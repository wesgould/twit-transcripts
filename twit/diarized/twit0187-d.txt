Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thanks for having me, Leo.  I'm so thrilled to make it out here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm really glad you could be here.  Do you like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You got some tea?  Got the tea going.  Got the laptop, Wi-Fi.  I'm pretty much set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We could put a table there if you want.  You got the table.  David Prager doesn't.  David, do you go anywhere without Prager?  Is he your bodyguard?  You know, I saw a tweet.  Tell me if this is true that you had a bodyguard in Austin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There was security in Austin, but it wasn't like a bodyguard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it was crazy at that Dignation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, there was like, how many people came?  Like 2,500 or something like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the venue capacity was 2,000 and then I think they crammed a couple more hundred in.  It was, I mean, every time we've done anything like that, it's outrageously flattering.  I mean, it's all because of Kevin there.  Oh yeah, he's the star.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's just, well, I mean, people get crushed if you don't have security saying like, hey,  get back over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you have to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But if you do a search on Flickr for like South by Southwest Dignation, you'll see you  find piles of photos.  I think Dick has a photo.  Cool.  Yeah, we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's not all, ladies and gentlemen.  No, the star power continues.  Mr. Jason Calacanis is also here.  Hello.  Hello.  Thanks for having me.  Best known for poker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes.  Lost 1200 last night.  Did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you make it?  Yeah, in my own game.  Did you serve in your own game?  That's not right.  It was terrible.  You know, the worst thing is when you tap out at your own game and you have to like serve  sandwiches.  That's really off.  Yeah.  It was it was not fun.  Did you you were in the celebrity poker for the World Poker Tour.  How'd that go? Did you?  How long did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I did really good.  I came in 90th out of 420 people or something, 410 people.  Does that mean you won?  You won money?  No, I didn't get in the money.  But this was every one of the top poker players in the world, like Ferguson and Phil Helmuth  and all these guys.  It must be fun to sit at the table with the guys like that.  Yeah, I was at one table.  It was like six pros, including the guy who has won more tournaments in cash in the last  30 years than anybody.  And also Shannon Elizabeth.  And then the guy from Mad Men.  It was just crazy.  Mackay, Pfeiffer, all these guys were there.  It was very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He knows when to hold him.  He knows when to fold him.  Gina Tapani is also here.  Formerly.  Well, I don't want to say formerly of Lifehacker.  You started Lifehacker.  Yeah. Now it's SmarterWhere.org.  But you're still Lifehacker Associated, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I am. I still write there once a week and bother all the editors there, tell them  what I want to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I continually go back to Lifehacker, because I'll do a Google search on how to use that  geek code.  And then there'll always be a Gina Tapani article about anything I want to do.  You've been there first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Excellent.  It's very frustrating.  I'll pay you later saying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, it's good that you're there because then I don't have to redo it all.  Also, a newbie with us, his first time on This Week in Tech from ABC, Dan Patterson is  here. Also, Dan Patterson.me.  Hi, Dan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, how are you, Leah?  Thanks for having me.  I appreciate it.  You were also at South by...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who was it?  Was everybody at South by Southwest except me?  Gina, did you go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, I did.  Have you not gone at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've never been.  Can you believe that?  You've got to go.  It would be so much more fun.  Yeah, you've got to go.  So, but the impression I got this time, and of course, this is at a distance, was it was  just one big drunken orgy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's about after, yeah.  Yeah.  After about six or seven nights.  That's true, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, you can filter through that.  Well, I filtered through it by filtering through Kevin's party and back.  But, you know, it's a big drunken party.  But if you have meaningful conversation with people, you really can connect.  And I can't tell you what this did for, you know, everyone talks about the networking,  but really the personal relationships that develop there and kind of evolve there are  tremendous. So, yeah, you can party, but you can also go.  I hate to say go to work.  But if you go and have the mindset that I'm going to communicate with people and all the  tools that we use just kind of facilitate that, you can have a wonderful time without  and do the parties, but without, you know, really getting stuck in the drunken muck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was there were there any great seminars?  I mean, you know, sessions that people really enjoyed?  Because, you know, you don't you don't really hear about those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I'd like to think mine was I was privileged enough to speak with Lawrence  Lessig and Amber Ettinger, Obama girl, Alex Wellen, who is the guy who does all the cool  we know Alex pretty well.  And yeah, yeah.  He's at CNN now, huh?  That's yeah. Yeah.  Mark McKinnon, who is a campaign strategist.  So that was, you know, it was humbling just to be on a stage with Lessig.  You know, it's like smart person, smart person, smart person.  Lawrence Lessig.  Kevin, what did you what did you what did you what did you enjoy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I didn't get a lot of time to go to the talks this year.  I was just in and out. I was there for three days and then bounced out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But were you doing meetings?  What were you doing that was keeping you busy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We've got a big launch coming up in like a week and a half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who's we dig revision three?  Yeah. Oh, yeah.  You want to tell us anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We talked about a little bit.  We're we're we're doing a software based or not software based, but a web based kind of  short URL service with a toolbar.  Oh, yeah. It allows you to dig on sites and trade around diggling on networks such as  Twitter and Facebook and you name it with these kind of shorter dig URLs.  And that's got a bunch of different stuff.  It shows that's going to be huge.  It shows you related content from that source.  That's going to be huge.  Wonder just a whole slew of different features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So wow, it's going to be fun.  So I use bit.ly right now because I get stats.  You get stats with this as well.  So I'll get that plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it doesn't even have to be a submitted dig story.  So you can just go.  I think the most brilliant piece of it is how you actually create these.  So all you have to do is click in your address bar.  And this doesn't work today, but it will when we launch.  You type in digg.com forward slash and then leave all the rest of the URL in there that  you're on and you hit enter.  And that passes that full URL to dig.  And then we reforward you to the tiny, the shorter dig URL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is so smart because you're going to get a lot of data about what people are interested  in over and above what you already get from digg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, we see how many people are passing around.  How many people are viewing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you monetize that kind of information?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was just going to ask that.  What do you do with it?  I mean, when you there's when you click on the related content within that bar, we have  as it folds down, the content kind of expands out.  It's hard for me to explain without you actually seeing it.  But there's ads on there as well.  But more than anything, it's to get more people digging and involved and feeding more  data into our system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just really clear. I mean, I think about it with Twitter.  It's just very clear that all of this activity that's going on is generating a cloud of  information about what people are interested in.  I mean, this is what digg essentially did.  How do you how do you capture what they're interested in?  But you know more and more and more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. So for us, it's just adding in more of those connections into digg and refactoring  that into our own promotion stuff.  So we want to look at what's being retweeted like that.  That might be a huge promotion later on.  We're going to look at a bunch of different sources, see how people are sharing and  spreading this information around the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Seems huge. It seems like Scobel posited that, you know, what Twitter makes money when  he says, OK, we made they made an announcement that Scobel's pregnant, Scobel's wife, I  think, actually, although it would be quite an announcement if he were pregnant.  It looked like Kevin was about six months pregnant.  Robert, you mean? Yeah.  Not Kevin. He looks he's getting skinny here.  I don't know what we're going to do with you.  But he said now if Twitter were really on the ball, I should have been receiving tweets  about not that I'd want to, but I should be receiving tweets about stuff that, you know,  where to buy my bassinet and baby shoes and stuff like that.  Because that information is of use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, there was a really I thought a great use of Twitter, even though it could get very  spammy quickly. That's the problem.  You got to be careful. Judicious.  Somebody tweeted out that they had a cold and weren't feeling well.  Right. So Zycam, like that nasal spray, monitors the search term cold and sent a tweet  back to this person like, hey, sorry, you're not feeling well.  Here's a coupon. That's like 10 percent off.  That's so smart. Wasn't that crazy?  I think that's so smart.  That was like all automated.  But, I mean, obviously, they're the first to do it.  So it's kind of cool now.  But I don't want 30 different companies sending me like, you need these vitamins.  How does Twitter stop that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, I did. How does Twitter stop that, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Well, they just have to be careful in looking at who's spamming, make sure people  aren't sending out, you know, hundreds of thousands of these kinds of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to talk about Facebook, too, in just a little bit.  But I do want to continue to talk about South by Southwest.  And Gina, tell me about your South by Southwest.  What went on for you there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it was my it was my fifth one.  I've been to the last five, including this year.  And it was definitely the best one I've ever been to just because I hit on some good  panels and just had some good meetings and conversations with people.  It's true that the sessions are kind of hit or miss.  Although I did get a couple of good ones this time.  But it's really about like conversations.  And I'm not much of a party girl.  So that all happens in the hallways, mostly for me or at lunch or whatever.  So it was a good time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My friend, Craig Severson, that does a conference called Lobby Con, where it's  still you take you just have the lobby conversations.  Forget the presentations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm at the lobby.  You hear about bacon con?  No. Yeah, it's supposed to be it's all about bacon.  That's awesome.  I wouldn't want to go to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. I'm over bacon.  I can't eat bacon anymore.  Jason, what was your what was I know?  I know. Shocking.  There is a there is a website called I think it's baconizer that'll add bacon to any  website. You know, yeah, yeah, baconator, the baconator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, that is that was one of my favorites.  You just add the URL in front and creates a piece of bacon.  It's a slice of bacon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't really get it, but OK, Jason, how about how about you?  What was what's it like for a Wheeler dealer like you at in Austin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm sorry, Austin.  Where's that? You didn't go.  No, I didn't go. I have too much work to do.  I've been I really enjoyed it, actually.  It's a it's a great conference because it seems like a very friendly conference.  Well, it's good about it is is, you know, most of the conferences that Kevin and I  go to and is, you know, they're like CEOs and marketers and VCs.  It's not actually people who do work.  It's people who take credit for other people's work.  And so when I go to South by Southwest, it's like you get to sit in the audience  and actually hear people who actually do real work talk about how they do their work.  And it's a much more interesting conference, although those people tend to not be  the best speakers, but they tend to have the most insights.  So you have to deal with a little less polish.  I love more substance. I prefer that.  Don't you?  Unless it's a bar camp, you know, when it's a bar camp, then it's like,  yeah, exactly.  Ten bad presentations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A vibe because it is people who may not be be professionals.  You also get the the energy of people who don't have, you know, professional life  dragging down their energy.  But it's a it's a wonderful chance to meet people in all levels of  of three different industries, really. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, maybe someday I'll go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm telling you, next year, what we should do is we should like rent out.  We did stubs this year for the dignity stuff.  But let's rent out something over the entire day.  Pick a day like on the weekend.  Just take over somewhere.  Take over some venue.  Do back to back different.  I'd love to do that.  You bring to it like we'll do all the different ones that we do.  We'll stream the whole thing. That'd be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jason and I were talking about getting a rock and roll bus.  Yeah, that would have been fun.  Yeah, driving there.  Leaving next week. Party bus.  We just didn't have enough time, Jason.  But if we start planning now, yeah, we're a party bus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Tyler will take care of for next year.  Like you can rent one of these.  They're not expensive.  Yeah, the tour bus is like whatever.  A couple of grand. 12.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And we're going to shoot it like real world style.  Yeah, it will be absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And one person has to get off the bus in each city.  Well, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Phoenix. We'll do.  Alex Albrecht, you're off the bus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Survivor. I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pretty good bandwidth on the satellite internet.  So you can do stuff while driving.  We'll all have the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think we can see you just bouncing on a ball, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that? Yeah, I'm sorry.  You didn't notice that I like to bounce.  I get excited. I bounce. I'm sorry.  It's not. It's a little creepy.  That's a happy bounce. It's a little creepy.  I understand. I look like Tigger behind the desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're going to go on a bus to Austin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I think if we rent this bus, we stop like and do tweet ups  and broadcast all the way like San Francisco, Los Angeles,  Las Vegas, Phoenix, you know, on the way.  And then we get to Austin.  And then I think you're right. We get a venue for the whole day.  Yeah. OK, we're going to do this.  I'm serious. I'm down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You might as well get a venue and do it.  I mean, if you get a venue, you can have a you can have a place  for a couple of days. I mean, it was like you get down there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like just. David thinks big.  It's what I like about Prager. He thinks big.  You need a still for Prager that you can pull up, which is like him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then I know someone was saying they could see my screen over like maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. When I go.  Yeah. Well, you know, stop loading the porn, Prager.  We can see what you're looking at, David.  So they're talking about the live video stream.  And I've got cameras for everybody except David.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you can see my screen.  Yeah, we know what you're browsing.  Pop something up bad.  What were you looking at?  A seven second delay, right? You can bleep it out. No, no, I do not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's talk about the new Facebook because, boy, they're getting a lot of heat.  I just saw a BBC article that said something like 83 percent of  people responding said they hate it.  There's a petition with millions of names on it.  There are millions now. Millions of names.  I hate Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there is there a way to determine if this is any more backlash than the last  iteration? I mean, it seems like it's a bigger change than the last iteration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't you think? I mean, it really changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, yeah. What's the complaint?  What's the main complaint? Confusion. Confusion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, that's that's a core of the issue.  People they wouldn't say they're confused, but people are really confused.  Like, imagine you see the Twitter box for the first time  and you used to see in the newsfeed. Right.  It's like, what is this? What do I do now?  I like the old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This might be this might be a lot of I don't want to say bubble thinking.  And I'm glad to see Facebook trying to change or at least train their audience  to use something that is more like Twitter.  But but one of the problems I encounter, whether it's it's at work at ABC  or even with my friends, when I evangelize this stuff, it's very, very difficult  to explain what this is for the for the neophyte and to log into Facebook  for the first time and see something that looks like Twitter for our audience,  for your audience. It's it's very familiar.  And you kind of feel comfortable with it.  But for my mother or my mother's friend, it it's it's what?  Why is it so fast? This isn't this is too much data. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See, that's the thing I was worried about, because with Twitter,  it feels to me as though it's just enough to consume because it's little updates.  It's simple. It's simple.  And then when you think about everything that that Facebook is bringing together  with pictures and events and everything else going on, I have to say,  it just seems like a little bit of an overload.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, the first thing you see, you go there, you say, welcome.  What's on your mind? It's very I mean, it looks just like Twitter's stream.  They don't immediately see on the left that you can look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It looks like more than Twitter. It looks like pounce.  I mean, it's yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And you know what happened to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, I'm happy with the outcome.  Man, well, really? Yeah.  Yeah. Everybody got hired.  Everybody got hired. We got stock in six apart.  We got cash like it was a good deal for everybody.  So that's a good way for you to have a plane safely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm seeing the six apart guys on Tuesday.  And one of the things that they really will be running movable type on the new  radio website and one of the things that they're really stoked about,  like the thing that amps them up is I don't remember what they call it flow  or something like that, but it's the integration of pounce.  I was playing around on my on my own servers and it was it was wonderful  to be able to integrate that with with all of my other content internally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I've seen some of the stuff they've been working on.  It's pretty, pretty cool stuff.  Anyway, back to Facebook.  Yeah, I will say the fan pages are much better.  Have you messed around the fan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. So the idea is that now I have and I'm sure you had this issue, too.  We put everybody on our regular page. Right.  So you hit five thousand pretty quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did they move you over to a new fan page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a I've always had a fan page.  Is there like a button I can push five thousand on your normal page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, a long time ago. OK, so we'll get them to move all those people  over to your fan page. You call Mark.  Do you want? Well, do you have?  I had it done to.  There is an issue that.  No, wait a minute. All right.  Facebook dot com slash Lila Port.  I don't know.  We'll get you that, too.  Wow. So the idea is now we with Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we just saying you and Mark are like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They call me like Dave Moran.  The main guy kind of spearheading this.  Yeah. Randy Zuckerberg.  Yeah, I'd love to have Dave on. Yeah. Yeah.  And he was like, hey, we're starting this new thing.  You might want to check it out.  And he told me like basically, you know, they're going to this  this openness to where they want people to have their own identity.  So it's going to be like Facebook dot com slash Kevin Rose.  That works right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, would that be your private page or your fan page?  OK. But your fan page, you maintain in the same way  that you do your private page.  You post stuff there and. Right.  It's just public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The cool thing, though, is that it used to be they'd have to go back  to the fan page to check it out, you know, to see if you did anything.  Yeah. Now it's on your like Twitter.  So if you go and post something, it goes out to all the people that have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and the other thing I thought was really interesting  is that they've gone to basically an open model.  The data is now accessible anywhere. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. So they have the APIs coming out for that.  So basically, you know, we use services like Twirl and Tweetdeck  and all these others. Right.  You're going to see a whole slew of applications interface with.  Well, I'm using Seismic for Facebook.  Yeah. You've seen Seismic. Yeah.  That's pretty cool. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's just like Twirl.  All the real time. The people. Yeah.  So the question is, but even more than that, I can now say every  I can make everyone instead of having it be private,  I can now make it for everyone.  That's a new setting.  And so presumably other sites could scrape that information as well.  Right. In other words, your profile is no longer kind of your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Personal. Right. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's more of a public. But you do control it. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You control what goes in there, but it's more of a public thing.  So is this a good move?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, given all the backlash, the confusion that Dan post  posited, is this a good move for them?  Scoble wrote an interesting thing.  He said, Mark should not listen to all the complaints.  They don't know what they're talking about.  This is a tough thing, though. You're in the same boat.  I'm sure you get the same thing.  I'm sure, Jason, you get the same thing when you change something on Mahalo  or when you change things on Engadget is the people don't like change of any kind.  For one thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's difficult for me is I always looked at the services  as serving two different things, two different types of audiences. Right.  Twitter for me was always more real time.  Facebook was where I went to connect with just a tight group of people.  Just my friends.  It's your high school buddies.  You're college buddies. My knees.  All this stuff. Right.  And it's like now the two together.  I don't know how I feel about it yet.  I think it's too early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Facebook has to be able to do what I mean.  Twitter's got all the buzz and I think rightly deserved.  I mean, we can't stop talking about all the time.  It's because of what it allows us to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I get so much heat.  This is why Dvorak is not on this episode because  just constantly berates me for talking about it.  Facebook has a story. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook's platform allows you to have that kind of interaction.  And I mean, whether it's true or not, I mean, they kind of want to be able  to get have a piece of that pie and and provide that functionality.  And so I think I think here's a good part of the reason you see the home page  the way it is, is because they want to be able to to grab what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Twitter has. Here's what Scoble says.  What if you had a I'm sorry to keep bringing Robert up this last time.  But what if I Bob actually is not Bob?  Yeah, Bobby Scoble. Sometimes Bobby.  Bobby, you're joking. He goes, why Bob?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't know. I'm serious.  He signed some of his emails of Bob Scoble.  Like somebody told me that the other day.  I'm like, really? I think there's an imposter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's trying to read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sort of like Robert Redford. Yeah.  If you know Robert, we call him Bob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, this guy's name over here is Bob.  You can call him Bob Rose. Dr. Robert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what we call him. Good times.  From the good old days. From back when.  So he said, what if you have and I use the Facebook.  And one nice thing is if you use the Facebook application,  the iPhone is still the same old Facebook.  But what if you used it kind of more like Twitter and said, here I am.  And it suddenly got information.  Robert said, OK, what if you said, I'm looking for a good restaurant?  Oh, 12 of your friends like the Bangkok kitchen next door.  Now it's interesting because these are recommendations from your friends.  That's your real friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're all all these services are kind of like starting to overlap each other.  You play with Foursquare at all yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was huge at South by South.  That's the new app that allows you to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's location based.  So if you have an I think the iPhone is the big platform for right now.  They create an iPhone app and so you open it up  and you can add you who you are actually personally friends with or anyone, I guess.  And so it's kind of like what dodgeball used to be.  It is the same guys.  In fact, there's some some concern that maybe it's the same.  It's a little bit more well done, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's cool because it adds like a social gaming component to it as well.  Have you seen how this works? They give you badges.  No, I couldn't because I was not anywhere important.  So let's say you're out and you're like having dinner with your friends.  You're like, oh, I really like this place.  It's a good burger joint or whatever, right?  You check in. So you say and then it uses GPS.  It talks to Yelp and it says, is this the location you're talking about?  So you just check into a burger place.  If you check in there like four or five times, you become the mayor  of that place by checking in.  I love it. And then you compete with other people.  And so they have so it's a game. It's a game.  They have these other things like if you go out three nights in a row  and you check in three different bars, it gives you the Bender badge.  If you check in with like three people of the opposite sex,  you get the player, please badge.  Oh, my goodness.  It's really it's really kind of fun.  But right now, only Austin, Boston, Chicago, Denver, L.A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to be in a metro to do this. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think this would fall under augmented reality.  It's like mixing Call of Duty four with real life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you need the weapons then is what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How many headshots do I need to get to get the headshot badge with the AK-47?  Call of Duty reference for those people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gina, did you use did you use play four square when you were in Austin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you play? I didn't. I did.  And I'm sad that I didn't.  It sounds like I'm a slow adopter of this social media crap.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think what's interesting here is you're taking.  Oh, I hate using this term, the social graph, people's social graph  and integrating it with location. Right.  Another buzzword.  And to make it something that's really powerful. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Absolutely. I mean, last night I was I was out with friends.  I went and got some food.  And then I pulled up my four square and I was like, OK, what is everybody doing?  I could see. OK, Joe checked in at this bar.  I had another friend that checked in this place.  And so you can instantly decide like, where do I want to spend my time tonight?  Right. Right. By seeing where your friends are checking in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, dodgeball kind of did this and was a flop.  So what's going to make this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, dodgeball was a little too like you had to go in and manually kind of  text in the place where you're at.  This is like two pushes of a button like it brings up the.  Because it has location. It has location.  It ties in with the. That's the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the new dodgeball.  But you can click and say I'm here, too.  And to say it almost encourages you to keep your network quiet and keep it small.  Like Kevin said, if you treat it like Twitter and you're following a bajillion  people, then, you know, there's there's very little difference other than the location.  But but it was fantastic in Austin to kind of know a dozen or so people  floating around the city and kind of know that this is our little, you know,  there's an elitism to it.  But it's kind of like, hey, we're the early adopters and we're gathering.  And I can see where my people are and the people that they're talking to.  And I can kind of see interactions and relationships being built by knowing  that two or more people are in the same location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I also think there's a there's a lot of like, quote unquote, high  roller Twitter people that were at South by Interactive.  And so they want to tell people where they are without telling their 100,000  followers. So you have your friends who are there with you and you can make it.  So it only updates for other people in Austin.  And then they can see where you are.  You can see where they are without having to deal with telling 100,000 people plus  where you are and what's going on, especially if they don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, that's useful for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just need some.  I'd like to ask you guys not to not to backtrack on Facebook too much, but I'd  really like to ask you guys your thoughts on Facebook Connect beyond the just the  credentialing log in structure that it has.  I'm I'm curious to see the data because you can push all of your comments and all  of this activity around the social web.  And Leo, I agree on the jargon.  We need to move away from the jargon.  But you know, you right.  Exactly. Exactly.  But but being able to pull all of that information into Facebook does does a  couple of things. It changes the game a little bit, I think.  All of a sudden, it brings the entire web into Facebook.  And of course, they can monetize that data on the back end.  But but it also introduces these networks of networks to people who may not be  familiar with the social web and how it works.  But but they're so prone to putting out, you know, vaporware or or I love  Facebook Connect. But hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's wonderful.  Hold that thought, because I do want to find out what people think about it.  And I still want to talk a little bit more about Facebook.  There are a lot of other stories to Cisco bought Flip Video Sun maybe sold to IBM,  the iPhone 3.0. Kevin, you nailed it.  You nailed it, dude. He's got the best sources in the world.  We're going to talk more about that.  Good. Good.  And when you you got a rumor, you got a rumor, dude.  There it is. As is Flip HD.  There's mine, too. Here.  Oh, you show off.  You got to have one. I got more cameras than you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you think about Cisco's purchase?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hold on. Hold on. Hold.  Hold your horses.  Pay the bills.  I got to pay the bills, baby.  Got to pay some bills. And then Jason, I also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Who's the advertiser?  Please don't tell me it's audible.  It isn't. Stop. Stop.  Play. Who could it be?  Go to meeting.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no. You won't guess this one.  It's a new advertiser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  New. Oh, oh.  You know how I love new advertisers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that is that a pint?  Are you drinking a pint?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think he's getting a little Coke Zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look, Coke Zero in his.  Did you buy that soda making machine that you were?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I got that as at a in a gift bag, but that thing is crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think I want anything that makes soda in my life.  That's not a good thing to have in your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Really cool for the planet, though.  Like you just like.  That's true. No more bottles.  You never have to go buy bottles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a service up here in the Bay Area called the Seltzer Sisters.  You should do this if you got you guys live in the city.  The Seltzer Sisters.  The Seltzer Sisters, they come around with they have.  They bought old and refurbished like old 20s Seltzer bottles,  you know, like the three stooges that stick in the pants Seltzer bottles.  That's not they feel.  Not really. It's actually not very not very pleasant at all.  They fill them with Seltzer and and they bring syrup around and everything.  And you get weekly deliveries of these classic old 20s.  They're beautiful glass Seltzer bottles.  This is in San Francisco.  Yeah, the Seltzer Sisters. You should do it anyway.  Anyway, we're going to come back.  We're going to talk more about the social graph.  And I'm going to ask Kevin Rose what the hell that means.  But I want to welcome a new sponsor to the show.  We're talking carbonite, carbonite dot com.  C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E dot com.  I'm not a stranger to carbonite.  I've known about carbonite for some time.  They've been advertising on the radio show.  I've used carbonite for over a year.  In fact, I started using carbonite when I lost some podcasts.  I accidentally deleted some podcasts.  I had no backup.  I said, I got to find something.  Carbonite is so cool.  You go to C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E dot com.  Less than five bucks a month.  And this is why I liked it for unlimited backup.  Now, see, these podcasts are big, but I didn't have to measure  how big they were going to be.  You just right click on the folders you want to save your financial documents,  your email, your music, your photos, those irreplaceable documents, your podcasts.  You right click on it and what's the offer code?  What's the offer code? Leo, L-E-O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait, wait, don't put it on the video.  We got the number. Don't put it on the video.  Cover up the numbers when you do that.  Oh, you're smart, Jason.  That wasn't a black card either.  That was a red card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  For sure. You know, I can get the black card.  That was a rip off.  It's like 40 grand, right?  I you have to spend like a decent amount of money and I qualified for it.  And then they sent me the package and stuff and forty five hundred dollars a year.  Oh, I was like, how is it different than the platinum card?  They're like, it's black.  And I was like, it's all about status.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's all about whipping the thing out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I already have a friend of mine.  Orange car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Frank, you're right. Orange is plenty.  They the money is still the same.  Friend of mine has a black card and all the pleasure is in putting it on the table.  Right. That's the whole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, actually, the cool thing about it is it is made out of metal.  It's made out of metal.  So when you set it down, it's sharp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like me.  Thunk when it goes down the table and you basically say like, I have the biggest card.  I am. Yeah.  What it is. I win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like turning over the nuts to get.  I mean, the real benefit I always heard was like this concierge type service.  You get that on platinum too.  You can think of platinum.  But you can say, hey, go get this and someone will just deal with the trouble of getting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. I did the research online and there's a channel,  like a message board of people who worked at American Express.  And they said it's the same exact group of people.  Who do platinum and gold and that.  And they're told to just be a little nicer to the people with the black cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the guy said.  He said, no, Mr.  Hello, Mr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Gillicottis. It's like it's like first or business or coach.  They basically just it's how nice they treat you when you're in coach.  They hate you. It's how long when you're in business.  They're like they like you.  And then when you're first, they love you. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just totally out of anyway, you don't need it.  Put it away. Carbonite dot com.  This is good. Offer code.  Tweet T.W.I.T.  And if you sign up afterwards, you get two months free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Carbonite offer code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twit. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.  So Facebook Connect, I do love Facebook Connect.  This is you know what I think is Dan's going on is really it's all of these guys.  It's just like you using a short code on dig, you know, doing a show.  It's these are just methods of finding out what people are doing. Right.  Absolutely. And that's inherently valuable.  I mean, it doesn't mean Facebook's going to put an ad on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, Leo, one of the things I constantly tell when I  I have meetings with you with various departments within ABC News  throughout the work week and kind of explain how to do this.  I put it in as late as small of layperson's terms as possible.  But I meet with different departments who I see their different needs.  And one of the things I always tell people is, look, if Google is the path  of least resistance between you and information,  then Twitter is the path of least resistance between you and people.  And I think we the more Facebook iterates and moves towards the Twitter model  with that one hundred and fifty million active users,  it could become exceptionally relevant for broadcast.  You know, previously it moved slower. It was a little quieter.  But if they can train their users to kind of accept this new model with Twitter  is OK with six million users, but one hundred and fifty million on Facebook  is is nothing to it's one seventy five now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're growing at the size of three Twitter's  Twitter every three weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but Twitter is growing pretty fast themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Thirteen hundred percent growth in the last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At least Facebook posits the right question.  They say what's on your mind?  I'm surprised Twitter didn't change it to like, what do you feel like saying it?  It just says what are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's on your mind is much better than what are you doing, isn't it?  Nobody pays any attention to that, do they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We say an observation about this thing with Facebook.  One is about Zuckerberg.  Yeah, you're friends with him, Kevin.  I've had dinner with him once at Ted and I met him a couple of times.  And he's a really bright kid.  But it's pretty obvious that like he thinks he knows like what the best thing to do is  and really doesn't care what anybody else thinks.  I think he's pretty like determined.  I think that's fine. It's a great character.  But and he I keep hearing he wants to model himself after Bill Gates  and keep using that Bill Gates metaphor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that might be so smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, actually, you know what?  It's actually he's definitely doing it because he basically  took somebody else's idea, Twitter's, and is ramming it down the throats of users.  I mean, that sounds pretty Bill Gates to me, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not going to mention propeller at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, no, I mean, well, listen.  Oh, you had to go there.  Well, I mean, come on.  We all know in this industry, everybody copies everybody, everybody evolves.  Everybody else. There's nothing original.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm doing Chris Perillo right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And Kevin Rose is, you know, it's doing.  But, you know, I have to say, there are original thoughts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twitter is original.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's getting a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  Twitter is original.  Dig was original.  I mean, there are original ideas out there.  But I think you don't have to be original.  This is pretty late.  Knock off. This is pretty blatant.  But is it a mistake after?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, it's not a mistake, but it's going to cause a lot of pain  in the short term because people who use Facebook are not bloggers.  They're using it as a Rolodex, primarily an email system.  Yeah. I mean, they're there to find out what their college,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  their high school girlfriends up to, what their brothers up to.  But but can they turn around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They should have done it in phases.  It's a matter of getting the right amount of data in front of the people  where it doesn't make them feel overwhelmed.  Because right now, I think they have it turn like full throttle a little bit.  I don't know if you've logged in recently.  And if you have some active friends, all of a sudden you're like,  I feel like I miss something.  Right. There's just too much going on.  Twitter's like that.  I mean, you have a Twitter's for me is different because it is about the same  hundred forty characters every time.  There's no photos. There's no video.  I miss a photo of my niece or did I miss an event or did I miss,  you know what I mean, like someone breaking in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We all suffer from overwhelm, information overload.  We don't want to add to that.  You want a tool like Facebook to make you feel like you're managing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that the good thing about Mark and what Facebook has done  thus far is they they do listen to the community and they go back  and make iterations. He did that with the terms of service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought that was really responsive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And how many times have they changed the newsfeed in the last couple of years?  I mean, they're constantly tweaking this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you can do too much listening to the community, too.  I mean, there's a point. You can use your way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you finally got to throw.  Gina, do you use Facebook? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do. I don't I don't use it a whole lot.  I mean, you know, in the past, I really kind of accused Facebook  of being this like company that has Asperger's because I haven't felt  like they've been very good at responding to their users.  I mean, the privacy thing they did.  But, you know, I have to say, in this case, I kind of agree with Scoble.  I mean, we've all run big websites and we know how people react  when there are any kinds of changes and change drives them crazy.  Any change at all. And I have to say, I mean, if this many users  are freaking out, you know, three weeks from now, a month from now, then OK,  you know, there might be something to it.  But honestly, I just feel like, you know, these things need time  and people feel upset when things they know change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I agree with her 100 percent.  You kind of have to sit, sit back, you know, step away for a few weeks  and watch and say, is this a big deal with the community  a couple of weeks from now?  Because oftentimes, you know, it's kind of the vocal minority initially.  And like, you know, it's important to listen to those people.  Is it a million?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me see. I'm going to look at the BBC and see what they say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's over a million. It's over a million.  Well, still, though, you know, my broadcast mentor always used to say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you cannot program a radio station by committee.  You have to have one music director.  And I think it's the same thing with Facebook.  They should listen. They should pay attention.  They should care.  But they shouldn't make business decisions based on some some  a very small but very vocal community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. Let me put you all on the spot.  Is Facebook going to lose users because of this?  No way. No, no. David.  I don't think so. Dan says no.  Gina. No.  Jason is is is no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But he may lose some employees because employees.  Yeah, I'll tell you why.  You know, if you're going to be sort of draconian about like saying, hey,  here's what we're going to do and your entire team says like,  we should have done it a different way.  You know, you could wind up losing good people  and more of the adults around him might get a little tired of this  because it seems to be a pattern.  I mean, I think he sort of shoots first and then he sort of pulls back.  It is his first start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This come from Mark or did this come from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. And supposedly there's it came from Mark and supposedly there's an email  that says, you know, he said like, oh, well, we have to.  I just want to attack me.  But who knows if it's true.  But he's just sort of like we have to be disruptive and, you know,  our users will get used to it, which is a very Steve Jobs approach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, yes, Steve doesn't give a damn what users think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Where's the right mouse?  But on, you know, the mouse, I still know the first thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I bought a five thousand dollar Mac Pro.  The first thing I do is throw out the mouse.  It's like, can you put a good mouse in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've never been good.  They need to replace that one mouse engineer, right?  We had the hockey puck. Remember that thing?  I got I got one right here.  You know, that guy is just like the mighty mouse.  Yeah. And then you get the mighty mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the IMAQ.  This was the this mouse.  It's round. No hand, except maybe a three year olds can fit this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is the worst.  This is because Steve Jobs makes a decision about certain things.  And when he makes the decision, he's making the decision based on somebody  who doesn't do a lot of work on their computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, so he's smart.  Nicely. I think it's a good look.  I get that.  And it's like a bolo. It is.  It's kind of like a I'm going to wear this to South by Southwest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When the iPhone came out, you couldn't send multiple people  SMS messages because apparently Steve Jobs said, well, why would you want to do that?  So why would you? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You still can't do that, by the way.  Well, the same thing with the keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, like, yeah, you've been able to do it for it was a firmware.  No, but there's an SMS to multiple people.  And then you can on the iPhone.  Oh, and then the next day, more attention, which should have come out.  Eon to go, you know, the cut and paste capabilities, the email search capabilities,  half of the common sense things that I still don't know why the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Mr. Rose deserves a victory lap at this point.  You hit it.  Did you said everything? They're right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Everything was there was some good rumors there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you got every one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You have to have you gotten the television rumor, Kevin, because I got this twice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm going to I got to call you on this one because, Jason,  you said this six months ago that there was a year and a half ago.  There was going to be like a 24 inch TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I've heard they're talking about an LCD TV. Yeah.  Yeah, I've never heard that has a computer built into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You never heard it.  Well, the thing is, it's not like you can you can have one source for all Apple  rumors. Do you know what I mean?  Like they're very segmented and they're very kind of tight.  And you have to talk to a certain person about the iPhone versus a certain.  But you're not reaching out to people, are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're you just have the world's biggest transom.  I mean, people throw stuff at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I think what happens is I get some anonymous emails from people that I know  their signatures by now and they kind of are like, hey, you know whether to trust  them or not. Right. Exactly.  And then also people come up at conferences all the time.  Yeah. Like, hey, I work at Apple. Check this out.  And it's real quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you're like, oh, yeah, I have to say, since Steve's been gone,  it's it seems like there's much less it's much less tight than it used to be.  I have a tight ship. You couldn't find anything for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it was really, really tight.  Here's got to remember. Yeah, impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Anything you heard, you knew it was wrong because nobody's going to take the  chance of getting fired.  The Nevalyn dictator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just just out of curiosity and and clearly I'm not going to ask to reveal your sources.  But how how worried are the people there?  I deal with the D.C.  wonks and I deal with the UN wonks a lot.  But how paranoid are people within Apple about their confident confidentiality?  I mean, clearly there's a background and off record type of situation.  But but are they worried about any type of backlash?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I mean, people if people walk up to you to conference and they just say, hey, check this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Used to be you'd call them intentionally and you'd be on the phone with them at Apple  and they'd say, don't ask me about that.  I can't talk about that. They knew it was bugged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, they the emails that I get are from crazy.  I've never heard of domains that are offshore or whatever they may be.  And you just look at the signature and oh, OK, you know, X five seven has sent me  three good rumors in the past.  You know, yeah.  So what about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What about this China Times or the rumor that Apple's buying touch screens?  It looks like I have to say, when you look at three point,  it looks like Apple's getting ready for a tablet PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't I don't think so.  You don't think so.  No, I think their focus is on the iPhone right now and how they can evolve that.  I think there's a hardware update coming later this year for the iPhone to match three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're going to give away three to current users. Right.  But to match three.  But I think that's been a year now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. It'll be a year on in August for iPhone two.  Right. And it was a year between.  Well, and here's the key.  And I'm on one and two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Scott Borne makes this very good point that this is two years  since the original people bought their contract is now running out.  Time to get them in the fold if they if they're thinking of moving on to say  a Palm Pre is the pre the competition.  Gina, are you looking at a pre?  Is that like the next phone for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I'm checking it out.  I just switched to Android myself, so I think I'm happy for now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're an you're an Android user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am. I'm an Android user.  You know, the iPhone thing like iPhone three point, oh, sounds awesome.  But the two point upgrade just completely screwed up my phone.  Like it just the phone was never the same after that.  So while in theory it sounds great, I'm interested to see what it's really like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I keep trying to use the G one.  I want to like the G one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, the G one, the handset kind of Android is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the hardware.  The hardware is powerful enough for Android.  So there's lag.  The battery life is three hours, four hours.  The screen and the software looks clean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I saw a Twitter app on there the other day.  I was like, wow, this is really like it's nicely designed.  Yeah. But the battery life I think we're going to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this is I know nothing, but I think we're to see netbooks on an Android platform.  I think it's just a natural, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do we think Steve Jobs is going to come back to Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I depends on what his health problem really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It depends on if if he if he kind of maintains his current health,  I think he'll stay retired and kind of just keep a chairman of the board kind of role thing going on.  Is he chairman of the board? Yeah, I think so.  But if he obviously puts weight back on and gains his help back again, I think he'll come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think that's going to happen.  But who knows? We don't none of we should say none of us know.  Right. Nobody's claiming any inside information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was wondering what would be the major difference  in an Apple without Steve Jobs?  Because obviously it seems like it's changed already since he's been in a couple of months.  It does. And maybe it's coincidence since there's a long product cycle.  You can't say cut and paste is because he wasn't there.  That obviously was in the pipeline.  But it does feel like a different organization.  And maybe they will let you put any MP3 player into the,  you know, iTunes, maybe they'll let you put any application on  and maybe they'll unlock the iPhone, because that, to me, screams of a Steve Jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, AT&T is selling an unlocked iPhone.  If you've got 700 bucks to lay for the 16 gig version and 500 bucks for the  eight gig version, I don't know who would buy that.  I don't know if they did that because of the FCC or what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I just hope they put the right CEO in place.  I want Ives. Like he's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really? You think so? More than a designer.  You think he could run the place? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, I don't know why you keep saying Jonathan Ives, who's got no business experience, should be the CEO.  He's a designer. He's a great designer.  He's just got that sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, unless he has a really good, good CEO.  Have you listened to him talk? He's just a badass.  He's a badass like Jobs is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's a visionary. There's no question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's a product visionary without a doubt.  Well, if it wasn't for him, they wouldn't have half of the design of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely. He's responsible for everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And somebody like Tim Cook, who comes along, is clearly the business guy,  the guy who can run it, but doesn't have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Make him a strong COO, make Ives the CEO. That would be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gina, who should run Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I'm going to go with Kevin on that. Sure. Ives.  Why not? Kevin knows. I trust him.  Kevin Rose?  Kevin Rose should run Apple.  I'll go with that. I'll go with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you'd be a good... Would you like a hardware job?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That would be pretty badass.  If I could work with Ives, hell yes.  So Bill Campbell is the chairman of Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Campbell's chairman of the board? OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. So Steve is just a CEO and board member.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right, Kevin. So here it is. If they came to you and said...  One dollar, you get paid one dollar, but you get a jet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do I get those stock options?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You get the stock options and the jet.  Here it is. Here it is.  Dig keeps running your chairman, emeritus, whatever you're involved.  You could do Dig in a day a week.  And you become president of Apple, second only to the CEO  and work in the new products group.  And they give you, you know, whatever, some huge amount of stuff.  Would you go do it? Would you leave Dig full time to go be president of Apple?  Yes or no?  Why? Yes or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why are you doing this to me, Jason?  The problem is everything would leak like a suit of air.  Because I want to see if your office would have.  I want to see if your office would have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Dig would have the best Apple rumors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, totally.  You could still do Dignation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go ahead, answer it, man. It's Apple.  I don't know. That's a tough call.  I think that we've got a dig, our product roadmap.  We've got like another two years of really cool that I want to see out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you see yourself segueing in a couple of years to something else?  I don't know. I mean, that's not a good thing to ask,  because you don't want to tell the troops that I'm here for a couple more years.  You want to say I'm here for the rest of my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, the thing is that I believe and you'll see with the toolbar  and then some releases shortly thereafter that we've got some crazy new directions  for dig that we've never taken in the past.  You know, you look at the home page and you're like,  oh, it's the same dig I've known for the last few years. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You need to do that, don't you?  You constantly have to keep swimming.  You constantly have to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We've been around for four years.  Yeah, we've got to get bored.  Almost five. Right. When is it five?  Almost five. Wow. It's nuts.  Crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In one week will be the anniversary,  the fourth anniversary of me leaving Tech TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't that crazy? Is it four or five?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Five. It'll be five years since I left Tech TV.  Yeah. April 1st, 2004.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We were all in D.C. and it was kind of cool.  Yeah, when we were interviewing the chairman of the FCC, Michael Powell.  And it was kind of cool to just be gone when like the ass hit the fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I remember telling Michael Powell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The ass hit the fan. The ass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The ass is good. That would be.  The ass hit the fan. The ass off the fan.  How? Fan ass.  No, I remember telling Michael Powell, he's the chairman of the FCC.  And this guy loved Tech TV.  And I said, yeah, I think it's over for Tech TV.  And he was genuinely like, oh, that's terrible.  Yeah, a lot of people were bombed. Yeah, it's very sad.  I want to take another break when we come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  John DeVorek is on me all the time.  John would do it, but he's not crazy about it.  Well, that's because I challenge John.  You challenge him. He doesn't like to be challenged, Jason.

The shell kind of cracks a little bit and starts to sweat.  It's perfect.  She's like a microwave and they're delicious.  I'm all about the M&M's microwaved on high.  30 seconds.  We try to have any M&M's here, Leo.

Transcript:  Go to My PC dot com slash slash twit.  Twit.  Thank you.  Do I need a credit card or just to sign up with them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You need a credit card on this one.  Well, but it doesn't have to be a black card.  It could be could be any color, any color at all.  They're not.  You could do a trial for a trial.  This is for a one month free trial.  They're not going to charge a card, but they just need that because you know what  happens? What's that?  There are bad people out there who just keep signing up for the free trial over and over  and over again.  So they want to kind of limit it to the number of credit cards you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Kevin, do you do a press tour when you have a new product out?  Do you do like a little press tour and show it to some of the press before you launch it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Satellite media tour?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It depends on how big the product is, but normally it's just like a blogger tour.  Kind of call up Arrington and a few others and say, hey, we've got this coming out in a few weeks.  You want to take a look?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You go have coffee with them?  Yeah, totally.  You could do it with the guys in New York too, and they really appreciate it.  You know, and you get the LA Times and you just get go to my ABC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And boom.  Yeah, Mr. Dan Patterson at ABC News would like to know more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I could use GoToMyPC for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes.  If you were doing a press tour, you know, because I know Kevin.  Actually, he would probably use GoToMeeting for that.  GoToMeeting, that's what I said.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is there a free trial that I could use?  There is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  Same thing.  The no risk free trial too, right?  Two for the price of one of that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow.  You guys.  I love when they say no risk free trial.  Has there ever been a trial where it's like a risky trial?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I have a sponsor on the radio where I can't say free trial.  I'm not going to say the sponsor, but I can't say free trial, but I can say no risk trial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Huh.  I think the risk is where you sign up for a free trial and you have to actively remember  to cancel otherwise.  That's the risk.  That is the risk.  And that's the risk trial.  That's the clever.  Two week risk trial.  Yeah.  But there's weird things you can sign up for.  If you're really can't get a benefit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like your twit donation, which will continue forever unless you cancel it.  Just a reminder.  Yeah, we stopped.  We stopped.  We stopped doing yearly donations because every year I would get a message from somebody  saying, what's this charge?  And I have to say, you signed up for a yearly donation.  So I just said monthly people remember because they see it every month.  Two dollars.  I asked for two dollars a month.  I figure that's as cheap as you can get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And see, we stopped doing it.  We stopped.  We want you don't do that anymore.  We kind of are thinking about having quote unquote paid memberships again.  But trying to wrap my head around what to offer.  If we don't offer anything in exchange, we don't offer anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, you just have to do after Dignation.  So you have Alex and Kevin and you talking about the show.  But you know what happens when you do that?  And this happened to you guys, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You gave people early access and then they just distributed.  They kind of they break it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the content screen.  The only reason.  And then you have to start chasing them around like whack a mole.  To count it like the same way as you want to be able to be.  You don't want to get in that business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How many people are watching a donation to Twitter is because you like what you hear.  It's free if you want to support it.  There's another reason to do it more than I mean, the money is.  Well, the money. Yeah, it's like NPR.  The money does believe it or not.  I mean, we wouldn't be here because for the first two years we didn't have sponsors.  There's a lightsaber.  Who's got a lightsaber?  Which of them losers is a lightsaber?  Oh, Jason, Jason, put it away.  Sorry about that.  I didn't realize I was on camera.  Listen to that sound.  That's very authentic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Somebody walked into my office and asked for a raise.  So whenever they do that, I put the lightsaber on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You are asking for a raise, eh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I find your lack of faith in your stock options disturbing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's good.  You can use that, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Next time Frager asks for a raise, you tell him,  your stock options are your raise and Jay Allison will be less forgiving than me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I never forget my my tech valuable tech TV stock options.  Oh, yes. Yes.  We're using upstairs in the bathroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Were people suing like Paul Allen about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like, you know, we went to a lawyer and we we we investigated and there was no way out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I heard a story from an unnamed source that  they would have these meetings with Paul Allen at Tech TV  and they'd have to retell him everything that they told him the first time around.  And he like wouldn't remember.  And at one point, Paul Allen stood up and he held it.  He pulled his wallet out of his out of his pocket and he held it up at this person  who I shouldn't name.  And he says, see this, it's getting thinner.  And I wish something like that had ever been like on a YouTube video.  It would have gone so viral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow. That's like a series of bad investors in the past.  Right. Oh, in the past and the present, Charter is now in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Charter declared Chapter 11.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does it really matter, though?  I mean, he's got like a few billion in the bank.  Like, what does he care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All you got to do is take likes.  And you should remember this.  Skim just a little off the top every month.  Put that aside and you'll never you never have to worry again.  Where were we?  Do we want to talk anywhere about the the Apple three?  I don't think so.  Talk about flip flip.  I think that was why is why does Cisco buy a portable camera manufacturer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they want to be able to sell consumer devices.  Then they started to they own Linksys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think but how does this fit the product line?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think I just think it's an enormous opportunity.  They have deeper pockets.  They can spend more money in R&D of engineering and hardware devices.  And I think there's a burgeoning market for small personal video recording.  I think it's really interesting that both of you guys walk in with a flip camera,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think is really and then Jason showed me.  He didn't plan on that either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think, you know, more and more people are going to be like,  you know, a video camera that basically fits in your pocket.  Seriously. And, you know, I think Cisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But wait a minute. Shouldn't it be on the phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but it brings the batteries so fast on the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, again, Cisco is in a position where they could decide  we want to make a flip cam that has network access.  We want to make a flip cam that does this or that or something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hey, Leo, can I introduce you to my friend? Yeah.  This is my friend, Sam Levine.  If you've ever seen Freaks and Geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I'm a huge fan.  I love that show.  And he's in Inglorious Basterds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you know Quentin Tarantino's new film,  he plays a Nazi killing mofo.  Yes, I believe that's how it's written in the script.  Nazi killing mofo.  What was it like to work with Quentin Tarantino?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was the craziest experience of my life.  iPhone or Blackberry? iPhone all the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  OK, macro PC. PC.  Oh, split decision. Split down the middle there.  All right. We'll talk to you soon.  He's the guest on that was a little promo.  He's the guest on Kevin Pollock show.  We're doing a little cross-pollination.  Sorry about that, Leo. Cross-pollicization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And those are the first three questions you ask anyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know Freaks and Geeks was an amazing show.  Look at all the people came out. Seth Rogen.  So many people came out of that show.  And that's great. It's great to see him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sam Levine made a lot of money at the poker game last night.  How much did you? That's Leo Laporte.  Please tell him I've been a huge fan since.  Sam says huge fans in ZDTV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's only got like 2000. Sure, what I like.  I'd like to know that. What is his Twitter handle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's S.A.M.M. Levine.  Tell him to add himself to WeFollow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's actually a good start. Go to WeFollow.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You got to go to WeFollow. The problem is if you only...  Now, this is a flaw in WeFollow. If you only have 2000 followers,  there's so many people going to be show up ahead of you because you rank by followers.  Yeah, well, I mean, you put...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We have really crazy like if you go to like Tag slash.  I mean, everything from feminist to T to pastors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they're going to look at actors, right? Because he's an actor.  Yeah, absolutely. And he's going to be like 800th on the list.  He'd probably be in the top 50. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, how many followers does he have? 2000.  Oh crap, we just took down WeFollow again.  Oh, sorry.  It's OK. You only have two servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Can everybody retweet to follow Sam Levine?  S.A.M.M. L-E-V-I-N-E. Is that how he spells it?  Yeah, L-E-V-I-N-E. Everyone follow him.  And why should we follow? Because he's funny? Because he's cute?  He's pretty funny. He's a cute guy. He's single for the ladies out there.  For the ladies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's a simple man who likes simple things like fancy cars and casinos, according to Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fancy cars and casinos? But he's a juvenile. I mean, he plays juveniles. He looks like he's 12.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But he's a boy in a man's body, a man in a man in a boy's body.  Anyway, he kills a lot of Nazis.  He's a mean mofo.  Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So your offer now to Twitter to be on the top list, you should tell Sam this, is now up to half a million dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, it is.  Jason moved it up to half a million.  Are you really going to pay half a million bucks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I said if I was a default user for three years, I would pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He wants three years for his money now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I said three years. I keep upping it because I want to keep changing the deal so it's better for me.  So three years, which means you would get, how many people are they going to add in the next three years, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. I get you. Right now, yeah. It's going to be huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Guess how many they're going to, how many do you think?  In the next three years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  20 million? No, more than that.  50 million? More than that.  They're going to be 175 million? They're going to be like Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They'll probably be Facebook size in three years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think they'll be around if they get that big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right. So what's the range, Kevin? Worst case scenario, what? And top line, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're probably in three years, you're probably going to pick up maybe five to seven million followers if that list stayed static at that 40 or 45.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, no, no. 80% of people add those people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is. That's what you look at it. It's 10,000 a day for people.  No, no, no. What it's doing is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't imagine that it is.  Do you think they're just going to keep it a static list?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What it's doing is that they select the first 25 and then they randomize that list of suggested people.  So they go through, if you refresh the page, it'll show a different 25. And so they're going through like 75 people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, except that for some reason, Whole Foods is always on there and Dell is always on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What does Whole Foods talk about?  You get about a third of the people that sign up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think new users at Twitter really should be following Whole Foods?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know how to follow the proof of concept.  I wanted to use it.  Is Whole Foods paying for it?  No, nobody's paying for it.  Nobody's paying anything now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do we know that for sure though?  I know it for a fact. Nobody's paying anybody anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And they turned down your half a million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jason, I'll pay your offer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I'm friends with Evan and I did this as sort of half of a joke and half serious because they didn't include me in the top whatever list when they did it.  So I went from being like number five to number 50.  Can I ask you a question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Were you supposed to microwave the M&Ms inside the bag?  Are they mic'd in the bag?  No, no. Like, yeah, to put them on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She microwaved them in the bag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because that creates steam chamber.  We're now going to have a lump.  Well, we got another one.  Okay. Are these microwaved?  Okay. Take them out.  Put them on.  This is she likes hacking stuff.  So these are microwaved 30 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that was the entire bag microwave?  The entire bag.  What do you think, Gina?  What's the inside look like?  Let's open it up and see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  So what's supposed to happen, Gina?  They're supposed to glow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're just supposed to melt on the inside and, you know, make you feel.  You know, I think this might have worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a few broken ones.  Are they still together?  Are they still in the shells?  Go ahead, David. You get to try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did the bag melt to the M&Ms though?  No. The bag is intact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Give it to Kevin.  All right. I'm going to try it. I'm going to try it.  If it tastes like plastic.  Oh, you're right. No.  Yeah, right?  So you get a creamy middle.  Because the chocolate is slightly melted.  Exactly.  And then you get the hard shell exterior.  And they still melt in your mouth, not in your hands.  Have you done this with Skittles?  I haven't.  Well, we have a bag of Skittles too. We could try it.  We should try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can key out a few onto a napkin if you're afraid of the inks from the bag leaching into your chocolate, which might not be so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I don't think that's a good idea.  So we're going to put these on the.  What is the difference between Skittles and M&Ms?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's no chocolate involved, so that could start a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's not good. So there's like a jelly bean in there, huh?  It's like it might. It's like starburst, but with a candy coating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK.  And then 30 seconds on the Skittles.  What's this? Oh, look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here, try these. These were these are microwaved in a mug, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They get a little melty, the M&Ms, as you're probably seeing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sticking with the Lindt 70% cocoa intense dark chocolate.  Forget M&Ms.  Look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're not really melted that much.  I love that Lindt Lindt is delicious.  That is good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cargo plane crashes in Tokyo and they've got a video of it.  Oh, my God. Wow.  Is there a plane there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, planes stop crashing. Holy hell.  We've had so many in like the last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're now many people don't know this, but Kevin is not exactly a good flyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I love to fly as long as I've had like three or four beers before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're a nervous flyer a little bit.  I know this because we couldn't get you to come back to Toronto because you didn't like the flying.  I hate everything about it.  It's pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Going away and like it's like you were live streaming your flight last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true. That was fun.  Actually, that was on Virgin America.  He was sitting there with a was it you streamers?  Yeah, you stream and everyone just sitting there staring at him staring at his computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. Now we've microwaved Skittles while you enjoy these lovely.  Try one of these two. Come on.  The green.  You know, you know, those are good.  What are the green do?  You remember when?  Yeah.  Stop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, how many of those tech TV shirts do you own?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I wore this for today for the occasion.  I have three or four.  They don't make them anymore.  You know.  Oh, wow. That's really different.  Skittles.  They're good.  It's not bad.  It's not bad.  Hmm.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Technology news.  I'm sure there's some TV viewing, according to Nielsen, is at an all time high.  More people are watching TV.  Well, this is from the fall.  So maybe the election.  It's something to do with more people are watching TV than ever before.  The average American television.  I thought it was going down.  No, I can tell you why it's going up.  Get this.  The average American television viewer is watching more than a hundred fifty one hours of television a month.  That's five hours a day.  It's a very simple reason.  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because people used to miss episodes of shows.  So to get into a show like damages or Battlestar.  No, you're right.  Or lost.  You would miss the show and you'd like, I'm not going to start that up.  So now they could make shows that are totally big story arcs, very complex and know that people are not going to miss anything.  Right.  If they do, they go to Hulu.  So now people are getting addicted.  I mean, I don't remember the last time in the 80s or 90s that people were like, oh, my God, Battlestar.  Oh, my God.  Damages. Oh, my God.  The shield. Oh, my God.  Lost.  I mean, people are addicted to the shows and it's cliffhangers again, like the serials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's a renaissance for them if they only had the, you know, this is bad for us, though, for revision three and twit, because we don't want them watching so much TV.  We want to be fine.  Kevin's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't care.  You can always find an hour here or there to fit in some good podcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's they're different, different types of content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I do think one of the changes is that they're counting DVRs now.  They didn't for, you know, when we were on tech TV, 13 percent of our audience was watching on TV and didn't get counted.  If you got a TV, Nielsen would come and take your people meter.  So that really hurt us because we never, you know, most of our audience was technologically illiterate.  But now they're finally counting DVRs.  In fact, DVR viewer, the rise, the use of recorders has is gone up.  Now, get this in the fourth quarter, 2008, seventy three point nine million people use DVRs.  I mean, how many there's only like a hundred TV, a hundred million TV households total.  It's like three quarters of all households are using DVRs now.  So that but that's what you said, Jason, because you don't miss episodes anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And if it gets to the big issue now, it's like, oh, if I got deleted off the DVR by accident because I ran out of space or somebody accidentally, I go to Hulu and watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. Or BitTorrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. But what they're going to do is they're going to get us addicted to this.  And then the new inside line is when you go to Hulu, maybe in like it'll take a year or two, you're going to have to prove that you subscribe at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's what they do with the HBO paper, pay per view or that's going to be for everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And they verify that he's putting your take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You put in your address, you put in your view, they cookie you, they give you a log in just like serious satellite does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Interesting. The chocolate episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it was either wine or chocolate.  And since you declined our wine square space, by the way, who does your blog, right?  Sent us. They do mine, too.  They did. They sent us some of the best wine.  They sent us. Thank you.  I want to say thank you to Dane, who sent us like ten bottles of like really good French wine.  I know. And California, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I had a chance to sit down with the Squarespace guys when we are in South by Southwest.  And not only are they really engaged in making a fun and interesting platform,  but they're they're intellectually engaged in how people use websites, both on a user back end and how how front end users navigate websites.  And and they have, you know, a sincere intellectual fascination with with not our toys and gizmos.  But but how do we move from a tinker type of platform like WordPress over to something that allows you to have that same code level access,  but but really concentrate on publishing as opposed to tinkering.  And, you know, they're fascinating guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you have to be smart now.  You cannot come out with a product widgets, websites and not really be.  You have to be Steve Jobs from now on.  The bar is rising.  And don't you like that?  I think you have to be a deep thinker.  I don't think you can just say, let's put something out and see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, one of the things that I constantly tell people within ABC and said the same talking point over and over and over at South by Southwest was that, look, our tools and our gadgets and gizmos, they're all they're all well and good.  But really, this is not about our tools and gadgets.  It's about determining the way media and information flows in the 21st century.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's not obvious because it's changing.  We're in an inflection point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly, exactly.  But I keep telling my bosses, look, this is the democratization of the dissemination of information.  And you need to understand not just how Twitter works.  You need to not understand just how Facebook works.  But you need to understand things like trust and community and relationship.  And they sound very, very basic.  But all of information flows based on hierarchies of trust and relationships.  If you don't understand that, you can implement any type of toy or gadget over the top of a website.  And like you said, you can't just launch it.  It has to be something that's smart and treats people like they're smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does that make sense, Gina?  You think that we're getting smarter?  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I hope we're getting smarter.  Some people are getting smarter.  But yeah, to build something meaningful.  Yes, all of you have to understand all of those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Your site is smarterware.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was not an intentional plug.  But thank you, Leo.  I appreciate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One of the things that I see, though, that troubles me a little bit, especially when working with big companies and corporations, is that they oftentimes sit back and they just sit on their hands for a little bit.  They kind of watch what's going on, but they're scared to get out there and actually play because their business model is shaky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you have to get out there.  You have to release early, release often and iterate.  You know, and that's something that these big companies aren't used to doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and they also don't understand what's going on because it undermines their business model.  And it's very difficult. If you've built a company on one business model.  Well, Jason, can you speak to that?  I mean, if now who's there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, this is my friend, Kevin Pollock.  Oh, my God.  It's like Hollywood.  I'm just name-dropping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did Martin Short call into the show yesterday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Martin Short called in.  Hold on.  Talk to Kevin Pollock for a second.  He's more interesting.  I don't know.  I mean, I'm in the helm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kevin, take the con.  Take her out, Mr. P.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm only saying that because it's Shatner's 78th birthday today.  And I'm very excited and happy birthday to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we're glad to have you on board the Starship Enterprise, Mr. Shatner.  What do you think, William, of the new Star Trek episode?  Oh, geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  First of all, let me just say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  On the Star Trek celebration, it's Shatner's 78th birthday.  No.  Geordie in the house as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Shatner is 78.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's still kicking life square in the nuts.  And he looks so good.  Yes, he do.  And so does they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look at this. We both got the hats.  This is going to be great.  Wait a minute. I got mine.  Where's my cap?  I've got one here.  Is that because you guys are bald or is it just you like to wear the hat?  You think it looks good on you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, in him, in his case, it looks because he looks cool.  In my case, because I am yet another talented balding Jew.  Now, you know, we're live very soon, shortly after you.  And I hope we get one-tenth of your audience would be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're going to keep everybody and then some.  We're going to 60,000 to watch Kevin Pollak vamp live.  What is the name of this?  Is it the Kevin Pollak show?  It's called Kevin Pollak's chat show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's titled.  Yeah, it's very original.  Kevin Pollak's chat show dot com.  One of the many portals where this can be viewed and Levar Burton, Sam Levine,  the first guest in the first kickoff debut show in T minus 37.  I better start drinking.  Yeah, you better start getting liquored up now, Levar.  And I want you, by the way, but you have to promise now on your show live that  you'll be a guest on mine and Kevin Rose as well, please.  I think anytime we'd love to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I want to book you now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not going to just take any time.  Thursday at four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's Sunday.  Every Sunday, five p.m.  Your specific highlight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have your person, Mr.  Calacanis, have him call my person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I will have my bitch Calcana's call your people and we'll set this up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bitch is the new king of the world, just so you know.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's great to talk to you, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm a huge fan.  I don't know if you remember.  I used to have you on the radio show at you on K and B,  are in San Francisco often and just a big fan of the of all the success you've had.  Thank you very much.  And of course, I remember it's still on my resume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you don't know.  That's a good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go do your show.  Go do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  I look forward to being on your show and you on my show.  And Kevin Rose, please.  Ask Levar what it was like to be on this show and then then then say you want to be on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, OK, I will.  I'll put that to him live.  We're taking live questions as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So please offer some of those.  And now here's Mr.  Calcana's my boss.  It's like Bob Hope wandering into the studio.  You know, you wouldn't remember that you too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember Bob Hope.  You remember.  But yeah, but I mean, you don't remember him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You remember.  Did you ever watch Johnny Carson?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you did.  OK, so you must have been pretty young.  Yeah.  So Jason, I was asking the question.  I would I think you were a little bit more of a young man.  I was just you know, I forgot now what I was asking was something about business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, well, changing business models.  I don't remember.  Yeah.  Whose business model would change?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, just how difficult it is for a company that is built around one business model to  suddenly say, oh, look at these newspapers this week.  Seattle Post-Intelligencer.  It's gone online.  It's no longer a print paper.  I think that's a difficult transition because their whole business is built on display ads,  full page display ads and classified ads, neither of which exist on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, no way they saw that coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So so it's a very difficult transition.  I might say to you with the record industry, it's going to be very difficult when you build  a business and the entire business is posited on one particular business plan.  I think it's got to be tough to say, well, it's different now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's brutally tough because typically it would involve a different group of people  with a different set of DNA.  I mean, if Dig went to an editorial basis and they pick the top 10 stories by editors,  you would be like, oh, well, what do we do with all these people who are community managers  and developers?  Right.  And that's what's going to have to happen with newspapers and a lot of things.  And most of the times people can't make the evolutionary shift.  It's just too difficult.  You better have to shut some of these things down.  And you know what?  Don't cry for the newspapers.  It's an opportunity for young people with new ideas to make better things.  And newspapers, which frankly, a lot of them were bought and sold and their editorial was  very biased and their ideas were very old.  Don't cry for the newspaper business.  I'm sick of that.  You know, Engadget as a blog or, you know, This Week in Tech as a show are much better  lifehacker, etc. than the tech products that came before them.  They're better than ZDNet.  They're better than CNET.  They're better than PC Magazine.  Nobody's crying because G4 TV is gone.  Who cares?  Who gives a crap about tech TV?  Twitter is better.  So don't care about the newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  From your ears to Kevin Pollock's lips.  No, that's wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, people have this thing like, oh, in progress, everywhere else is good, right?  But in the newspaper business, progress is bad.  Right.  I don't know.  Stopping killing trees is a good thing.  I guess.  It's good that we're not going to kill trees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like the Sunday paper.  I mean, I like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, once a week is fine, but it is bad for the environment.  I have a Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you ever tried to read a newspaper on the Kindle?  It's not a good experience.  It doesn't feel right.  No, it's well, you know why?  The Kindle is a linear device for...  Great for books, lousy for anything that you want to hop around in.  You can't hop.  There's no hopping.  Do you use a Kindle, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do, and I totally agree.  Books, for sure.  Newspapers, not so much.  It's great for books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I get all my books that if I don't listen to them on Audible, I get them on the Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you have them on the iPhone app, too?  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  It's cool that it syncs, right?  Yeah.  Because you can be sitting there and read through a few pages and go back to your Kindle.  Have you played with that?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I love it.  It's not easy to read on the iPhone, but it's not awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it'll kill 10 minutes, right?  You got it.  Sitting there doing something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a funny, there's an interesting Twitter account to follow.  It's called The Media Is Dying.  Yeah, I've seen that.  It aggregates all the news about what's on the certain newspapers.  And sometimes they'll post things about how Kindle might be changing or not changing.  I follow that.  It's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We need to death watch Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's not dying, it's evolving.  I mean, look, you just saw...  No, you're absolutely right.  It is evolving.  We're still media.  This is media?  Yeah.  Yeah, Revision 3, Twitter, you just saw three celebrities in here.  They're more excited to work in this medium than they are in the last one.  Oh, that's interesting.  And with good reason.  Twitter has hit celebrities.  They are because they're forward thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, you look at something, you know, Jimmy Fallon, these guys, they know.  But there's a lot of guys who are going, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know what, it's just almost all of them, if you put them in front of it and you show  them and I've showed, you know, a dozen celebrity type people, the internet and the  intro webs and how it works.  It's the same business.  What happens is they just, all of a sudden in their head, they're like, oh my God, I  can communicate with the audience.  Oh my God, the audience is giving me feedback.  Oh my God, this is real.  Careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cutting out the middle man in a lot of cases.  Like if you take a look at like Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher and what they do, they're  taking pictures of paparazzi and then tweet picking those.  Isn't that great?  Yeah, it's so awesome.  Yeah, that's awesome.  They call them the Paps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The Paps got disintermediated.  I love that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Again, it's a different understanding of what trust is and how information flows.  And when you have a static medium like a newspaper or a television, something that is one to  many, a broadcast, it requires a certain paradigm to understand how that's communicated.  I'm sure that those who, the predecessors of traditional media thought very, very similar  things.  It's that now we can live in a time where we can have conversations about how and why  information is changing.  And that's fascinating.  You know, I know that that old media a hundred years ago were having these discussions, but  now we can have them in a public context.  We can allow new ideas to come into the discussion and form how information moves and changes.  You know, it's a vastly different time period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, it's really fascinating.  Leo, our next sponsor is really fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're watching the chat room, aren't you, Jason?  Yes, I am.  Yes, I am.  Jason's getting his cues now from the chat room.

Transcript:  You know who does a great walk-in is Kevin Pollack.  Kevin Pollack does the best.  He's the king of walk-in.  He is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I copied my walk-in from him.  Mine's about 40% as good as his.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's how you know a guy does a good impression is when you copy his impression, you have  an impression of his impression, you still sound good.  That's a good impression.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Your father gave me this watch.  You know who I like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a fake Gary Busey that's pretty funny.  Kind of out of control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I should read, I should do a dramatic reading of this Twitter account of Christopher Walken.  An associate told me he'd been cheating on his wife.  He asked me not to talk about it.  And I probably won't, unless it comes up somehow.  Thank you.  Thank you very much, Christopher Walken.  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  His account is cwalken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  C-W-A-L-K-E-N.  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We got to get Kevin Pollock here to just read Christopher Walken's Twitter account.  All right.

Transcript:  Save that for your show.  What about Audible?

Transcript:  Audible.com slash twittoo.  You could sign up today.  You get the platinum account.  I like the platinum because it gives you two books.  And I go through two books a month easily.

I bet you Pollock's on here.  There's radio shows.  A lot of BBC, classic BBC stuff on there.  It's wonderful.  Audible.com.  What did you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got so excited about Audible, I just spilled my tea all over your desk.  I don't care about the desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It looks like you spilled it on my chocolate.  I got it on your chocolate as well.  Forget the desk.

Transcript:  I'm a sports Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  Well, there you go.  It's just a Hollywood extravaganza at the Calakans.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's just getting crazy here.  What is up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you invite people over like all day long to just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, what happened is we're doing Kevin's show here and I told everybody on my mailing list  they could just show up.  So now there's like a hundred people here drinking beer.  Man.  I'm taking cues from you, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought this was a good party and now I'm feeling like I want to go down there.  Anyway, let me mention Audible.com.  Audible.com.  Just go there.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm happy.  You're not happy partying with Prager?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm happy.  No, I'm happy.  This is good.  I'm very happy.  Prager brings the party.  Exactly right.  Exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Did you know there's an erotic and sexuality section on Audible.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Play something from the erotic section, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  I guess I can.  They have kids and young adults too.  Would you like to hear that instead?  No, I'll go with the erotica and sexuality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're trying to get the sponsor value, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay?  You know, In Bed with Susie Bright.  Susie Bright is now my Facebook friend.  I don't know how she knew to follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Susie Bright is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's great.  I love Susie Bright.  No, Bobo's in Paradise they have on Audible and I just grabbed that.  That might be a very apropos pick as well.  It might not be erotic enough, but you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not erotic enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I actually love Bobo's in Paradise.  That was a great book.  I actually did not listen to it on Audible.com.  David Brooks, the author, of course, he's the conservative columnist for the New York  The New Bill Kristol on the New York Times.  And it's the new upper class and how they got there.  I don't know what you're saying by that, Dan.  What are you saying by that?  What are you implying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I wonder sometimes because, you know, I have my family's from Jersey and New York  and I grew up in the Midwest and I went to a very small school.  You're starting to sound like Christopher Walken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you notice that?  That was awesome.  Well, I live in Brooklyn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Everybody's been doing the show with that voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm right now two blocks from Burl Hall in Brooklyn.  I get a lot of the accent.  But anyway, I wonder sometimes and I try to bring myself into this mindset again, as much  as I love technology and I love talking about the future of communication, I wonder if we  don't live in our own little bubble.  I know that and I've built a career talking about the news bubble and the media bubble  that the traditional media is in.  But I'm also a little concerned that to middle America, we may look like a bunch of dilettantes  running around with our gadgets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I promise you that's exactly why people hate Twitter.  That's why South by Southwest looks like a, you know, a solopsist's love fest.  I mean, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  And so I mentioned Bobo's in Paradise because, you know, he does talk a lot about this new  class of people who seek out the simulacra as opposed to the authentic.  And yet we're all kind of on this desperate search for the authentic.  What does Twitter do?  breaks down these barriers so that we can access people and so-called celebrities on  a much more authentic level.  No doubt.  But at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I had Snoop Dogg send an out reply to me the other day.  It was amazing.  What?  I had Snoop Dogg send me an out reply the other day.  That's wild, isn't it?  Word, dog.  It was the best thing ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then you said something about shizzle and menizzle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's what he said to me.  He said, for shizzle, something like that.  Yeah, yeah.  And he calls all his Twitter followers are his twizzles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My twizzles, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My twizzles.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I love it.  Mike K. Rose is a make a rose is a can you spare a digger's is a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Bobos in Paradise.  I think this is a great pick, Dan.  Thank you.  The new upper class and how they got there by David Brooks.  This isn't one of his more recent books.  I think this is five or six years old, but it's really let me play a little bit of it.  I don't think there's anything erotic in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The thing that struck me as oddest was the way the old categories no longer made sense.  Throughout the 20th century, it's been pretty easy to distinguish between the bourgeois  world of capitalism and the Bohemian counterculture.  The bourgeoisie were the square practical ones.  They defended tradition and middle class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Bohemians are now the new bourgeoisie.  That's very interesting.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Was that being read by C3PO?  You know what?  Some of the.  Your bourgeoisie are quite like Arthur Moffitt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  From the new Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do you expect?  He's a conservative writer for the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's not C3PO.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the book, I think, in fact, I'm seeing this now.  It is on my library.  I did listen to it on Audible.  It's Bobo's in Paradise, the new upper class, how they got there, our pick of the week.  But you can get two books if you go to audible.com slash twit two and sign up for the beautiful  platinum plan.  Two books a month, but the first two are free.  And we do thank Audible so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what's cool?  You can do with I think most devices with audio with audio books like Audible's audio  books, you can speed it up.  Yeah, that's great.  Driving and you want to listen to something and it's kind of narrated too slow.  You can just speed it up.  Oh, that is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I have seen.  Productivity tip.  Yeah, very good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then when it speeds it up, they employ something that keeps like the tone down so  you're not like a Mickey Mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think I've seen Gina studies that say that we actually comprehend better at higher  speeds.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you give your mind time to wander while it's trying to speak.  Maybe that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We add types do better when it's talking very fast because we can't pay it.  Oh, look at bicycle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's what the problem with Twitter and Facebook is.  It just promotes add.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no. Tab browsing.  Promote. Oh, yeah, totally.  That is I got to turn that off sometimes.  Well, what do you do? You open a lot of.  Virtual Adderall.  Absolutely. Like how many tabs you have open right now?  Let's take a poll. How many tabs?  OK, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  Eight, ten.  Well, wait a minute. I have two browsers open.  So. OK, I'm nine.  What do you have? Eight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fifteen. I've got 13.  Yeah. Oh, my God.  You guys are a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We are a mess.  Well, I leave stuff open until I'm done with it.  And sometimes to shut my computer down, if I don't save the tabs, I'll just have to  we have to try and finish each tab so I can close them all out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you ever go back to like a tab that has Gmail open with the email  that you already wrote and you're like, why didn't I just hit send?  Oh, yeah. All the time. I have all the time.  I have unsent mail.  I hate when that happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gina, is there a cure for this?  Is there something we can do? Help us.  Help us, life hacker.  You're our only hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Step away from the computer.  That's what I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm all about the like I'm all about the like forcing myself to single focus.  Like there are times when my tab bar when my tab bar gets to the point  where I can't read, where I'm only seeing fav icons.  That's when I do like the cleanup.  You know what I mean?  Or when like the same thing on the dock of the taskbar.  I just kind of do that, like clean up every couple of hours.  Like, OK, close this window, send the email.  Done with that. But you're not one of those loathsome inbox zero types, are you?  I aspire to be. I aspire to be.  I don't aspire to be loathsome, but I do aspire to have no email in my inbox.  And I don't know. I'm not very successful.  Let's see. Right now, I've got I've got 30 in my inbox right now.  So emails. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would kill for 30. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I file like I deal with email and then archive it immediately.  So, yes, I am one of those loathsome types.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have thirty two thousand nine hundred forty eight messages in my inbox.  Four thousand one hundred fourteen unread.  But do you live email because like I used to like I can't get the inbox here.  I have to do amnesty. I have to delete them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They call it email bankruptcy.  Yeah, bankruptcy. Lessig invented that.  You send a reply all to all unread saying I just declared bankruptcy and delete them all.  I don't think I could even do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think I just have to post on the blog.  If you sent me email once, it's long gone.  So send it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have really strong filters and I send lots of canned responses.  That's like, I'm really sorry to send you this impersonal thing.  But here's the generic answer.  I have a kind of a jerk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a text expander macro. S.S.O.R.R.Y.  I sent it and says, I can't help you. Go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Text expander rocks.  Text expander is a lifesaver. Yeah, it really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now email. What's his name?  The wine guy, Gary.  Gary's like you get a link back to a video and he's like, OK, it's Gary.  Listen, you email me. I love that you email me.  I love you. I love email.  I love everybody and we're going to kill it together.  OK, here's I love my family. I love the Jets.  I can't stop you.  I cannot respond, but I can love you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then he gives you links to commonly asked questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I've done that, but I didn't do the video.  I really think that's a good idea.  And I think the key is to say I love you. Right.  Yeah. Just keeps saying over and over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's incredible. You're just killing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're great. You're going to do great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're wonderful. You're a wonderful person. I love you.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Honestly, you think like maybe it's a little cheesy, like the Gary thing.  Totally endearing, totally authentic, totally a real guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love that guy. Gary's for real, though.  He's not just doing it just because he wants like press or people.  He's just a good solider.  No, he's a sincere human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He is. He is totally authentic and sincere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's almost like he died.  And this is his obituary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, he was a great guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's never been on the show.  I got him. Yeah, Gary was awesome.  He's going to have a lot of time on his hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's spread the rumor at home because his wife's about to have a baby.  Oh, really? Got a new baby.  And so like he's going to be languishing, itching to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, I'm going to ask him on Twitter.  We'll have one next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Somebody just said this is the best Twitter ever.  Twitter isn't in the chat room.  I'd like everybody in the chat room to rate Twitter on a scale of one to ten.  This episode, please.  I hate it when you do this.  Oh, this is so painful.  Please rate the show.  Please rate the show.  And so put a number and then what you think of the show.  Someone put 49.  One to ten. I got a nine, a nine, a nine.  So we got a billion, two point five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A lot of them.  Seven billion.  Eleven. Somebody said it to eleven.  Six hundred and sixty six.  Apparently a devil worshiper in the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can't. They're raising it to the power of.  Yeah, you can't put pie in there, guys.  Somebody said three, three strong hits of LSD.  That's good. Wow.  Yeah, exactly.  I think this is Adderall, virtual Adderall.  Who is who is it that said that?  Was that you, David?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what we need. That might have been me.  Was it you, Dan?  Shh. Well, I do.  I'm just saying we, you know, if that's the metaphor, we need  some kind of digital Adderall to to focus us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Turn off the computers.  What Gina says. OK, everybody, please stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What? You stop writing now.  Are you telling are you telling up the votes now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Steve Wozniak is the winner.  Can you believe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I watched that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you believe Belinda Carlyle lost to Steve Wozniak?  It's like that's got to be the most  the most horrible thing that could ever happen to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Woz brings in ratings.  Everyone kind of wants he's the underdog, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's mad. You know, he's actually a little angry  because he feels like, you know, they never reveal what the online voting was.  He feels like they're actually hiding that that they that he says  the producers planned for Belinda Carlyle and me to have a dance off.  That's what happened last Tuesday.  They wanted that for the ratings.  They didn't care about the vote about the online votes.  And you're and he's right, they never tell you what the online votes are.  I voted for him 13 times both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lawsuit lawsuit with 13 different phones, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no.  If you're AT&T, you can send 13.  Oh, really? Text messages.  You can vote for anybody 13 times.  You get 13 votes, I guess, because that was there were 13 contestants.  And then next week, they'll be 12 and 11.  So so, yeah, Belinda Carlyle of the go-gos of all people.  That's got to be humiliating because because frankly,  Steve was a dance and Teletubby, let's face it.  He did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you have to love him. Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you see. And that's why he won, because I think everybody goes his spirit, his heart.  He's loving this. He's enthusiastic.  He doesn't he's he's not a good dancer.  I don't think anybody has that illusion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But he's he's trying so hard.  He broke his foot. Yeah, he's awesome.

Transcript:  He broke his foot and still danced.

Transcript:  What happened to Steve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not very many. I was actually it was really good.  I didn't hold it mad once.  I got to you seriously, you know, for like a second at one point.  For the most part, I didn't even use this one, which was which was really exciting.  I thought Jason would at least make me use this one.  The WTF. Yeah, but he didn't.  He didn't. So I think this went really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I adore you. SmarterWear.org.  Please come back. We love having you on the show.  Thanks for having me on.  It's not easy being the one woman with a bunch of loudmouth guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You have to write it backwards.  You have to write it backwards.  Yeah, but you have to kind of flip it around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The trycast does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, something weird is doing it. All right.  So that's OK.  Everybody should watch this show in their rear view mirror and they'll understand it.  Jason's at Mahalo.com and his new show is coming in a couple of weeks.  Meanwhile, the Kevin Pollock chat show dot com.

They'll come out in his book when he writes a quote on my argument.  Bastard.  I love Kevin.  I always have.  But I also tried to hire Gina at least three times and would send her  offer letters of increasingly large sums of money and equity  and tell her, at the very least, if you don't take my offer,  please make Denton pay you more money.
