Lots of people coming from all around to visit, to see the new  studio in action, and to pay  a farewell to the old cottage. Joining us for the first time, I think, on TWIT,  Ben Parr  from Mashable. Great to have you, Ben. Glad to be here. Welcome.  You were a celebrity this week.  That's your definition of one. Yes, in the Facebook. That was really cool.  That was really cool. We'll talk about that in a second. Also joining us kind of  it isn't a surprise because you told me you were coming here, but I  I just forgot to bake a cake. Mr. Ray Slechinski,  who is an old friend. Ray did the first really good iPod  podcast program called iPodRx with August Truminer. And that's when I  first met up in Toronto.  And he is now working for HiDef,  which is the Flavors.me company.  And where do you do, are you still in Toronto? Yeah.

Start time: 258.58
End time: 265.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I just got back from Cape Canaveral and I haven't even unpacked everything.  But yeah, I'm still all vibrating from the excitement.

Start time: 266.14
End time: 293.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, it's funny because we rebroadcast the feed from space vidcast dot com.  They do such a great job.  They did. It was kind of remind me the old days of Walter Cronkite  sitting in the tent and watching the launch and everything.  And they invited me to go. And you know why I didn't go?  And I had I could have gone.  I thought, oh, I'll go and they won't launch.  You know, because the last one, they launched a bunch, you know,  the four weeks later where I said, I'll go and they.  And of course, what do they do?  They've got a weather hole, a weather hole. Oh, let's launch. Boom.

Start time: 294.94
End time: 303.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it went off and, you know, Scobel was there, too.  And he was thinking the same thing.  It's not going to go off because I'm here.  I'm like, try to be optimistic, Scobel. It might go off.

Start time: 303.58

Transcript:  This is actually your second shuttle launch.  You were there last time, too.

Start time: 307.48
End time: 319.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was there for STS 134.  That's kind of their code system. That was Endeavor.  It was scrubbed the first time that I went back again.  And then I went for the final launch and it was really magical.

Start time: 319.24
End time: 341.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The last shuttle, although, you know,  and I'm sure people didn't talk about this at the time, but I mean,  there was generally the feeling that this the shuttle was mostly theater,  not so much really about space exploration.  In fact, Esther Dyson called it the end.  Of the beginning, she's of the opinion that now we get serious  about space exploration.

Start time: 342.76
End time: 357.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think we're going to see so much private stuff  that starts to really go off.  And that's pretty exciting because, you know, the idea that  that the government doesn't have to do it.  That whole notion is so so exhilarating.  I think we're going to see amazing stuff now.

Start time: 357.64
End time: 360.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Trey took a great shot of the this is the night before, wasn't it?

Start time: 362.22
End time: 374.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I felt lucky.  I got an escort and I was one of the last people to be there  for its kind of final night on Earth.  And I felt like I shared a little personal moment with it.  And it was really a nice little evening there.

Start time: 374.64
End time: 376.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, have you started reviewing your pictures from the launch?

Start time: 378.54
End time: 448.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I've gone through a few of them.  It takes a while for me, you know, because I want to make sure that I  I have to be careful what I post because I want to make sure it's really high quality.  You know, Robert was able to go post one immediately,  like three minutes after the launch.  He's not a pro.  No, he's still got a good shot, though.  But yeah, it was it was amazing because the thing is, is that,  you know, you're sitting there when the press area, we're three point one miles away.  We're as close as they really let you get.  And you know, it's going to be loud and it goes up.  And then the sound comes across and it is loud.  But then something else happens.  There's sort of this kinetic staccato  wave that rumbles across the water and slams into your chest  and kind of shakes your skeleton and vibrates your soul.  And it's sort of this unholy feeling that's rocking through you  as you're watching this thing go up all in the meantime, you're trying to  get photos of this thing and capture the feeling of it.  So there's so much happening.  And there's the emotion is the last one.  And all of us that are there, such enthusiasts, we're so into it.  We're completely impartial.  So there's a lot of stuff colliding.

Start time: 449.02
End time: 451.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's Roberts said picture.  That's a pretty good picture, too. I got to admit.

Start time: 454.72
End time: 456.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was a nice description, by the way, try you can say.

Start time: 456.48
End time: 462.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, Mary. Yeah, he's very poetic, Trey.  Is. Yeah.  So you're glad you were there, obviously.

Start time: 464.16
End time: 479.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it was great.  It was a little nerve wrecking actually having a scobel so close to me  because he's you know, that final 10 minutes, I need to focus on my craft.  I've got my multiple cameras and so on and so forth.  And he's there. He's kind of like that that little thing on Jabba  the Hutt that's always laughing.

Start time: 480.32
End time: 480.40
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So

Start time: 481.56
End time: 493.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I took Scobel a couple hundred yards away from me.  And I said, you stand here, Robert, and point at the flag.  Focus on Infinity F11, F13. Yeah, this is good, Robert.  I'm going to help you get a great picture.  Stand over there.

Start time: 493.48
End time: 504.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I said, I'll see you after the launch.  Yeah, I'll see you later, Robert.  You're going to get a great shot from right there, Robert.  Yeah.  No, he did end up getting a good shot, but it was great.  It was great fun. That's so neat.

Start time: 504.82
End time: 506.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I can't wait.  Now, I sent a donated $1,000 to the company.

Start time: 509.60
End time: 527.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, I sent a donated to the cause.  We had I had my actually was my first DSLR, my Nikon D70, a beloved camera.  I took a lot of great pictures with it.  But it's been eclipsed by several cameras since, including the 5D Mark II.  So you said, well, I could use it.  I could put it next to the so how close to the launch was that D70?

Start time: 528.98
End time: 559.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a couple hundred feet.  You know, you can't stand there.  But if you get an escort, you can go out and set up remote cameras.  And we set up two remote cameras, yours and another one.  And the plan was my storybook vision of this is that your camera would end up  as this melted, melted husk that we would have to go out and pull out these Nikon  jars of light and peel it open and extract out a card that we then take to some  CSI chamber to resolve the pixels that might be remaining.

Start time: 559.28
End time: 561.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's what you told me would happen.  That's not what happened.

Start time: 561.94
End time: 576.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it didn't turn out quite so histrionic.  Really, your camera is just a little bit damaged.  And I haven't gone through all the photos yet, but I don't think we're  going to see anything too impressive.  It was there and it's probably got a little bit of something, something on it.  And I'll bring it back to the studio.

Start time: 577.00
End time: 584.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Please. Yeah, we'll put it in a place of honor.  I couldn't be at the launch, but at least my camera could be could be there.  So that's pretty cool.  So you're glad you went.

Start time: 585.52
End time: 594.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I'm very happy I went.  Bit of history there. It's nice. It's real nice.  Pretty amazing. Thanks for sitting in your camera.  We had we had a good time with it.  Just just the whole idea of it was was really kind of.

Start time: 595.04
End time: 597.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just sorry it didn't get melted and destroyed.

Start time: 597.30
End time: 604.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And oh, well, yeah, it was cool.  Yeah, you say you like Nikon and Canon equally, yet the Nikon is what you offer  up to die in a fire.

Start time: 606.78
End time: 624.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think I've ever said I like Nikon and Canon equally.  I am I am now a full bore Canon shooter, although I, as I said, my first DSLR  was a Nikon and I love that D70.  You know, the other choice for that, I kind of went back and forth was to send it up  to Washington state and have it turn into an infrared camera.  But I think this is a good use for it.

Start time: 625.46
End time: 627.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, maybe you still can, which depends on if we get it fixed or not.

Start time: 627.98
End time: 668.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, the edge, I don't want it to be fixed.  Trey Reckliff, so great to have you.  Thank you for joining us and sharing some first person  observations from the shuttle launch.  Atlantis is is up there now.  In fact, we just watched a video of them docking with the International Space Station  and the meet and greet as they got on board the ISS.  And then the program ends.  What's actually I'd like to open this up to the panel.  What now? Is it going to be citizen space?  Is it going to be privatized?  You know, one of the things that NASA wants to do, of course, is focus on.  Manned unmanned expeditions to Mars and in other places, what do you what do you  let's start with you, Trey, and then I'll let the panel speak.

Start time: 669.82
End time: 684.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's a good question.  I think that people do like to get their heads around a big idea.  And it's inspiring.  I'm a little bummed out that NASA hasn't announced something really, really awesome.  You know, like the successor to the space shuttle.

Start time: 684.72
End time: 685.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got no money, dude.

Start time: 686.30
End time: 687.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know. I know.

Start time: 688.00
End time: 707.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although I just said that the 20 billion dollars  that we spend on NASA actually is the same amount of money  it took to air condition the troops in Afghanistan and Iraq for one year.  So, you know, I mean, it sounds like a lot of money,  but compared to what we spend money on, it's not a particularly large amount of money.

Start time: 709.00
End time: 729.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they're still going to be doing manned space flights.  They're just doing it in a different way.  They don't have something quite as, you know,  as exciting as a space shuttle once was when it was announced.  But, you know, we we do live in this sci fi time  where we see amazing inventions right left.  And I think we we really want to get excited about sci fi space travel right now.

Start time: 729.46
End time: 745.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I mean.  I have to say, when I talk to scientists, the sci fi is what excites them.  They end up doing what they read about the sci fi.  That's you've got to excite kids.  You've got to get them going.  And I think a space program is a good way to do it.  Ben Parr, what do you what do you think the future of NASA?

Start time: 746.32
End time: 771.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually wrote and did a lot of research for an article  that I published this week about the private space race  because I was fascinated by everything that's been happening.  I really think it is the X Prize.  We've got I mean, yeah, and the X Prize people are amazing people.  You have you have SpaceX, which is Elon Musk's space company.  And that's been growing quite substantially.  And then you have Virgin Galactic, you know, and Richard Branson.  And they're going to be starting those space flights, two hundred thousand dollars a pop.  But they're going to be starting.

Start time: 771.80
End time: 775.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're barely they're barely they're not even their suborbital.  They're barely into space.

Start time: 776.18
End time: 803.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That one is barely into space.  But each with each excessive one, it gets higher and higher.  And the thing is, it's I mean, you had to start off with innovation, I guess,  in the public sector, because no one else could afford  the programs that were needed in the 1960s and such to build  rockets to the moon.  But now it's the costs are going down, the technology is getting better.  And hopefully what's going to happen is when the private sector  really, really hammers it hard, it's going to cost are going to go down  and it's going to become more and more accessible.

Start time: 803.94
End time: 809.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know you were really excited about this, but you're you're nearby in Houston.  You didn't want to go over to the Cape.

Start time: 810.72
End time: 869.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's a long way from Houston to Cape Canaveral.  I didn't go. We sent several of our of our columnist and bloggers over there,  including Eric Berger, our science blogger, who did some excellent work out of there.  And I'm kind of interested in in what's happening  here in Houston as a result of the end of the shuttle program.  A lot of the support and certainly like mission control is based here.  And there's going to be a lot of layoffs.  But what's interesting is because Johnson Space Center is here,  there has been almost like a Silicon Valley effect.  There are a lot of private space operations here.  Companies that supported NASA as contractors.  And now they're kind of they're going to be off on their own.  And my suspicion is that you could see a lot of the innovation  taking place from those companies that at one time supported  the shuttle program there now in order to survive.  We're going to have to innovate.  And I think it's going to be really interesting around here for the next few years.

Start time: 869.46
End time: 872.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And there'll be a lot of aerospace engineers looking for work.  So that's right.

Start time: 873.14
End time: 896.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And a lot of those aerospace engineers will start their own companies  and or they'll become affiliated with SpaceX or one of the other private companies.  And I think, you know, you're going to start to see when when there are layoffs  in Silicon Valley, those people just don't go live in a box under a bridge.  You know, they start their own companies.  And during layoffs, you actually have a lot of innovation happening.  And I think that's what's going to occur here.

Start time: 897.36
End time: 920.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's exciting. I think it's really exciting.  And but I just hope we don't stop.  Mark Millian, you're a young guy.  You don't remember as I do and Dwight does.  God, I'll never I mean, I grew I got up every  middle of the night to watch first Mercury, then Gemini, then Apollo.  I'll never forget.  I'm sure you remember this vividly, Dwight, watching Neil Armstrong walk on the moon.

Start time: 920.38
End time: 937.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I sat in front of my parents' television set with a little  Iowa reel to reel tape recorder holding a microphone up to the speaker.  And I still have those tapes of Walter Cronkite, like wiping wiping a tear from his eye.  Unbelievable. Yeah, it was astounding.

Start time: 938.34
End time: 946.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You watched on YouTube?  That's the that's the that's the there you go.  So it must excite your generation to Mark.

Start time: 947.06
End time: 1007.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah, I mean, I'm actually not much of a space guy myself,  although I know a lot of people my age are, you know, huge Star Trek and Star Wars fans,  which which have to have some correlation to being interested in space.  I mean, from a further off perspective,  I agree with, you know, Ben and and pretty much everyone else on the panel,  that it seems like space exploration is at a time where the private sector can take it over.  And I think that's kind of been the job of the federal government to shuttle a technology.  No, no pun intended to shuttle a technology, you know, to a certain extent,  like they did with DARP and that before it became, you know, this privatized thing  at the as the Internet or with GPS.  I think they I think space is at a time where NASA can now focus on deep space exploration  and they can leave it up to private corporations to figure out, you know, moon bases and all that stuff.

Start time: 1008.16
End time: 1033.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know why, but I'm just skeptical that that private enterprise is going to be able to do this.  It just feels like something a government or maybe even better multinational governments should do.  I hate for here's one thing I'd hate.  I don't want to see a space station with corporate logos on it.  I don't want to see our future in space become commercial.  Isn't that the risk of doing something like this, Ben?

Start time: 1035.72
End time: 1054.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the problem is that's how the economy turns and how the economy goes.  That's how you fund a lot of the technologies.  That's how we fund our medicine. That's how we fund.  It's worked so well with big pharma, hasn't it?  You get the pros and cons. I agree.  But it's better than not going into space at all.  Well, I agree. I hope we do go into space.

Start time: 1054.06
End time: 1061.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It just feels like this is something that should be supported by multinational effort.  But I guess the ISS is not a huge success.  What do you think, Ray?

Start time: 1062.92
End time: 1100.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I grew up purely with the shuttle program.  So I was very you didn't get Gemini and no, no.  I remember when the shuttle flew over my school in the early 80s.  Wow.  Which was a treat. I've never seen a launch.  But I've watched pretty much every single one that I could on TV and on the Internet when that became available.  So I have a strong connection to the shuttle program.  But I really hope that we do progress and do something more, because it really feels like it's been stagnant for 10 years.  We've done all the science experiments multiple times.  We need to do something else.

Start time: 1101.00
End time: 1113.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Part of the problem is there's no competition.  I mean, the reason for the original space race was the competition.  We're trying to beat the Ruskies.  Yeah. And you don't you don't have anything like that right now.  Maybe there will be something like that in a couple of years.  It's competition breeds innovation.

Start time: 1113.84
End time: 1133.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was great. We about a month ago, we heard JFK's the tapes from JXK's office talking about the space program.  And it was very clear that for JFK, it was theater.  It wasn't about science. It was about beating the Soviets.  He said, I want to make sure that the money I'm spending here is going to we're going to beat them, right?  Because it was otherwise no point from his point of view, which is a shame.

Start time: 1133.16
End time: 1148.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He also made it that it had to be completed within his term.  Yeah, not four or five terms, which both cases are political.  But such short timelines, you know, drives innovation as well.

Start time: 1148.48
End time: 1157.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Well, I think we all agree that we want more space exploration, maybe not necessarily manned.  I mean, the truth of it is the science is probably better done by unmanned missions. Yes.

Transcript:  Yeah, I think it may not. It may not happen as soon as that.  You know, I think one of the interesting things about the commercial the idea of commercial space exploration is that governments,  you know, while you can raise a lot of money, governments still have a lot more money.  They can guarantee that it's safer and to and to a certain extent, depending on the government, there is a chain of accountability.  The only accountability you have in the private sector is to the shareholders and to profit.  And without much motivation for profit, I don't know how far or how deep the the bench is for private space endeavor.

So by ticket, they're also talking about doing some supply missions to the to the space station.  And that's kind of interesting, I think.  But I don't see somebody like SpaceX, you know, ten years from now establishing moon bases that will then used to go to Mars.  I just they just don't seem to be that sophisticated or have that kind of financial depth.  There's not enough profit in it. Right. Right.

Transcript:  Well, and I think that's the thing. I think among us, it's pretty clear to us that there's emotional and, you know,  benefit, that there's societal benefit, there's scientific huge scientific benefit.  It's pretty obvious. It's just hard to get.  Unfortunately, it's hard to get government that's struggling with, you know,  unemployment rate of nine point two percent and financial huge deficits to suspend even twenty billion dollars on a space program.  And and that's unfortunate.  I guess all we can do is lobby for it and encourage private sector to to to do what they can as well.  But I'm with you. I don't think, Dwight, that the private sector ultimately,  they're going to operate for profit and it ultimately doesn't necessarily match our interest as a society.  I know NASA is going to go on. I just hope that they continue to go to the Mars and and on and on.  I was glad you know, Asteroid. There's some good stuff on those asteroids.

They click the link and literally 30 seconds later you're in.  You're working on it. You're fixing the problem.  And from then on, unattended support is available.  Frost and Sullivan, who it's an analyst group that analyzes this sector  called to go to assist express the worldwide market leader in remote support.  I don't know why they put this in the copy.

It's very simple. If you visit the website, Geo, Tio, assist dot com slash  Twit 30 days free.  If you're in support or even if just mom and dad needs some help,  30 days free should be enough to fix their problem.  Go to assist dot com slash Twit.

But for some reason, the tech community is just fallen in love with this thing.  You use it, Ben. What do you what do you think?  What is this? Is it the user interface? What is it?  I have a theory, but I'm going to I'm going to let you speak first.

Start time: 1941.12

Transcript:  And, you know, this the current market that's on Google Plus right now is not,  you know, it's not normal.  And that that's the market that Google has to win if it actually wants to be  competitive in the social networking space.  Otherwise, it's going to be friend feed. Right.

Start time: 1968.28
End time: 1969.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 1969.50

Start time: 1973.78

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 1977.56
End time: 2003.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't like Buzz because I felt like it was forced on me.  Well, it kind of was on my email.  Grafting it on the email was, I think, a really bad idea.  Email is email.  And it just didn't, you know, I didn't want it.  And I can't make up my mind about Google Plus.  It feels really friend feedy.  And I think that's because of who's there at the moment.  Well, you know, the big difference.  It doesn't show me anything that is different from from Facebook.

Start time: 2003.40
End time: 2017.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it isn't a friend feed because you can't pipe your other stuff into it,  which was the thing that was the seminal feature of friend feed all along,  was that you'd pipe your Twitter and I think that's what I think is what killed  both friend feed and buzz is they became aggregators. Right.

Start time: 2018.00
End time: 2045.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so every happens with what happens with social networks, I think.  I think that piping one thing to the next  generally doesn't work because you lose context.  The kind of things that you say on Twitter,  when I see them piped into Facebook and see kind of the responses,  they're like disjointed. It doesn't quite match.  And and I think I'm glad that Google Google Plus is not doing that.  But because all of these are native Google, Google Plus posts.

Start time: 2046.44
End time: 2049.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you don't see people posting it.  And that's that is a difference.

Start time: 2050.14
End time: 2059.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Big the big difference. The other big one is that, I mean,  the reason they called it just plus is because they just want to make it  as an addition to Google, as everything on Google is Google Plus.

Start time: 2060.30
End time: 2067.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't you think that's going to change when they release the API  that we're going to see the, you know, tweet to Google Plus?  Well, that's a good question.

Start time: 2075.36
End time: 2082.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I think they probably shouldn't be focusing on like  importing other feeds in.  Like I said, that they won't.

Start time: 2082.80
End time: 2087.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But as soon as they have the API, other than other going to.  And then it's going to screw up. Yeah, you're right.

Start time: 2088.28
End time: 2115.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because that's the first thing I'll do is I'll say,  how can I get my Twitter feed into Google Plus?  Or should I say, how can I get my Google Plus feed into my Twitter?  I think Google would prefer that.  That would be a better way to go, wouldn't it? Oh, yeah.  But so if you make a good enough UI  and make people and which is very sticky right now, it's obvious.  Keep it very sticky.  Keep people living in Google Plus and don't take stuff in,  but only allow porting out.  Doesn't that work to?

Start time: 2116.10
End time: 2126.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Haven't you seen the the Facebook post inside of Twitter  where they're, you know, they stop mid sentence and then there's a link  and you never follow them?  Yeah, you're right.  Or you unfollow those people? Yeah, you're right. So yeah.

Start time: 2127.56
End time: 2181.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the point about social networks not working with each other.  I think, you know, Twitter is best in its hundred and forty character  native state.  Facebook is best in its native state.  And I I hope that Google Google Plus Google Plus  does not do does not allow  importing of other social networks.  I think that'll that'll mess it up.  But on the other hand, you know, I've I've watched as a lot of people  who aren't techies go into it.  A lot of the readers of my column have gone.  What do they think?  I don't know.  A lot of them are looking at it going,  what's different here?  You know, why do I need to leave Facebook?  It's just one less. Yeah.  They kind of see don't see a why yet.  And that's for for those who aren't interested in social media,  for social media's sake.  They don't quite see the why should I be here yet?  That's crucial.

And we'll give it out to everybody.  They were just kidding.  They ran out of disk space in the service that keeps track of notifications.  So they spent the notifications over and over again.  What is it?  What if they had like a two terabyte drive and they ran out?  That is the weirdest bug I have ever heard.  Maybe they just did that so that they could brag about it.  We ran out of disk space.  That's to me, that's the highlight of Google Plus in the first three weeks.  Right there.  We actually did ask on Google Plus.  We might do this more for your suggestions for stories we should cover on the show.  And we're going to get to we picked one that was not in our list  that we'll cover in just a second.  That's one of the uses of this.  I've been doing hangouts.  That's been fun.  But after a while, it's like, OK, I got a big deal.  Mm hmm.

Transcript:  You were going out. It's really is the competitive advantage.  I mean, that's something that very few other services are doing  and no mainstream services are doing.  I mean, Facebook just the week after they launched, plus was, you know, racing  to catch up with this Skype feature they've been working on for about a year.  But, you know, that can only do one on one.  Hangouts is up to what is it?  Ten people.  But I think Dwight was on to something when, you know, he's saying social networks  aren't interoperable, you don't want to push your Twitter to Facebook and vice versa.  And putting them into buckets, I use Facebook for people I know in real life  and then Twitter for more work type stuff.  And I haven't figured out where plus fits into the whole, you know, world of that.

Transcript:  I think you're not alone.  So Facebook did have an awesome announcement.  Well, kind of. So you were there, Ben, sort of an us.  Kind of. Well, it was kind of boring, actually.  This is the announcement they added.  Well, they did three things. They put group chat into chat.  They redesigned chat to accommodate that.  Those are the non announcements.  The big announcement was they've added video.  So let me see. I'm in chat right now. I see Becky Worley's name.  Let me start a video call to Becky Worley.  This is Skype built into Facebook.  And at first I kind of said, aha, yeah, we've had this in Yahoo Messenger,  MSN Messenger and Google Talk, MySpace, Tom Anderson on Google plus.  And we had that's in 2006.  But I have to say, remember, this is Facebook.  And in a way, what I just did is going to be a revelation  for a lot of Facebook users, the ability just to click a button  and start a Skype call with their family and friends.  Maybe this is a little more awesome than we give them credit for.  So let me record a message to Becky here.

Transcript:  Oh, never mind. Oh, well.  So maybe it's not that easy for grandma and grandpa.  Huh? No, I think that that's huge.  And I think it's big for Skype as they, you know, on the eve of their acquisition  by Microsoft. But I think even more important that  750 million people are now going to have a very trivial, simple, easy way  to call the grandkids, to call each other.  Don't you think that's that's pretty important, Mark?  I mean, I know you know how to use Skype.

Start time: 2429.98

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's it's way bigger than FaceTime.  I mean, Apple had said a year and a half ago or, you know, at least over a year ago  that they were going to open up FaceTime and they never did it.  I think they had thought they had the competitive advantage  and it never worked out. That's a really good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, video chat, I mean, all of these chat services are about  who can reach critical mass first. Right.  And when Apple first introduced FaceTime, I think they thought they had the  they they didn't they thought they were playing catch up.  And they said, we're going to open source this and we're going to let everybody use it.  We want this to be the video chat standard.  And they never did that because I think they saw FaceTime  as this competitive advantage.  People will buy Apple products to get this video chat service.  And I think Skype with Facebook kind of changes that they've all of a sudden  overnight reached this much greater audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's the same kind of exactly that.  Like, I mean, we're like, oh, it's not as pretty or as unique  or as cool as Google Hangouts.  But one on one video calling is important to a lot of people.  A lot of people aren't looking for just like 10 person video chats.  A lot. Most people are looking for one.

Transcript:  And why didn't FaceTime take off?  I mean, I know a lot of people who have iPhone fours.  I have an iPhone four and all of my family have iPhone fours and we don't use it.  And a lot of us are connected to Wi-Fi most of the time and we don't use it.  I don't think a lot of people do.  So will people use this as video, you know, for the masses is a little too intrusive?  Or is it that FaceTime is in its current incarnation is too clunky to use?  I mean, I'm curious as to what people think as to why it hasn't gotten more traction.

Start time: 2567.34
End time: 2592.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a theory on that.  And my basic theory and the statistics show that like teenagers and younger generation  are making less phone calls and they're making and they're doing more texting and texting is less intrusive.  You can respond to when you want to.  Phone call interrupts whatever you're doing.  You have to respond that type of thing.  And a video calls even more intrusive because you have to stop that.  But you also have to be holding the thing, looking at the camera rather than like you can't be doodling  on the side or something.

Transcript:  I have to say Facebook chat is intrusive.  Whenever I go to a Facebook page, 20 people try to chat with me and I just go, Oh God, I forgot to turn it off.  I mean, anything that interrupts you is intrusive.  Chat can be very intrusive.  Oh, so really, I think who's going to use this is kind of just it's going to be I want to see the grandkids.  I'll make an appointment with you.  I will call you tomorrow night.  Let's see the grandkids.  It's going to be more that, isn't it?  I hope so. That's a good use of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a lot easier.  Also, no Java or Flash.  It's Java.  You saw that recording was Flash.  Yeah.  So the input, I guess, for the recording of the message is Flash.  But the Skype part is a Java is a jar file  on the Mac and an exe file that loads a jar file on the PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 2702.66
End time: 2708.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it wasn't something they had done.  And then Microsoft came along after the fact.  That was kind of a trigger.

Start time: 2710.32
End time: 2733.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, they had been talking for a long time,  but Microsoft has a very deep, long time relationship with Facebook.  They're an investor in Facebook.  And I think Tony Bates said at the news conference that  I think it was the day of the announcement that Microsoft was buying Skype.  The Skype executives went down to Facebook,  met with Mark Zuckerberg to reaffirm that they're excited about this  partnership and they want to keep it moving.

Start time: 2734.64
End time: 2772.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And Mark Zuckerberg said that once we heard about this deal,  we had more confidence as if they didn't maybe have enough confidence in Skype  to begin with, but once they knew that Microsoft was involved, the servers and so  forth, you were great, Ben. You asked Mark Zuckerberg.  So what do you think of Google Plus?  Someone had to ask it. It was great.  I think you maybe I imagine it, but it felt like you got a round of applause.  I think you got a virtual round of applause.  Hope so. I don't know.  Well, we all this is the weird thing.  We all know that Mark Zuckerberg is the number one most followed person.  Not on Facebook, on Google Social Network.

End time: 2825.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, he did the dance, you know, dance, dance, but he did it so elegantly.  He's become much better at the dance.  But it was he essentially got to the point of like,  this is all just reforming our vision of the past five years of growing social  networks and layers in the next five years, which is using this social layer  that's been built to do amazing things like video chats and applications and all  those kind of things. Right.  So he danced around. He did it very diplomatically.

Start time: 2825.50
End time: 2852.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But who would be surprised?  I mean, the only difference is that on Google Plus, you can't be on there kind  of privately. But of course, it makes sense that Mark's going to check out  the competition. Don't you think that Larry and Sergey and Vic are on Facebook?  I mean, what they're all on Twitter.  I mean, what's the surprise here?  Right. Of course, he's on there.  What's the surprise to me, though, is how many people are following him.  Like you join Google Plus and you follow Mark Zuckerberg.  It's like that's what you do out of this entire list.

I'm bigger, but I'm growing  not as big as Mark, but I'm growing.  Take pills for that.  Leo. Great article.  Really? There's a great article in The New York Times  by Nick Bilton about Mark Zuckerberg.  Apparently, when he wants when he's got somebody he really wants to hire,  he says, let's take a walk and they walk through the parking lot at Facebook  and they go up to the mountain.  They go up a hiking trail to a hill that overlooks all of Silicon Valley.  And then he goes, see, there's Apple, there's Google.  How would you like to be a part of all this?  All this could be yours.  And then literally he says, I got the papers back at the office.  If you'd like to sign up.

In fact, another article in the New Yorker magazine about  Sheryl Sandberg, who's the C.  Is she the president?  CEO, chief operating officer of Facebook,  talking about  how, you know, how competitive it is.  And there was some some question about  her involvement in that, because, of course, she was a big wig at Google,  one of the first employees at Google.  And she in that article, a Googler not named says she's persona non grata at  Google because we feel she's stealing engineers.  She's using her inside knowledge.  They even said  she knows that it takes three weeks to get hired at Google.  The process.  So that's why Facebook's process is two weeks  because we want to give them the offer first.  Yeah, it's very, very competitive.

You're doing such a great job over there.  Thank you.  Really, really, really appreciate your showing up.  And race Likinski.  Nice to see you again.  See you.  Have some actual people in the studio today.  Before we continue on, let me mention our good friends at carbonites.com.  Talking about friends, carbonite is the way to back up.  I think about Francis Ford Coppola when I think about carbonite.  Great film director.  Twenty years of screenplays on his hard drive.  He was living in Argentina.  He was backing up to a second hard drive right next to his computer.  External drive plugged in thieves broke in.  They stole the computer. They stole his hard drive.  And this was I remember reading this story about a year ago.  Tragic.  He said that's 20 years worth of work. It's gone.  I had a backup, but it's gone.  When the worst happens, you're going to wish you had a backup off site.  That's so important in the cloud.  And this is what carbonite does.  Mac or PC.  You go to carbonite.com right now and use the offer code to it.  You'll be installing it for 15 days free.  Now immediately what happens is when you're not using your computer,  but you're online, it'll start just kind of backing up your data.  When it does that first full backup from then on, you just are always backed up.  It's not like I'll back up on Sunday. It's all the time.  You don't have to think about it.  You don't have to think about how much either, because it's unlimited backup  for every bit of your personal data on the internal drive.  You can't start plugging in drives, but on the internal drive.  And it's always there. You can even access it.  You don't have to wait for a disaster online.  It's cloud storage.  So you can log on to your carbonite account on any computer,  on their smartphone, Blackberry phone.  And there's your stuff.  It's all there waiting for you and so easy to restore.  Should the disaster happen or should you upgrade to a new computer?  You just log on to your carbonite account on the new computer, press restore,  and you're done. So try it free.  Use the offer code.  Twit carbonite dot com.  If you decide to buy  it's 59 dollars a year.  That's about 16 cents a day.  And what they're going to do is they're going to add an additional two months.  To your 12 month subscription.  If you use the offer code, twit.  These are great guys. You know, they just  you'll like this rate. They just they had off.  I think their support team was in India.  It was offshore outsourced support.  And they kept looking at the results and they finally said, you know,  we're going to move them back.  They just hired 150 people in Lewiston, Maine.  Nice to do all their support.  I do. I think that's really nice.  I'm nothing against if you're an Indian company, use Indian support people.  I'm not saying that nothing wrong with it.  But but if you're an American company, I think it's nice to use local people.  And they found that really people were  getting, frankly, better support from the people who really were right there.  So that's, I think, really great.  Carbonite dot com offer code twit.  And we really thank them for their support.  We have people, you know, we bought we've been selling these bricks.  A lot of our sponsors now are buying the logo bricks.  So when we have the the wall of honor in there,  isn't that pretty where that's going to be?  Yep.  And when you come in the lobby, you'll see it's right there.  I'll show you Ben after the show.  But we've got two rows of these logo bricks going all the way down there.

Such a dump. I don't think so.  And somebody somebody this is good.  Somebody said just said to me, you don't want logos on the ISS,  but you're going to have logos all over your building.  That's a good point.  If the government would like to support twit,  no, I don't want them to support twit at all.  So the Nortel patents,  I think we talked about this last week, they've gone not to Google, who bid for  them three point one four one five nine billion dollars, but they went to Apple  blackberries, Rim  and Microsoft.

I mean, they it looks like they haven't done a whole lot with the operating  system in the last couple of years, and I think they've lost a lot of their best  designers and a lot of their best engineers to Apple and Google and  the hotter companies in the mobile space and the transition from Palm to HP.  So, I mean, they they still make pretty  good hardware and they still make pretty good software, but it's not outstanding in  anyway. I think that HP putting WebOS on all its printers and  computers and then trying to  lease it out to other manufacturers could be an interesting play.  But it's it's going to take a while before they can do anything with that software.

They were talking about how it's iOS on top of Mac OS.  I was kind of thinking that sounds Frankenstein.  Yeah, it sounds like they've grafted something.  He used the phrase mission chaos.  Yeah. And it it it seems to me like that's  I saw some reference to it is like this could be Apple's Vista.  And I don't know that far, but it does sound like it's clunky,  like it like it's not seamless as it should be.  And but it could be also that that's because it's not yet on the software,  on the hardware that they envision it being on.  Imagine if you did have touch screen IMAX,  say, laid down when you wanted to use them like a touch screen.  It could be a lot more friendly then.  But I think if you're using the gestures on a touch pad and with a magic mouse,  I'm not sure that that sounds like it would work well.

This is Jesus Diaz writing another iOS aspect that has worked its way  in the lion is the graphical emulation of physical surfaces.  Now there's gross faux wood paneling and photo booth.  The address book is a real world, hard bound address book.  I call it a bloody pseudo calendar made of paper and leather.  The question is, why is Apple reproducing things that are obsolete already?

There's not much of like, you know, this is the Mac team and this will always be  the Mac team. Their engineers go back and forth between between products.  And I think they've shifted a lot of their resources to iOS.  So I just I think they're to an extent giving up on on doing big innovations  on the desktop just because iOS is becoming a giant part of their business.  And there's so much more to do there.

Transcript:  Isn't this in a way, though, what Microsoft's doing with Windows 8,  at least what we've seen of Windows 8,  it looks like they're gluing a tablet interface on top of an operating system.  This might be the thing.  I have to say, I think I bet you both these companies,  Apple and Microsoft, are desperately casting around to figure out,  well, what can you do to an operating system that's new and different?  We kind of got it down.  I mean, there's no real reason to change, is there?  Are we done?

Start time: 4275.04
End time: 4325.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, the real reason to put that Windows 8,  Windows Phone 7 type mosaic interface is because they're taking the desktop  windows and scaling it into tablet.  I mean, those changes are designed for the tablet devices that people are going to put out.  But they will appear on the desktop.  But they will appear on the desktop.  They'll appear on the desktop, and maybe it'll be good for Grandma,  who gets her cheap Windows netbook and she can see big tiles and figure out what everything is.  But those changes are really done for the tablet devices.  And Apple, they've gone the other way.  They've said our mobile OS, our OS for phones is also for tablets.  And it just doesn't really make a whole lot of sense to put all of that touch stuff  onto the desktop for the Mac.

But I don't raise this as a way of criticizing Microsoft,  but just wondering if maybe we're kind of  casting around for something new, some idea, because operating systems are kind of...  I mean, the iPad, that's the new idea.  The iPhone, the touch screen, that's the new idea.  The desktop, I don't know if there's anything more to say about it.  Is there?

They need to figure out, you know, if it's a truck and it's going to lose its  mainstream significance, but still be important to a small sec, then don't  drastically change things like what they did with Final Cut Pro X.

That's a good they came up with one that was actually  something probably I wouldn't have heard about.  And I'm really grateful.  So we think let me get the name so I can tell you who thought this one up.  Jamie Dimon on G plus  for pointing to this Ars Technica article that kind of stunned me.  Major ISPs agreed to six strikes copyright enforcement plan.  Now we've heard about the three strikes plan that was proposed by ACTA and  adopted in France and some other countries where you have three unproven  strikes against you for piracy, they'll kick you off the Internet.  Well, AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, Cablevision  and Time Warner have just signed on to a voluntary agreement with  the movie and music industry to crack down on infringers  after six strikes.

It's a good thing I checked my eyes.  Yeah.  And by the way, if it were content theft, that would be wrong  and a violation of our published policies and that consequences could result  from any such conduct.  They will also direct you to educational resources.  In other words, that crappy tree, my happy tree friends.  Anyway, then the second alert, if it  persists, the subscriber may get a second alert, which will underscore the educational

End time: 4769.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If the subscriber account again, this is third strike now, again  appears to have been used for content theft, you'll receive another alert.  However, this alert will provide a conspicuous measure, a mechanism such as a  click through pop up notice landing page or something like that, asking you to say,  I got that, I got it.

Start time: 4769.88

Start time: 4796.26
End time: 4810.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hope they don't send this to like my  if I was doing this and of course I don't.  But if if I was doing this and they were to say send it to my ISP email address,  which I never use and a lot of people don't use, I would never see these.

Start time: 4811.34
End time: 4872.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So OK, by by alert five, they can do the mitigation.  Now, here's the mitigation measures,  for instance, not limited to but including temporary reduction of Internet speed,  redirection to a landing page that says you can't use the Internet until you call us.  You've been called to the office  to discuss the matter or reviews in response to some educational information  about copyright. ISPs are not obliged to oppose mitigation measures,  which would disable or be reasonably likely to disable the subscribers voice,  telephone service, email account or any.  This is a problem.  You can't cut somebody off of the Internet because you've been selling them  Internet based phone service for the past six years  or health service, such as home security or medical monitoring.  You can the ISP can waive it could say no, no.  Sixth alert, whether or not the ISP has previously waived the mitigation measure,  if the subscribers account again appears to be used for content theft,  the ISP will send another alert

Start time: 4972.36
End time: 4994.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's it's got a nice design and  it actually rivals the song catalog.  But obviously, the biggest competitive  advantage is that it's going to be free up front.  You go to any college campus and the way  that they're listening to music is they're firing up YouTube and typing in each  song at a party. What's wrong with that?

Start time: 4994.28
End time: 4995.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. You get the video and the music and it's free.

Start time: 4997.42
End time: 5014.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. But you can't do playlists easily with that.  And it's just not a very good experience.  So Spotify is free and it's a better  experience, which is why it's taken off massively in Europe.  And I think it has a pretty good chance to take off here.

Start time: 5084.46
End time: 5090.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 5090.44
End time: 5116.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not legal.  No, they don't have any license agreements or anything.  They have venture capital.  They're going to have a long road ahead of them.  I mean, Spotify has been negotiating to get to the US for over a year and a half.  And they've had to sell people on their business model, sell all the record labels,  put money up front in order to get the agreement signed.  Turntable is cool, but I would be curious about how long it lasts.

Start time: 5116.92
End time: 5123.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 5128.66
End time: 5143.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I feel if you haven't used it is there's five turntables.  The first five people who jump on the  turntable get to choose the songs one after the other.  There's chat.  Somebody told me that no matter what, it all ends up being a dubstep.  I don't know if that's true.

Start time: 5143.64
End time: 5160.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The thing I like is I believe they have  an agreement with one publisher to get a small catalog, but they don't have any  of the label agreements, any of the major publishing agreements.  So the legality is very gray.

Start time: 5161.74
End time: 5166.82

Start time: 5176.82
End time: 5201.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, I have to think there's a chance for this to monetize because look what happens  when you hover over the title, you can add song to Amazon, iTunes,  Last FM, Spotify or RDO.  So you can you know, I could buy this song, I presume, if I click that link.  I think that I don't know, shouldn't the record industry embrace this as  a great way to discuss music discovery service?

Start time: 5202.24
End time: 5249.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're using music in the cloud that you upload and you are  have a you want to share it socially, I think it might be really interesting  that to see somebody like Google or even Apple do something like this.  I mean, you could do this already got the music, right?  Because they have the music.  Amazon could do it, too.  And they and well, Amazon and Google don't have the licensing agreements as  you know, when they when they started their locker services, they didn't get  that didn't get that those deals nailed down.  But they certainly have a better relationship with the with the music  business and Apple has the best relationship, the music business.  And although they've they have punted badly with Ping, the interesting to see if  what if they did something like this with Ping, if they turned it into a DJ service?

Start time: 5311.24
End time: 5340.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The reason that Pandora has reached such a much more massive audience than those  services and the reason that Turntable FM is growing at a very high rate.  And the reason I think that Spotify is  going to do very well is because they all offer compelling services for free.  And that's how people start telling other people about them, the social features.  You can actually use them because odds are that other people will have access to it.  And Spotify is going to have a very close relationship with Facebook.

Start time: 5341.26
End time: 5353.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that was what we part thought we'd be part of this awesome announcement is  that they do Spotify, they didn't use and then I'm hearing a rumor  may be encouraged by the Ardeo people that it's not Spotify, that it's Ardeo.  So, you know, it's Spotify.

Start time: 5354.74
End time: 5379.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, they have been working together on Ardeo, not somebody else.  I wouldn't be surprised if Ardeo is part of the music service as well.  I mean, Facebook has, you know,  their position is that they want to encourage as many music services.  And if they do it for movies, as many different video services.  As possible. They don't want to just  partner up with one from what I hear is the standard Facebook model.

Start time: 5380.06

End time: 5452.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I think they'll probably partner up with a number of them and make Facebook  the hub for social music, and I think Spotify probably has a better  chance than Ardeo or Mog for being the most listened or iTunes, for that matter,  being the most well, service on there just because.

I follow people and then and so forth.  But before Facebook could just clobber this out of the park.  And you're right, they don't have to do any deals at all, Mark.  They just have to pick a partner or two or three or four.

They, you know, the labels thought they had audacious terms and they they wanted  way too much from something that might hinder the label business model.  But Sean Parker is involved, Napster.  Daniel Eck, the CEO of Spotify, was also the CEO of some like bit torrenting  software company.  So, I mean, these were the guys that were just that's so funny.  Bringing down the music industry.

But a lot of people believe a lot of experts say that they were using  something called pre texting, which is illegal in the US fairly recently.  And many countries where you call up a phone company and pretend to be the person  on the account, say, like, oh, I forgot my voicemail password.  Can you help me reset it?  And they ask you a few security questions.  If it's a celebrity, if it's someone in the royal family or,  you know, they they were believed to have hacked into all kinds of.

They know where to go to the corner.  And they say, here's the phone.  You make 150 bucks if you pulled the battery, because that way all that it's  not the phone, it's the data on the phone.  That way the phone can't be erased ahead of time.  So, I mean, this obviously this is this we're just I'm just waiting for the big  attack on the smartphones. I don't know why we haven't seen it.

It's like, I don't want to invoice your wife does the invoicing, doesn't she?  Right. No, no.  You do it. No, you're an employee now.  You don't have to do it anymore.  Yeah, I don't.  That's one way to solve it.  The other way is to go to FreshBooks.com.  Focus on your work, not your paperwork.  FreshBooks is so awesome.  You upload your logo.  They create these great looking professional invoices, which you email to your client.  The invoice has a button that says,  would you like to pay now via credit card PayPal authorized net?  It is I mean, you get paid faster.  You're more likely to get paid because of that.  You can easily create invoices that are automatic payment.  That's automatic.  Even if your client agrees to that follow up is very straightforward.  You could say every 30, 60, 90 days, maybe make sure if I don't get paid,  we get a follow up.  It just couldn't be slicker.  Even if you do time and hours, they've got this great iPhone app or a web  based app that you can just track your hours and then  put it right into the invoice.  Well, I just love this system.  It's free for the first three.  That's the other thing that's great about it.  If you have three or fewer clients, it won't cost you a penny.  Just go to FreshBooks.com.  Over two million people have sent and paid invoices via FreshBooks  since it started in 2004.  And if you decide you want to use it and you have more than three clients,  twenty dollars a month for twenty five clients,  thirty dollars a month for unlimited clients.  It's a really great deal.
