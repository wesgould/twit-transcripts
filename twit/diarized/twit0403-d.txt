Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Some guy you've never really heard of.  He's kind of obscure.  He's a UK personality called Ricky Gervais.

Start time: 184.14
End time: 196.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's going to be huge I think because I watched it and I just wish he'd do more because he seems to be a very funny fellow.  Seems to be.  Yeah.  I think maybe he's one to watch.  Yeah, he's an up-and-comer as they say.

Start time: 197.99
End time: 204.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  So we have a new YouTube channel with Ricky Gervais and it's youtube.com slash Ricky Gervais as you might guess.

Start time: 205.44
End time: 220.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or Plumplard.  Or Plumplard.  It's supposed to be Plumplard.  Plumplard.  So what's really interesting is not only is it Ricky Gervais doing some great stuff on YouTube, but it's Ricky Gervais as David Brent the character he created for the UK office.

Start time: 221.70
End time: 226.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so David Brent was like the original Michael Scott.  Oh, worse.  Worse.

Start time: 226.22
End time: 228.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Smarmy as hell.  He was like the king of it.

Start time: 228.78
End time: 264.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and he was also kind of an idiot, but not really in a kind of self-knowledgeable way.  And so Ricky said he would never do David Brent once he finished the office in the UK, but you know, we managed to convince him to bring it back and he's got this kind of crazy.  It's like 10 years on from the office.  What's David Brent doing now?  He's still doing the repping.  He's so horrible.  Sip Company and he's trying to like, he's signing with these like, you know, black rappers and these kind of crazy ethnic artists.  He keeps trying to put himself in the music videos.  Oh, I love him.  It's a bit cringeworthy and awkward.

Start time: 264.58
End time: 278.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love him.  Oh my gosh.  I'm so glad you got him back.  So that's good.  You're doing pretty well there, Will Harris.  You've become a promoter.  Like, you're the next Richard Branson.

Start time: 304.40
End time: 308.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, it's weird though, because usually you don't make Hawaiian shirts out of flannel.  That's kind of an unusual.  Yeah, I know.

End time: 318.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a little hot.  It's flannel.  That's actually rayon.  Oh, that's rayon that feels like flannel.  I don't know how they made it this way, but it's like thick Chinese style rayon.  I love it.

Start time: 319.27
End time: 347.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, the week is here.  You wrote, John, a great antidote.  Robert Scoble has been wearing Google Glass for two weeks.  He's polluted every social media stream I subscribe to with bad pictures through glass, all tagged with through glass.  And he's given his review.  He basically says it comes down to price.  You, on the other hand, pose a very interesting question.  Is Google Glass a world class hoax?  Yeah, hoax.  Why is it?  Why do you say that?

Start time: 347.34
End time: 377.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you read the column.  It's a PC magazine last Friday.  Check it out.  Read it because I got all the details in there.  Well, yeah, but for people who are watching this show,  Sergey Brin is a practical joker.  We know that.  Right.  He's the one with the glasses all the time.  Here's what triggered the whole thing.  A couple of things.  One was your grousing last show about Scoble getting glasses.  Well, he didn't have the same number, waiting list number you had.  Right.  And I started thinking about that.  And then when then during the week when when Eric Schmidt kind of backed off from even talking about it,

Start time: 377.92
End time: 379.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Eric said it's not going to be up till next year.

Start time: 380.06
End time: 382.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was backing away from the whole thing.  He didn't want to discuss it in any detail.

Start time: 383.14
End time: 387.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I started to say he can't maintain the joke.  The joke he's cracking under the strain.

Start time: 387.68
End time: 477.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, he is.  Come on.  That way.  And here's the other thing.  Here's what.  And that triggered one more thought, which was that I saw a presentation by Eric.  I think it was at the University of Washington where he was and it was on C-SPAN.  I wasn't at it and he was showing his PowerPoints and he at some point he says I have to be really careful with these  PowerPoints because the guys meaning Sergey and Paige get a hold of this thing and they put embarrassing slides up.  So when he's given his PowerPoint is all of a sudden a goatsie or something.  Oh, God.  Which, you know, just grosses everybody out.  And so I'm thinking, wait a minute.  This whole thing looks like a scam.  And here's one.  And so then I added the two other elements, which was that again, Scoble, who can be trusted to always like everything,  Scoble caught Sergey, if you remember, about a year and a half ago, roaming around somewhere with the glasses on.  He took a couple pictures as though it was candid.  He says, oh, look at this.  Sergey's got the glasses on.  And then like I guess about three or four months ago, Sergey supposedly is in the New York subway.  Yeah, that was focused.  A billionaire.  Yeah.  That can get drunk.  Right in the subway.  You know, he should have two limos.  He's on the subway.  He actually has two private jets.  Yeah, two sixty sevens.  And so he meanwhile, and they also have some some some other stuff.  Yeah, submarine hovercraft.  So they have so here he is in the subway and the guy who took his picture coincidentally is a wearable computer guy.  This is that was a little bogus.  This is looking like a setup just to I think it's out of control.

Start time: 478.20
End time: 481.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there's no question they're making them because people are wearing.

Start time: 481.30
End time: 490.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're going to take the joke.  Let's go for it.  Take it right to the your contention is they have no intent of selling these.  They may or may not sell them.  But whatever the case is, this is not going anywhere.

Start time: 490.92
End time: 495.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Robert Scoble says I will never live a day of my life from now on.

Start time: 495.42
End time: 503.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does he now this sounds like bogus without Google Glass.  See, this is all part of this.  This is a practical joke line because that's bull.

Start time: 506.08
End time: 511.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But people real real people have them right now.  Yes, it was a real people who's got him.

Start time: 512.12
End time: 514.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, I don't know any real people who have them.  Well, come on.

Start time: 514.44
End time: 518.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, who's got some developers have them, but it's mostly Google people right now.

Start time: 518.20
End time: 553.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google people are starting to open up a few journalists have them.  But what's interesting is I am I did last year we bought glass.  Yeah, you got and and I have the reservation, but I have not heard word one about the check cashed.  No, because they don't charge you until they.  Uh-huh.  I have lots of issues with glass, but I'm increasingly of the opinion that it's not just Google that's going to do this, that there are a lot of companies.  In fact, we've seen a number of companies say, yeah, we're working on something similar.  Wearable computing is the next big thing.  You've got to admit that John.  Maybe it's a watch.  Maybe it's glass.  Maybe it's a head.

Start time: 553.84
End time: 557.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The phone is pretty wearable.  I mean, I carry my pocket is kind of wearable.

Start time: 557.90
End time: 562.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tim Stevens of engadget has Google Glass.  Is he is he pulling a joke on?  I don't know.

Start time: 562.48
End time: 570.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think what do you do with the glasses?  You take pictures.  You have apparently that's all they do.  They take crappy pictures.  They are kind of crappy.

Start time: 571.02
End time: 580.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, they're not bad.  I find it amazing that the tear down on this thing looked like it was like 200 bucks worth of parts.  And they're selling these for like 1500 dollars.

Start time: 581.58
End time: 597.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  1500 bucks and Robert Robert makes the point and I think this is true.  We even asked this last week on Twitter.  Well, how much would you pay if this were a product?  And most people agreed that somewhere between 200 and 300 bucks is the most they would pay for this,  which is good because if it cost them 200 bucks to make that's about right.

Start time: 597.30
End time: 601.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, a regular pair of glass frames nowadays, decent ones.  Yeah, a couple of 300 maybe four.

Start time: 602.70
End time: 606.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you go to Oliver people's you get like the these are not that fancy glasses.

Start time: 606.66
End time: 614.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But but if you're going to pay 300 by the way,  I think there's a kind of have you seen these glasses that actually change the focal length and everything in in real time?

Start time: 615.12
End time: 616.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they never got those out.

Start time: 616.60
End time: 617.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I wonder why.

Start time: 617.50
End time: 654.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they never were able.  I talked to somebody who is an expert in the glass business.  You know, there's only really there's one company that like Sotica.  Yeah, like Sotica controls most of this stuff and I think artificially jerks the prices up.  Oh, yeah. Yeah, pretty much.  And they own, you know, a lot of the chains like they own Oakley and they do glass for Louis Vuitton and all the big brands.  They pretty much have it all.  And in fact, I think that this was the story I heard is they couldn't get that because this these guys who developed these  self-focusing glasses had either had a hard time making them.  We saw them at CES two years ago, right?  Or more likely couldn't crack the monopoly.

Start time: 655.46
End time: 660.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, whatever the case that Google's got the same issue, I'm sure and we'll see what happens.

Start time: 660.60
End time: 671.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I mean, they're not going to have the same issue, are they?  Because they're not actual glasses and as far as I'm aware, you can't actually wear Google Glass with glasses.  This is part of the problem because you and I wear glasses.

Start time: 671.40
End time: 672.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a bit of a problem for me.

Start time: 672.70
End time: 704.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Most people wear glasses.  Yeah.  Or they have contacts.  Well, anyway, people go to that column is PC mag dot com.  It's last Friday.  I've got all the documents.  Late employee.  I got it.  No, you come on.  I mean, really believe that.  Yeah, I'm totally sincere.  You can't write a column like this and not nail it.  If you're not, if you don't have the conviction, the courage of your conviction, I have.  I don't see any evidence that there's not a hoax and it's always Sergey Sergey Sergey.  I mean, he's the hoax.  You know, Larry doesn't talk about at all.  No, he never talks about it.  And you don't see him wearing it.

Start time: 704.80
End time: 707.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The CEO of Google is like it's like they don't exist.

Start time: 707.48
End time: 711.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they're saying, OK, Sergey, do your thing, whatever.  We'll see what happens.  But it could be bad.

Start time: 714.10
End time: 732.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we've talked before many times about the issues with Google Glass.  It's interesting as the as the general public learns about it.  I get a lot of calls on the radio show.  We were talking about privacy.  What happens if you wear Google Glass into a men's room?  Robert Scoble, by his own admission, at least 20 times walked into a men's room wearing a camera on his head.

Start time: 732.96
End time: 735.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that would be Robert Scoble.

Start time: 736.72
End time: 739.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, do we have any etiquette for this?  Do you take them off?

Start time: 739.72
End time: 743.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He also says he wears them in the shower.  He tweeted that today.  Yeah.

Start time: 743.94
End time: 747.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's something wrong with he is.  No, no, he is he is part of the scam.

Start time: 748.12
End time: 758.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's not part of the scam.  He doesn't have to be.  It's easy to get Robert to say, I like something.  You think he's a stooge is what you're saying.  That's a good word for it.  I love Robert Roberts and everybody likes Robert.

Start time: 758.90
End time: 765.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have nothing wrong with him.  Never said anything bad about anybody.  I'll give him credit for that.  But he's also never said anything bad about a product.

Start time: 765.40
End time: 769.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He says this is the most interesting new product since the iPhone and I don't say that lightly.

Start time: 770.72
End time: 772.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is that?  What is it?  Don't say it lightly.  What does that mean?

Start time: 773.72
End time: 791.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But look at the pictures he takes with it.  This was part of my problem.  Look at this thing.  Is that a cat?  Well, it's on your eyebrows.  So you don't you know, it's like.  I don't know.  I just to me.  I don't know if people are going to walk around with that thing on their head.

Start time: 792.80
End time: 795.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Curry has a lot of these pictures posted on glass holes.

Start time: 800.08
End time: 808.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So my I'd walk around with that thing.  I don't know.  I'd walk around with that thing on my head.  But if it was just like a smaller thing attached to a normal pair of glasses, you know, I think wearable.

Start time: 809.20
End time: 833.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think wearable computing is a completely legitimate category.  I think, you know, we all understand how the smartphone revolutionized the world.  The idea and this this seemed like impossible 10 years ago that you would have  Internet access everywhere you go at any time.  If you wanted to look up a fact, I'm not sitting in a movie theater and you say what movie was that guy in?  Well, that's got it in your hands.  Yeah, instantly.  That's a revolution.

Start time: 834.90
End time: 847.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At least 10 years ago, if not longer, they a lot of people that were that were in the business of not predicting, but the research  companies would all say it would happen.  So why why are you now saying it's a huge surprise?

Start time: 849.54
End time: 862.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just because how many things have they said would have you know, flying cars to talking computers?  We thought a lot of things would happen.  This one really did and not only that and this is probably more to the point.  It really did change things considerably.  I think I agree with the change.

Start time: 862.74
End time: 883.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This like there's nothing's going to be the same with in terms of that.  And so the next that doesn't mean you need something, you know, in front of your eyeball.  You look like a Borg walking around like a complete crazed maniac.  It's bad enough.  You know the number of things have changed you.  You never saw in the past.  I've always thought about this one is people standing around holding an object way in front of them taking pictures.

Start time: 883.44
End time: 884.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you mean the iPad?

Start time: 884.98
End time: 902.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the iPad or the phone and our new cameras and right nowadays, you don't have a nobody's ever doing this anymore.  They're always doing this and the other thing is people standing around at airports train station every place else leaning somewhere with this  with this looking like this right a phone to their ear, which you've never seen.  You know, you wouldn't have seen well, it's 20 years ago.

Start time: 902.54
End time: 928.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I kind of wonder if we aren't really kind of all becoming badly addicted to this because I have I see a lot of people who cannot go five minutes without kind of pulling and I'm one of them.  It's like the Crackberry is really addictive and pulling out the phone and just I see people walking down you go out and petaluma watch people walk down the street 50% fully 50% will be looking at a phone even if they're walking with somebody right?  It's universal.  Is that good?  It is really crazy.

Start time: 928.62
End time: 978.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is that good?  Sometimes you know, I think I'm not sure it is but sometimes you stand, you know in an airport or stands, you know, the train station or something and if you just stop for a second and just look around like the number of people talking to each other is you know, less than 10% the number of people looking at something right or like tapping something is you know, maybe 60% of the number of people just kind of gazing blankly with something in their ears is like the other 40% like it's it is crazy.  It's this it's this complete step change and it's such a change that it makes me think that it's not inconceivable that in another 10 years time everybody would be sort of looking up into the right hand corner of their vision, you know, something completely surreal being projected onto them.  You know, it's not that much of a leap really is it?

Start time: 978.88
End time: 988.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think it is in social situations when you know, if I hang out with people and they're they have their phone in front of their faces that those are people I don't want to hang out with.

Start time: 988.70
End time: 1018.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you're you're a younger person you you grew up with this technology in your life from you know, early.  Since he was a baby.  Yeah, almost since you're a baby. What happens when your gen when you go out with people of your age and your generation? It looks like everybody takes out their phone and puts it on the table.  Is that the case?  It's pretty common.  Yeah.  How many and then half of them are checking into Foursquare as they're sitting down, right?  Or some variation.  Or some Foursquare or Facebook or somewhere.  Is then the etiquette to that's it leave it alone?

Start time: 1019.30
End time: 1027.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It depends.  I mean if you know you you'll have it on the table so you can check your messages and there are some people will you know check it periodically.  It's hard.

Start time: 1028.32
End time: 1031.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 1033.64
End time: 1048.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To an extent but you know, we've I think my generation is probably started to build up a tolerance to you know, glancing down and then ignoring it for the most part.  I think there are a lot of people who can you know, my age that can still engage in meaningful conversation without having something in front of their face.

Start time: 1050.40
End time: 1055.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe you're better at it than people in our generation who are still kind of enamored to the technology and go wow, this is great.

Start time: 1056.98

Look at Apple's clearly influenced by what's going on.  This is the newest iPhone 5 ad that just just came out a couple of days ago.  Play this here.  We're running around with our phones taking pictures at all times.  This is this is a response to that.  If you ask me to Google Glass, these are the things that were in the Google Glass ads in a way, right?  For those listening, it's just really people with their iPhones taking a lot of pictures.  Lots.  A lot of pictures.

Transcript:  I think one of the important points about glass, I think the point that Eric Schmidt was trying to make in his speech is that we'll have to develop social norms to use it.  I saw a tweet from Joe Hewitt, who designed the original Facebook app, who said, you know, glass isn't necessarily the evolution of the smartphone.  Maybe it's the evolution of the Bluetooth headset.  And I could see, you know, it being useful in certain scenarios, maybe hopefully not driving.  But, you know, when you're out running or doing something where you don't have your hands easily available, I can see that being useful.  But sightseeing would be fun.  But wearing it in, you know, when you're sitting down to dinner, I think is a little crazy.

Start time: 1286.89
End time: 1349.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I disagree.  I do not think it's the extension of Bluetooth.  I think it's a new way of thinking about computing.  It really is wearable computing.  And the more I think about it, the more I feel like this was this was the promise.  Remember the guy, the MIT guy who wore his camera?  No, he was wearing a computer all the time, many years ago.  And he was an early pioneer in wearable computing.  And it's a different experience.  If the computer is a heads up display, it's part of your sensorium at all times.  I like that word.  You like that word?  And I think that it's going to be a revolution equivalent to the smartphone revolution.  It's the next step in the smartphone revolution.  Scientific American had an article this week in which they talk about all the other companies that are working on this kind of thing.  Gartner says there are about a dozen companies with wearable products in the works, many almost ready.  So if it's a hoax, it's a theory is Steve Mann.  Yeah, he's had some interesting things to say about that.

Transcript:  He wrote an article saying glass, you know, you got one thing you got to watch out for is the brain adapts to what it's seeing.  Remember the he mentions this famous experiment where a guy wore upside down lenses within a day or two.  His eyes adjusted the fact that he was in fact seeing upside down and saw right side up once again because we in fact do see upside down.  So our brain adjusts and and he said, you know, your brain sooner than you think will adapt to glass and you may have all sorts of side effects that you don't anticipate when you take it off.  He said he often would get disoriented without his glasses on.

But there could be as many as 10 million smart glasses sold worldwide by 2016.  The key is going to be software.  Actually, this is from IMS research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They may be.  No, I think some people are doing this seriously.  I'm just saying the way it's being put the way Google's going about it looks like a hoax.  Right.  Got all the elements.  Got a checklist.  They do the fake publicity.  In fact, I remember the show recently where Sergey goes on says anyone holding and playing with it with an iPhone or mask is emasculating.  You should be wearing these very silly glasses.

Start time: 1518.00
End time: 1533.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's not emasculating at all.  I am excited about the idea of wearable technology.  What I do think that it is a very big challenge is how you how what is the user interface?  How is it going to work?  Are glasses the right way is a watch the right way?  Maybe there's some other way.

Transcript:  Who am I?  What am I doing here?  Hey, we got a new sponsor.  I'm really excited about this company.  A friend of mine, Dana Atkins, who started Squarespace, has started it.  It's called Some All.  And you, you knocked, you got it, Will Harris.  You said, is that an Excel nerd joke?  Kind of is.  The idea is, it kind of is.  The idea is we have a lot of data out there.  And from YouTube to Twitter to Google to PayPal to Amazon, for us, it's all of our downloads, our views.  Wouldn't it be amazing if there were a way to combine this and get insights from this data by click?  This is primarily, I think this is primarily a use for a business.  For us, it would be amazing to be able to combine views with social media campaigns, with posts,  see what our e-commerce is doing compared to websites.  Some All combines it all into a very smart dashboard that can extract information.  This has been around for a long time for big companies in a technology called business intelligence.  Companies like SAS make these amazing dashboards and companies can really see what's happening with the company  and look ahead to see what's going to happen.  This now is available to everybody free from SomeAll.com.  There's no fee.  I think they'll probably think about a freemium model at some point, but for the moment,  if you go to pricing at SomeAll.com, they say free.  That's the price. It doesn't cost you a thing.  This is an amazing, 25,000 companies are using SomeAll.  By the way, they do have a pricing plan, but it's free for now.  Choose your plan later because we don't, they're not charging.  Amazing what they're doing.  It's a little hard to describe, so here's what I would suggest.  Visit SomeAll.com and play with it.  This is the era of big data.  To figure out what's going on, these are all the services you can connect now.  And they're adding more.  By the way, this is not scraping these services.  They have partnerships with all these services.  So they're getting the numbers directly from the service through the API updated in real time.  So you can watch real time graphs of how things are going in your business,  get an idea of where they're going, get prognostication.  Currently, they have deals with Amazon, PayPal, eBay, Authorize.net, Google Analytics,  Google AdWords, Shopify, Bing, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.  More coming every single day.  It's just a fascinating business to me.

Like you have to go to one place to get data about your Twitter account,  and one place to get your Google Analytics, one place to get your YouTube Analytics.  They believe that to combine all of that and then do kind of cross analysis across all of them,  like that's ridiculously powerful.  And it's the sort of thing that really you had to pay like tens of gazillions of dollars for in the past.  So this is really staggering.  It's BI for the rest of us.

They can change your business and you can do it right now for free.  Sumall is the name of it.  S-U-M-A-L-L.  And I am...  We're starting to use it right now.  I'm very excited about this.

They're super excited about the platform.  Users are still spending more dollars per user on that platform  than any other mobile platform around.  That's why.  And I think everybody is...  There's a great headline I saw today, which was,  you know, Apple's next big product isn't hardware.  It's iOS 7.

Yeah, like Windows, Windows 8.  Windows 8 started it.  Windows 8 started it.  But you know, the reason they called it Metro is because they copied the  subway signs.  Where was it?

When he came back to Apple, he like cut all the employee charitable contributions, didn't do anything for charity.  Who? Oh, Jobs, yeah.  Jobs didn't.  Right, right.  And one of the first things that Tim Cook did when he came on as CEO was like reinstate company matching for charities and start doing all this stuff off his own back.  And it's kind of like a real mark of, I guess, the way that he sees corporate responsibility in a way that Jobs didn't quite.  And that's why Apple is over.

And if you're in business and you do a lot of mailing, you know,  I don't have to tell you, I don't say anymore.  That is a great thing.  The post office just slows you down.  Wouldn't it be cool if you could print postage on demand?  I'm not talking the postage meter.  Yeah, that's been around for a while, but you got to lease it.  It's expensive.  And guess what?  It runs out of postage.  You have to bring it to the post office.  No, I'm talking about never going to the post office again with Stamps.com.  Use your computer, your printer, print shipping labels with the postage on it.  Print right on envelopes, postage, return address, recipients address,  even your company logo, all in one fell swoop.  You can take those addresses right from your address book from QuickBooks.  If you use it for, you know, invoicing or mailers, maybe you maybe you sell,  you know, you do fulfillment eBay or Amazon or Etsy.  Stamps.com is great for that.  It'll take the address right from the website printed out.  They've got the great printer.  I got one right here.  This is this is their USB printer.  They have others as well, but this one I'm going to scale.  Did I say printer?  That's a scale.  There'll be nowhere for the paper to come out.  You're right.  This is thank you, Chad.  Scale for what?  Oh, for what?  Stamps, your postage.  So you put it's a USB scale.  You're right.  That's a good question.  That's a legitimate question.  Why do I need a scale?  I'm not cutting meat here.  No, but this you put this on your computer and then you plop the letter of the package on there  and Stamps says that is exactly I still get from companies.  Big companies postage do mailing.  That's just not it's not okay.  You don't want to do that to your customers and you never will again with stamps.com.  Even if any class of mail, even if you do international mail, they fill out the forms for you.  If you do priority or express mail, they got discounts.  You cannot get at the post office and even after you've got the package all looking pretty ready to go.  You've emailed the client the customer here, you know your package.  Here's the tracking number.  Even then you don't have to get up and go to the post office because stamps.com.  No problem.  Postage mail carriage comes and gets it.

And we, of course, they did it right after Mac Break Weekly.  Some say they're waiting for the stock market to close.  I think they're waiting for Mac Break Weekly to end.  But what we talked about at Mac Break Weekly is we did a little counseling because it seemed like everybody...  Stop it.  Everybody in the world...  That was my phone tinkling.  Everybody in the world was saying this is going to be it.  This is when everybody, the world is going to say it's over.  Apple's over.  But of course, you forget Apple is very smart.  They load the dice by lowering expectations.  So once again, they beat the analysts' predictions.  Analysts thought that Apple would have $41 billion in revenue.  They had $43.  And I think they sandbagged the analysts.  I think they tell them stuff to make them think it's going to be worse.  And then they come out with a bigger...  It's an old trick.  Yeah.  Well, Apple does it every time and it fools them every time.  Earnings of $10.  It's like Lucy and the football.  It is, isn't it?  Not again.  Oh, they did it again.  And $9.5 billion of profit.  Now, this was the thing people were worried about.  First year to year drop in profit in over 10 years.  18% drop in profit.  Is this significant?  Is it just a, you know, kind of partly a reflection of the maturity of the market?  Apple did sell 37.4 million iPhones.  19.5 million iPads.  That seems like a good number.  4 million Macs during the quarter.  5.6 million iPods.  iPods slowing way down, of course.  iPhone sales flat from a year ago.  iPad sales up from a year ago.  Up a lot from 11.8 million to 19.5 million.  And Mac sales flat, as I mentioned, iPod sales down.  The big issue for the stock market, besides the drop in profits for the first time,  or dropping profit growth for the first time, was the drop in margin.  Yeah, that's what hurt the stock.  You know, they had 47% margin last year at this time.  37% this year.

Start time: 3283.36
End time: 3323.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they did a really, really clever thing by saying, you know,  everybody was saying going into this,  the big issue is going to be Apple's margins going down.  It's going to be the fact that the stock is going to tank because its profits are going to be down year on year for the first time.  I think Apple really successfully completely changed the narrative.  They just said, okay, we know all this is going to happen.  We know our margins are down 10%.  What can we do?  They announced the biggest stock buyback in history and gave an extra $55 billion to investors.  And suddenly, all the financial headlines are, Apple does biggest stock buyback in history and gives $55 billion to investors.  Everybody forgets like the fact that they've dot 10% of their margins and the stock goes up.  Well, also, there'll be less shares outstanding.

Start time: 3323.20

But here, if you look at the graph, this line here,  which is really a sudden drop in stock value and then a sudden spike in stock value,  that's when they announced the results.  It's gone back down, but then climbed ever since.  And it's a pretty steady growth over the five days after the announcement.  It's not bad.  Looks like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Will I was going to say, you know, everyone keeps saying Apple's in this quiet period or Apple hasn't got any new products.  But if you look at, you know, the last two big projects had to the iPhone in January 2007, the iPad in April 2010, like that's three and a little bit years.  So we're not actually due another big Apple project for like another two or three to six months.  Right.  So I don't get this whole, you know, Apple Apple can't come up with another killer product.  Well, they do one about every three years.

Start time: 3538.50
End time: 3568.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are they do see one this year?  So I keep seeing a huge amount of conversation about the iPhone 5 having fingerprint read a 5s or whatever they call it.  The next iPhone having fingerprint reading and a bunch of information seeming to tie the fingerprint reading to Apple's passport wallet.  And some saying Apple's going to make a big play for identity this year that suddenly if you don't have an iPhone, you can't validate your identity.  You're out of luck.  And sorry, using Android can't buy anything here.

Transcript:  Right.  That would make sense.  I mean, they bought Authentic last year.  Fingerprint scanner.  Fingerprint technology company.  I think they were the biggest in that space.  So that would be a logical move for them.  I could see it being actually pretty cool in terms of security.  You know, there's a lot of talk now about two-step authentication.  I think, you know, having fingerprint technology tied to that somehow, you know, you have an app for Facebook that ties into fingerprinting.  So you have a secure login could be really interesting.

Transcript:  You know, before you know somebody else brought this up with me and I had to point out, I'm going to point it out again.  We had this this sort of authentication fad, I believe about 10 years ago to the point where I have a laptop at home.  I don't use it much, but it's got the little fingerprint thing on the laptop.  Yeah, Lenovo was doing that.  Yeah.  Well, Toshiba was doing it.  We use these at Bloomberg.

Transcript:  Oh, I swear to God, I read that somewhere.  Mike Elgin said the eye and iPhone will stand for identity.  This is a breakthrough feature.  He was writing in the cult of Mac and I like Mike a lot.  Do you think that this is, you know, it's an interesting point.  If you put fingerprint in and you put NFC in and then you use my Apple's wallet technology  and put your credit cards in there, suddenly that makes the iPhone a pretty useful tool.  And it beats in many ways unless Android phones start putting chips in.  The advantage Apple here is has is that the Android top of my iPhone just came out.  Is it died?  There's no power to it.  I think so.  I'm sorry.  Well, you don't need that.  It's just a computer.  Don't you have your smartphone with you?  Yet your Google Glass?

Elgin says it would be the beginning of a multi-device identity method that would allow you to access any of your iCloud content and settings on any enabled device.  Just like that Bloomberg terminal key.  You have to have that to access the Bloomberg terminal and to get in there and to get your email and all that.  Imagine that same thing, but it's on an iPhone.  I think that's actually pretty compelling.  Yeah, I mean, I say you break the iPhone.

Start time: 3806.60
End time: 3828.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not sure I agree with that.  Is it that compelling?  I mean, Apple doesn't really want you accessing all your Apple stuff that lives in iCloud or whatever from wherever you want.  They want you accessing it from your like your iPhone and your iPad that you always have with you.  So I'm not sure that they would really want to encourage you to be able to go and get all this stuff from everywhere.  They want it just in the devices that they're selling that they're making the money on.  Right.

Oh, state of the art.  And this did a lot of the things that a smartwatch might do.  It buzzes you when you get a text or an email.  Google Talk.

I'm on a real crackdown to not spend my whole life looking at my phone or not spend my whole life.  Like the second someone texts me or the second I get a little bing on my phone, not being like,  Oh God, what is it?  I have to check it right away.  I'm trying to discipline myself to check my email once an hour, right?  And turn off push notifications and try and live a little bit more in the moment.  That's kind of my sort of resolution at the moment.  And so the idea of like a watch that's just going to like bing me all the time.  Like I have a really nice watch.  I don't want some, pardon the language, but some crappy kind of plastic thing.  I'm with him.  Well, look at this.  It's in this state of the art.  It's got a rubber band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  So we do that so everybody's more focused on what they're doing.  And I don't spend all my time like replying to email as it comes in is really inefficient  because you know, in the time that you're writing an email,  like three other people have replied to the thread and either contributed or solved it or something else.  And so it's like just do it every hour.  You can blitz it.  The other thing that I did was get mailbox for the iPhone.  Yeah, like mailbox, yeah.  And I stopped using email on my desktop.  And now all the email I do is just mailbox on the iPhone once an hour  and then you don't get distracted by it when you're actually working on a computer.

Start time: 4084.92

Transcript:  But then...  On my other mega...  I've got another mega pro tip for you which you might enjoy, Leo.  Okay.  Which is I'm pretty sure I saw Kevin Rose put this on Twitter.  Which was that people don't mind really short or slightly rude or one word replies  if they come from your phone, like if they say sent from iPhone.  So I just tell everybody that I know just put on the bottom of your email client on your desktop  sent from my iPhone and then you can just send one word reply.

Start time: 4117.12

I think Kevin was the first to do this but I correspond with a number of people who have a signature  that mentions a site which is not coming up for me right now.  Two sentences.  Where it explains my email policy.  They usually say in their signature my my email policy is here.  And what it is is basically I will not respond with more than here's three sentences.  Email takes too long to respond resulting in continuous inbox.  Even the solution.  Treat all email responses like text messages.  And so my personal policy is three sentences or nothing.

Start time: 4181.20
End time: 4211.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you send that out?  I think it's rude.  You know what it reminds me of?  You can make it five sentences if you want more.  What it reminds me of is you send somebody an email, you know, you got their name and they say,  sorry out of the office reply auto reply.  And then they give you all this bull crap and they just sent you a note.  So you send it back to them and they're not really out of the office because they do answer.  And so they turned on vacation and left it on.  Or they don't want they're just being selective.  They're looking at everything but they're yeah, you know, I can deal with this later.  I don't like it.  Just don't answer.

Start time: 4905.74
End time: 4949.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I'll tell you one thing that has evolved on this when  you poke and it's not just me but Microsoft I think is going  to acknowledge is Mary Jo Foley on Windows Weekly and all  about Microsoft.com revealed her sources say that Windows  Blue the next generation of Windows 8.1 will not only have  a boot to desktop option eliminating the Metro screen,  but we'll have a start button now the verge but they won't  have the verge says here's a verge title Windows 8 one set  to bring back the start button.  May I make just a minor correction there never has been  a start button before the start menu is not coming back.  Yeah, that's what we want you type when you tap that button  where the start menu should be it brings you to the Metro  starting screen.  Well, that's dumb.

Start time: 4950.84
End time: 4955.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are they doing what people ask for or not because what people  wanted is like the Windows 7.  They want a menu.

Start time: 4957.68
End time: 4970.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is real.  I think people are I think Microsoft blew it by saying  we're bringing back the start button.  Yay, but it's not a start button.  It's not a start menu.  It's merely a button just a button that brings you to the  Metro interface when you tap it not now the point now when

Start time: 4970.70
End time: 4974.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  you want to get out of Metro they don't nobody wants Metro  right.

Start time: 4974.90
End time: 5022.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it's this going to boot to desktop is good.  They need the start menu not the start button and I think  that they're misleading people including apparently the verge  is a little confused that start but the only place there's  ever been a start button was a developer preview of Windows  8 and I don't think when Microsoft says we're bringing  back the start button.  They say you all love the developer preview so much that  we're bringing back the start button.  It's not a start button.  You're right.  It's not a start now you have what do you have on you?  Well, so I finally gave up.  This is a Windows 8 machine and I got so sick of the  freaking start screen that I this is a $5 utility called  start 8 that gives you exactly what you want, which is a  start menu.  I use classic shell classic shell does the same thing.  I like this you still you still have access to this.  Yeah, you still do all of this, but I don't think people  want to do all of that frankly.

Start time: 5022.78

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The other program I'm using is it's called modern the  modern mix is also from Starduck and then when I so for  instance, Twitter is a Metro app, which is normally full  screen got take over the whole computer when I run it here.  It runs it in a way.

Start time: 5050.32
End time: 5052.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 5053.94
End time: 5064.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no classic shell does not do that.  And so I highly recommend for 10 bucks.  You can make this look just like Windows 7.  Which is exactly what Microsoft does not want to say, right?

Start time: 5064.74

Although Mary Jo has such good sources.  I think it's probably accurate and others have confirmed  this Paul Therotte said so too.  It is a capitulation and a little at least in some regard.

Start time: 5094.40
End time: 5122.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, I wonder, you know whether they will change direction  further.  I mean, Stephen Sinovsky was the head of Windows who was  largely running this initiative to transition over to Metro  and to to really downplay the old interface now that he's  gone.  Though they pushed him out.  Yeah.  So, you know, it remains to be seen whether it that was a  result of the board, you know, not really believing in that  vision.  Any.

Start time: 5122.70
End time: 5130.66

Are they goofy?  Wrong?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  No, here's where I say that the Windows interface,  which really was invented by the Xerox star.  I'm so not the Windows interface, but the desktop  metaphor was invented in 1981.  Yeah, and then Lisa and Macintosh and all the rest  came along and then Microsoft was reinvigorated in 1995  when they adopted it to a to an extreme and made a big  hit out of Windows 95.  It's now been so established.  It's like having four wheels on a car and a steering wheel  on the left hand side or the right hand side depending  on what side of the road should drive on as opposed to  a steering wheel in the middle, which would be more  practical in both England and the United States because  you could all be driving the same kind of car except in  different lanes.  It doesn't make any sense that you're going to start  changing these these models of use that are now so well  established for like 30 years essentially from 81, let's  say to something crazy.  It doesn't just make zero sense to me.  And that's that's my argument.  I'm with you.

We've been saying that all along on Windows 8 and I think  that there is a little bit of an admission from Microsoft  little crack in the armor that maybe it isn't going all  that well.  Of course we saw the the results they didn't break down  Windows sales, but it's pretty clear that they did not have  a very good quarter.

I'm the curve.  Microsoft is dead.  Futures touch and tablet and what is Microsoft?  You know, Steve Balmer is the worst leader ever.  He's not getting Microsoft into you know, okay, I'll grant  you that and they go really aggressively for it.  And I think I mean they have gone obviously really aggressively  for it.  And I think you know, if they weren't doing that we'd be  criticizing them for the opposite thing.  So I think I don't think Microsoft is you know, everyone  is ranting on them at the moment for this problem with  you know, with Windows blue bringing back all this stuff  with surface or with Windows profits being down, but I also  think it's really worth noting that you know, last was it  last quarter was the worst ever quarter of PC sales for like  10 years down for Windows revenue Windows revenue was  flat.

They could have done so they did Windows 8 and they went  all what's the third way maybe make a good version of Windows  and sell that.
