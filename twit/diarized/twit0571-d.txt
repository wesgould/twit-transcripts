Have you guys ever seen anything on this scale of virality? I mean

Start time: 395.58
End time: 404.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right like everywhere I go when we're out and about playing it  There are definitely other people playing it. It's like it's not like oh, we're the only ones here

Start time: 405.86
End time: 452.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everywhere you go everywhere. I mean we've certainly seen big viral hits before right with with with with with games and with apps  But other than I mean, you know, just like almost a utility app and an Instagram or a Facebook or a snapchat  This is the first time I've seen a game do this and and certainly this quickly  I think this is is caught on even faster than any of the social networks  I talked about before I mean like like Tom like when I go out and I'm playing, you know in the streets in New York  I'm not alone and even the first day like it launched on a Wednesday night and that Thursday morning I was walking  To my subway stop and I was not the only one who had my phone out playing Pokemon go and this is like six hours  seven hours after it launched so  It's it's something I haven't I can't recall seeing anything this big this fast before

Start time: 453.54
End time: 474.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's great to see something with so many positive aspects to you know, people actually getting out walking around getting some exercise meeting each other  Teaming up to capture these things  I think it's you know, it's a great story  obviously some people are having a  Negative reaction because it is all over every era way possible at this point  But I think I think it's a great story that it's something that's actually getting people out and doing things and being sociable rather than just

Start time: 474.42
End time: 481.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We've had people cheering like hey Pokemon whoo like it's a positive thing for the different people that are playing it too when I walk downtown

Start time: 482.76
End time: 525.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And there you know if there's a lure set and that's the thing that attracts players because you can get more Pokemon faster there  If there's a lure set and you can see it  Especially if there's an area where there's several stops within an area that you can go there's a park over here  Nobody goes to remember Penry Park Tom up on the hill there with a cannon  Yeah, yeah, nobody goes there because it's up on a hit you have to climb stairs right to get to this postage  Damn park and it's not that interesting  but it has three pokey stops in the park all within reach of one another and  People set lures in all three and there's dozens of people  Up on this hill that never has anybody, but you know maybe a homeless guy. He's wondering what the hell is going on

Start time: 525.72
End time: 530.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's like he's like would you please let me just have some time to my house. What are you doing here and

Start time: 531.58
End time: 538.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But what there's friendly you go team red team yellow  There's friendly there it isn't I think it looks as you see people walk down the street a little bit antisocial

Start time: 538.68
End time: 592.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But there is a social component to it. Well. That's that this is this is what's so interesting to me  So the original Pokemon game if you think about it was pretty social in a virtual sense  You would take a link cable and connect your game where game boy color or whatever and you could trade Pokemon and battle that way  Right so there was definitely a social aspect even though you were obsessed with your screen with Pokemon go  It's almost the inverse whereas you can't do anything like you know we can say what team we're on  But I can't give you a Pokemon Leo. I can't battle soon. I understand that's coming  I understand that's coming, but you know but I can't do that right now instead what I can do is  If I run into Tim you know and we're in the neighborhood together we can talk and we both like oh, there's one over here  I found one over there, so it's a weird thing where you don't have the social aspect inside the game itself  But instead the entire outside world has strangely become a lot more social because we've all been kind of forced to  converse with one another I kind of love

Start time: 593.44
End time: 666.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Going to Friday evening. We went down into the big city Santa Rosa  It's a county seat you know and  I kind of it used to be in the old days on a warm summer night people would be out promenading  Walking around and then in the last ten years  It's just gotten pretty not so much kind of deserted people don't go out anymore  This it was like the old days there were all these people out of and different generations families  Admittedly they were all starting their phone  But they're but not you know so the question really is is what what is this phenomenon?  Here's a graph from Survey Monkey Intelligence  Peak daily active users it is already in less than two weeks the biggest US mobile game ever  Besting Candy Crush Saga draw something remember draw something that was over in a week  Yeah, as Zynga bottom and then  It died and they're like what Clash Royale which came out and slither.io which came out this year  Easily besting all of those the real question and and I think a lot of the naysayers say oh yeah two weeks  Pokemon who?  Don't know if that's the case. I think this has legs

Start time: 667.32
End time: 741.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah  I mean  I think if they can continue to add more Pokemon to it if they can continue to add  Features there's been reports that if you go into the code they're going to have sponsored gyms like they might have a partnership with McDonald's  So every McDonald's location is a gym if they do add in the social features like being able to you know  Battle one another and trade Pokemon with one another I think that could keep people engaged is it going to be this huge like viral?  Phenomenon forever where everybody is doing it no of course not  But I think that this more than maybe some other types of viral hits  We've seen has staying power provided they can continue to update the game get rid of the bugs  Continue to onboard new players because there's something simple about it. It's not a very you know like it's not a huge game  It's it's not that complex at all. It's really easy to do  There's not a lot of kind of overhead the gaming mechanics are really basic, but there's something really fun about it that  You know and not to mention the nostalgia factor for for a lot of us that I think  Will keep this enduring longer than than maybe you know the draw something's out there at least that's that's the hope I mean  It or at least me hopefully for Nintendo's sake you know that they can draw this out until the real Pokemon game comes out in  The fall and and and gets a you know that customer base really excited

Start time: 742.60
End time: 766.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Nintendo's bottom of it is you know it will definitely not stay at this new like  Everyone's interested in it level  But will they be able to sustain a certain number of people that will always be out in the parks?  And you'll always see the Pokemon go people or will it go more towards what ingress?  Became where it's like yeah, there's people playing it, but you don't really notice them Nintendo stock of course huge jumps does Nintendo

Start time: 768.10
End time: 772.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Benefit from this or didn't they sell the Pokemon property off to the Pokemon company they own

Start time: 774.42
End time: 778.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  33% I think of the Pokemon company is that right yeah Christina that is that's correct

Start time: 778.70
End time: 831.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they license I mean they own the Pokemon characters then the Pokemon company handles the licensing and Pokemon company of course then work with  Diane tech so they get some money from this game  I think what this really helps with them more than anything though is the fact that people are actually talking about Nintendo in a positive  Way, we're not being like okay at e3 we saw Zelda  And that was it and there's a console coming out that no one is really that excited about instead  We're all really stoked about the fact that you know a Nintendo property is actually doing gangbusters on a handheld and people like me  Thinking god you know how much better with this game be if not to take anything away from Niantic  But how much better with this be if this was like a fully robust?  Pokemon experience from Nintendo and not licensed and so makes that makes you kind of hope and cross your fingers and go please  Nintendo you know like seriously consider making you know mobile first games that are not  Dedicated solely to your console or handhelds

Start time: 834.68
End time: 930.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well that's the question is who benefits from this I mean Niantic  Is really taking a property ingress that it created and it's just skinned basically  ingress and  Made it much more appealing much more friendly and they benefit because ingress the players of ingress were the ones who established all these  Pokestops of Pokestops  Way back when it's interesting in Petaluma the places of interest the Pokestops are are mostly murals  Not so much buildings  They're weird is it the same there same yeah, and it's because of ingress right people  I don't understand how it happened the company  Started in 2010. It was called keyhole  John hanky mr.. Hanky. I like to call him formed it  And Google bought keyhole keyhole was satellite imagery and Google added the keyhole satellite imagery to Google Maps and  Google Earth  And I guess what happened is once they were internal at Google the engineers hanky and a couple of engineers  Created Niantic labs that was a Google company  Did field trip right remember that which was walking around and getting like messages about points of interest ingress  And ingress was kind of one of those cult hits it never broke out, but was can you still play it yeah?  But I think they learned a lot from ingress  Licensed the Pokemon characters and created Pokemon go does Google I would know Google spun it out  I wonder if Google yeah, Google spun it out. Do they probably though have significant a stake in it. Yeah, yeah

Start time: 931.66
End time: 937.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So Nintendo has a stake in one side Google has a stake in the other and Apple's getting 30% of all the end game transaction

Start time: 937.48
End time: 943.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, on IOS on iPhones everybody everybody's making money, but it's all run by the CIA if you listen to the conspiracy

Start time: 944.78
End time: 991.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So what are the privacy implications?  There was a misstep early on where you could use your Google account and most people did because the Pokemon  Trainer accounts were blocked like crazy because so many people were using it  So they sign up with Google and the way it was set up was incorrect and it gave them full Google permissions  Which is typically only given to browsers and operating systems  Right Niantic said that was a mistake they patched it  It's been patched all around it now does the normal kind of permissions that any game might do using the oauth features of Google  But there are still persist these concerns for instance people saying yeah all you're just handing your  continuous GPS coordinates over to  some strange  Company that might be handing it over to the CIA is there is there a privacy concern I?

Start time: 993.80
End time: 1004.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Don't think so personally I think people aren't really aware of how much of that data is already being tracked by me certainly if they're using  Any kind of navigation software in their phone already knows everywhere you are

Start time: 1004.84
End time: 1009.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google  Yeah, all you have to do is look at your Google dashboard you can see everywhere

Start time: 1009.78
End time: 1036.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You've been your location history unless you've disabled that right and anytime that Google predicts navigation for you and says hey  Are you trying to go here? I'll give you directions and obviously Google's already figured out that's where you live  They know where you're going before you even get there  Yeah, so this sort of thing certainly doesn't bother me  You know so long as users are getting something out of it and obviously you know people are having a good time with it  So that's fine. It's not a problem for me  I think that it's just something that people are still slowly getting around the idea that  The phones know a lot more about them than they think they do

Start time: 1036.98
End time: 1072.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I feel like the the key is always transparency as long as I know  That it's collecting data about me and in this case  I know that Pokemon go is collecting location data because it can't work otherwise and I know what they're gonna do with it  Then I have the right to either play the game or not  What was disturbing is that when you did log in with a Google account?  It didn't say would you like to get full permission it just signed you up and gave full permission  I'm still waiting for Google to explain how any authentication  Could ever give full permission even by accident without alerting the user that it was about to do so that's a good point

Start time: 1072.56
End time: 1132.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Totally and and I mean honestly that was a really big to me  That was I think the the reason that they had to patch it so quickly and came back with their response so quickly because that  Wasn't just a violation. I think that's technically a violation of Google's API's, you know  There's supposed to be a pop-up that says this is what you give and this is what it can do and in fact  That's now what the Google account login says it'll say we cannot access your account  but we can we know your email address and you know, we're  It's just like like Leo was saying a simple oop  But it didn't give you any of that before and I think that's a violation of Google's policies around using their login  It's certainly a violation of app store rules because the app store is very clear about at least on iOS saying, you know  And this is where the problem was was on the iOS side that if you're taking permission for some sort of other third-party login  You've got to display what's happening to the user and the fact that it wasn't is problematic and then it kind of makes you think  At least to me anyway  I'm going how many other apps are out there that are using Google tokens that don't show up the proper modal window  You know, it's but well you can find out it's easy enough

Start time: 1132.54
End time: 1153.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You go to your ex your account access and you could see in fact this the good  The good side of this is I think it brought a lot of people to that part of Google their page to see what apps had  Permissions what the permissions were and to turn off any apps that they didn't want to continue with those permissions  I of course, I really turned off my attic and I definitely found a couple myself. Yeah. Yeah

Start time: 1157.26
End time: 1161.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The app has not been around in years  Why is that still a permission to it with Twitter and Facebook too?

Start time: 1162.56
End time: 1179.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The single sign-on systems that's you know, you want to make sure you prune those periodically so there's a benefit I guess  To this point, you know the thing one thing that struck me is it's a shame Google didn't come up with this  Before Google glass fizzled out because glass would been the perfect  Perfect for Pokemon go

Start time: 1181.06
End time: 1202.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Totally already we've seen, you know  Somebody's got kind of like a demo setup of how it could work with HoloLens and obviously HoloLens isn't perfect for Pokemon  Go because you're kind of tethered to your device  But to me this just kind of proves that that eventually, you know, if not this particular game other types of games  Will be able to kind of take advantage of this stuff this sort of augmented reality kind of world. It's

Start time: 1203.82
End time: 1205.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  augmented reality, let's

Start time: 1206.34
End time: 1207.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 1207.62
End time: 1208.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  fulgmented reality

Start time: 1210.32
End time: 1235.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because and in fact most people probably by now have turned it off to save battery life and to make it easier to catch Pokemon  But it was cool and it you know what the smart thing was is spawn a million Instagram shots  Pokemon in your world  But and I also think there's a there is it is an icebreaker  It's gonna make people a little bit more comfortable the idea of technology in the real world and kind of an interface between  technology in your real environment

Start time: 1236.64
End time: 1253.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's this is what people will look back and say augmented reality broke through into public consciousness with Pokemon  Go because now you can say if someone says what's augmented reality you can say Pokemon Go and  Percentage of people will understand. Okay, I get it now and it makes us more comfortable with walking around

Start time: 1254.02
End time: 1261.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I guess we already were somewhat with maps, but maybe more so walking around  Integrate interacting with our real world using our device

Start time: 1262.70
End time: 1287.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I mean I think that the difference is between you know a mapping situation  It's a utility and so you're trying to find a place to go and so you can kind of you're not you know  There's you're not that self-conscious about it this as people are becoming less and less self-conscious about you know  The fact that like they're they've got their phone out and are looking for Pokemon in the middle of the world  I think will kind of lessen the stigma for future types of games like this

Start time: 1288.44
End time: 1310.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We were pulled over the side of the road at a pokestop  And just having fun watching people walking down the sidewalk looking at their phones and trying to say okay  Just on their phone or Pokemon right you could tell because they would stop and start you know spinning and catching Pokemon  You could absolutely tell yeah, but it's it's it made me aware of how many people just walk around looking at their phones  Who weren't playing anyway?

Start time: 1317.78
End time: 1356.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It feels like this is some somehow qualitatively as well as quantitatively different from anything we've ever seen before and  I just I it's hard to say what exactly it means for instance  You know we know now that  Self driving cars and uber and many of these vehicles that are mapping the world have all sorts of utility for the company that owns them  What can Google do or Niantic do it is because Google gets the data right?  This is the stack goes through Google so the the they're using Google code. They're using the maps  So this all the data is going through Google  What can they do with that I?

Start time: 1359.14
End time: 1382.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mean I guess they could you look at certain types of gathering patterns you know yeah  See what what type of what sorts of people are nearby what times will congregate you know what types of maybe even you know?  How people will move through things?  Yeah, I mean I would just think pattern data would be one of the things they could get and and probably I mean  But yeah

Start time: 1384.20
End time: 1405.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I was just gonna say it's it's a little bit clouded by its only data of people playing the game  Versus something like ways which is everybody who's driving so you can't really tell if if that is normal for that area  Or if that's just because it happens to have a gym, right?  But yeah  There's there's something there for sure in being able to tell population clusters and which stops and gyms get the most traffic

Start time: 1406.44
End time: 1417.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Etc and there of course the revenue opportunities as well when it comes to licensing these things and creating deals and you know  Getting some money off a drink if you're playing Pokemon go that kind of thing which which ultimately I think is where this is

Start time: 1417.56
End time: 1423.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is of course headed huge money in this this is they've just they haven't begun to tap the gold mine

Start time: 1423.74
End time: 1454.58

Transcript:  That is this game. Yeah, no, I mean the only only real challenge  I think they're gonna have is obviously kind of striking while the iron is still really hot because I  I'm not like some of the skeptics who think this is going to disappear overnight  I think that this is going to last longer, but they've got to start  You know turning on that monetization spigot  You know ASAP beyond just the in-app purchase stuff because  You know while you've got people engaged  Start start making the money don't don't fall into the trap of Zynga, you know and draw something  You know as you were kind of mentioning before and and and not you know taking advantage of it while while people are out there

Transcript:  Twitter probably Facebook and and that's been the case the last you know  Why a little while is it's been you know, the last election?  we saw this a lot to where you finally saw the older media partnering with the debates for with YouTube and Twitter and Facebook and  And now we're seeing more and more that and obviously now we have the live video component that we didn't really have with those  infrastructures before where you can really  both with broadcast and  Consume the stuff that way so but yeah, I mean I anticipate I'll be watching a lot of the speeches  Through Twitter or through Facebook  You know, we have TVs in our office at Mashable that are tuned in to the different news networks  But I think most of us it's just easier to  Consume it on the screens that were already tuned into and so I think I'm not alone in that  I think a lot of people when they get home or if they're at the office or something else  It's just easier, you know if they have it pulled up in in Facebook that they're already browsing anyway  Why not? I just have the video stream going there one thing that this does is it kind of disconnects?

Transcript:  The content from its source. So for instance this morning  I wanted to see Trump's speech about his vice presidential  choice and  There was video I can't you know, I was probably reading a newsfeed, you know  Maybe tech meme or something there were maybe nuzzle and there was video and I clicked it and then I'm watching the video  I don't know where it came from. I'm watching the video of the speech  And I thought I would like to Chromecast this because I want to see it on the big screen and there was no button  I realized oh, this isn't YouTube. This is Facebook  I'm watching Facebook video now  But it disconnects you don't know where you saw it or so  What's the benefit to Facebook if I'm not viewing it on Facebook if it's embedded?

Start time: 2811.64
End time: 2822.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What's the benefit they're not pointing out it's just uptake they just want people to use the platform  But eventually they'll figure out how to monetize that and then they already are doing it in small ways to begin with

Transcript:  Do they need to be more subtle than traditional media?  I mean traditional media will say well, we'll be back after this word from our sponsor  YouTube kind of has this middle ground where they just slide up a banner. Those are kind of annoying and then unless you have YouTube read  Or are they gonna get more subtle, I mean how do you monetize if you're Facebook how do you monetize this?  Especially if it's not on the page. I understand Facebook would like you to answer that question as well  I understand if it's on Facebook comm you're gonna monetize it because you get the ads on the side  But I noticed this is embedded video. It was I was reading somebody else's site. Well, and that's part of the

Transcript:  calculation I think is  Even if you're not always watching it on Facebook if enough people are using it that's bringing people to Facebook. I guess

Start time: 2873.32
End time: 2934.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and they can probably they're probably grabbing some demographic information from the embed  Anyway, you know  There's probably some ad code shared where they can get some information about at least the location and maybe something from your browser  Cookie that can add to their demographic information for those sidebar ads that you'll see  But I mean, I think that the short answer and Tom would would know better than I would but I think obviously there's you know  Preroll would be an easy thing for them to do  Once it comes to embeds that are already happening on the stream  I don't know if they want to do the YouTube route of doing, you know  The pop-under, you know and kind of overlay or what I think right now though  They're just trying to get as many people watching as possible  And they'll worry about making money off of the video component later because that that's gonna be there that that opportunity will be there  For them. I think the big thing that they just want as many people as possible  Using their platform to broadcast because that really helps showing hey, we've got people  Who are using their phones and are capturing these major events, but they're they're positive or negative using Facebook live  That's a really big thing  and then the secondary thing is just whether they're watching it embedded in a stream on a web page or

Transcript:  Looked it up  Twitch doesn't actually say exactly where the streams are coming from but they say they're partnering with the parties  So I assume it's just like a pool feed that the parties provide from the conventions and they're saying they're doing it as a public  Service so it ties into what we're saying here, which is twitch is just doing it to bring eyeballs and say hey  Maybe maybe just use our platform and the other interesting thing is they're letting you as a twitch user  Re-broadcast that with your own commentary and streams on your twitch channel

Start time: 2992.98
End time: 3024.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. No, that's actually interesting because then that's the pool feed concept  which has obviously been around for a long time and that truly does democratize it because  Before you you added that part Tom  I didn't really understand why twitch would care because I would think the typical twitch audience isn't going to be as engaged with the  You know party conventions as as maybe some other things, but if you can add in that commentary factor  That's very interesting and that's  That's really smart on on their part  I wonder how many people will use it, but that's really smart.

Transcript:  The networks and I think that's one of the big things that would be missing from live streams on Twitter from Facebook or elsewhere  You know it's one thing to sit there and watch C span but ultimately it's not gonna be a very informative thing if you've never watched the  Conventions before and certainly not everyone's gonna be able to sit there all day and watch the whole thing anyway  That's what CNN and everybody else brings to the table. They have the analysis they have roundups  They bring out the important parts and talk them up  You know unless you're able to watch all day long and you've watched them before  You won't necessarily be able to pick those things out  So I think that's the big advantage for the news networks at this point  But yeah as we see people being able to rebroadcast these things and cut them up and put together their own highlights  That really does bring the deprecation to to another level for an event like this and it will be interesting to see what comes out

I think there's gonna be a lot of news coming out of there and so it'll be very interesting  To see how what choices people make  And we I feel like we're reaching a tipping point this last three weeks  we've really seen a  very rapid migration to  alternative sources for your content

So you I was remember walking down Main Street  I was in Providence Rhode Island at the time and you never were outside the audio the radio audio of  after those few days and  Events happened very rapidly and but you were never kind of it was the first time you were in the bubble all the time  But we all experienced all the same thing now  You can remix the news as at will and you kind of do don't you read you're doing you're doing mashups as you go  and

Recalibrate ourselves because we're not used to  Seeing these events as up close and personal, you know, there's always been some barrier some buffer  You know someone saying shocking footage ahead, you know, you may want to now that kind of thing that that barrier is gone now  And so these sorts of things are you know?  They're in your Twitter feed there in your Facebook feed there  They're in your face all the time and we're not really used to seeing these things  We're not used to not being able to avoid seeing these things  I guess and I think that's something that we as a society are going to have to  Have to deal with and have to adapt to somehow and I'm not sure what the solution is or even if there is a solution  If we'll just become a bit more jaded about these things, which would be unfortunate  but ultimately, you know, we've never had this kind of exposure in this kind of  Insight into these terrible events as we have as we've had over the even just the past few weeks and that I think is definitely  You know changing our perspectives on the world at large

It was very sanitized. We saw the shock and awe  From a distance, but we didn't see the bloodshed  I think that that's changed now and you're gonna see you're seeing the bloodshed and it's shocking  And you might be right.

Yeah, man, I have way fewer people than twit  And you're doing fine, right? I'm doing okay.

Transcript:  there have been  Two or three autopilot crashes probably just two because now Tesla's saying  What was initially built as an autopilot crash wasn't they because Tesla has the telemetry they said no the autopilot was not turned on  But the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is is  investigating  Security Exchange Commission  Investigating some sale of stock issues and Consumer Reports now writes the letter quote. This is Laura McCleary vice president of consumer policy and  mobilization  For Consumer Reports quote by marketing their feature is autopilot  Tesla gives customers a false sense of security in the long run  Advanced safety technologies and vehicles could make our roads safer  We're deeply concerned that consumers are being sold a pile of promises about unproven technology autopilot  Can't actually drive the car  Right, but it does allow consumers to have their hands off the steering wheel for minutes at a time.

Transcript:  Think the most important thing here is that autopilot in a plane does not fully control the plane  In fact autopilot in a plane is in a lot of ways very similar to the autopilot system that Tesla offers  About system will not take the plane will not taxi on the runway  It will not take the plane off off the runway for you  It will control the plane and maintain a heading and it will maintain a course for you and indeed  Autopilot systems will land the plane for you in many cases as well  But it's not the kind of thing where a pilot would turn on autopilot and go take a nap or go play go or watch  A movie or that kind of thing  well  There are specific regulations that the FAA has in place about when you can use it when you should not use it and a lot  of recommendations about using  autopilot to effectively  Reduce the workload of the pile so they can be paying more attention to things like traffic in the air  Inclement weather conditions and that kind of thing  But but ultimately the system that autopilot has in planes is not as comprehensive as what most people think and I think that's where this  Disconnect is Tesla is saying it's like autopilot in planes and people think oh well autopilot flies a plane for you know  How to do anything that I think is where the big disconnect here is

Transcript:  I'm not sure consumer reports is wrong because of course if you're a pilot a commercial pilot  You're highly trained and know exactly what autopilot will and will not do and what your responsibilities are  But Tesla drivers, you know, they just have a driver's license  They've probably never driven a car with these features by using the word autopilot  You know as a pilot and pilots know that's not what we think it is  But can you expect the guy off the street to know what that means?

End time: 4550.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Transcript:  There's a little bit of you love fatigue there though  Yeah  I mean people people get excited about autopilot and they think that means it will drive the car for you  Even though that's not what Tesla said  And and so they treat it as if it will and I think that's what Consumer Reports is reacting to in my opinion  They're overreacting to it  I think Consumer Reports has the right to change their mind and say now that we've seen that the reliability concerns are true  We're gonna adjust it. It seems like they're going from one extreme to another though

Transcript:  they they say  That Tesla should disable automatic stealing steering in the cars until it updates the program  You know actually what they're really saying is add the feature that says drivers hands must be on the wheel  For this to work right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it's somewhere between two and four minutes  Usually I don't think there's a set time that that Tesla has has stated  But certainly it's definitely more generous than we've seen in other manufacturers  But one of the points that I wrote a big editorial about this because it kind of made me upset  Tim but one of the points is we've had cruise control forever  In fact, the first generation of cruise control was called autopilot ironically not really  People who were doing things, you know  We've seen controversies in the past where people have done stupid things with cruise control on  But there's no regulation about having to have your feet on the gas and the brake pedal ready to take over  You know  You can be paying attention and you can be alert in the car without having your hands resting on the steering wheel at all  Times I don't think that is necessarily the crux of the problem  I think the problem is that ultimately a lot of local news stations in particular have been  Misrepresenting what this system is I did a two-second Google search and came up with ten different local news reports talking about  The Tesla model s being a self-driving car even one that called it a driverless car completely outrageous

It works better than anything we've seen before and you trust it  so you are willing to  You know to give it more responsibility than maybe you should and I think that there is going to be said about the fact that the  Branding that Tesla's done  It might be too good and is leading some users to think that they can not be as alert as they are when they're in these  You know these

Transcript:  What is I mean think of one of the biggest problems here is what some people are calling ambiguous role allocation?  When the car doesn't entirely drive itself, but you're not also entirely driving the car  Who's who's in charge slow your reaction time?  There was a University of Strasbourg study in 2013 that found with cruise control  Episodes of drowsiness increased 25% and reaction time to emergencies was lengthened by one second now. I agree with Tim  I don't think that means we need to ban cruise control  But I do think that we have to keep in mind that when we are using these assisted technologies  There is an extra responsibility on us to stay alert that things could happen and we might be less likely to notice them right away  If we're not constantly paying attention like we would if we're driving the car entirely ourselves

Transcript:  What is not sure who should be doing the messaging here because all Tesla's messaging has been saying exactly what the system can do  I don't think that they have gone out of their way to swat down every single  Mistaken report that says what this that's kind of misled people into believing that these are self-driving cars  And I don't know that that's something that Tesla  Should have to do because what would we be thinking about them if they were correcting every single news report that went out there?  I mean they'd have to have a staff of hundreds just to keep up with that  But I'm not sure what the solution is to get people more educated because the manual says what it can do all of Tesla's  Messaging says what it can do  But yet people are using the system incorrectly and so I'm not sure what the what the solution is  But ultimately ultimately just disabling it and renaming it. I don't think that's going to fix the problem here. And by the way

Transcript:  Keeping your hands on the wheel doesn't mean you're paying attention  Right. Yeah, so this same problem that you referred to Tom is could occur even if you have your hands on the wheel  Google about attention Google talks about this with their self-driving cars  They they don't want people they take the steering wheel and the pedals out  Because it's it takes you too long  To figure out what's going you might say oh gosh, but I need to take control but you still have to kind of  Read readjust yourself to be in the situation and by that time you you're in trouble  so I  Think the way is to disambiguate it either the cars driving or you're driving but there's no middle ground. You can't both drive

Start time: 4924.70
End time: 4979.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and unfortunately, we're gonna be stuck in that middle ground for for a good couple years  Anyway, as this technology evolves, I  Think the other big problem is that there's no way of knowing how many lives are pal and it's saved and I'm sure it saved  Just a couple of lives at this point, but there's no way to prove that there's no way to know  But obviously when when a lot of is lost because the system failed that's obviously very easy to tell and it's obviously very tragic  Situation but for sure these systems have saved lives even the emergency braking system is that there was a Nitsa study  I think two years ago that showed if your car has emergency braking alone  You are 42% less likely to get involved in then a rear end collision that involves injuries 42%  Just from this one system and Tesla's got that system and a bunch of others  So I'm sure that there are fewer accidents happening and fewer serious accidents happening because of this system  But there's no way to prove that ultimately and that I think is an unfortunate thing that there's just just no answer for

You can really relax a bit more  if honestly  I think it makes me a safer driver because I can be  Looking around for incidents much more so rather than just worrying about staying between the lines worrying about how fast I'm going  Worrying about maintaining a safe gap between the car ahead of me  Speeding up the slowing down the car kind of takes care of all the menial stuff and frees me up to  be looking for someone who's driving in an unsafe way or  Straight lights ahead that kind of thing should make you a better driver not a worst right?  If you use it as you're supposed to but if you are using that as an opportunity to do something  You shouldn't be doing then obviously it can cause a lot of problems. Leo. Don't worry. Turn it on.

They're sadly they're not even though  I think on the whole they're making good points  You know, I don't know about you know pulling the entire recommendation for the car that that seems going a little bit far  I should note here.

Autonomous and partly not because to me that becomes the big question  like I don't really have a problem with weirdly with a fully autonomous car on the road because even though there will be crashes I  Think that you know those the software will get better and things will will probably be safer with with more autonomous fully autonomous cars on the road  But in this middle ground I do have to be concerned with whether people really understand  They still have to be paying as much attention if not more, you know  Versus just doing what I think a lot of people are gonna do  I mean  I know a lot of my friends who drive who are already distracted when they're driving without any sort of autonomy and and give them an  Excuse to not have their hands on the wheel  You know you just you're concerned  So I wonder like can we live in this middle ground world or are we going to have to kind of wait?  for the fully autonomous cars to come I

Transcript:  Talk to it. We can sorry I talked to a Tesla owner today. He was in our studios visiting. He's he's such a Tesla fan  He's actually had some cards printed up that say Tesla evangelist  unofficial Tesla evangelist, but he said  Because he often gets drowsy. This was something that really scared me when I had a commute  I would get drowsy on the way home after the show and I'd be tired and I'd get drowsy and I was oh  I was so glad when I stopped driving because I was really afraid I was gonna die at some point by drifting off  He said it there is something to be said for the kind of you shouldn't be taking naps at the wheel  But should you get drowsy if you've got these services turned on you're more you're safer, right?  You're less likely to have an accident due to inattention. You should pay attention. Of course, we know that no one should drift off asleep  But these things do might protect you if you for a moment, you know momentarily lose focus

Transcript:  And many of these cars can actually tell if you do fall asleep because they have infrared cameras that are watching you  So they will tell if you're getting drowsy if you're not paying attention and some of them even have  Retinal scan or retinal position detectors basically so they can tell exactly where you're looking  So they and that's part of this handoff that that's gonna be put in place  Which which is uncomfortable as you're going from the car driving to driving the car needs to obviously make sure that you are paying attention  Before it'll give you control back if you do have a situation where the car can really drive itself  But but these cars can really tell in a lot of ways your health situation  In fact for as we're working on seats that will tell if you're having a heart attack, for example  Things like that which are coming and which are encouraging and I think will make driving safer  but ultimately  You know  There are ways to exploit these autonomous systems and and as we've seen people are do we've all seen terrible YouTube videos or people  And the Tesla's playing board games or even tax or taking naps  I hope that people will be responsible so they don't have to worry about some kind of draconian legislation that that sets the whole world  Of autonomy back by five or ten years  But ultimately I think it's too early to tell but I think this ties back to our conversation before about things getting more  sensationalized and getting more coverage  I think than they did before if the news media sees these things and runs with them  Without getting all the facts right as we've certainly seen in the case of the the unfortunate death of I think Joshua Brown  It was his name who died in the mall less there have been a lot of misreporting about that incident just because everyone wanted to  Cover the story of the first person who died in a quote-unquote  Self-driving car and so if we have a lot of misrepresentation if that gets momentum  That could definitely set things back and that's really what I'm most concerned about here

It doesn't work very well  And this is it we're kind of in that I think for the next decade probably in that  Interregnum between driving yourself and having the car drive you where it's gonna be just weird and and and that disconnect of who's well  Who's in charge here?  We're gonna be putting up with that for a while so people pay attention  Don't trust don't trust the car  And this has been good for me. You know we're in a lucky position  I think all of us are in a lucky position that we are not  We don't have the pressure to file every five minutes and generate a lot of traffic  We have the luxury of not having to sensationalize the news of being able to sit back and say well  Let's tell let's find out what really happened  And I feel fortunate that I don't have to  Be first on any of these stories because they change  And you know maybe the new this new media landscape will help with that a little bit or take a break  Want to talk about  Prime day you guys buy stuff at Prime date the 12th  Free I got a TV.

But some are smart enough to go full-screen snap seed for instance was a great Google photo editing program  It works like a desktop program. It's pretty cool  And if you have a pixel, and I think that they are kind of encouraging touch for the there's only right now. It's  three Chromebooks  More to come in the fall and you have to be in the developer  Track to do it it did I got you know as buggy  I got some real slowdowns like weird things going on but nevertheless the fact that you could run Android apps on your Chromebook  Really adds a whole nother layer of capability

No no no you're wrong  You're wrong, and I'm like no, but but really like seriously come on  Yeah, we do you do you need to have two separate stacks because two separate  I mean you've got two versions of Linux happening right now.

Start time: 8006.68
End time: 8023.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 8026.04
End time: 8045.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well yeah, I think that's a good point because because it's a different implement hate  I mean it is a slightly different user interface  I guess for me  But I could see them doing at some point would be if Android becomes developed enough have the same you know chrome that's running on  Desktop on on Chrome OS and Android literally being that the same branch and that would at least get you
