Transcript:  This is TWIT, this week in tech, for May 22nd 2005, episode number 6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it looks as though we're into a splendid afternoon sport on this, the 127th Upwork Class TWIT of the Year show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And now for something completely different.  We are all TWITs now.  What a great TWIT!  Excellent, yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Look out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let us get underway, ladies and gentlemen.  It is this week in tech, episode number 6.  And on the line with us, Yoshi.  Hello.  Yay, Yoshi.  We got Robert Heron.  Hello.  We also have David Prager joining us for the first time since the pilot.  Hey, David.  Good to talk.  Hey.  Patrick Norton is here.  At least I see his icon, but I don't see him, so he's wandered off.  He said he wanted to get a soda.  Maybe he ran out and he's gone down the street to 7-Eleven.  A little later on, Roger Chang will join us to talk about E3.  The big game show conference is over, but Roger was there, Robert was there, David Prager was there.  A lot of you were visiting, so we'll get some input on that.  And of course, your questions coming up.  And then, sorry to say, Kevin's not with us live today because he's still in Canada.  I don't know what happened.  He went up to do the TV show this week and he never came back.  Maybe he liked it too much.  He liked it a lot.  But we did record.  I took him out to the KitKat Club and we recorded his big announcement  because there's a couple of big announcements from Kevin Rose coming up later in the show.  Let's take a look, though, at the top stories of the week, starting off with Google.  Google's been very busy, not only with their iGoogle or google.com slash IG.  I guess it's their answer to Yahoo's MyYahoo.  They also have announced that there's some...  Actually, we'll get the story on this from Yoshi's, some issues with China.  And then Steve Ballmer, I love this, gives an interview in Business Week in which he says,  Google, ah, they're a one-hit wonder.  Yoshi, what's going on with Google and China?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, basically, first of all, Google, I do not think is a one-hit wonder.  I think that's safe to say.  They're opening offices over there because they like Yahoo move over there.  They want to move their search market into China.  Japan does a lot of filtering, that kind of thing over there, domestic.  Internet users being able to see outside of China, which websites.  Yahoo actually agreed to censor the results.  And now there's talk of, will Google do the same?  And a lot of people are really kind of going, hey, Google's like, it's like the press.  They want freedom of information.  They don't want them to say which information you can get.  It kind of brings to... it's like an ethical thing.  Is it right to censor the results?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  China could say, no, if you don't do it, we're not going to let you in.  I mean, China is actively censoring sites right now.  They're blocking IP addresses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, of course. They definitely could.  My feeling is I think Google should say, then fine, don't let us in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's the biggest market in the world, though, isn't it?  I mean, billions of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It comes down to, is there a company about the ethics and the information they provided,  and the reason why people like Google is because you can get a lot of good information.  Or is it just a matter of making a buck?  Because right now, they're already a huge company.  They're not a one-hit wonder. They're going to be around for a while.  They've got a lot of good stuff coming up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is there such a thing as a 100-hit wonder?  I don't think so.  If you look at Google Labs, there's dozens of things.  Has anybody used the new Google portal?  I started playing with it. I like it a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's really cool. It's real simple.  It's a lot simpler than Yahoo's, if you ask me,  which is one of the things I've always liked about Google's search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, the thing I like is, as you say, it's simpler, so it doesn't clog up your page.  But it's got news.  It's got flashed out of the Times or Wired News or the BBC or Google News.  It also has a quote of the day, a word of the day.  You can look at your Gmail box, driving directions, weather, movies.  It's got access to the Google services.  My favorite thing is you can drag them around live,  which you can't do on Yahoo, so you can rearrange your page, just dragging it around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's so slick.  It is. I have it as my home page now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, me too.  How about you, Robert? Have you looked at it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I haven't used that particular service yet, but Google's...  Actually, one of the Google lab tools I use is their search tool that allows you to suggest beta,  where it types in and fills in the characters as you're typing.  Then the other cool thing related to the new mapping function is that...  Have you seen the site that basically married Craigslist to Google Maps?  Yeah, isn't that cool?  I love that.  You can do home searches, apartment searches, anything you like,  and you can even overlay the satellite information that they acquired from Keyhole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It makes sense because if you're doing a Craigslist search for a rental,  it'll generate a Google Map with pins in it for all the rentals that are available.  You click on that pin, so you know where they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like you said, you mentioned the ease of the interface where you can click and drag around.  It's such a simple thing, but at the same time, it makes it so easy to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What this Google suggest is kind of cool. What do you think of this?  You enter in sleepy, dopey, grumpy, and then it fills in the rest of the seven dwarfs.  I did try. I have to say I tried Patrick, Leo, Kevin, and nothing happened.  It's not perfect. I guess we're not on the list.  Is there a submission system for that?  Yes, submit to Google. That's the submission.  There's a Google ride finder now. You can find taxis, limousines, or shuttles,  and locate them in real time.  Don't you love this? One hit wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You notice they're also perfectionists because they keep everything in beta forever  until they have it to their satisfaction.  Gmail's still in beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everything's still in beta. I wonder if Microsoft's kind of salty  if some of their people are going over to Google with all the talk of the Google OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What is the deal on Google OS? You think they'll do that?  I think it's paperwork at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are definitely some of the people that have gone over to Google from Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Look at the job listings on the Google Labs.  If you're passionate about these topics, you should work at Google.  Look what they're looking into.  Artificial intelligence, computer architecture, computer graphics,  data compression and mining, file system design, genetic algorithms,  machine learning, profiling, robotics.  This is stuff they want to do.  Sounds like the beginnings of an operating system, if you ask me.  Especially this file system.  Unless they're going to do a Google FS.  What's that all about?  I never know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm looking forward to seeing what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Google FS is what their entire cluster of computers is based upon.  Multiple redundancy, cheap boxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So they're doing it in-house, you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Their file system? Yeah, definitely.  But it would be interesting to see for enterprise class solutions.  It could be a real challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have to say, I think what we're really seeing,  when you see Balmer do something like that,  what you're really seeing is Microsoft admitting that they don't have anything.  They've got another year before their operating system update.  They've got another year before Office.  It's time to spread the FUD. Right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Patrick Norton is here, ladies and gentlemen.  Sorry about that, Patrick.  We kind of messed up somehow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It turned out that I logged in on the machine downstairs.  Strange and unfortunate things happened.  You're still a little crackly on us, so we'll see if we can fix that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I want to apologize to everybody, by the way.  We're still doing this in Skype, as you probably can tell,  until we get the recorders.  They didn't arrive yet.  But maybe by next week we'll have it all good.  I'm going to be in New Orleans next week.  I don't know how we're going to do the show, by the way.  Can we do the show a day late because of Memorial Day weekend?  Oh, sure.  Monday afternoon?  That'd be perfect.  No one's driving into work Monday anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right.  Thank you, Yoshi, the spinmeister.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Item number two, ladies and gentlemen.  We're going to talk about WiMAX.  David Prager is excited about new Wi-Fi and CDMA solutions.  Do I get to mop the floor?  Do I get to mop, David, since I've written four columns on WiMAX

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  in the last three weeks?  Oh, David.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You guys will be in complete agreement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm interested to talk about why I'm not necessarily too ecstatic about it.  Really? Why not?  Well, the upload speed isn't nearly as quick,  but I have been using some of these 3G systems on the CDMA backbone.  I'm really impressed with really being able to go anywhere,  at least as far as I'm concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wait, are you talking about 3G or are you talking about WiMAX, David?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm talking about 3G.  I only brought it up because of the fact that all this stuff about 802.11n  and what they're going to ratify has been in the forefront.  I've been using this Verizon 3G service.  Well, you're in LA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're lucky because the 3G in LA is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, are you using the EVDO stuff, Prager?  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Cool.  It's pretty fast, isn't it?  In fact, fast enough so you can watch TV at 30 frames a second on your cell phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the reason I was trying it is because we're trying to fly a kite on the beach  and put it on the internet.  And so we thought we needed to get something in the middle of nowhere  that gives us broadband, and that's what we thought.  How do you follow up putting a web server on somebody's butt

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  while you fly a kite on the beach with a web server?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Something like that.  No, Verizon says you're not supposed to serve this stuff,  but we'll let you try it for the stunt purpose, for the stunt sake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you're going to use EDVO to do a web server?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Now, of course, the uptime isn't as good as the down,  and of course it's nowhere near the throughput of the WiMAX,  but it's still getting significantly faster than any kind of dial-up you'll ever get,  and you can get it just about anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, you can get it in 34 markets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right, but they're rolling it out fast, more and more markets very quickly.  Verizon is where they are.  Well, no, they are.  I mean, if you can get it in Providence, Rhode Island now,  I mean, it's pretty amazing that you can get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I mean, they've got 34 really weird market choices.  I mean, that's what's odd about where they rolled it out,  because they didn't roll it out in San Francisco,  and they didn't roll it out in a couple other major cities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Patrick, remember cable modems, which were rolled out in Fremont,  which is a small town in Silicon Valley,  years before they rolled it out in San Francisco.  In fact, Comcast didn't roll out cable in San Francisco,  cable modems in San Francisco, until way late.  Yeah.  So I think that there may be good legitimate market reasons.  I know At Home didn't do it because they didn't want to be swamped.  They wanted to slowly grow the network,  and that may well be what Verizon's thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That'll be interesting to see how long it takes them  to really upgrade the rest of their network with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hot item right now, and I know, Patrick, you'll have something to say about this.  Yahoo announced this week that Yahoo will have music,  unlimited downloads for $5 a month, $4.99 when you sign up for a year.  That brings the cost of music down to practically nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, did you hear what Mark Cuban said about that?  Yeah, I love it. Go ahead. Tell us.  Mark Cuban said that, well, if you get an unlimited number of legal music downloads,  that means the RIAA can no longer sue anybody for more than $5 per month.  They were violating peer-to-peer file trading,  because obviously the value of an unlimited amount of music is $5 per month indefinitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, what are they going to charge you for damages?  $5? Oh my gosh, he owes us $60.  Now the issue, of course, and I asked the lawyer about this,  and you're right that the compensatory damages are now effectively $5 a month,  because that's how much it's worth,  but they still go for statutory damages and punitive damages.  So this doesn't let you off the hook,  but what it means, and this explains why the record companies in the movie industry  go to Congress with bags of money,  because they need there to be statutory penalties  so that they can get these lawsuits to carry some weight.  But you're right, $5 a month. What's it worth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But he said the files were legal.  They're legal, man.  They nailed me on statutory file trading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't want to go to prison for that, man.  They really treat you poorly.  Oh, he's a file trader. Go get him.  You're my bitch now, baby.  So here's the question.  So you can get on Rhapsody, it's what, $14 a month,  but Rhapsody lets you play on three different computers and your MP3 player  if it has this Microsoft Play for Sure on it.  Yahoo! One computer, any MP3 player with Play for Sure.  Now that's not a huge set,  which would you choose, $5 a month, one computer,  $14 a month, three computers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you know, it's kind of a swap, by the way.  I think Yahoo! is mostly going to get people who are really loyal  and really into Yahoo! more than anything else.  I'm attracted to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't you think it makes me want to swap my iPod for a creative?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, have you used the creative?  By the way, 192 kilobit WMA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's pretty good quality.  Is it only WMA?  Yeah, I'd like to see.  WMA only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's time for iTunes to start upgrading the quality of their downloads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Predictions for you, ladies and gentlemen.  Well, there's no lady in here, but if there were, I would have a prediction for her, too.  Next month, WWDC, I think Apple's going to pull the switch.  I think Apple has to do a subscription model now on iTunes Music Store.  I think they're going to, in order to do that, they have to announce new iPods.  I think they will, and I think they may well do a video iPod this next month.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they're already offering video through iTunes.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They upgrade iTunes to 4.8.  All of a sudden it shows video.  What do you think?  The clues are there.  I guarantee they're releasing a video iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think they're doing it next month.  I'd be surprised if they did that quick.  Maybe August in Macworld.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, there's two.  I mean, last year at the D conference, which is the Wall Street Journal conference for technology executives,  is when they announced the Airport Express.  I think what's going to happen, a lot of people are saying that the next iPod major development is going to be wireless headphones,  which I've heard from two or three different directions.  There's a lot of people who are saying that Steve is still really, really down on creating a video iPod,  and a lot of people don't think that there's the cooperation there from the motion picture studios.  So it'll be interesting to see what they come up with.  The other thing, the other really strong rumor is that they're going to do WMA support on the iPod,  which I can't believe, but on the flip side it's a really interesting idea.  So supposedly they're going to do WMA and August support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You said that they have the hooks in there, but it's not connected to anything yet.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Somebody told me that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I couldn't understand what you said.  Somebody told me, I don't remember if it was you, Patrick, that the hooks are in there, the icons are in there.  They just haven't hooked them up to anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, some people notice in 4.8 there's some undeveloped links in there that have some interesting problems.  It's WMA.  And Awkworbis and WMA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think they want to do it early in the summer because I think they want to get the college kids a summer-long buying spree, don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, did anybody see Hillary Rosin's column she did online where she was whining because the iPod and iTunes are a closed system?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, she's right.  If you're an iPod user, you're stuck with the iTunes music store and vice versa.  If you have the iTunes music store, you've got to buy an iPod.  I think she's, I mean, I don't know what her dog is in this hunt, but I think she's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, she was upset that she couldn't WMA encoded tunes on an iPod.  That would be a big complaint.  Steve, free my music.  Free the music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I ain't going to ever be free.  And it's Hillary Rosin and people like her that are keeping it from being that way.  Where is she now?  She left the RIAA.  Is she a consultant now or what's she doing?  Lobbyist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's do a quick search on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You missed our Google discussion where we decided that Google is not a one-hit wonder.  So this is what I think.  Microsoft's just kind of on the offensive.  And I mean, they're offensive.  You got Balmer saying Google's a one-hit wonder a couple of weeks ago.  You've got Gates saying the iPod's a one-hit wonder.  I think this is wishful thinking at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And their new Xbox is a big friend to the iPod.  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, you know what?  It's time to get our E3 roundup from Roger Chang.  So David, that means I'm going to put you out to pasture.  I want to thank you for joining us.  What are you doing these days?  You're still at the G4, yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, still working there on the, I guess, the current incarnation of the G4.  The incarnation of screen savers.  Attack of the Show.  Attack of the Show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ratings good, I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've gone up significantly, so it's really interesting to see how it's going.  And of course the CEO is pleased.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, we're going to have you be a regular, I know, on the Twitcasts down the road.  I have to say right now we have this issue with Skype, which we can only get five people in here.  So in order to get our CES coverage in from Roger Chang, I have to let you go.  But thanks for being here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Be sure and ask Robert Heron to get his cousin's input on E3 as well.  His cousin?  Who's your cousin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, my cousin works for G4.  And he's arguably the most knowledgeable person about gaming I've ever met in my life.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right.  Hey, thanks.  Hey, thanks very much.  Take care.  All right, bye.  Bring her!

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Bring her!  Bring her!  Bring her!

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, classic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He turned into a pretty darn good producer.  I mean, he's the guy who arranged the web server up the guy's colorectal area.  He booked the surgeon and everything.  I mean, that's, you know, that's good.  That and the amount of work he does.  He works hard, I tell you.  Yep.  There's Roger Chang, ladies and gentlemen.  Roger, welcome.  Welcome.  Thank you very much, guys.  Roger Yahweh Chang.  Both Roger and David were on the original pilot for this and haven't shown up since,  but we've brought them back.  Yeah, work kept me away.  You're working at now.  Okay, we're going to say you're working at where you're working, but you do not represent them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I work currently for GameSpot in the division of CNET, but I will not speak on  their behalf at this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So anything he says is his own opinion, ladies and gentlemen.  So how was CES?  You were there all week, right?  I was at E3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was I saying?  Yes, E3.  It was actually very, very involved in my end.  It was we got there last Saturday to set up our booth because GameSpot is not only covering it,  but was also an exhibitor in the West Hall next to the Sony and Nintendo booth.  And my responsibility was to get the stage and all the various elements, the lights,  the cameras and stuff up and running in time for the Wednesday show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you actually did stuff on stage for it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I basically told the guys, well, I need the lights here, here, here, here,  raise this high.  I had to put those lights on a dimming board, find out that the dimming board was located  55 feet up in the rafters.  I had to find a way to throw the cable.  This is a story because I originally asked the booth contractors, the ones that we contracted to build it,  I needed a lighting board at an easily accessible location.  But the way it was located was up like 55 feet.  You would need a union pass or an electrical union pass to basically get up there  and then have a union electrical guy to show you around because you can't do anything without them.  So it was a $20,000 plug-in a cable?  Yeah, and essentially there's this huge hoop of cable that, you know, DMX cable,  which is essentially a four-pin XLR that controls the lighting board to the actual lighting unit.  So I basically had one of our guys, or one of the builder guys come up with me  and basically throw the line over one of the cross beams on the convention ceiling  so it would drop right into our booth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow, that sounds like a scene from, you know, Lara Croft.  Did he swing it around and throw it up in the air?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, it was quite humorous, if not for the fact that I was in a very big rush to get everything up.  How many throws did it take him?  The first one we basically threw a lead line, so it would have a tape at the end, it would pull it out.  But the guy that was helping us forgot to hold the other end.  So it just fell over to the other side. So we had to get another piece of rope in.  That's crazy.  Yeah, it was very, very amusing slash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What union do you have to be in to throw stuff up into the roof of the convention ceiling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't have to be, you just need the union approval. You can't do anything without the Teamsters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm in the local 43-44, the rope throwing union.  The toss in the rope over the thing union.  That's me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it was a good show, it was a very good show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All the mainstream media obviously covered the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.  Was that really the big story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The hardware was key.  That was really what everyone around was looking for.  They were looking for all those hints that either the CEO or the spokespeople would drop.  Oh, it's going to have that, it's going to have that.  What titles were going to roll out for the various platforms.  Microsoft, I think, basically went out of the gate with the MTV show that they did.  Unfortunately, that show was more geared toward, it was more like an infomercial.  It was more of a, this is the Xbox 360, and less of this is what's inside the 360,  and this is basically more of the technical elements of the machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that makes sense. But I think they were trying to get the attention before E3.  Exactly.  Because they were afraid of what Sony's PlayStation 3 announcement would look like,  and I think they did get scooped.  And you know who I really feel sorry for? Nintendo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, it's interesting because Nintendo really didn't have that much compared to the other...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They announced two, they announced a handheld and a console.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, they announced a lot of air is what they announced.  But they didn't get any attention for it.  Well, they didn't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, go ahead, Patrick. I mean, Patrick's on the right track.  I mean, they basically announced something they did not have yet.  They announced the Nintendo Revolution, which, you know,  if you've seen pictures of the USA Today for that, I think it was Wednesday or Thursday,  it looks like a broadband modem on its side.  It's, you know, well, and the thing is, especially in the video game industry,  as like, you know, as all very media-hyped industries are, you know, it's the numbers, it's those keywords.  Nintendo referred to as two to three times more powerful than the GameCube,  while Sony was saying that the PS3 was on orders of 10 times more powerful than the PS2.  I mean, it's very semantic oriented.  You know, what does that mean? 10 times more powerful?  But when people pick up on just the numbers to 10, the three, and then they start thinking,  well, you know, the PS3 is going to be 10 times more powerful than the PS2.  So it's better, right?  Yeah, I mean, so, you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The article I saw said it was 35 times more powerful than the PS3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And my daddy can beat up your daddy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it's two teraflops.  How many teraflops are you, you little wimp boy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, and I doubt any of those teraflops would be able to calculate, you know, any engineering, you know,  you know, stress tests, you know, to see where we're at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So which is the better machine?  Is it the 3.2 gigahertz, three 3.2 gigahertz power PCs plus a 500 megahertz ATI in the Xbox 360?  Or the cell processor running at three plus gigahertz in the PlayStation 3?  You know, it's... how do you decide?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, they're different architectures.  I mean, you know, you have a multi-core G5 in one.  Then you have not only a power PC derivative, but basically entirely new cell architecture.  No one's ever kind of seen that before in a home entertainment device.  You know, the expectations are high.  But, you know, the expectations I were for the PS2 when they announced the Emotion Engine,  everyone was expecting to be bowled over.  And when it came out, you know, people are having, you know, developers having, you know,  the first games are always going to be kind of, you know, a little shodded  because developers haven't had time to exploit the power.  You know, it's been, what, four or five years later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But the first year of the PS2, it took them to figure out how to program to it.  It was so hard to write.  And all of a sudden the games got spectacular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you see anything about the type of cooling they're going to use also?  Because I heard there were some rumors of liquid cooling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't hear any specifics and I don't want to draw any conclusions, you know,  just saying like, yeah, that's going to have, you know, a huge water vat cooler  that connects to your refrigeration unit in your kitchen.  They keep it cool because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've got to announce a new video card though that's on their site, I believe, right now  that offers liquid metal cooling.  It's the new XA50.  But you've got mercury running through?  It's some, you know, metal alloy that supposedly can transfer heat 60 times,  or 65 times better than water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder if that liquid sodium...  They developed something like that for nuclear reactors,  so they found out it was unreliable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love Roger.  He's like the only...  He guys reads Jane's, you know, military guides for bedtime reading.  History Channel buzz.  Why yes, they did use that in the 1942.  So let me ask you this.  The rumor was that Microsoft's kiosk demos of the Xbox 360 weren't running on an Xbox,  but running on Apple Macs G5s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I personally was not able to get out there because I was literally...  I was a chain, but figuratively I was chained to my booth.  But yeah, people were saying that a lot of the demos were not running.  How about Sony's? Were they real?  That was...  They just showed the video.  They had no boxes to show other than the announcement they made.  There was no hardware.  And that's where Microsoft is trying...  I think they're trying to leverage is like,  Hey, we have a tangible product that you can touch that will work.  I mean, even the pre-limb...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Even if it is an Apple Mac and touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you know, it's a surprising thing and I probably shouldn't let this out, but...  Go ahead, tell us.  A lot of the games that I've seen so far, you know, are all running on development units.  None of it is the official, you know, this is the final Xbox 360.  You expect that.  So it's not surprising to see that, you know, at E3.  It's because they're either working out the games or figuring out how to, you know,  produce this in mass quantities without, you know, costing Microsoft an arm and a leg.  When does the Xbox 360 hit the...  Supposed to come out this fall, basically in time for the holiday shopping season.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it's not till March of next year for the PlayStation 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and it remains to be seen if what the price point for the PS3 will be.  Most people are probably speculating around 300 bucks because any more than that,  you're going to price yourself out of the market.  Sales of the PSP still robust?  Yes, PSP, you know, is doing, you know, pretty well.  There's nothing...  I mean, people have been so used to the Game Boy,  then you come out with essentially what is a little downgraded version of the PS2,  a Dreamcast level console in your hand.  I mean, the graphics are, I would have to say, very, very, very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love the PSP. We've talked about it before, of course, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's great.  I mean, the battery life isn't as great as what one would expect from a handheld,  especially if you're a frequent flyer that has to travel five plus hours on an airplane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've been able to get like four and a half, five hours out of mine.  It's been pretty good. I've been happy, yeah.  I'm going to make you spend money, guys, imaginary money on imaginary game consoles.  Robert Heron, PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360?  PlayStation 3.  Yoshi, without a doubt.  Xbox.  Xbox.  Xbox. How about you, Roger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Xbox, just because it supports... it will act as a Windows Media Extender.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's really what they're going to do.  They put a hard drive in there and they didn't put a hard drive in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and the ability to... and I mean, I think Microsoft has hit the nail on the head.  Sony was really pushing the technical specs of their machine,  and Microsoft was trying to kind of spin the whole,  this is what it's going to do for your lifestyle, how it's going to fit in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Patrick, Xbox or PlayStation 3?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, boy.  I gave you time, Patrick.  Whichever one MotorStorm comes out on first,  which I think is going to be the PS3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right, so I've got two PS3s, two Xboxes.  I'm going to break the tie. It's Xbox, but I might get a PS3, too, if it looks that good.  They look pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You didn't say that. I'm probably going to buy both.  Well, both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That and high definition output.  So far, Microsoft hasn't said how they're going to do it,  and there is no word for anything like a digital video, like DVI or HDMI.  They're not all interesting.  And once again, you're going to have to buy a separate AV box  just to get S-video or even component output.  They're saying there's going to be no upscaling of DVD content  to high definition resolution.  I thought it was going to be HD. It's not going to be HD.  No, I mean, it will be capable of HD resolutions,  but the only connector on the physical box itself that's somewhat official at this point  is a simple composite output.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, interesting. But they did do that with the old Xbox where they had a connector,  and then you could buy a composite component output.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, they all do the multi-AV outs because it's cheap.  You don't have to build them into the box.  You think they'd have a DVI.  Yeah, but you know, Sony also says that it'll support two HDTV outputs  at the same time for the PS3. But I mean, is that really realistic?  Are you going to expect people to have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, will they be digital or not? That's my real only question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You want digital, and as long as it's digital,  as long as it's digital, it doesn't matter what kind of connector you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know, you got to work for what a majority of your audience will have  at any one time when they have it in the living room.  Odds are Microsoft's going to create an AV packet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We'll offer that, so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Patrick, go ahead.  Yeah, but Microsoft also likes to make money on upselling accessories.  Think of all the accessories that should have been in the box in the Xbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like the DVD remote control that you'd have to buy 30 bucks to get the...  Well, how about this though? They're going to have a Blu-ray in the PS3.  I mean, doesn't that sound like it's your HD DVD player?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. Has anyone found out what a majority of the studios have decided on as a format?  No, there's no agreement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're split. The studios are split across the two formats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But of course, Sony's going to offer Blu-ray. What else would they do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, of course they can leverage their studio holdings to that effect.  I mean, Blu-ray and then, hey, we have Columbia Tracer.  Why don't we just leverage that entire library of movie content on Blu-ray exclusively?  And that way we can kind of force it from both ends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'd much rather support a format at least that's out there currently.  And Microsoft's been promising HD, Windows Media 9 HD support and set-top devices for a long time now.  And they're still not there.  Well, that...  At least you can buy Blu-ray right now in Japan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This brings us in a nice smooth segue to our questions portion of the show.  Now, you guys just stay on and jump in with your answers, whatever you have to say about the questions.  I'm going to try to get through 20... You want to do 20 questions?  Sounds like an old culling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We should warn the audience right now that these are all cold questions. We have no idea what's coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, I was really incensed. I did a podcast interview the other day and the guy said,  well, when you did the screensavers, of course you had the earpiece and the guy's telling you the answers on the other end.  What?  Who said that to you?  That made me mad.  Who said that?  Oh, it was a podcast interview. And I think that a lot of people think that.  I know, but it's kind of like funny.  Well, I told him, I said, do you... If you only knew who was on the other end of those earpieces, you wouldn't say that.  And most of the conversation on the earpieces was, shut up, shut up, speed up. You're killing me here.  Question number one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is Brendan from Maryland. I'm really glad to hear you're all together again for a show.  I was wondering if you thought that Sony's announcement that the PlayStation 3 would include iTunes capability,  coupled with the fact that iTunes is now offering video sales, meant that Sony and Apple were trying to position the PlayStation 3  as a convergence device that might allow consumers to basically buy movies at home and whether that was a real threat to rental services like Blockbuster and Netflix.  Thanks guys. Bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  PlayStation 3 convergence device?  Well, isn't... I mean...  Definitely, I mean...  But they don't have a hard drive in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's, you know, it's both Microsoft and Sony are pushing it as a conversion device.  You know, Sony wants it from the hardware end because, you know, if you notice with the PSP, what kind of flash memory do you need to buy for the PSP to store your games and store media content? Memory stick.  Right.  What are they going to make you do when you get a PS3? It's Blu-ray. I mean, it's basically all about consolidating a vertical integrated...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Makes no sense, though, to do the iTunes music store if you don't have a hard drive.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You know, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's going to have to have some serious form of storage on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How about a Blu-ray burner? What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Or how about just an external hard drive that you pay $50 for or your external hard drive plus your remote control is $150.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or, you know, if it is networkable, why not network storage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ah, there you go.  Yeah, this is true. And then the big question is what is their compression going to be? Is it going to be the new H.264, which is beautiful and lovely, or is it going to be something else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's kind of interesting as you look at it right now.  Microsoft pretty much owns the legitimate online and, you know, kind of splits with DivX the illegitimate online distribution of feature movies.  You know, you go to MovieLink or whatever.  Walmart just gave up on distributing, you know, doing the mail rental DVDs. They basically gave it up to Netflix.  But I mean, it's like Microsoft has a pretty huge lead negotiating the deals with the studios.  I'm kind of curious whether or not, you know, the studios are maybe in a are the studios going to go, well, Microsoft may be doing all of our other online stuff, but we'll make everything available on the iTunes video store.  If it actually ends up existing because it's got such a good economic model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, the whole thing ended up being a moot point with the new competition offering $5 a month for unlimited downloads that it might be a bundled feature of the PS3, but it could be a very unpopular one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I got it. $20 a month you get PlayStation Live. You get all the music you could listen to. You get networking games. You get maybe video rentals.  I mean, why not just one flat fee and you get all the stuff? Wouldn't everybody go to Sony if that were the option?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For online gaming, Sony has been free to this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know, with online gaming, it's been up to the developers to basically implement all that.  That was a mistake. Did Microsoft eat their lunch because of that?  I'm not a big Microsoft fan, but I think their model worked better because they had total control. They made sure that whatever game you had that was Xbox Live enabled, you would have a working server to connect to you and have to rely on EA or Ubisoft or someone else.  That's very true.  Maintain a server for everyone to join in.  Question two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey you guys, this is Jenny Ruskin. I'm calling from Cary, North Carolina. And my question for you all this week is, do you think that with the leak of the Star Wars work print that came out before the episode three was released in theaters, and then the resulting popularity in the theaters, which of course we all knew was going to happen,  do you think that that goes to undercut the MPAA's position that sharing files is going to hurt the industry? I'm of the opinion it does nothing but enhance the excitement. So I'd like to know what you guys think. Thanks. Bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Star Wars in its first weekend, $50 million. Obviously people saw that.  Not me.  I have not seen it yet because I'm not seeing it. So good. So they made $50 million and you guys still haven't seen it. So there's another $50 million to be made next weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think it really depends on the film. You get something as popular as Star Wars that people will go see it three or four times and still download it and still buy the DVDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, Star Wars is a weird case. It's a phenomenon. It's not just a movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you get something that's a bad movie and it's not going to make a difference. People are going to download it and see it and spread the word that it's crap and no one's going to watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's to protect crappy movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's my guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think really it's just a way of distribution of movies in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now the work print that got out had time code all through it. So big deal, right? But still it's a work print. It's better than somebody recording it in a camcorder in the theater.  Yeah, with half the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, some guy walking to get his popcorn.  It's funny. People say, oh, I got the Divix version of Lord of the Rings Special Edition.  Yeah, they're just collectors.  But I'm one of those people that would actually go out and buy the DVD box set.  No matter what.  Yeah, because it's not only for the collection reasons. It's just because the quality is better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know what you want. You want those little plasticine bookends that you get with the Hobbits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, okay. I got a couple of books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Many of the files on the Internet, though, are ripped from DVDs.  The quality is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but they don't upload special features. They don't upload menus, you know, any of that crap. It's just the movies.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you know, I still have, have you found, anyone found a really cool, set-top, standalone Divix player that won't, you know, I won't have to go through some online store and show them money instead of just paying 60 bucks at Best Buy to get a DVD player?  I mean, it's just one of those things that, for convenience sake, I think people would still choose a medium-length DVD or something like, you know, iTunes, where it's, you know, it's pretty much well thought out for you.  You don't have to go through a bunch of hurdles in order to get the thing on a freaking disc and then get a player that's compatible with that format to watch it on your TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're not selling the movie or the music anymore. You're selling the experience of where you're seeing it or how you're buying it. That's the value add.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although I think movie theaters are shooting themselves in the foot by putting ads in front of movies.  Yeah, I agree.  I think that is like the worst idea anyone ever, anyone has ever come up with. I mean, the whole point of going to the movies is to watch something without flaming commercials, right?  And then you sit there and you watch a Samsung phone commercial, you know, a movie tones commercial and a bunch of other Coca-Cola ads that you want to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Question from Dorothy. This is the woman who, by the way, designed our little twit that's on our webpage. I love that little twit guy.  Isn't he cute? I think when he's on his side, I think that's that's electrical symbol for she told me it was like an inducer or something.  And then you turn him around and he's a little guy. So thank you, Dorothy. That's not we're still the logos are still pouring in.  I don't I don't know if we're going to have more logos or what we're going to do t-shirts.  I'm using a lot of the images throughout the site and they're all great. So thank you everybody.  Here's Dorothy's question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hi, guys. I'd like you to put on your twit visionary caps and ask what is your most optimistic vision of technology impacting on everyday life and your most pessimistic vision?  And are these visions necessarily mutually exclusive? I don't have a time span, but let's just say within the next decade or two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Patrick, you're the you're the you'll stand in for the pessimist. What do you think?  Terminator. Terminator. The machines take over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, man, I've been doing I've been doing a bunch of reading lately about the whole idea of, you know, peak oil, which is which is the idea.  Yeah, basically this economic downturn where it becomes really expensive to pull oil out of the ground.  And they thought it would be 40 years from now, but they forgot that, you know, there's all these countries coming online and becoming more industrial.  And China is starting to use huge amounts of crude oil.  And, you know, the idea that basically life as we know it is going to end because we're going to run out of electricity and fuel to, you know, move food.  We'll go back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Essentially, it's going to look like the story has been told in the Road Warrior.  I was just going to say, yeah. Mad Max, baby.  I mean, if you listen to the beginning of Mad Max, it's basically massive global economic downturn because of, you know, the reduction of oil production.  You know, everyone's that's what people are driving around the highway, you know, V8, you know, trying to clean the last gallon of gas from someone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, it's going to go down. You may as well go down in flames. Right, Roger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why not? And then we're really cool S&M gear while you're at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, does anyone have a pessimistic, I mean, an optimistic vision for the future?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, she's right. I don't. She hit on a very interesting point where she said like the pessimistic and optimistic not necessarily exclusive.  It's going to all happen.  It's going to all happen. And, you know, for certain groups, and these are groups that are probably in the position least able to deal with it, you know, developing countries, people in economically depressed areas,  people who are in regions that have capital inflow that are based on a knowledge economy, you know, will probably be more flexible and more able to deal with it.  But, you know, countries that are resource dependent, that are like, for example, you know, countries that all they do for revenue is export coal, export, you know, raw materials.  You know, they're going to be more susceptible to the shock because, you know, they're that one commodity export market, you know, coffee beans, all those coffee beans growing countries, you know, get hit when there's a glut of coffee.  Right. There's a price decrease and they have nothing else.  I don't know what the hell Roger's talking about. You don't understand what he's saying here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, okay, basically, basically it's this. It's that countries like...  One sentence, Roger. One sentence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Basically, it's this. Those... I'm sorry. Basically, it's this. That people who are basically well off will be able to deal with any kind of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The rich get richer, the poor get poorer.  Yes. You are correct.  Robert, what's your scenario for the good old day? We're all going to get 1080p televisions and we'll just sit and watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I feel that too, but TVs will continue to get cheaper. In the next 10 years, you're going to see flat screens at outrageous sizes for $500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I like that. See, who cares what the rest of the world's going to hell in a handbasket? I got a big TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or even better, some form of wallpaper. We just integrate the display into a wall itself, maybe an organic lady.  But anyway, getting back to her question, for me, it's really about medical advances.  The South Koreans right now are just pushing stem cell research into places that everyone was afraid to touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They've been able to create new lines. We couldn't do it in the States. Bush said, you can't create new lines. We've got enough lines.  The Koreans figured out a way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And if you need a way to get up to speed on that subject, PBS has done a few episodes of shows related to that very topic, explaining what it is they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The biotech revolution is going to make the information revolution look like nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That, and I also feel very small machines is one of those items where you can build on an atomic scale machines to perform certain functions.  That's one of those topics where you can see it as either being very bad or very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Patrick, is nanotech going to happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, nanotech, I mean, nanotech, the little tiny machines is sort of the extreme forward.  And that's like the far end of nanotech.  Right now, it's already starting to show up in everywhere from makeup, paint, you know, that technology that essentially, you know, is creating thousands of tiny fiber lids on fibers.  So you had, you know, better, basically created better surface tension.  Yeah, well, it's not even coatings, right? But by actually modifying the fiber, by creating more surface area, by creating these little tiny fiber finger lids off each individual fiber strand, they apply it with a chemical.  But basically, it does is it's kind of you ever see a cat when he gets angry and it puffs out?  Like imagine like, you know, the tiniest form of a cat.  I can't wait to write the synopsis for this cast.  Puffed up cats.  But on a simple.  What's a cat fancy that on technology?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There was a researcher, a lady researcher out of I think Cornell, who developed her and a group came up with a way to take a sphere of gold and by varying the thickness of this tiny little sphere, you could shift it would shift the color of the wavelength that would bounce back.  So depending on, you know, how big or small or how thick or thin you make the ball itself, you could literally generate any color you wanted.  That was applying to like paints and other things as well.  But it also had uses in the medical industry where they can actually inject these little balls that would respond to specific forms of laser light.  They inject them into tumors and be able to operate just by shining light and heating and destroying this one area without ever making an incision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Guys, I made a pledge that we would keep this thing much shorter from now on.  It just goes on and on and on.  And I know it's fun and nobody wants to stop.  But I think people need to have a podcast that's less than four hours long.  So let's move on to the plugs before we because we have Kevin Rose coming up with his big announcement that he teased us with last week.  And I think it's a big it is a big announcement.  So I know everybody's going to want to hear it.  But before we do that, Yoshi, I know you wanted to mention you've got the new videos out, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, we released Box 2.0 on Friday, which was our it was actually that video was originally going to be in the video that we're releasing.  We're releasing another one on Tuesday.  Wow.  It got too long.  So we released that one as a 15 minute standalone because it's basically about these kids we found that lived their life through the Jedi religion.  And it's very interesting.  Box 2.0 was.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Where I just want where can people see it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, from the shadows dot TV.  From the shadows dot TV.  I'm hosting direct downloads to it that are linkable from there on my site so people can get nice fast downloads.  Good.  And then Tuesday's is vulnerability.  And I'm doing another mod in that one, which will be a PSP Wi-Fi mod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm so glad you're still doing mods, Yoshi.  Yes, that's that's the that was always a fun the best part of the screensaver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I enjoyed it.  And this this this one's kind of fun because it was presented in a way it's like before we always had a few minutes to kind of just show it off.  Now I got to show it being made, which is a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Very, very cool.  Robert Heron, anything you want to plug?  What you up to these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, still working in the labs at PC mag doing my thing, writing and reviewing HDTV sets, getting them in as fast as possible.  Other than that, I also have a video project also on from the shadows dot TV that I think is in Box three coming out on Tuesday.  Something I did when I was still down in LA and hopefully we'll get around to doing some more of that now that I'm up here in the Bay Area.  That's really great.  That's really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Fun stuff.  Yeah, I'm glad you guys are both doing downloadable video.  Kevin's going to talk a little bit about system in just a second.  Patrick, I know we see you on extreme iPod dot com and extreme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, anybody out there with an iPod, you can win one hundred and twenty free songs from E music dot com.  Send a picture of us with your iPod.  Don't send Photoshop pictures because if you don't have the rights to the art and we can't prove it, we can't pick your picture no matter how unbelievably cool you're Photoshopping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, I wanted to mention that you've been Patrick's been my iPod dot com or the.  What's that extreme iPod dot com?  Yes, let's get that plug in there.  I just want to mention Patrick, you've been kind of the pollster on the site on the Twitter dot TV site, which is great.  And I love these polls.  We keep meaning to talk about the results.  The most recent one was how people listened.  Were you surprised that more than half listen on the computer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was actually I was kind of amazed.  I figured there would be at least 30, 40 percent listening on the computer, but it ended up being I think it was 64 percent last time I checked.  Let me let me pull it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's now gone down a little bit, but to 60 percent, 59 percent, it's still a huge number, especially compared to portable players, which is only about 43 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So, yeah, well, 33 percent are on iPods or digital players.  So, yeah, 60 percent on the computer, five percent burn at the CD and two percent other.  So, yeah, I was I was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What would other like your cell phone?  What else could you listen on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, you know, you could you could move with the tape.  You could move it to your cell phone.  You could somebody had something really in there.  Let me scroll through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Somebody did something really nutty and crazy ways to listen to the test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, we want to see.  We want somebody to cut the quick cast of vinyl or eight track.  I want to find it.  I want to listen to the quick cast on eight track.  We got to get a vinyl cutter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're going to prove our audio quality before we get it on vinyl.  I think I'm going to get it on vinyl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think I'm going to get like having a vinyl cutter would be great.  I like. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yoshi, you should build a little vinyl cutter.  That'd be a nice mod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It'd be interesting.  It'd be fun.  Kind of a retro throwback thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Leo World Tour continues on Wednesday.  I'll be in Athens, Ohio for the Southeast Ohio Macromedia Users Group.  We've got a link on the show page if you want to go.  I'd love to see you there.  We have a little meetup for breakfast and then giving a speech at lunch.  Registration, including lunch, is $25.  And Wayne and Akron has put together a cafe press store with the Leo World Tour T-shirts.  Did you see those guys?  Oh, my gosh.  And by the way, proceeds from that store benefit twit.  So thanks to Wayne for setting that up and Tacky for doing the art, which is far from Tacky.  Any other plugs you guys want to get in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  None. I have nothing to plug.  I work 60 to 70 hours a week.  I don't really have much time to do anything after.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Roger, you do a lot of the videos for GameSpot, Tacky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  The cool thing for E3 is that we actually got a lot of HDV.  We got like four HDV cameras in for that.  And we were using Premiere Pro to cut with it.  It was the first time that I actually used HDV.  And it's kind of a cool format.  And by that, it's technically an HD spec, but it's a super compressed form of mini DV.  You're using the H.364 or what do you...  It essentially uses MPEG-2 to compress down.  And to basically make it fit onto a mini DV tape, it crams 15 frames into a single frame.  It matrixes it into a single frame.  So it's kind of weird because your software actually has to be designed for it.  So you just can't use HD software.  You have to use one that's HDV compatible in order to do the editing,  because it has to pull out those 15 frames so you can do a frame in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right, folks. We're going to roll in Kevin.  Don't go away because we'll have some final words in just a bit.  But Kevin Rose had a big announcement he said that he wanted to make on the show.  He can't be here. He's still up in Canada.  But we had some time to talk on Thursday night at the lovely KitKat Club in Toronto.  So here he is, Kevin Rose, with the big announcement.  Here we are at the beautiful KitKat Club in downtown Toronto.  I'm sitting across from screen star Kevin Rose.  He's the babe toy magnet, or the toy babe magnet...  What are you talking about?  ...that all the girls go for.  The king of the dark tip.  Kevin, tell your loving, adoring audience,  what is it, this big announcement, that you can't be on the Twitter for? What's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so the big announcement is that I'm leaving G4.  What? You can't leave G4.  It's true.  Are they firing you?  No, they actually...  Tell the truth. It's okay. You can tell us. You're one of my friends.  The truth is I've been in negotiations with them for the last...  negotiations with them for the last probably close to a month now to get out of my contract.  Really?  Well, the deal is I really want to do my own thing.  It's like I've, for the longest time now, it feels like I've just been doing content that I'm not happy with  or haven't been able to get as really as geeky as I want to get with the content.  Right.  And I miss a lot of the old screensaver's days and I just want to get out there and produce and create  really solid downloadable tech content for the web.  And the only way to do it is to actually have some time to do it, and that's to get out of my contract with G4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and this system thing is about to explode, right?  I mean, this is really about to take off, this new TV on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it starts Monday, and yeah, that's what I'm seeing all over the place.  I'm seeing more and more downloadable content and, you know, with IPTV coming up and all these different  little miscellaneous set-top boxes that people are starting to buy,  that they can get all this IP-based content delivered right to their television.  There's no reason why we just can't create it on our own.  Wow. Have you started a company for System and all that?  Yeah, we started a small production company, and we're going to be working on System full-time.  There's actually going to be four of us. Myself.  Who is involved? You and Dan Huard?  Dan Huard. Keith Harrison, which is the old screensaver's technical director.  And he edited The Broken for you, right?  Right. And Ron, who is our chief Linux guru slash tech guy.  So really, except for Ron, it's the old gang that did The Broken.  Yeah, it's the old gang that did The Broken, and we're going to be doing it full-time,  putting out as many episodes as we possibly can.  We're going to be selling ad space within the episodes so that, you know,  different tech companies can place their ads within.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm proud of you. This is pretty bold. I mean, you're really turning your back on a normal,  real paying gig, a national television show, to devote your time and energies  to something that's fairly speculative and yet that you really believe is the future of television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's just that, you know, you remember when I first started Tech TV,  I didn't get into this to be on TV. I really didn't want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, you weren't on TV. In fact, tell me, I don't remember.  How did you get to Tech TV? I don't remember how that happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Chris Krause was working there, a friend of mine.  Oh, yeah. He was an IT guy.  Right, he was an IT guy at Tech TV, and he said they had a position open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The inventor of the IP Chicken website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right. It's ipchicken.com.  Is that still around?  Yeah, it's still around. He still makes a ton of money off that site, too.  You're kidding.  No, I'm so mad. He makes a ton of money off that site.  Does he do anything else? He just sits there and relaxes at home.  No, he does consulting work from home now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, so he was a buddy of yours. Did you go to school with him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it was just through a common friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He said there's a job in IT? Or what was the job?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it was just basically being like the tech guy behind the scenes on the screen.  He was setting up the computers.  Yeah, anytime there was a demo that needed to be done, a scan line that needed to be ran,  I was just the guy that took care of it.  That lasted about a month.  Yeah, that was the last time.  Really, you were on the air very quickly.  Well, it started with that vulnerability. Remember that Windows vulnerability?  Was that the first thing that hit on the air?  Yeah, you had me come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You discovered the Messenger flaw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, the way to automate it to send out to all those machines.  And you were like, hey, come on the show and talk about it.  You're kidding. That was your first time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, it wasn't me, but that was the first time.  No, you found something fairly significant.  And remember we called Microsoft and they said, hey, that's not a bug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then they patched it in the next release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, no, we did that on purpose. That's intentional.  That's right.  I didn't realize it was the first time. And then from there, did you start doing things regularly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As far as on the show, yeah.  Just eventually, remember I started doing some of the kind of shady hacker-type stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you were always the dark tipper from day one?  Pretty much from day one, yeah.  That was Paul Bloxley.  Yeah, I never liked that name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You didn't?  Well, it's just kind of one of those TV things.  I mean, I don't want to be called the dark tipper.  I don't think anybody really wants to be called that.  But...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Paul Bloxley was the executive producer of the Screensavers.  He had that TV sensibility. He knew how to do...  Right.  He knew this is how you market it. This is how you create a character, per se.  So really, we should give him credit because he was the guy who saw you as being a star.  Definitely.  And you did very well. And then of course, with the acquisition by G4...  Right.  I left...actually, even before the acquisition, I left the Screensavers.  And you took over for me.  Right.  So it was you and Patrick.  Uh-huh.  And then G4 took over, and then it was just you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, and then it was Alex and myself.  And then Alex...that's right.  And then they laid off...  The brief Alex Albertiro, which is, what, two months?  That was a lot of fun, though. I really enjoyed that show.  How was that?  That show was great. You know, it was a lot of fun.  We still got to do a lot of techie stuff. We did a lot of product reviews.  Robert Heron was there in the labs.  You're still friends with Alex.  What's that?  You're still friends.  Oh, definitely.  Oh, yeah. I talk to Alex all the time. He's a great guy.  We'll get him on the show.  Definitely.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you were doing that. At what point did you start to say,  this is not where I want to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that pretty much happened after they laid off Alex, Dan, Yoshi, and Robert Heron.  That was...what was that day like? That must have been a terrible day.  That was a rough day. That was probably my worst day on the job.  It was so rough because these are all some of my best friends.  And they all came to LA to be part of the show.  Right. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was two or three months later. What did G4 say? We want a new direction?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, I don't think...a lot of people would say that G4 had this master plan to destroy TechTV,  but I don't think that's the case. They just wanted...  It's a little Lex Luthor.  No, no. But you've seen the forum post and all that.  And it's not like...that's not what G4 set out to do.  I mean, they really wanted the show with Alex and I to take off,  and it just didn't turn out to be the direction that they wanted it to go.  And so they made modifications, and now it's an entirely different show.  It's doing very well by the way.  Yeah, it's doing great. And it's actually a good show for what it is.  I enjoy watching it, and I like it. It's just not the tech stuff that I really want to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nobody's going to believe me when I say this, but I actually think the tech of the show is a pretty good show.  The problem that you guys always had was you were being compared to the old screen stars.  And there was no way you could succeed on those terms.  So leaving the name behind, starting fresh, was a smart idea.  Then nobody's comparing you to anything else.  How does this show stand on its own? And it's doing much better as a result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's doing much better. And everybody that works on this show, I have to say,  when I first came down to G4, we're kind of looking like, oh, you're the G4 people.  Everyone was kind of standoffish. But they're just a great bunch of guys.  I mean, they're creating a great show. And I really like Kevin Pereira.  He's a great guy. Everybody that works on this show, he is a really nice guy.  And yeah, I am going to miss working with him. I'm going to miss working with that entire crew.  But I'm glad that they finally released me for my contract.  Many people don't know that I was bound to G4 for four years.  Four years, right?  I had four-year contracts, but I couldn't do anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You couldn't even do what you're doing now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so they let me out. They set me free, which is great.  I'm thankful that they did that. And they understand. I mean, they get it.  They know what I want to do, that I want to go out there and produce really cool tech stuff.  And I'll probably come on the show every once in a while to show off some of the cool stuff that I'm doing.  It's along the same lines of what they like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I hope you'll come up to call for help in Canada and join us.  That's why you're up here right now. I hope you'll come up more often.  Oh, definitely.  And I know we're going to see the system and the broken.  SYSTM.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's your non-profit. By choice or by...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well...  Soon to be profitable.  I'm going to be hungry, so I'm going to be producing a lot of content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And of course, Twitter will go on. You're never leaving Twitter.  I'm going to be mad because you have no contract, so you can't get out of it.  You think I'm a fool? No contract for you. You must continue for the rest of your life to do this silly little podcast.  Oh, it's fun.  All right. Well, have fun in Toronto. I'm glad you could be with us virtually.  Enjoy your... What did you have? Salmon?  Yeah, it was great, actually. Atlantic Salmon.  The Kit Kat Club, Atlantic Salmon. It's different in the Atlantic, isn't it?  Yeah, it's good stuff.  Everything is different here. That's not the Atlantic, though. That's Lake.  That's Lake Ontario.  It looks like an ocean because you can't see the other side, but it's actually just a really, really, really big lake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was nice. It was a little choppy out there today. It was nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, we went swimming. We coated ourselves in bear grease.  Kevin looks better in bear grease, frankly, than any man ought to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm telling you. You look pretty good yourself, Leo, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thank you. It's because I'm part bear.  All right. Well, on that note, on that fabulous image, let's take it back to the studio, guys.  Wow.  When is his last day there?  Yeah. He's going to announce it on the show Monday night.  So this is the first time anybody's heard of it is on the Twitcast.  And then he's going to announce it on the show on Monday night.  And yeah, he was able to get out of his deal.  And he's going to devote all his energies to system, to IPTV.  Cool. Nice.  You know what I find interesting is that we're all kind of doing this kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like just exploding right now. It's like the thing to do.  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's when geeks get frustrated, we learn to find new ways to satisfy our AV needs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And with Microsoft and Yahoo, we're heavily investing in it, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but the deal is, from my point of view, with this podcast and the stuff he's doing on system,  the stuff you guys are doing out of the shadows, is we don't work for the man anymore.  Bye bye to the man. We're doing our own thing.  And the truth is, the man never understood what technology was all about.  I don't know who the man is, but...  The man tried to tell us how we can use technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do.  The people generating FUD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes. So we're doing our own thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Remember how cool Napster was before it was illegal and hardly anybody knew about it?  So it's back to those days.  Back to those days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Back in the day, TV was more the man than it is now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is becoming, I'll tell you, this Twitcast is really becoming the venue for big announcements.  Yoshi announcing his impending wedding and baby, and now Kevin announcing he's leaving G4.  Patrick, do you have anything you want to announce?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Nothing new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Roger, are you getting the sex change operation?  Anything you want to tell people about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not to my knowledge, but when I do, you'll be the first to know.  Speaking of sex...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wait, wait. I can hear Roger's sister crying now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yoshi said something. Yoshi said speaking of sex. I've got to hear this sentence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Speaking of sex, I found out the sex of our baby is a boy.  It's a boy! That's a big announcement.  We're going through all the name books now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's great. Congratulations. Yoshi's going to have a boy. I think that's appropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, yes. I've already got the URL. It's a couple years off, obviously, but I registered myfirstmod.com.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  His mod's on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  With any luck, he'll be doing his first mod on a Twitcast.  Robert Heron.  Supercharger, Fisher Price PC.  Patrick Norton. Roger Chang. David Prager. Kevin Rose.  I'm Leo Laporte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You were talking to a Kevin at the KitKat club?  Yeah.  Is that a strip club?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not in Toronto, but it is another place.  It does sound like a strip club. Well, you know, the KitKat club was the name of the club in Cabaret, wasn't it?  Oh, was it?  I think it was.  Here come and view. No, it's a restaurant. It's a nice restaurant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like a chain of strip clubs in San Jose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, that's the Pussycat. What is that?  No, there's a KitKat club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a KitKat club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I know what Robert's talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why does this show always end up talking about strippers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, hey, when have I ever talked about strippers?  I don't think that makes it up to me.  Wait, wait, wait. What are we getting at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, Roger, that time with the bottle and the thing and the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, remember? No, no. Hey, you, I, no. Remember, Roger, the, what was the name of that Italian place?  Bucca di Peppa?  Bucca di Peppa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're the one that bought that stuff, not me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In the Pope room. Yeah, but you put it on the Pope's head.  You put it on the Pope's head.  I did?  Yes.  I came by and said that.  And yelled at you.  She said you can't put that on the Pope's head.  We're a family restaurant.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, Bucca, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you still have that stuff, Roger?  Oh, yeah.
