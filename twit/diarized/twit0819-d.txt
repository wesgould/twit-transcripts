Start time: 258.54
End time: 457.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should put this closer to the camera to be OK.  Hey, before we get to the news, we have some news ourselves at Twitch.  Lisa is here with me.  It's something that we've been working on for some time.  When we first launched Twitch, you know, I come from ad-supported media.  I mean, I've worked in radio and TV for years and everything I did was free and ad-supported.  And initially when we first started it, it was free and not ad-supported.  That wasn't so tenable.  Then we were lucky in the first year we were able to start selling advertising.  We've done very well, I think, as a free ad-supported network.  But we've been getting a lot of, I don't know, I think interest from our audience.  And I've been watching people like you, Alex, move from traditional mainstream media to  substack as Ben Thompson, what does he call it?  The Sovereign Writer.  Sovereign Writer.  You're a Sovereign Writer.  And I thought maybe we should be a Sovereign Podcast.  So we thought, let's try this.  And I hope you will like this idea.  We are going to continue to sell ads on our shows.  We'll continue to be an ad-supported network, free to anybody who doesn't mind hearing some ads.  But we've heard from enough people saying, you know, I don't want to hear the ads, I  don't want to be tracked, etc., etc., that we've decided to offer an ad-free version of  Twit.  No ads means we need to make money somehow.  So we're going to start something we call Club Twit.  For $7 a month, you'll get ad-free versions of all of our shows.  You'll get a special dedicated address that's just for you, that is your feed specifically  for you of ad-free content.  And I mean all the shows will be ad-free available.  And then also going to do another feed, which is Twit Plus.  The Twit Plus feed will include outtakes, pre-shows, special content, stuff that we  maybe couldn't afford to do in the past as an ad-supported thing.  There's quite a few shows that we just weren't able to get enough audience for to do an ad-supported  version.  That might also be part of Twit Plus.  And we are also going to open a special Discord channel.  We call it Club Twit.  And as a member, you'll also have access to that.  So I think that's a pretty good package.  $7 a month.  Twit.tv slash Club Twit to find out more.  I hope for those of you who've wanted an ad-free version of Twit and who've wanted additional  content, things like the GizFizz on feeds, I hope this will scratch that itch for you.  We're very excited about it.  I think it's going to be a great way for us to continue to put out the same quality content  and maybe even more content than ever before without having to wait for advertisers to  say, OK, we like that idea.  We want you to say you like the idea.  So I hope you like the idea.  Again, Twit.tv slash Club.  $7 a month.  There's somebody in the chat room saying, I actually like the ads.  That's great.  That's fine.  And we're going to continue to do that because I also like the ads in the sense that I think  it's always good to have a free version for people who can't afford or don't want to spend  the money.  I think $7 a month is a pretty fair price.  We went back and forth on the price and that seemed like the sweet spot.  This worked for you, Alex, right?  I think that's a good way to go.

End time: 482.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm actually building Big Technology quite in the same way that you guys followed.  So actually right now I'm entirely ad-supported.  So the podcast, Big Technology podcast and the newsletter are free in their full version  to everyone.  And the idea is let's grow it.  And when it's at a point where we can build some community around it and deliver some  extra features for a subscription fee, then I'm going to go to that.

Start time: 482.96
End time: 487.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what Substack is kind of designed for, right?  I didn't realize you do free as well.  That's nice.

Start time: 488.54
End time: 552.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that most of the writers go to Substack because you hear about like the  high profile writers, people like Casey Newton or Charlie Warzell or Glenn Greenwald.  They immediately go to subscription because they already have a critical mass of fans  that can sustain their business.  So Glenn Greenwald is making over a million dollars a year on Substack already.  Didn't Substack pay him initially?  No, actually Glenn, I don't think Glenn took the advance.  Some others like Matt Iglesias did.  I didn't take the advance and I said, you know, I'm still like in the middle class of  content creators and I'm not going to be able to generate enough annual revenue on subscriptions.  I mean, my list is okay.  It's 9,300 people.  But I figured that that would really lend itself better to an ad supported model.  And so far so good.  Yeah, that's what we did.  It's the right move.  And I think that what you guys are doing is super exciting because at a certain point  you grow and you build to a critical mass where it's time to give some of your super  fans a little bit more.  Allow them to skip those ads, give them some extra content.  And that's what I'm working towards too.  So I'm excited to see you guys take the step and we should compare notes somewhere down  the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See how it's going.  If there is a trend in the last couple of years, this sovereign writer trend, and not  just for writers, but also for podcasters, seems to have been the trend.  Move away from people like Alexis Madrigal and the person you just mentioned who left  Vox.  Yeah, Casey Newton.  Madaglacius, Casey Newton.  They've all said, you know what, I have a brand.  Why don't I just do it myself?  And I think that that's a I think sovereign podcasters is an interesting idea as well.  Anyway, we'll try it.  We'll see.  I think it's a good idea.  I like it.  What do you think, Ed?  You've been with us since the very beginning.

Start time: 592.22
End time: 651.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, this is I was thinking about that this week, you know, watching a lot of  the discussion, you know, the discourse about what's going on with Substack.  And it reminds me of the early days of blogging, you know, around the turn of this century  of people started businesses that, you know, made them money for a while.  Some of them have stuck around people like Josh Marshall turned it into, you know, turned  it into good sustaining businesses.  And then, you know, and then Facebook and Google got involved and distorted all of the  all the content business models.  And I think I think it looks like what we're doing now is starting to disrupt Facebook  and Google.  And I'm all for that.  So the content creators can, you know, can get involved without those without those intermediaries  either in advertising or in reaching the readers, viewers, listeners.

Start time: 652.06
End time: 659.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I'm all for that.  Absolutely.  Anything to just intermediate the Facebook is fine with me.

Start time: 659.96
End time: 706.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we've learned our lesson, too, by the way, like anyone who's starting a new business  now, we've seen all these publications, you know, go all the way in on Facebook and Google  in the hopes for traffic or support that never really came.  And so now when it's up to us in terms of the way to run our business, we'll we'll obviously  send emails that will touch Gmail or do podcasts that will touch Apple.  And maybe people will share our stories on Facebook.  But like, Facebook's going to try to get into this newsletter game.  Facebook is starting audio only stuff that we're about to hear about this week.  And I think a lot of us who are coming up now, we know, you know, that is a bargain.  That's one with the devil.  And, you know, it might give you some better results short term.  But if you want to be successful in the long term, stay away, build it sustainably and  so that it doesn't end up collapsing on you sometime in the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been you know, it's funny, because in rich, you probably more than anybody have  been through all this.  I started in broadcast media like you.  And broadcast media has been very good to me, as it has been to you.  But at some point, you kind of want to spread your wings and radio in particular has been  faltering over the last 10 years.  I can't tell you how many radio guys I've worked with who said, how did you do this  twit thing?  Tell me what you do.  What do how do I become a podcaster?  Because, you know, the radio is starting to get a little shaky, people are leaving their  jobs or their jobs more likely are leaving them.  There've been lots of layoffs in the last couple of years.  And so I think it makes sense if you if you want to be a content creator, owning your  own stuff in the long run just makes sense.  And when I started this in 2005 and 2006, podcasting was in its infancy.  And now I think it's mature, it's very mature.  And we're starting to see podcasting become big media with Spotify and I heart and others  kind of dominating podcasting platform.  And unfortunately, you know, one of the reasons Spotify can give Alex Joe Rogan $100 million  because they can say, well, you're going to be exclusive on our platform, which means  people have to listen to what was traditionally a podcast or on YouTube and open have to listen  to it on Spotify, which means they can track people.  And that's become hard for us because it's hard to sell against, you know, advertiser  has a choice between buying us and getting enthusiasts and geeks, but they don't know  anything about them or going to Spotify where they not only know everything about them down  to their credit card number, they even know what part of the shows they did and didn't  listen to.  And I don't want to get in that game with Spotify.  That's a tough game to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I've just been watching this very closely and I find it fascinating.  I mean, I've worked for a media company all my life and, you know, it's really I talk  about this all the time, my wife, how when I started, it's like the only way to reach  someone was to go through that conduit, you know, that that channel, that radio station,  whatever.  And in my career, I've seen over and over every single way that we used to reach people  you can now do on your own without someone.  And I'm not saying that, you know, I'm ready to jump off or do anything like that, but  it's just it's fascinating that we never had that opportunity as journalists to go direct  to the people.  Now, here's what I think is happening.  And I think it's amazing that people can support their, you know, the creators they love and  the networks that they love.  subscription.  We've heard of the term subscription fatigue.  And so that worries me a little bit.  But I think here's what's going to happen, Leo.  I think someone's going to some smart aggregators going to come along and say, you pay us, you  know, whatever, 10 bucks a month and you get to pick five subscriptions.  Now, I know that sounds anti to everything we're seeing happening.  But if someone's sitting there going, hmm, I add up all these things and it's 30 bucks  a month, but I can get 25 through this aggregator and then people will sign on.  You know, it's just I feel like that is probably going to happen.  We're going to come back full circle to like the cable model where it's like all these  channels and you say, OK, but it's going to be much more flexible where you can pick and  choose every month or, you know, six months, whatever.  I don't know. I just feel like there's something, you know, because I love supporting like  seven bucks a month is great.  You know, it's like it doesn't sound like that much for something you love.  But, you know, I'm sitting here with all the things.

Start time: 917.44
End time: 920.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have one hundred seven dollars a month things and starts to.

Start time: 921.00
End time: 939.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. And right now we all have that limit of like that whatever we are paying for cable,  right? Like maybe two hundred dollars.  You're like, OK, if I'm over that, I'm too much.  But as long as I'm under that, I'm OK.  So there's like this weird, you know, mental, I don't know, line in your head.  I don't know. But I find it fascinating.  I love what's going on. I do worry about that.

Start time: 939.94
End time: 952.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, that's you know, that's that's absolutely the case.  Although I have to say, we're getting I think we're getting a little bit more used to it  because everybody's got Netflix and Amazon Prime and and, you know, I mean,  just starts to add up. And I think we're just kind of getting used to it.

Start time: 952.54
End time: 969.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I don't know. This is what Apple Apple tried.  Has tried to do this with magazines and newspapers with Apple News Plus.  Is that what they call it? Yeah. Yeah.  And and I don't know how successful they've been.

Start time: 969.44
End time: 982.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think the newspapers and magazines like it very much.  The only ones that that like it are ones that don't have a big subscriber base  or a national audience. So they like the exposure.  But I don't think it's worth well for the right times in the Wall Street Journal.

Start time: 982.32
End time: 1036.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's exactly where this and that's exactly where this plays out here.  Those who already have a good solid base, either because they're  you know, they're somebody who has a brand that's that's it.  That's instantly monetizable and substack.  Or people who have a brand that accrues to them through the media outlet  that they're with. You know, those people are going to be OK and they're going to be  independent. But a whole bunch of other people who are in that second and third  tier are probably going to see some advantage to saying, look,  I would rather get two dollars each from somebody  aggregating me into something than try and convince people to pay me five,  seven or ten dollars a month and know that I'm not going to make the cut.  I'm not going to make their their, you know, whatever their threshold is.

Start time: 1036.18
End time: 1057.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What they don't like is that they don't get the ad, the email address.  They don't get the information about the customer.  That's what customers like. That's what Apple likes.  They hold that. But the newspapers don't get that.  And they want to build over. They would love to build a relationship  with their subscribers. And that's what the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal  have done so very well. That's why they're so successful.

Start time: 1058.74
End time: 1155.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And this is by the just to jump in quickly.  This is the key part to like asking whether some of these writers,  independent podcasters, are going to want to go in a bubble in a bundle,  because they are at the end of the day, independent minded.  They don't want to be working under the auspices of a publication.  They want that direct relationship with the readers.  And if they're only getting two or three dollars from a bundle,  per subscriber, they're going to probably attribute more to themselves  than to the being part of the bundle.  And by the way, people subscribing to a bundle of sub-stack writers,  they're probably better off subscribing to a publication anyway.  So I think that like, you know,  a lot of these news publications are learning their lesson in terms of playing  ball with Apple on this bundle with the Apple News Plus.  So, you know, I'm definitely, you know, I talk to people about joining  a bundle of sub-stack writers.  Honestly, it's just more fun doing it on my own right now.  And I think that's going to be what happens by and large is that  sub-stack writers are going to stay independent.  It was scary, but a scary move for you, though, wasn't it?  I actually felt that I had, you know, no other option.  It was the timing was was wild.  My book came out in April 2020,  and I wanted to keep writing on the topics in the book,  but I wasn't going to have a chance to do that as a staff reporter and said,  you know, let's just make the plunge.  And I had a relationship with people, you know, on a newsletter.  I was writing for BuzzFeed anyway.  And they all came over with their email addresses to the new thing.  And I don't know, I personally have high risk tolerance.  So I was just like, let's just go jump off.  That's why I see what happens.

Start time: 1156.46
End time: 1174.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so that was helpful.  Do you feel like it's, you know, exciting to kind of, you know,  what you do on a daily basis directly?  I mean, you can see when you get the subscribers and you get the,  you know, the paid subscribers, especially like, do you feel that?  I mean, that's got to come with an energy that you probably never had before  working for someone else.

Start time: 1174.86
End time: 1206.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No doubt. I mean, to like this, you have to like being an entrepreneur.  So I'm not only doing the writing and I get to assign myself the stories  and book the guests for the big technology podcast,  but I'm doing the business deals, too.  Or I have a sales guy working with me now on advertising.  And we're going to say a little bit more about that this week.  But like getting a chance to steer the entire ship  is something that was always exciting to me as a prospect.  And, you know, now getting a chance to do that  definitely is super fulfilling to me and something that I was always hoping to do.  And it's nice to be able to live that out.

Start time: 1206.70
End time: 1245.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We tried when we first started to it, I thought, oh, no, advertisers will just have a tip jar.  That didn't work so well because there was no infrastructure around it.  That's the other thing that's changed dramatically.  Things like Substack.  We're using memberful, which is a Patreon company.  I mean, Jack is really Patreon has been huge for people.  And now, of course, there's only fans, there's Substack, there's medium.  There's a lot of ways to go.  Is this another announcement, Leo?  I am starting my only fans channel.  Now the big news.  That's the real news.  OK, you want to see the luxury set I just bought.  No, you don't want to see that.  Don't worry, I'm not doing.

Start time: 1246.02
End time: 1285.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think that that's another interesting side to this is that as a content.  And so they have this thing on Facebook called Stars.  And I don't know if anyone has seen these or used them,  but it showed up on my account one day and it's like people can leave you stars.  So when you do something interesting, people can leave like,  I don't know, a couple of stars, like a penny or two.  And so you buy them in bulk.  You can buy like twenty dollars worth of stars and leave them for people.  And so I think that that's another part of this whole situation that has not really  in the past, in the web, they talked about it back in the beginning,  where it was like you would give people a penny for an article or something.  But I think that's another side of it.

Start time: 1290.44
End time: 1318.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it never happened.  But I think we can.  I don't think the the thought process was in place for that to happen  or the infrastructure. But at this point, again, another smart person comes up  with a way and maybe it's Jack at Patreon.  But if someone comes up with a way where I just have a little bucket on my  Chrome extension with twenty five dollars loaded up and I read a good article  and I go, and I just give someone a penny or two or whatever their suggested  Braves doing that, actually, isn't it?

Start time: 1318.42
End time: 1334.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brave has those brave attention tokens.  It's a crypto currency.  But because it's a browser with an ad blocker, they thought, well,  if we could have some way of donating to the sites you visit that you're not  seeing their ads, I don't know how well that's working.  But I think I think it's an interesting experiment anyway.

Start time: 1335.96
End time: 1351.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think people want to support.  And we've come to the place where since there are so many independents out there,  we've got to place where we want to support them.  I mean, think about the tips you leave.  You know, you go to a coffee place and you tip the person a buck  for handing you a coffee. Yeah, because everybody's struggling a little bit.

Start time: 1352.06
End time: 1405.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So anyway, that's my news.  That's the that's the story.  Thank you for putting up with that.  That's not the big news of the week.  Maybe the big news of the week is Apple's going to have an event on Tuesday.  Spring loaded and all the all the Apple haters going, that's not the news, Leo.  But I'm going to just start with that.  We'll just well, because I think they're loaded implies  they're probably going to announce a lot of things.  We've thought for a long time that this would be the place  where they would announce an iPad Pro, perhaps finally announce their long  awaited air tags.  There's some evidence that that's actually going to finally happen.  But there's also just a rumor came out today or yesterday  that there are going to be multicolored IMAX, redesigned IMAX on Tuesday as well.  Any thoughts about that?  You cover you wrote the book on the iPhone, Rich.  Are you are you excited about Tuesday?

Transcript:  I mean, look, I cover tech news for a living and consumer tech news.  And Apple stuff always is the most popular no matter what.  An iPad Pro to a consumer audience is a really tough sell.  You know, you're not it's not the sexiest thing in the world.  It's laptop priced.

Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think the air tags have potential to be huge.  If those ever see the light of day, I think it's it's odd that they announced  the the find my expansion last week with Chipolo, which makes little tags like tile.  So it's you know, an Apple definitely makes products that other people,  you know, they partner with Peloton forever.  And now all of a sudden they make their own Apple Fitness Plus.  So I think the air tags have potential to be huge for the average person.  The M1 chip are are the IMAX going to have the M1 in them?

Start time: 1458.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Probably right. Or M1X or we don't know.  Apple's naming convention is is weird.  The iPad Pro will finally catch up with the M1.  It'll basically be an M1 in the iPad Pro, I think an M1X.  You know, they could look at this.  They're silicon. They control it completely.  They could do a new chip.  We haven't heard any rumors from the supply chain like TSMC who makes those chips.  But who knows what we do think or the rumor is, and it's a fairly well  positioned rumor source, that it will be a redesigned IMAX,  which, you know, is probably a good idea.  The Find My thing cracked me up because it was very that's one of the reasons  I think AirTags is coming out.  It was very clearly to say, look, Tile, because Tile's been bitching.  You know, we're going to open it up.  Tile notably did not join the the crew of third parties.  VanMoof Bicycles, an electric, actually, I love the name.  They're they're good electric bikes, but they're expensive.  We'll have. Yeah.  They have this little logo on locate with Apple.  Find My. I never heard of Chipolo.  You'd heard of Chipolo before. I never heard of them.

Transcript:  Yeah, they they were at CES many, many years ago.  And the big difference is, is that you can replace the battery.  You know, Tile, the whole thing, it dies that after a year,  you got to recycle it with them, get a new one.  But Chipolo has like just one of those standard batteries in it.  Is that, you know, like a flat battery?  I forget what they're called. Yeah.  Like a A3200 or something. Right. Right. Right. Whatever.

Transcript:  Start shipping in June.  You'll have to get the Chipolo one spot.  What if you left your Chipolo and Chipotle?  Would that be no, just I'm just being stupid.  And then Belkin has a wireless here, but I'm surprised just those three.  I would hey, if I made a gadget that's easy to lose  or expensive like a bike, I probably would want to put this in there.  I think it's a good idea.  And I love the idea of opening, find my and not only see my laptops, my phone,  but also seeing other stuff that I can't find.  Apparently, the  the person Apple's using  for the demonstration of this lost everything in Golden Gate Park.  They got a backpack here. They got a bike there.  They got their headphones over here.  Clearly, a little too much partying.

Transcript:  And well, and also the one advantage Apple has also is this UWB chip,  this ultra wideband chip, which lets you point your phone  and get it as like a direction finder.  So if you lost your keys under the sofa, you can actually figure out  that's where they are.  That's huge. Nobody does that.

Transcript:  And the fact that it's baked into the operating system versus tile  was always a third party.  You know, on Android, it probably ran in the background.  But like with Apple, it probably didn't.  I don't know if it ran in the background, but it probably did not.  Right. Based on their architecture of iOS.  So the fact that this is running in the background all the time on every iPhone,  you know, I don't know what the opt in process is like.  But the reality is this has potential to be huge.  I mean, nothing may ever be lost again  if you have one of these air tags on it or a Chipolo.  You know, it's I think it's pretty wild how how wide ranging this could be.

You know, but but if you if you want, you know,  I have Android devices here.  I have Windows devices.  You know, car has CarPlay and Android Auto in it.  And I will. I love, by the way, try them both.

They include, you know, their own maps and their own stuff.  But who wants to use that?  Don't you want to use the always updating phone stuff?

Transcript:  I know. I don't understand.  So we just got we we just got a new car a couple of months ago.  We got a Volvo.  And I was in the same camp in our previous cars, which were Fords.  But the the Volvo has its own app  and its own mapping system that I think is it is definitely superior  to Apple Maps and is superior to Google Maps.  We just basically there's on the screen.  You can you can just scribble in the name of the destination that you want.  Oh, that's kind of your finger, which is really nice.  Or you can use the app to find it,  which and then it will use Google Maps to locate it.  It was sent to the car and then you can navigate it there.  And the killer feature for me is that it puts your current position  and all your navigation instructions, both in the console,  right in front of you in between the speedometer and, you know, right,  right there and in the heads up display. That's nice.  So yeah, so yeah, so I've found myself using the built in navigation there  in preference.  That's the only thing in CarPlay that I don't use anymore.  And we used to use Google Maps in CarPlay all the time,  which was about as ecumenical as you can get. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I'll line up. Yes.  And isn't it I was like looking at what's going to happen  and my eyes kind of glossed over like I'm curious what you guys think,  because are you bored?  Are you done with Apple?  Not with this show, with the Apple products a little bit.  Yeah, because it's like, all right, what are the big announcements  we're expecting?  Maybe an iPad.  Yeah, I think that's a good question.  I think that's a good question.  And then the big announcements we're expecting, maybe an iPad,  you know, different colors on the MacBook and then a carbon copy of tile.  And it's interesting, you know, looking at Apple, a company that we used to,  like, you know, kind of count down the days to see their next big product reveal.  And this is what we're dealing with now.  And for me, like the more interesting stories about Apple are like,  what's going on with the battles with their app store?  Right.  You know, what's going on with their fight with Fortnite  and what's going to play out with tile?  Well, we certainly talk about that too.  Yeah, like we're starting to move.  And maybe this is just me, but I feel like when the conversation about Apple  is starting to move from look at the awesome power of these products to,  you know, is this company wielding its power in a way  that is detrimental to markets and detrimental to others?  And I just think it's marking a really interesting shift  in terms of what's happening with Apple.  And I know it's not going to win me many friends to say that.

Start time: 1942.54

Transcript:  Well, they're playing it safe.  I mean, we are for everybody.  We're at peak.  Technology, we haven't, I mean, you know, until the augmented reality  glasses or whatever the next big thing is, comes along.  That's normal.  You've seen this at several many times, right?  You hit right. You hit a plateau and there's no innovation for years.  I mean, that that that I expect.

Transcript:  Right there in the they're in the rent extraction phase.  Yes, that's that's one way to put it. Yes.  Yeah. And there's a great deal of of rent to be extracted here.  I mean, I think and of course, everyone has been waiting for,  you know, the Apple self-driving car or whatever they do with a car.  But even there, I don't expect it to be magical and revolutionary.

Start time: 1993.22
End time: 2013.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I mean, honestly, Apple, I mean, maybe you're a little jaded, Alex.  Apple, just the last announcement  announced that they were abandoning Intel and creating their whole  a whole new chip architecture just for Macintoshes.  That's a pretty powerful thing to say.  That's that's I mean, don't you think that's a significant announcement?

Start time: 2014.56
End time: 2020.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's a big deal.  And I won't discount that at all.  Yeah. Let's see what it looks like in production.  You know, I love it.

Start time: 2020.40
End time: 2032.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I already have an M1. Oh, yeah.  People I was. Yeah, it's impressive.  You can feel the difference in your computer. Oh, absolutely.  Oh, yes. Alex, let me get you one.  You got to see it's amazing reviews.

Start time: 2033.84
End time: 2079.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The reviews were impressive, like the feedback has been, you know,  across the board, like it was pretty impressive.  But but I see what Alex is saying.  I mean, this is the thing about Apple is that, you know, they they come in.  And, you know, for probably for many years.  And this is why I talked about the architecture of iOS.  iOS, you know, is very secure and they love to talk about their security.  But, you know, the Apple does things their way and their, you know,  services and things have a little bit more  leeway on their operating system than other apps. Right.  So this whole find my is going to be running 24 seven in the background of iOS  where tile, I don't believe was ever allowed to do that.  And so just by that little tiny distinction, the Apple find my system works  and it works in a big way.

Start time: 2079.34
End time: 2086.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

End time: 2100.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's not. But if they're doing third party, it makes it seem like you're welcome  into this. But we all know that that's a license thing that, you know,  yeah, they're working with Belkin, who is, you know, obviously a very tight knit  company with Apple. How about this?

Start time: 2100.46
End time: 2156.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Van move. I'm challenged. Alex has challenged me.  Now I'm going to give you another one, Alex, because one of the things we expect  to hear on Tuesday is the introduction of iOS 14.5.  And you know, as somebody who's been writing about Facebook, that Facebook is  terrified of what Apple is about to do for the first time ever.  I mean, you know, on an iPhone, when you install a new app, the app will have to  tell you it's what permissions it wants and most specifically will have to ask  you for permission to track you.  Facebook's saying this is bad for small business.  It's bad for Facebook. People are really worried about this.  I think this is only a company like Apple with the kind of ecosystem it has could  say, yeah, in fact, we're going to we're going to screw all of you guys on the  track. Our users know.  Don't you think that's a big deal?  I think that's a huge deal.

Start time: 2157.10
End time: 2300.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I actually have two minds about it.  So I actually do like the privacy stuff that Apple is introducing and Apple.  You know, I wrote the book looking at the culture and leadership practices of the  big five tech companies.  And without a doubt, the employees I spoke with let me know that Apple is the one  that takes user privacy most seriously on the inside.  You know, Google, Facebook are all too easy, or at least it has been relatively  easy to get user data at Apple.  It's a huge pain in the butt.  So, you know, I think that they do walk the walk and talk the talk, but I wish they  were a little bit more upfront about why they were talking the talk.  So why is Apple so against Facebook?  And of course, you know, maybe Tim Cook does have it in his heart that, you know,  Facebook is inherently unjust and must be, you know, reined in.  But he should also mention the fact that they're competing with them based off of  product. So, you know, you talked about ecosystem lock in, right?  iMessage locks people into the iPhone and the Mac because they know if they were  going to switch off, they become green bubbles in their group chats were going to  break. Now, when people start using Facebook's products, things like Messenger,  WhatsApp, Instagram, it becomes so much easier to switch off an iPhone, switch off  a Mac, because the most important thing you do with those phones is communicate  with your friends and family.  And if you can do that just as easily on an Android as you can in the iPhone, not  have to worry about coming up as a green mobile, not have to worry about breaking  your group chats. And you can make that switch more easily.  And Apple knows this and Facebook knows this.  And only Facebook is willing to say that actually, like, you know, they're  competitors with Apple, whereas Apple is trying to play this as like we're taking  the moral high ground by making you more aware of privacy while trying to kneecap  their competitor. Of course, we could talk for hours about their business.  And and not only that, and Facebook's going after the next big operating system  that Apple has its eyes on, which is a virtual reality.  Facebook has a ton of people working on Oculus.  Apple is dilly dallying with AR, but we've heard about forever.  We haven't seen anything.  So I think we need to just like have the context with it.  Yes, these privacy moves are big.  I welcome them as a consumer.  I want to have more privacy.  But I also want more honesty from Apple, you know, talking about what it's doing to  solidify the power of its own ecosystem, the anticompetitive component of this as  well. And I don't expect us to hear that from Tim Cook anytime soon, because I think  the media tends to give him a pretty big pass and say, look at this man.  He's standing up for the values we all believe in without looking one layer  deeper. So that's my hope.

Start time: 2301.06
End time: 2347.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree with you. And I mean, we talk about on MacBreak Weekly, Apple's position  with China. Apple tried to do its own ad platform and failed.  So they've embraced, you know, blocking and tracking.  And it's clearly, you know, it's a it's a it's a profit making company.  This is a marketing thing.  We're for privacy. Those other guys aren't.  But they're also walking the walk.  It's not just the talk. I mean, I think they are making good moves in favor of  privacy and whether they're doing it because they're altruistic.  I don't think any corporation's altruistic.  Their job is to make money and it's good business.  So it's good. It's good for us.  Well, they're not going to say it's good.  This is not going to say that nobody's going to ever say that.

Start time: 2347.82
End time: 2351.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 2351.94
End time: 2376.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  I think I think it's it's pretty clear Apple's a corporation.  It's you know, I think there are a lot of Apple fans going way back to the earliest  days who, you know, love the company and have this great, you know,  this is my team and it's the computer for the rest of us.  And I think differently.  But everybody, if you think about it, knows you may love Apple,  but Apple doesn't love you. They love your money.  That's right. Yeah.

Start time: 2376.60
End time: 2386.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One nice thing about like what they're doing here is it shows us the power of the  markets, functioning markets, right? Providing.  Exactly. What they want.  If we want privacy, then Apple wins.  Apple people don't.

Start time: 2387.16
End time: 2428.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wins by providing people something they ask for.  That's exactly right.  So I think that I will watch on Tuesday with what they announced,  but I can almost promise you get your bingo card ready.  Privacy will come up.  You know, even I'm even Microsoft saying this.  And the last time such an Adele came on stage, he talked about trust and  and sovereignty and things like that.  I mean, he really he also realizes, you know,  Microsoft succeeds to the degree that Facebook and Google fail  and Amazon fail.  And so privacy is good for Microsoft.  It's good for Apple.  And it just maybe it's a side effect that it's good for the rest of us, too.  It's good for business. Let's put it that way.  We'll take it. We'll take it.

Start time: 2428.96
End time: 2501.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And let's be honest, it's been it's been a privacy free for all for the Internet  for the past 20 years.  I mean, these entire companies like YouTube and AdSense and everything  that Google runs and Facebook and everyone.  I mean, it's all been based on our user information.  And Apple has kind of latched into that and realized that, you know,  they sell a lot of products that, you know, don't necessarily rely  on our personal data and the stuff that does, you know, like Apple News and stuff.  They personalize on a device basis.  So they found a spot that they can really kind of burrow into.  And consumers like it because it is, you know, when I use an iPhone,  I do feel like the stuff I do on there is not leaving into a million  different trackers. And, you know, whereas on Android, it definitely feels like it is.  And so I think that there's a lot of change in store for these big advertising  companies and big tech companies, because they have to kind of rethink the game,  because it's not just when you get that message that says, you know,  I opened the Wall Street Journal the other day and I got the message that was like,  hey, can we track you across all of the websites you visit so that we can  deliver you better ads? And what I say, I said, no, you've got to be crazy  to say yes to that. I mean, who's going to say yes to that?

Start time: 2501.72
End time: 2548.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that happened with me and Venmo.  And I was like, Venmo, you're you want to track me across all the websites?  I thought I was just using you to do payments person to person.  But it turns out that Venmo wants a whole lot more data.  So I know the big headline is Apple versus Facebook, as it should be.  But I think one of the cool side effects of this is we're going to start to see,  you know, how many apps are out there really tracking  and have been tracking for a long time.  And by the way, they track on the iPhone.  So, you know, I think Apple is starting to now catch up to some of its rhetoric.  You know, what happens on the iPhone stays on the iPhone.  Well, really, that's not really the case because they have the store  that enables you to download apps to track you and go elsewhere.  So, you know, now they're starting their actions are starting to catch up  with their marketing. And I think that's good.

Start time: 2549.52
End time: 2574.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple apparently has some sort of flock style segment  thing it does with audiences to Apple is not completely out of the tracking business,  but it's poorly documented.  We're not really sure what it does.  And that's the the downside of Apple being kind of,  you know, so secretive and closed off and proprietary.  We don't really know for a fact that Apple's not tracking us.  In fact, there's some evidence they are.

Start time: 2575.36
End time: 2661.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, OK, and let me this is this is fascinating.  So, you know, when you look at something like the Apple Watch and  where I saw anyway, it's one of these things where they know  what you're looking at, what you're using on the watch,  how you're using the watch, right?  Like what what apps you use the most, how, you know, even like a flow of like  you go from your home screen to the stopwatch to a workout.  I mean, there's a lot that they do that like you wouldn't really think.  Even OK, this is the best example.  If you have an iPhone and you have Siri suggestions on board,  you know, like you have the widget with Siri, just put it on your home screen  or put on a screen for a little bit.  And I'm not kidding, because I dial the same two phone numbers  every morning for KTLA to do, you know, to set up my live shot.  And so every morning, as soon as I put in my headphones, it says,  oh, do you want to dial this first number?  Because you always do.  So I always do.  And then it says, as soon as I disconnect that call, says,  do you want to dial this number?  I say, wow, of course.  And then it says, do you want to check your Facebook?  Because that's what you typically do after this.  I mean, the fact is, you know, and this may not leave your phone like  Apple may argue that that just stays on your phone and that Siri, you know, smarts.  But the reality is that it's a little window into just how much these companies  know about what we're doing and the patterns and trends that they can  extrapolate in a million different ways.  And if it's a company like Facebook, they've you know, they're doing it for real.

Start time: 2662.40
End time: 2708.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess it's to whose benefit.  So Apple would say, well, we're doing this for you, Rich.  We're not doing it for third party advertisers.  We're doing it for you.  So and we keep it to ourselves.  So, OK.  Remember, Google tried to do the same thing with the Google Now and Google cards.  And it shut down.  I'm not and I thought, oh, this is going to be great.  It's going to know what I do.  It's going to tell me ahead of time, you know, oh, don't forget.  Do this. That's going to be useful.  I love that idea.  I think probably. Yeah.  People probably didn't like it because they were worried  to what Google was going to do with it.  So this is another reason, Alex, why Apple is going to double down on  privacy is because they want to do these kinds of things.  But they know that if if they're not very clear that they're going to keep it  to themselves, people aren't going to aren't going to play along.

Start time: 2709.66
End time: 2766.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so that is definitely a big move.  I think my comment earlier about glossing over at their products,  I think that stance because, oh, yeah, you know, they're they're  they're innovating at the margins.  And I know that they've just introduced these this, you know, this important chip.  But I don't think making your computer faster changes your life.  And Apple, I mean, it's tough to expect a company to make life  changing products over and over and over again.  But Apple has.  And yeah, I'm just wondering, you know, are these going to become kind of rote  or are we going to continue to start to see, you know, the sort of life  changing type of invention coming out of that company?  You know, we talk a lot about what's going to happen with Apple and AR,  what's going to happen with the Apple car.  And, you know, I don't know, maybe maybe I'm expecting too much out of them.  But I don't think so.  And that's why to me, these these new product releases are  fairly run of the mill. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

We actually, there are some, we have been able to kind of peek behind the curtain at some Apple.  So just a couple more Apple stories just real quickly.  One, Apple Music has revealed how much they pay per stream.  And this is really a shot against Spotify and the other streamers.  Apple told artists, they sent a letter that they pay a penny a stream,  which is about 10 times what some other streaming services pay,  double what Spotify pays per stream.  Spotify pays an average of about a third to a half penny per stream.  Of course, Spotify has got a bigger user base.  So a hit on Spotify is going to generate a lot more streams.  But Apple, Apple wants musicians to think anyway.  This is another one. This is marketing again.  Exactly.  To think anyway that Apple loves them.  Any thoughts?  If Taylor Swift were here, what would she say?

Transcript:  I thought there are several good analyses of that that I read this week,  but it's basically taking one set of numbers and comparing them to a completely different set of numbers.  I won't say apples and oranges, but you know, the apples and Spotify.  And Spotify has free plays.  Apple doesn't, for example.  And just a much huger base.  And Apple is completely non-transparent about the way that it compensates artists.  It mushed together the payments that it makes to labels and artists there.  But then the the compliant press picked it up and just interpreted that as all this money going to artists.  And if you talk to artists, they will tell you that, no, they don't get all that money.  So, you know, the whole thing struck me as one of the one of the less  Seemly examples of Apple PR trying to distort its competitive position.  I didn't. It made me clench my teeth.

Transcript:  There's no question that they, in fact, I don't think they hoped that it would leak.  They probably leaked it.  They probably managed the leak.  I mean, there is nothing.  If something leaks from Apple and it's not supposed to leak from Apple, then, you know, then you have lawsuits and stuff.  But stuff leaks from Apple all the time.  And this this has all the hallmarks of a deliberate leak with PR intent behind it.

Transcript:  And let's not forget the war between Spotify and Apple.  I mean, that's another Alex is talking about it.  Yeah. But, you know, I mean, why is why Spotify the most popular music service in the world?  Not on the Apple Watch.  It makes zero sense.  The Apple Watch has been out for five years.  It there's no way that that Spotify can't come up with an app that works on the watch.  So, you know, there's there's there's a lot going on here.  There just is. And, you know, it's something it's more than meets the eye.  And little stories like this make people feel good about Apple.  And, you know, I'm sure, yeah, they probably do pay a little bit more.  Who knows? But the reality is there's many more moving parts.  I'm sure every artist out there would rather have Spotify on people's wrists right now  than two cents from a stream on Apple Music.

I mean, which is funny, because if you think about every computer in the world, you know,  you're able to set your defaults, you know, even on Android forever.  Apple Maps still, if you know, if you have an Apple watch or your or your any sort of voice command  is still going to go to Apple Maps and music, you know, is still right now.  I mean, you could say play something on Spotify, but nobody does that.  I mean, who who it's tough enough to learn these commands to, you know, and then to to verify,  you know, whatever, to explain them even further is even tougher.

Actually, they did in 2019, but we're just now learning spent moved seventy five billion  dollars in profits through Ireland using the the traditional double Irish.  Does this have the Bermuda reach around in this one?  I don't know. But in other words, avoiding tax by offshoring profits is a longstanding thing.  I thought you couldn't do that anymore. Is that still legal?  They did in 2019. Yeah.  Oh, they did use they did use the Bermuda reach around.  So it does sound bad. I don't I think I made that up.  And there was the double the double Irish, the double Dutch.  They apparently the company Google Ireland Holdings is registered in Ireland  before the purposes of paying tax domiciled in Bermuda.  Man, you know, look, it's obviously legal.  They wouldn't do it. You know, if you if you if you confront these guys with it,  they said, well, we're we're just doing what the law allows us.  You should talk to Congress.  But of course, Congress writes the laws because Google tells them to.  So anyway, just I thought I'd spread the hate a little extra just going around.

But well, many of these laws are written by lobbyists, literally written by lobbyists.  Yeah. Yeah. And so it's like, well, we can't we can't ask Congress.  And that's why people feel like the system is rigged against them.  You have a common person paying a ton of taxes.  And then you have these, you know, big companies paying lobbyists,  paying think tanks, they influence what's and they write the laws.  Then they don't pay taxes.  And then they just throw their hands up and they say, it's the system.  It's a system. And then you wonder why people want to bring the system down.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Australia continues its attack on Google.  The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission says that Google broke the law.  And they've been they've been found to have, quote, partially misled  Australian consumers about collecting location data.  This actually was a federal court ruling  handed down in an action brought by the consumer rights watchdog.  It turns out when you turn off location history on some Android and Pixel phones.  The location history is still being collected.  You have to turn off location history and Web and app activity.  So Google continue to collect location data if Web and app activity was on.  And the justice said this was partially, partially misleading.  Not sure if if there will be a consequence to Google, but.

Transcript:  I mean, you know, this is you're using this is giving me  deja vu to a I think a conversation that we had.  You and I had probably six or seven years ago now on on this exact same topic.  And you were saying something then that you said just a few minutes ago,  which is that, you know, why should I object to this?  Because I want Google to make my life better.  I want people to keep track of location on.  And and my argument was there that Europe, you and I come from a position  of fairly extreme privilege in all of this.  And the fact that all of this data is being collected and assembled  into not just dossiers, but the raw material for dossiers  that can be built on the fly at any time.  And it just has the potential to impact all kinds of people  who don't have the kind of privilege that we do.  So things like redlining, things like credit decisions, things like, you know,  you you walked into this store and you, you know, and this store,  it's a payday loan shop.  Boom, you can't get a loan anymore.  And that's in your location history.  And, and, you know, and it doesn't matter that you walked in there because  you were keeping a friend with something.

Transcript:  Yeah.  And not just credit, but I mean, you know, insurance companies,  let's say that, you know, Google knows when you're speeding.  I mean, let's be honest, they see your location changing and their algorithm  could figure out exactly how fast you're going.  And I'm not saying they're doing that, but if they wanted to, that's something  they could easily do.  And let's say they sold that money to insurance companies and then they,  you know, and then they, you know, cross referenced it against the people they  insure and they say, rich, we've noticed that you like to go 90 in a 70.  And so we're going to raise your rates.  And I say, oh, I didn't know my phone was doing this.  And it's just the reality of like, we don't know what's happening here with this  data and we don't know until we do know.  And I think that's the scary part is that like what Ed was saying with these,  you know, the stores you go to, there's a startup out there that's going to say,  oh, we can figure out someone's credit profile based on where they shop.  They go to a liquor store every day or a Target or a, you know, Home Depot.  We can figure out what kind of credit profile they have based on that in our  smart algorithms. And so-  Or Dollar General, for example.

We may keep track of what phone calls Rich Demuro makes every morning, but we  don't tell anybody.  Would you be willing to use a solution like that, Ed?  You got an iPhone, I guess you are.

Start time: 3766.01
End time: 3816.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I agree.  That's the other thing. Apple, by putting all this emphasis on privacy, we're  letting them write the rules, you know, and, you know, and all these companies  that, you know, is there anything really that's, you know, the Europe was pretty  big about all the regulations with privacy, but like in America, it's still  pretty wide open to what is allowed and, you know, available to people.  And I'm not saying, you know, like, look, these are just new companies that are  doing this, like the Googles of the world.  But Leo, to your point, yeah, this tracking has been going on forever.  Like, and I think Alex, someone said credit cards.  I mean, if you don't think that Chase is analyzing every single transaction that  you make and creating a profile that they then sell your data against something  else, and then that shows up as an ad somewhere.  I mean, this is all happening.  I mean, it's all happening.  Welcome to America.  I mean, we're in a capitalist society.

No, I'm just kidding.  Leo, when you call me the anti-Big Tech guy, I mean, I'm anti the BS, but, you know,  some things that Big Tech do is good.  We love Big Tech.  That's where this is, where this is really fundamentally what's driving everything I

Start time: 3876.18
End time: 3933.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think we need to like draw the distinction, like there are going to be  companies, we get to choose, you know, ultimately, you know, where we shop or what  we buy and there are trade-offs involved.  Well, good luck finding a company that doesn't drag you.  No, of course. But like when it comes to devices, because we're talking about Google  here, like ultimately it's a decision between do you want to buy a device where you are  the user and you are the customer?  It's Apple, right? You use the products, you're the customer.  Or do you want to buy the device where you're the user and somebody else is the  customer? And that's a Google device.  You know, you're using it, but the customer at the end of the day for Google is  advertisers, not the people buying the phone or not the companies that are using  Android because Android is open source.  So it's not like Google is making a ton of money that way.  And I think that when we when we do engage with technology, when we buy devices,  things like that, you know, this is a distinction that we should start drawing.  Maybe people already are, you know, am I going to be the user and the customer or am  I going to be the user and somebody else will be the customer, in which case they're  buying me?  What do you guys think of Flock?

Start time: 3933.56
End time: 4024.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you let's start with you, Ed.  What do you think of Flock?  This is Google's Google saying, all right, we're going to turn off the third party  tracking cookie where to stop tracking you.  Instead, what we're going to do is we're going to in browser, not off browser, but  in your browser, we're going to look at all the places you visit and we're going to  put you in a cohort.  You know, old white men for me, I guess.  I don't know. Old white podcasters.  I don't I don't know.  How do you neighbor?  We don't we don't really know yet what those cohorts are.  We don't know how big they are.  It's all kind of a work in progress or Google's being obscure, probably a little  bit of both.  Is this a Google's attempt is to give advertisers some information without  specific tracking.  There have been some complaints.  EFF says, well, it's just another data point that will allow companies to  fingerprint you because oh, and here's the other thing about Flock, which is wild.  After Google analyzes your behavior, puts you in a segment, then a little bit of  JavaScript, any site you go to can query.  Oh, what segment is this guy in?  So you're basically your browser.  And right now it's only Chrome because every other browser said, we're no way  we're doing this.  None of the Chromium browsers edge or brave or or anybody.  Vivaldi, Vivaldi.  They're not they're all taking that flock code out.  But Google, if you use Chrome, which is the like 90% browser, huge dominance.  If you use Chrome, any site that asks Google will say, oh, yeah, this guy's  segment 53 B is that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, this strikes me.  This strikes me as a lot of hand waving from Google and also a way of dealing  with of basically trying to end up at a midpoint that is still economically  advantageous to them in a way that, you know, if if they lose all ability to track,  then, you know, their their economic model, their business model collapses.  So this is their fallback position.

Start time: 4060.92
End time: 4102.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can't they? I mean, honestly, does it?  So the number one way Google makes money, I'm pretty sure maybe Alex, you know  better, but I'm pretty sure is in search and selling search terms.  So they have auctioned a very successful technique and there's maybe a little  self-dealing on that.  We'll talk about that in a bit, but they have an auction for keywords.  You buy the keyword.  And then when somebody searches for something and that keyword shows up,  your ad shows up, that's the, I think by far the most profitable thing Google does.  That it doesn't involve tracking at all.  If I search, you know, for cargo pants and the gap has bought that keyword,  I'm going to see that.  That's not tracking me.  That's just responding to my search term.

Transcript:  Even if it's 60% of their revenue, there's still another, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  And so another 12% of it is, you know, hardware and G Suite and stuff like that.  But there's still, there's still up in the 80% that's totally based on, on  advertising.  And I, I do not believe that the marketplace for search advertising is  completely keyword driven and that there's no other signals that are  integrated into that.  That would make, that would make no sense.  You know, for the way that Google operates.

Start time: 4143.74
End time: 4213.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you could definitely segment that stuff, but, you know, I think that.  Let's take, let's just kind of unpack this from, from Google side here.  If you gave me a, or from a consumer standpoint, which may be, maybe are  aligned, if you gave me the option to be tracked one to one, right.  So a marketer follows me around the web with a cookie and knows exactly what I  do and can pretty easily de-identify me, you know, because we know that this whole  anonymous tracking thing is often a lie.  And instead I'm placed in a cohort of a dozen or 20 people or something like that.  So they just track the group behavior on aggregate.  I'd be much more comfortable with the cohort and I don't know, maybe I'm an  outlier here, but I do think that like most of the tracking that's done on the  web doesn't really add up to all that much.  I think it's generally made out to be more than we hear in the common discussion  because ads on the web are still pretty terrible.  Like, I don't know how often, you know, Facebook, the most egregious tracker of  all, I don't know how often I see an ad on inside Facebook where I say, you know  what, this ad really gets me.  How do they know that?  I don't use Facebook, but I will tell you Instagram's ads work very, very well.

I mean, there's an app.  I mean, it's just, it's pretty wild.  So the advertising and maybe Alex, that's against your point.  Those are not targeted.

I was looking up this morning, this, you know, athletic brand.  And, you know, I look at the website, I go, okay, cool.  50 bucks for a pair of shorts, whatever.  Not going to buy.  Now all of a sudden I'm scrolling Instagram and it says, hey, get your first pair of  shorts for 50% off.  And I said, okay, cool.  Now I think in that case, it does work.  And would I rather see that than some random ad for something?  Probably.  So I think that the target more.  I, you know, I, I don't know.  I, I'm kind of, I don't know.  I don't hate the tracking.  I think that there's, you know, I think there's a time and place for it.  And I think that, like you said, like these Facebook is the master marketer and still  the ads I've always seen on there are terrible.  So, you know, maybe it doesn't work.

And maybe because Instagram is a sealed box, it's from Facebook, but I suspect that  the Instagram ads I see are directly connected to the Instagram people I follow and other  behaviors on Instagram, but they're shockingly good.  Those clearly know me well.  And of course, one of the things they do on Instagram is, you know, they sell t-shirts  that have your age, your town in the t-shirt, right?  You've seen those, right?  It's like, yeah, yeah.  It's like, I love Petaluma.  I see ads that say, I love, because I know that they're, that ad is so tight, highly  targeted, it's got my, you know, 64, ain't that old or something.

So, you know, they wouldn't be like, I love Petaluma, you know, they could end up being  with a whole group of others.  I have mixed feelings.  I love California.

Transcript:  Well, you're with one person and then all of a sudden the marketer, so the marketer can  use that to target, but then back into conversions and decide which to double down on.  Which is worse.  So you, you prefer the cohort idea.  I mean, if you're a privacy advocate, the cohort sounds better.  If you'd like to get ads that know what you're doing and make you think that Facebook is  listening to you, you probably want to be tracked one to one.  I think it's a matter of personal preference here.  So, that's why I like Apple.  It's deciding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why I like Apple.  Giving you the choice and says pops up says you want to be tracked.  And more and more you're seeing that.  I think one thing that's very clear is that consumers have are voting with their feet.  They're saying we do not want to be tracked.  In fact, that's why these browsers are not going to do flocking.  I wonder if this is going to hurt Chrome's market share.  I mean, I think more and more normal people, the people who watch Rich on TV or listen  to me on the radio, I think more and more normal people are aware of this and are responding  to it.  No doubt.

So you might end up being on Google.  You might be making the bet that you will.  You will vote with your feet.  I mean, honestly, if you're using a Google product, you're never going to win on privacy  because it's Google.  But at the end of the day, that would be their pitch.  Let me take a little break.

Transcript:  I want to talk about Amazon.  Jeff Bezos, his last letter as CEO says we have to do better.  Oh, and by the way, Elon Musk, best friend of the year.  Elon Musk beat Jeff Bezos in the space race on Friday with a big decision from NASA.  We'll talk about that too.  Our show today brought to you by World Wide Technology and Cisco.  WWT has spent the last couple of decades building knowledge, building expertise to help  enterprise companies do a better job with technology.  And I think there's one area that you really need to know about WWT and that's security.  That has become job one for every company in the world.

Jeff Bezos retiring, stepping down as CEO is going to be the chairman of the board,  but less focused on day to day operations.  He's handing over the reins to Andy Jassy.  He's kind of maybe this is another one of the, it seems like the whole show has been  about corporate spin and PR.  And maybe this is more of the same.  In the letter he says, if you've read some of the news reports, you might think we don't  care about our employees.  Well we do, but maybe we ought to do better.  He's coming off a victory of course.  The Alabama warehouses voted against the union, fairly substantially voted against the union.  He says while voting results were lopsided and our direct relationship with employees  is strong, it's clear to me we need a better vision for how we create value from employees,  a vision for their success.  I'm sure Amazon will continue to fight unions.  On the other hand, there are things they can do to make it better to work at Amazon.  He said our employees are sometimes accused of being desperate souls and treated as robots.  That's not accurate.  Remember the, was it a book that said that if you didn't cry at your desk once a day  at Amazon, you really weren't working hard enough.  If any shareholders are concerned that Earth's best employer and Earth's safest place to  work, that's his goal, might dilute our focus on Earth's most customer centric company,  let me set your mind at ease.  Think of it this way, if we can operate two businesses as different as consumer e-commerce  and Amazon web services and do both at the highest level, we can certainly do the same  with these two vision statements.  I'm confident they will reinforce each other.  Do you think he genuinely is being a little affected by all of the blowback and wants  to do something to make it a better company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is Jeff Bezos' last letter to shareholders as CEO.  What he's thinking when he's writing this is legacy, legacy, legacy.  For him, he's reading the news and he's seeing what happened with the high profile Twitter  battle that led employees to end up sharing photos of the bottles that they've peed in  and letters telling them to stop pooping in bags with the press.  Basically Amazon is under fire for the way that it treats employees and it's on its  way to becoming the biggest employer in the US.  It's added a million employees in under a decade and it just keeps adding 100,000, 200,000  a year.  This is going to be Jeff Bezos' legacy because at the end of the day, he's going to be the  person who's going to be responsible for the state of the American worker because the American  worker is largely moving from places like the factory which produce things to places  like the fulfillment center which distributes things.  This stuff is going to continue to grow.  Amazon added 50 million prime members in the last year, up from 150 million.  That's stunning.  33% growth.

Start time: 4803.66
End time: 4898.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Bezos is thinking when people look back at him, they're going to look back at  the e-commerce company he built but they'll also look at the broader transformation that  he led in terms of the economy and the way that work is structured.  Of course there were other factors that were involved there.  That's why I think we heard so much about the worker there.  Does Amazon care?  Yeah, actually I think Amazon cares a lot more than we end up hearing in the press reports.  I don't think it's a miserable place for so many people to work.  It can be really tough.  But I do think that the reality there is somewhere in between what we hear and some of the worst.  It's not like everybody goes in and brings their bottle to work and pees in it twice  a day.  There are good jobs at Amazon but they definitely have room to improve.  Amazon was freaking out when people were talking about the way that their employees are treated.  There is some righteous indignation that they can have.  The United States politicians are the ones that sign trade deals like NAFTA and encourage  China to join the WTO which ended up having us trade those production jobs with women  jobs and Amazon pays $15 minimum wage or the federal government has a $7.25 minimum wage.  And so I kind of see Amazon's side a little bit when they're looking at these politicians  from the US government saying you got to treat workers better and Amazon's like you're  supposed to be looking after the workers.  In America, I mean of course Amazon we talked about has lobbyists but there have been decades  where our politicians have had a chance to make the situation better and they've failed.

Start time: 4899.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can also make the case that voting down the union in Alabama was a vote of confidence  from the workers saying we prefer Amazon management, we don't need a union.

Start time: 4908.60
End time: 4963.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd buy that more if Amazon didn't go through the painstaking union busting process that  it did.  If Amazon had that vote be, let that vote be fair and didn't compel people to go into  education systems and start getting the post office to have this mailbox in that might  have made some people think that they were going to read their ballots.  That might be one thing.  If you really think that you can stand up based off of the merits, you don't need to  bring the union busting firm in.  You obviously have a right to defend yourself against unionization if you don't want it  but to just go through such effort and to be so against it.  I don't think this was entirely the workers standing up and saying we don't want a union.  Obviously Amazon had a role in it and Amazon's like this wasn't a victory for us, it's what  the workers wanted but Amazon corporate was definitely a victory for them.  They had a side, they picked a side, they pushed it real hard and then we saw the impact

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of it.  It's an interesting goal to become Earth's best employer and Earth's safest place to  work.  A lot of this letter was talking about how we already are great.  So I'm not sure exactly what he plans to do to make it the best employer and the safest  place to work.

Start time: 4983.18

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well there's a couple things here.  Number one, Bezos is doing what Bill Gates did 15 years ago.

Start time: 4994.28
End time: 4996.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Andrew Carnegie did before him, right?

Start time: 4997.10
End time: 5018.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Andrew Carnegie did back in several generations ago.  And people were skeptical about Bill Gates walking away from a day to day role with Microsoft  and yet that's exactly what he did.  And became a philanthropist.  Has really become his primary focus there.

Start time: 5019.44
End time: 5023.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess like Andrew Carnegie, some of that was to renovate his reputation.

Start time: 5025.55
End time: 5133.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think to a large extent.  But there was also, I think people who know Bill will say that there was some genuine personal  transformation that happened along the way.  But I think the other thing about the whole union vote, there's two factors there that  we really need to keep in mind.  One is that this vote took place in probably, perhaps the worst possible place to have a  union vote.  This is one of the reddest states in the country.  One of the reddest states with one of the most powerful so-called right to work traditions.  I just get angry when I have to use the phrase right to work because it's the exact opposite  of what it should be.  Right now, the United States is one of the most anti-union countries in the world.  And so basically Bezos is operating as the kinder, gentler face of what every corporation  is doing.  They don't have to bust unions anymore.  The unions are in shambles.  They're in shards on the ground.  And with an NLRB that isn't able to really influence the course of the election very  much, this one seemed kind of preordained.  It's a country that's anti-union.  It's a state that's aggressively red and anti-union.  So I guess this didn't surprise me at all.  And for Bezos to come back and say, well, thank goodness that our employees love us  so much.  No, I don't think that's what it means.

Start time: 5134.76
End time: 5153.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He quoted 94% of our employees saying they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place  to work.  He says, we want to make that 100%, but 94 is not bad.  This is better than Wendy's.  Well, and it pays better than Wendy's, I might add, and pays better than Walmart, I might  add.  There are plenty of...

Start time: 5153.38
End time: 5161.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And at the end of the day, the workers did vote.  They did get to vote.  They got to vote.  I can't discount their choices, even though Amazon influenced it.

Transcript:  This is Jeff Bezos'...  It's his farewell.  Do you think this is his attempt to kind of leave on a high note and then just kind of  walk away, wash his hands of the whole thing?  How well will Amazon do without Jeff Bezos at the helm?  I think for whatever you don't like about him, you have to say strategically, he's amazing,  right?  I mean, he's brilliant.  Or no?  I mean, the culture...  Go ahead, Alex, you first.

Start time: 5198.52
End time: 5207.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would just say that the culture that he's built, when you start to look at it upfront,  and of course, there's an element of how workers are treated, I think could be better.

End time: 5217.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's a big difference between the experience in the warehouse and the experience  in the executive suite, right?  I mean, they're two different jobs, very different jobs.

Start time: 5217.60
End time: 5347.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No doubt, no doubt, but there are some constants where both of those, both workers in the fulfillment  centers and workers in the corporate offices can have their jobs automated away and will  have to adjust.  In fact, this past week on Big Technology Podcast, I had one of the people who worked  in Amazon's corporate offices, a woman named Elaine Kwan, who had her job automated away.  She was on the phone with Gucci and Versace stocking the fulfillment centers.  And then all of a sudden that was handed over to machine learning.  So it's, you know, everybody inside that company needs to be able to adapt and embrace change.  And you look at most big companies and they just kind of make something and they stop.  Like this was the case with Microsoft for a long time, where they made Windows, they  were the desktop operating system, and they stopped.  And only after we moved to mobile and the cloud did they actually have to catch up and  they've done a good job, although they were pretty late to the game.  But you look at Amazon and they're always one step ahead of what's going on.  You know, bookstore, then selling everyone through a first party marketplace, they build  a third party marketplace, logistics and fulfillment, voice computing, hardware manufacturing,  or something like the Kindle, not to mention the fact that they are a grocer and Academy  Award winning movie studio.  And now they're moving into healthcare.  And you don't excel at all that stuff unless your culture, your leadership and your processes  and internal technology are locked in.  And I don't think there's anybody on the planet right now that's done a better job at that  than Bezos.  So I think the company will be able to survive.  And the big question is whether they're going to be able to keep that mentality that Bezos  has instilled from his position at the top after he leaves.  Jesse, of course, has shouted him as his technical advisor back in the day before he built AWS.  He's done a good job with AWS, built it into a massive business.  But you never quite know until the person at the top leaves.  And we know with Microsoft, Bill Gates left and they put Steve Ballmer in, who was just  there to, you know, ended up making money and they needed to make another leadership  change to get back to their more inventive ways.  So that'll be a question with Amazon.  But I think Bezos' legacy as somebody who is, who's been able to build a powerhouse company,  I don't think that's ever going to, you know, go into question in the long term.

Transcript:  Developers, developers, developers.  And he also made that he made two really bad bets.  He made a bet on advertising that didn't pan out.  He made a bet on mobile that didn't pan out.  But they were both very sensible bets, logical.  And the fact that they didn't turn out had more to do with external market forces than anything else.  But he also, in the background, was building the cloud infrastructure that became Azure,  that became the basis for Office 365 and then Microsoft 365.  And all of that stuff was with Satya Nadella, who was reporting directly to him,  who was building all of that stuff under under Ballmer's leadership.  I think ultimately, when you go back to it, what happened is that Microsoft as a company was built to do a specific thing,  to grow, you know, to find an area of technology and just grow it relentlessly.  And I think Amazon is the same thing.  It's a company that was built to squeeze margin out of everything, to become more efficient at everything.  And so everything that they've gotten into, that was an impressive list that Alex, you know, spooled out there.  And the defining characteristic of all of those things is that each one of them,  they're extremely efficient and extremely market focused.  And that's the kind of company that they built. That's the kind of people they hired.  So, you know, it's a juggernaut. It's just going to keep on moving.  And if it falls apart, it will fall apart years from now, you know, not in the next two or three years,  because that's not what happens to juggernauts.

Transcript:  I think you're right that he's sorry. I think you're right that he's getting out at the right time, though,  because you do have Congressional investigation is looking into them.  You know, the Congress is going to pass new laws.  Lena Kahn, who wrote about like how Amazon needs to have stricter antitrust regulation is now on her way to the FTC.  So, you know, Bezos might have seen all that coming and said, you know what?  Now's a good time for me to think about space. How about space?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I think that I was just kind of thinking what Ed just said about, you know,  they squeezed efficiencies out of these various industries like, you know, they're going into grocery right now and everything.  And but but every tech company that comes along these days, that's their mission.  I mean, they're they're rewriting the book for just about everything that we do in this world.  And Amazon was early on that. I mean, they they started with the bookstore and they just continued to disrupt more and more.  And I don't see that changing anytime soon.  When you look at I read a statistic, I know, last year or something where, you know, Amazon, you think that they're,  you know, that you would think that they control everything when it comes to, you know,  commerce and it's just a small fraction still when it comes to what they are able to sell online and how many people they reach.  And so I, you know, even without Bezos on board, I think they're going to that's probably the worst thing you could say,  because I think he is on the board, but he's not at the helm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, I think that this company was set up to to disrupt and they will continue to do that.  But then again, every company that comes along nowadays is disrupting what we knew and love.  And so I don't know. I think that it's a company.  It's I'm just thinking about all the things that we've talked about so far.  It's in America right now. It's very conflicting because we love Apple, but we hate them.  We love Google, but we hate the show is a love Amazon example of all that.

Start time: 5617.02

And I say, I can't believe someone has to bring this to my house because, you know, it saves me two dollars.  But then when I tweet that out, people say, well, look, you know, that truck is driving down your street no matter what, whether they're there or your house.

Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Jeff actually addresses a lot of this in that letter.  He talks about that, in fact, it's he makes a strong case for the the value Amazon has added to the to the country and to secondarily the world.  One of the things Amazon has never been able to do is make itself a global power to the degree that it wanted to be.  It's still while there is Amazon dot C.A. and Amazon dot Australia, it's still really an American company because Asia has got Alibaba.  And I don't think I bet you that's one he didn't talk about it, but I bet you that's one area where Bezos felt like maybe he didn't succeed to the degree he wanted to.  He talks about being the best company in the world, but it really isn't the world.  It's a smaller, smaller part of the world.  He says Earth Earth, which is, by the way, telling, isn't it?  Let's talk about Jeff's space ambitions.  We'll do that in just a second.  Ed Bott is here from the Ed Bott report on ZDNet.  That's Rich on Tech.  Don't confuse the two.

The scraps.  Our show today brought to you.  Actually, some of it's pretty fun.  Our show today is brought to you by Podium.  Think about it.  You know, if you get a text message as you leave a drug store, a grocery store, an ice cream shop or a dentist,  you're going to be much more likely to see that than and respond to it than an email that you get days, months,  weeks later.  That's what Podium does.  Podium is the messaging platform you can use to power your business.  It helps you reach your customers wherever they are.  Business messaging with Podium can be used to get reviews, collect payments, communicate, capture leads.  And it all goes into one inbox.  Your employees will like that.  It makes it very easy.  They can even use their own phone's messaging system to respond.  Podium lets you adapt to changing customer expectations.  And I have to say, I would far rather communicate with a business via text than have to call them because that's easier for me.  Ninety eight percent of text messages will be opened email.

Late NASA big announcement.  They're awarding a contract to build the moon lander to SpaceX.  Blue Origin had bidded, bidded, bid, had bid, had bid, lost the bid.  In fact, I was talking to Rod Pyle who does our space stuff on the radio show.  He said basically NASA just didn't have the money to go with anybody else.  So they went with a low bidder, $2.9 billion to use SpaceX's Starship to take astronauts from lunar orbit to the moon.  NASA has a program, the SLS Orion program, which will take the astronauts into orbit.  They'll transfer over to the Starship and then fly to the moon and land on the moon probably 2025.  NASA had accepted proposals from Dynetics, which is a Huntsville, Alabama defense contractor and Blue Origin.  But SpaceX won the bidding.  And this could be very interesting.  Certainly good news for Elon Musk, bad news for Jeff Bezos, who has been moving a little bit more slowly with Blue Origin.  SpaceX has been very aggressive with Starship.  One of the things I love the most, John, you're a space fan.  You'll probably love this. Starship is there's no lunar lander.  Starship does. We've watched it happen on Earth.  It turns around and lands on the moon.  The whole thing like out of a 1950s sci fi movie.  Just lands on the moon.  Any thoughts?  Are you guys excited?  Rod said basically Richard Branson in all of this.  Oh, yeah.  Didn't he have a space?  You're right.  Virgin.  What is it?  Virgin space.

There was a horrific Tesla crash in Houston this week.  And I think there's a little bit of honestly, a little bit of blame to be assigned to Tesla on  this.  Two passengers were killed in the crash.  They were using Tesla's quote full self-driving features.  One of them was in the back seat.  The other was in the passenger seat.  They were not driving.  The car crashed into a tree, drove off the road, crashed into a tree, burst into flames and killed  both drivers.  And I think there's a little bit of blame, honestly, on Tesla on this, because they really  promote this full self-driving, but it isn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But what are they telling you to sit in the passenger seat?  No, they've no.  And I do think the car and I'm not, you know, of course, this is horrific.  But I think the car should have, you know, my car, if you get out of the passenger seat,  or if you're too light, it says, you know, the passenger airbag turns off or on, you  know.  So clearly you can detect with quite ease if someone's in that seat.  Why is this system working?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The only way Tesla knows there's not a sensor in the driver's seat is when you torque the  wheel a little bit.  And it is true that when self-driving is on, it periodically will, you know, if it doesn't  feel your hands on the wheels, they torque the wheel.  But I have to point out the General Motors, the Cadillac CT6 and their particular self-driving  stuff, Ford's going to do the same thing with, I think they call it Blue Drive, something  like that.  Blue Cruise.  Blue Cruise has a camera.  Yeah, it's a little sensor.  On the wheel.  And it's an infrared camera.  And it's checking not only to see that you're there, but that you're looking at the road  and watch it looks where your eyes are.  Yeah.  And that your eyes are open.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's you're not sleeping.  You could keep your hands off the wheel.  But as soon as you like I tested it with like, you know, putting on sanitizer.  And so as soon as I started making those motions with the hands, like doing something else,  that's when it said you got to put your hands back on the wheel.  But otherwise, I mean, their system is engineered to let you have your hands off the wheel comfortably.  But you do have to be paying attention, like you said, looking straight ahead.  So I don't understand why this Tesla that's so hyped up doesn't have something like that.  And I've seen little videos of people where they rig like a hand on the wheel that moves  it every so often or some kind of pressure on the wheel.  So I don't really understand that part of the world view probably, right?

Transcript:  But that's because traditional firefighting methods don't work on lithium ion batteries  because they generate their own oxygen.  So you can't smother a lithium ion fire.  You need to have the right kinds of chemicals to put it out.  And obviously, in this case, the Houston Fire Department did not.  They tried to put it out with water, which didn't work.  Didn't work.  So for the basically the car burned itself out.  And I suspect that's the cause of death, because if you look at the vehicle,  there sure isn't much left of that.  They wanted to go for a drive just before they left.  And we're talking about the vehicle's driverless features.  I'm going to guess because you do have to torque the wheel that the one guy got in the backseat.  Dumb.  And the other guy got in the passenger seat and was just torquing the wheel once in a while.  But he wasn't driving the car.  59 and 69 years old.  I'm not sure which one was the driver.  But it's a tragedy.

Transcript:  But I think you're right, Leo.  One of the things that you said right up front here, the original sin in this case  is the fact that the marketing department at Tesla was able to brand this product as  full self-driving.  And if you pay extra, you can get the beta stuff, which is even more full self-driving.  For any other kind of product, the Federal Trade Commission, if you label something  in such a misleading way, they will hammer you down with a 20-pound sledge.  And that's really what needs to happen here because this is not full self-driving.  This is driver assist technology.  And it's very good driver assist technology.  But the messaging that is coming across is just all wrong and it's guaranteed to lead  to situations like this.

Transcript:  Let's see.  A couple of other...  Oh, I know what I want to talk about.  Facebook's oversight board.  You had a good article about it on your big technology newsletter.  The oversight board has decided to defer the decision about Donald Trump.  It's one of the cases they've been working on.  Of course, Facebook...  Was it after January 6th or before January 6th?  The band...  After.  After.  They acted in an excess of courage.  They decided to ban Donald Trump after the insurrection in January 6th.  But the Facebook's advisory board has taken that...  Oversight board has taken that on.  And we'll decide if that ban was justified and whether to reinstate the former president.  Is the board working, Alex?  What do you think?

Start time: 6656.16
End time: 6754.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's two sets of opinions on this, which is something I laid out in the newsletter.  On one hand, people say that this is really just a head fake.  That the board can only review certain content moderation decisions,  not the recommendation algorithms, not the group.  They can't take down groups.  They can't review the fundamentals of the product.  So they're really just dealing with the periphery.  And Facebook is making it seem like we have a say where we really don't.  The other side of it, talking about whether the board makes a difference,  is people are like, well, what other choice do we have?  What alternative is there?  And so you can have Facebook make the decision.  You can have the government make the decision,  or you could have some form of public representation make the decision.  I personally think it's good to have the public make the decision in some way,  even if it's limited.  And this is a good start.  So I'm really curious to see what they ended up ruling.  I don't think we should say that, like, okay,  Facebook's washed its hands of all of its problems,  now that it has some third parties making a call like this.  But it is pretty significant that it's not Facebook itself  making the decision of whether to ban Trump or not.  And it is going to go to this board.  And I'm really curious what happens if Trump actually does return to Facebook,  because then Facebook becomes the one platform that's going to have Trump on it.  He's not on Twitter.  I think he's been banned from YouTube, too.  And how does that change the nature of Facebook if Facebook becomes Trump HQ  while the others are not?  And I'm pretty intrigued by what ends up happening over the next couple of weeks.  So, you know, they deferred it a little bit,  but I anticipate that this thing is going to come, you know, end of April, early May.  And it'll be really fascinating to see the outcome.

Start time: 6754.98

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  â They say they wanted to defer because they received 9,000 comments.  They asked for feedback.  And they wanted to read all 9,000 comments.  â Never read the comments.  â Never read the comments if there's one thing we've learned.

Start time: 6772.63
End time: 6889.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  â So, Alex, I thought that was a great column.  And two things struck me about it.  Number one, that you had the same expert commenting on both opposing sides of the question,  which really struck me as identifying the core of how, you know, just insurmountable  this problem seems to be.  But the other thing is I thought you wrote something that just,  I wanted to see it bold-faced.  I wanted to see it leap out.  You said, for years, people have questioned whether one company should have all that power.  But Facebook has the power now.  And that's kind of a theme of how we got to where we are in 2021.  Companies like Uber, companies like Facebook got here by finding a weakness in the market  and the regulatory structure, aggressively rolling over any kind of regulation that is there  and then acquiring the power and saying, well, we have the power now.  You can't, we have to find a way to deal with this.  And the third option here is to say, Facebook, you're out of business, or you're broken up.  You're broken into, I don't know, five different companies that do God knows what.  But the idea that, well, we have the power now and that's just a fait accompli seems  like something that shouldn't be dismissed as, if you got there through horrendous,  anti-competitive ways that basically trampled on what we see as societal norms,  that maybe it's worth revisiting the decisions of how we got there.

Transcript:  And I have to say, I mean, just purely subjectively, life has been a little bit calmer  with the daily 40 or 50 tweets from Donald Trump.  But that's interesting.  So why can't Facebook, why couldn't Facebook just have the nerve, the spine to do what  Twitter did and just say, we don't need an oversight board, we're just going to do it?  Is Facebook's oversight board a better solution than Twitter just saying,  we're just going to ban them forever.  That's it.

Transcript:  I don't know.  The more I think about this oversight board, the more I like it.  And I'm nervous to admit it in public because it's not a very popular stance.  But I generally think that we shouldn't have Facebook making these choices.  We shouldn't have the government making these choices.  Yes, Facebook is making, turning over a very narrow segment of its decisions to the public.  Yes, it handpicked all the first members of the board.

Don't like change the like core protections.  But I mean, ultimately, like we want, I think we want the public making these choices.  And we don't want to make have a man like Zuckerberg who runs a company  who's unaccountable even to his own board to be the final say on this.  And so why do we let Jack Dorsey do that?

Yeah, I wouldn't be upset to see some board like this set up for Twitter.  But I do think that we need a view with nuance, which is, you know, let's let's look at the good  for what it is, but also understand that part of it might be to to defer criticism.  I agree.  That situation.

Transcript:  That's bad.  It's an intransigent problem.  It's almost insoluble problem.  It's better to do something than nothing.  Exactly.  On the other hand, I have to say, maybe it's just me, but I feel like  the day the day of Twitter and Facebook is those days are waning.  I don't know what's going to replace them.  I don't know what the next thing is.  Maybe it's TikTok.  I don't know.  Maybe it's not social media.  My sense is maybe people are a little fed up with social media.  Is that is that just me, Ed?

Start time: 7101.16

Transcript:  But there's no indication that their influence has stopped.  And there's no indication that Twitter's influence in terms of  you know, sort of controlling the tentacles of attention to media has has stopped.  But the whole thing about the advisory board strikes me as pure PR because there's there's  a thousand things that are happening every day that are having negative impacts on communities,  on businesses, on people, on countries, on ethnic groups.  And the advisory board is only going to deal with the high profile ones that are too hot  for Mark Zuckerberg to handle.  And so it becomes a way to shovel those off and say, see, we have an independent board  dealing with these while the horrible things that are happening on a more granular level,  on a more local level are still happening and are still at the mercy of Facebook's  horribly broken or non-existent content moderation architecture.  So who should do that?  I don't know who should do that.  I wish that the fact that we're in a situation where somebody was able to build a thing  where three billion people in the world are able to launch a genocide,  you know, and nobody thought about that from day one.  You know, the idea that somebody has to say, well, whose job is it to fix that?  Sort of seems to me that we're asking the wrong question here.

I'm not on there either.  I mean, I'm on there in a public way, but privately I'm done with it because  it was no longer providing me the value that I wanted.  Right. And Twitter, I mean, you know, I use Twitter and I think Twitter is quite possibly  the perfect social media.  Twitter to me is a phone number that everyone has access to.  Right. If you tweet me, theoretically, I'm looking at my tweets and I can see your message along  with anyone else in the world.  I think that's amazing.  You know, and is Twitter to me a lot of nonsense and things that just kind of percolate  give me a break?  Sure.  Do I think it should go away or be burned to the ground?  No. And I think that, you know, and to answer Leo with social media in general, I mean, look,  this is a force in our world that will never go away.  It might be reinvented, but at this point we see the TikTok, like you said, and we see  Instagram is still just beginning to grow.  I mean, it's still just at the beginning.  And the influence that that has on travel, on places people go, on everything is just  absolutely unbelievable.  And will there be something else to overtake it?  Maybe.  You know, and Facebook, I think there's, you know, I think there's, I don't know,  as someone who uses it in a public way, I think it's amazing.  You know, I took a video yesterday, I posted it and the comments and the discussion I get  on my page is just phenomenal.  And I find it to be really interesting.  And, you know, I'm not in the political world, so maybe that's it.  I'm just, you know, I talk tech, but I will say I have seen in the past couple of years  the political fallout on my tech page.  You know, I work for a news station and people used to take what I said as it was real.  And now every time I post something, well, how do I know you're real?  How do I know this is not fake news?  I mean, it's, you know, the impact has been seen across the board.  And I do find that part quite interesting as well.

That I've seen since I started covering them about a decade ago, which is that we now have  TikTok is insurgent and TikTok is unbelievable.  I mean, there's so many complications with TikTok, but the product itself is incredibly  addicting. And I just picked it up during lockdown because I was bored and I am sucked  in all the way. And I think that poses a serious challenge to Facebook.  Then you think about some of this audio stuff.  And I would point out before you move on.

Transcript:  Just like Instagram copied stories.  I mean, if nothing else, Facebook's very adept at copying other people and buying  what they can't copy.  And I think you could make the strong argument that Facebook's success really has come from  the fact that they put Instagram and WhatsApp quickly out of business by buying them and  making sure that their success was Facebook's success.  Maybe the same thing with Oculus.  I don't know.  And Facebook putting stories on Instagram immediately kind of hurt Snapchat when they  couldn't buy them.  I don't know.  It's an interesting thing.  I just don't feel like Facebook owns the future necessarily or Twitter at all.

Transcript:  And look at the failures of Facebook.  Look at how many things they've started.  Remember a couple years ago, they did that big Facebook watch push where they were  getting into shows that they were producing.  And it's like a lot of the stuff that these companies do never works out.  I mean, Google's the same way.  Google's the king of failures.  Yes.

Start time: 7585.64
End time: 7607.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's what I'm saying.  So it gives us hope for the fact that Facebook is huge.  They've got three billion people on the platform and they couldn't make shows where they  paid people millions of dollars to produce YouTube style shows.  They couldn't make that work.  So that gives us hope that this is not just a numbers game of just pushing their way into  things.

Transcript:  Right.  Well, one interesting thing about Facebook watch is after they invested all that money  into it, they all of a sudden did a study and they found out that passive consumption  on Facebook actually makes people feel bad.  And so they shifted the algorithm.  Oh, that's right.  I remember that.  That's right.  And there went watch.

Transcript:  Yeah. So Facebook, if they're going after Clubhouse, you might also say they're going  after Spotify or at least the podcast ambitions of Spotify.  Although they're going to connect a podcast discovery product that will be connected  with Spotify.  It's very interesting.  I don't I think so that I don't know if I think Mark Zuckerberg is a product genius or not.  I think there's a lot of evidence he's not.

Start time: 7660.14
End time: 7716.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I would I would argue that none of the current tech CEOs are product  geniuses.  What they do very well is listen to their employees and then elevate those ideas to  you know, people who can actually make decisions and end up building the stuff like Jeff  Baszler didn't come up with all the stuff we talked about at Amazon on his own.  But he's a very good listener.  And I would say the same with Zuckerberg.  You know, we talked a little bit about the oversight board having 9000 things because  they asked for feedback and they have to delay.  And that didn't come out of nowhere.  I mean, it is the Facebook oversight board and the Facebook ethos is all about feedback.  And Facebook wouldn't be where it is today if there weren't specific people inside the  company that pulled Zuckerberg over and said, you know what, Mark, you're doing it wrong.  And if we don't do it this way, we're in trouble.  That happened with mobile that happened with stories.  And so, you know, I think the nice thing for Facebook is that Zuckerberg actually will  listen and that's how they've been able to stay relevant.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Let's take a quick break.  Lots of little stories.  I'm going to kind of do a speed round when we come back.  But first, because it is getting late.  First word from Uber for Business, our sponsor for this segment of This Week in Tech.  It's kind of hard to find easy ways, simple ways to keep employees engaged.  To keep customers happy, especially now when you can't really do face to face interaction.  If you're finding looking for a way to stand out to your customers or make your employees feel  extra valued, I want to point you at Uber for Business.  What a great idea.  You know, you know, Uber as a way to request rides to order meals from restaurants you love.  But Uber has a platform for businesses, specifically for businesses to spiff their  employees and their customers.  Over 150,000 companies use Uber for Business to improve customer and employee satisfaction.  I'll give you some examples.  Add $20 to somebody's personal Uber account and say, come on, I'll buy you a ride to our next event.  Or I'll buy you a coffee while you attend our meeting.  Or just to thank an employee for working late.  Buy them a meal from Uber Eats.  It's a great way to make customers love your business even more.  Offer them a voucher for a free meal or ride when they make their first purchase or  spend a certain amount.  Here's the great thing.  Uber for Business is easy for you.  You could sign up for free.  You can immediately, I mean, like before I'm done with the ads, start delivering extra value  to the people who matter most to your business.  Vouchers couldn't be easier to send.  Same thing for redeeming them.  You get total control over who gets them, when they expire.  You can even say what portion of the ride or what portion of the meal you want to cover.  You share them via email.  Or by text.  And they can be redeemed with a click.  And based off of all, you don't pay for any rides or any meals until they take the ride  or they order the meal.  So it's a great way to get some great stuff out and maybe not even cost you too much.  For a limited time, in fact, I'm going to make it an even better deal.  Get a $50 voucher when you create your first vouchers campaign and spend $200.  Go to uber.com slash twit to find out more.  Uber, uber.com slash twit.  Terms and conditions apply.  Uber.com slash twit.  Wow.  Wow.  Amazon.  You know, they're doing the Lord of the Rings TV show, I guess, for Amazon Prime.  They're going to do a series.  We knew they spent, what was it, $100 million to buy the rights.  Now they say it will cost $465 million for the first season.  This is what a crazy world we're in now.  Almost half a billion dollars.  It's good for New Zealand.  The New Zealand Minister of Economic Development Tourism says this will be the largest television  series ever made.  One season.  Almost half a billion dollars.  I'm sorry, they spent $250 million for the rights.  They spent a quarter of a billion.  They're already almost to a billion dollars before they've even aired anything.  All right, nothing to say.  That's the story.  There you go.  Move on.  I'm into it.  I'm into it too.  I can't wait.

And I think some of it's due to pandemic.  But I think this has really become a very fat market.  And boy, it's a great time for to be a content creator.  I got to get that script out of the bottom drawer.  A great time to watch stuff too.  Yeah.  It's a great time to be a content consumer.  Have you seen the time lapses from Google Earth?  This actually is maybe a little too depressing.  Showing the devastating effects of climate change.  You can actually watch as climate change progresses.  You have to go to Google Earth, click on the Voyager tab, and then search for one of five  guided tours about forest change, urban growth, warming temperatures, mining, and renewable  energy resources.  Here's a GIF.  It'd be easier for me just to show this of how Cape Cod has changed over time.  Or the glacier retreat, the Columbia Glacier.  Bye bye, glacier.  Bye bye.  Thank you, Google, for really, really bringing the show down.  How about that Lord of the Rings for $400 million?  New Surface Laptop for Paul Therot was so unimpressed.  Ed Bott, surely you're more excited.  No.  OK.  I mean, it's a very nice...

Transcript:  I did actually an article this week sort of analyzing what the Surface product lineup  is right now.  And in every case, they get to the point where they identify, design, and build a successful  product, and then they stop and they iterate on it.  And so this is iterative.  It works.

Transcript:  How important is this business to Microsoft?

Start time: 8077.92
End time: 8159.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They say that there's two aspects of it.  The biggest part of it is to serve as an example to their...  Almost a reference for the OEMs.  OEM partners, a reference platform or something.  And the other is to be a place where people can say, all right, this is how Windows should work.  Third-party hardware and third-party crapware has always been the Achilles heel of the Windows  hardware ecosystem.  So that was the two twin goals of this.  But now that they've got it up to making $2 billion a quarter, it strikes me that this  is no longer a reference platform.  This is a business.  And what they're really doing instead of being a reference platform is being a competitive  spur to the partners and saying, look, be better than us and you can make lots of money.  Don't shovel crapware onto things.  Don't deliver cheap plastic stuff that breaks or that blue screens every time you turn it on.  Step up your game.  So it's not so much a reference platform anymore as a baseline competitor.

Start time: 8160.40
End time: 8197.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me ask you this though, because I was thinking about this in the conversation on  Windows Weekly with Paul and Mary Jo.  There's a Surface laptop.  There's a Surface Book even still around.  That was the convertible.  It's quite successful.  Is it?  It's a Surface Book 3.  But really when you say Surface to people, they think of the convertible, the tablet  that the keyboard comes off, which Microsoft clearly made in response to Apple's iPad.  I know there are other convertibles, but I don't see very many of them.  Are the OEMs looking at that and going, yeah, no, we're not going to make  the detachable keyboard thing?

Start time: 8199.21
End time: 8216.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are six product lines in the Surface.  Three of them have kickstands.  Three of them are conventional notebooks with the Surface Book being the one that is detachable  if you wanted to, but you don't have to.  And nobody did.  I mean, I owned one for years and never took the screen off.  It's solid.

Start time: 8216.12
End time: 8220.79

Transcript:  I don't have the use case.  You know, Microsoft talks about first line workers holding the Surface in their arm as  they check guests into a flight or things like that.  And that's not me.  I use a laptop.  If I'm going to use a laptop, I want a laptop.  I don't even want an iPad.

Start time: 8247.88
End time: 8265.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I'm going to go back to your original question was people think of the Surface.  When you say people, I think you're thinking of consumers like tech savvy consumers like  us who were paying attention 10 years ago or nearly 10 years ago when this was.

Start time: 8266.00
End time: 8269.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They did the click ad and they were twirling around.

Start time: 8269.48
End time: 8291.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was nine years ago.  The iPhone was one year old when that came out.  That was a long time ago.  Right now, the Surface is a business centric family of PCs and a business centric brand.  And most of what you see is coming through the commercial channel right now.

Start time: 8293.08
End time: 8305.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's what Paul explained to me.  And that's why there's no Thunderbolt or USB 4 ports.  Businesses are very conservative.  And I was surprised.  I thought of it as a consumer product, but it's really a business.

Start time: 8305.72
End time: 8322.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think consumers are going for cheaper alternatives.  That's right.  It's too expensive.  These are very expensive computers and they're beautiful.  I mean, if I was purchasing a Windows laptop, this would be what I'd want.  Which one would you get?  I'd go for the Surface laptop.  I don't need the detachable thing.  I like just a regular laptop.

Start time: 8322.70
End time: 8325.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The laptop's a conventional ultrabook pretty much.  Yeah.

Start time: 8326.14
End time: 8365.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And these start at a thousand bucks.  They're the high end of things, but they do offer some advantages.  If you like the Windows platform, I think they're a really nice device.  But they're expensive.  So the consumer, even when you look at, they came out with that Surface,  it was like the Surface Go and it was like it started at like $329.  It was supposed to be cheaper.  But when you added everything up, they show on those commercials,  you add up the keyboard and you add up the pen, it gets pretty pricey.  And consumers want something they go into Best Buy for sub $500.  That's probably the most popular kind of laptop price for the average person.  So a couple things there.

Start time: 8365.56
End time: 8427.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So one, the prices are, you can match them up unit for unit against MacBooks.  So MacBooks are expensive also.  Yeah, they're very similar.  The prices are almost identical.  And the Surface, the cheaper Surface that you want.  But most consumers aren't buying MacBooks.  Well, right.  And most of the people, most of the cheap PCs that are out there  have zero profit margin in them.  And so the only people who are in those businesses are people who can survive on,  you know, microscopic margins like Lenovo, which can make them by the gazillion  and shove them through Walmart and make $10 on each one and be done with it.  But the product that you actually want there is what's called the Surface Laptop Go,  which was the one that came out last fall.  And you can get one for about $600.  And it's actually a pretty decent PC.

Start time: 8429.12
End time: 8432.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And the cheap computers, by the way, are horrible.  I mean, they're...

Start time: 8432.80
End time: 8440.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I always try to talk consumers out of it, but you know, it's hard to tell somebody  you can't spend more than $500.  Sorry.  They're still horrible.  Yeah.

Start time: 8440.68
End time: 8468.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they, and guess what?  They don't last very long.  So when you're talking, you know, $1,000 seems really expensive.  Yeah.  And by the way, one little tidbit I learned doing a story at the Microsoft store back  when they existed.  And Ed, this goes kind of back to what you're saying about the crapware on these things  is that if you bought a computer at the Microsoft store, whether it was a Surface  or a third party, those computers were not allowed to have crapware on them.  So they could not have all that.  They were called signature PC.

Start time: 8468.84

End time: 8515.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you see them all over, right?  No, no, you don't.  They must make a lot of money on that trial.  Where actually it's funny that we're talking about cheap laptops because Neil I Patel did  a piece on the verge, a little trip down memory lane talking about the net book.  There was an example of how the public's thirst for cheap really backfired.  I think it hurt the PC industry for years.  People's sense of what a cheap PC could do was really damaged by that.  That may be the other reason why Microsoft makes these surfaces.  Just to remind people a Windows experience could be gorgeous and nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're the average consumer that spent, let's say, 250 on a net book back in the day,  and it's terrible from the first boot up, you realize, why is this so slow and horrendous  and the screen you can't view from any angle except direct on.  You just spent 250 and what do you do?  You got to stick with it for as long as humanly possible.  So now you have this computer for four years that just is terrible.  Torture.  And it's torture.

On Monday, executives from GM Ford, the chip manufacturers met with the president.  Biden pledged $50 billion, not nearly enough to solve the chip shortage.  Unfortunately, it's going to be with us for a while.  Probably, according to Pat Gelsinger, CEO of Intel, into 2023.  Intel's building two new plants in Arizona.  TSMC is committing $12 billion to build a plant in Arizona as well.  But thanks to natural disasters, COVID-19, exponential consumer demand.  There are car assembly lines shut down.  You can't get a lot of parts.  And that's going to last for a couple more years.  $50 billion from the government as part of his infrastructure plan.  Gelsinger says that's not nearly enough.  I welcome it, but we need even more.  So just bad news.  If you're looking for an Nvidia GTX 3080, good luck.  Oh, gosh, there's so much little stuff.

By the way, 70 million dollars or something.  What is that?  Right?  Can that be right?  Is that what the headline says?  This was a good idea.  That's ridiculous.  Your robot dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bristling.  I guarantee you.  You know that the malls are doing this,  you know, with that night scope, I think it's called,  where it kind of wanders around taking video.  I mean, this is just the beginning.  We're going to see a lot more of this.  We're living in the future, kids.  I mean, surveillance society, I mean, it's just,  it's happening in a big way.  And it's, you know, people's homes, the same thing.  You know, you've got cameras around your house now.

Transcript:  We have an opportunity now to like raise the alarm over this type of stuff.  It should not be happening.  And there's going to be a slippery slope where eventually like,  it'll be like, well, everyone's doing it and then it'll be too late.

Start time: 9016.22
End time: 9023.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, okay.  So now when you say it shouldn't be happening, I'm curious,  like at the airport, should we have dogs?  Like if these dogs could...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Doggy dogs, little doges, that's okay.  Sheena Eboo comes up and sniffs your crotch.  I don't mind.  I'm okay with that.  But you don't, you want that robot dog sniffing you?  I don't know.

Start time: 9037.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, we're already over policed.  So I don't...  The police don't want...  No more technology.  I'm not in the defund the police camp.  I think the police play an important role in society.  But I mean, come on, robot dog, like we can't...  If we're failing with the humans that we have now,  I don't think the problem is lack of technology.  I think the problem is with the system.  So why don't we look there first and then decide whether we really need  robot dogs with sensors walking around the neighborhood.

Start time: 9065.76
End time: 9089.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But what if they could scan luggage?  Have you ever seen these dogs?  Are they trained to sniff out drugs?  I mean, that's a huge...  It's a big thing.  So if you can program these robots to do that and they can scan the luggage,  is that bad?  It's like, where does it start and where does it end the bad part of this?  I don't know.  I'm not...  I don't know.  I'm just thinking out loud.

Start time: 9089.24
End time: 9113.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I think that at the end of the day,  if you're doing that for a cost,  the reason you would bring the robots in instead of the dogs  that we have trained to do this job right now is because  you want them in there for a cost thing.  And I would argue that training the dogs is not the real problem with cost  in our government right now.  Well, is it cost or is it maybe I don't think dogs should be doing that?

Start time: 9113.68

Transcript:  These dogs, they basically...  I mean, they're working eight hours, whatever.  Maybe it's better to have a robot to offload that kind of job to versus an animal.

Start time: 9123.54
End time: 9136.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, see, I haven't heard what the animal rights folks say about it,  but I think there's a balance, of course, between like  what we want to do and whether we want to end up living in a robot police state.  And I'd be very reticent to get us to the lottery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In all...  Sorry, Ed.  This is almost a canonical example of a technology  where that is new, that's just being introduced.  And instead of thinking about where it can go,  we're thinking about the processes and the deployment today.  And the reason we're in trouble with things like Facebook and genocides and Myanmar  is because nobody thought about where this is going to be in five years or 10 years,  where it could be and how we guide it in the right way  and prevent the bad scenarios from happening.  So the question shouldn't be, do we build these robot dogs?  Do we deploy them?  Where do we deploy them?  How do we deploy them?  We think about where does this end?  And how do we make sure that it doesn't end in a way where we say in 10 years,  holy crap, I didn't see that coming.

Start time: 9207.10
End time: 9212.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe the people that are building this stuff  should have the dogs patrol their neighborhoods first before they put them in other neighborhoods.  Good idea.

Transcript:  And by the way, because ClubTwit has a Discord, there is a ClubTwit channel.  And maybe this was a mistake, but we've allowed animated GIFs  and other movies in the ClubTwit channel.  Here's a video testing nine new mini cheetahs at MIT.  They take little steps, but they look actually a lot like the robot dogs.  I don't know if we need nine of them.  And then of course, lots of GIFs of dancing robots.  So you see, you see.  Thank you.  Thank you, ClubTwit for your contribution.  Sad note, real quick, Chuck Geschke passing away at the age of 81, co-founder of Adobe,  kind of a legendary fellow in Silicon Valley.  We could thank him for the Tech Museum in San Jose.  He was one of the people who put that together.  It's a wonderful museum.  I highly recommend it.  Of course, every obituary is going to mention that he was kidnapped at gunpoint in 1992,  held for four days.  Suspect caught with the $650,000 ransom, eventually led police to the hideout  where he was held captive.  He survived unscathed, retired from the Adobe board in 2020,  but quite a legendary fellow in Silicon Valley.  Chuck Geschke passed away at the age of 81 on Friday, founder with John Warnock of Adobe,  and Warnock and Geschke are credited with inventing PDFs.  So next time you open a PDF, you can thank Chuck Geschke.  That concludes this robotic edition of This Week in Tech.  Thank you so much for being here, Alex.  Thank you so much for being here, Alex.
