We cover the week's tech news with some of the  biggest journalism is in the business. Although as you can see, I'm all alone. There are no  journalists to help. And really it's not the weeks, but the year's biggest tech news. It's our annual  year end edition of this week in tech. And actually it's a good way to begin a new year.  Here we are in 2022. 2021 was a piece of work, a piece of work. We didn't know what it was going  to be like. We still don't know frankly, what 2022 is going to be like. But I think at the  beginning of 2021, we were kind of getting ready for the roaring twenties. We've, our standards  have really changed for what we consider entertainment during all of this. I'll just  watch somebody in his living room. I'm in my living room. You're in your living room.

Transcript:  Although I got to say some of the best music has come out during the pandemic of people just  recording in their homes, covering a song and then releasing the video, you know, just them playing  it on the internet. There's a bunch of really excellent music out there as a result of this.  And you got to wonder how that's going to change the music business. You know, when, when, as you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  said, once we get to come out of this, it's one of my favorite topics is what's going to persist  and what's not going to persist. For instance, weirdly last year, hardcover book sales were up  18%. So I don't think that's going to continue. I think that's like a, that's because of the  pandemic. That's a blip. Audio books also up, I think 16% and eBooks, which have been dying.  They've been down every year for the last few years were up as well in the double digit percentage.  But none of those trends, I think will continue. On the other hand, streaming services gained  about 50% overall in customers. And that I think is, is going to hasten the end of cable television  and, and, and it's going to really move us to the over the top world that we've been slowly moving  to. It's going to hasten it. So it's interesting in some cases, the pandemic makes changes that  won't last, but I think things like zoom will continue for a long time. I think streaming  tele, I mean, Disney plus had a huge year because of it. Well, I gotta say, I mean, usually, oh,

Transcript:  go ahead. I mean, usually, usually on New Year's Eve, my wife and I will go out clubbing or raving,  as I believe it's known in the, and so three years ago, for example, we were watching one of  our favorite bands in Glasgow and yeah, it was a great night out. And this year they did a paid  stream. We listened to it at home. I didn't have anyone let you on the wife. I could have a cup of  tea when I wanted to. It was actually a pretty good night. You miss the energy of a club, but I  think those kinds of streaming services are really going to take off. Well, that's what I wonder. I

Transcript:  mean, there are certain in-person things we do like conferences and concerts. I mean, I have to  feel, I have to imagine that live performers are suffering mightily because of this. And I, and will  they come back? They say that the 1920s, the roaring 20s was part of the reason it was the roaring 20s  is because people were so burned out from the pandemic of 1918 and being quarantined and masked  for so long that when they finally came out, it was the roaring 20s. Do you think we'll have our own

Start time: 367.24
End time: 417.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  roaring 20s? You think so? Yes, yes, without a doubt. If you, there's that, there's a book I've  been recommending, a pale rider, which is about the, the, the Spanish flu pandemic and in it,  they talk about kind of the changes in society as a result of that. And yeah, I think we're just  going to have an, an explosion of people traveling, going to parties, concerts. I think every band in  the world that's a name will get out and tour. I mean, I think it's going to be almost like a frantic  golden age when this is all done. Oh, I hope you're right. Cause if you look on, if you look on social  media, like all of my friends on Facebook and Instagram, all they talk about is when this is  over, here's where I'm going. You know, and they post pictures of countries they've been to that

Transcript:  they love. It's what we fantasize, what my wife and I fantasize about practically every night is  where do you want to go first? What do you want to do first? Yeah. Right. Yeah. And remember the

Start time: 426.98
End time: 461.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  roaring 20s wasn't just about people going out and partying. It was people changing what they've come  to expect from society. You know, after, after such a prolonged time of not being able to do what you  want to do, suddenly you're changing how you consume. You're, you're changing what you consider  to be success. You're changing what you consider to be stable employment or stable housing. We could  do the same thing. And if you do that, the companies that latch onto that and start feeding that  appetite, they're going to make a mint. It's going to be, it's going to be a free for all once the

I mean, the one comment I'm getting  again on social again and again on social media is when this is over, some people, so many people  are going to get hugs because no one has been able to hug everyone else. No one's been able to go

Transcript:  visit anyone else. Let's just all rip off. You know, there's going to be a massive baby boom.  Yes. Nine months after this ends. Yeah. Yes. Absolutely. It's lots of French kissing. Yeah.  I think if we really want the roaring 2020s to duplicate the 1920s, we should ban alcohol as  well. Let's just do that too. Let's just repeat it. Let's just repeat the whole thing. Now we  remember how it ended with the great depression. So maybe we could skip that part, but well,

Start time: 511.36
End time: 539.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  that's good. I mean, yeah, the prohibition of alcohol did have a huge social influence on,  on the United States because men and women started drinking together for the first time,  for example, different races started mixing together. Oh, that's a good point. Yeah.  So I mean, it was an enormous social driver, albeit an incredibly stupid policy, but you know,  I mean, it was an enormous driver for social change and you saw women's hand limes going up  and they were started smoking and okay, so it wasn't all good, but I mean, you know, men and

Transcript:  to start smoking. I applied for a job in a magazine in the 1990s and they had a cigar reviewer and

Start time: 559.12
End time: 573.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that was his job. What a great job. Oh, what a great job. Let me start with you, Alex is meme  stock. It's a little bit of a put down. Like these people aren't real investors. This is just a meme.

Start time: 574.14
End time: 598.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is that a fair characterization? I don't think it's as pejorative as we might think on the  surface. I think it's almost one of those negative things you kind of take on as a joke that you  then begin to enjoy yourself. So meme stock to me just describes the group of stocks that are  trading not based on fundamentals or long-term value, but based on kind of current market  sentiment amongst the retail crowd. So by the way, the sentiment may not be driven either by

Start time: 598.98
End time: 603.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  market fundamentals. It may be driven and it seems to be somewhat driven by let's screw

Start time: 604.26
End time: 653.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the hedge funds, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a lot of annoyance amongst retail traders about  their position in the market. If you have a lot of money, you have access to better information,  better tools and faster trades. If you're a retail investor, like, you know, us here,  you kind of regular folks, you don't. And so it feels like the market is a little bit set up  against you and it is. And so what you're seeing here is a combination of greed, social interest,  people banning together on the internet to bring something together and also annoyance with the way  things are set up. And I think a lot of people are still pretty peeved about 2008, 2009 and how  things kind of worked out there and how people didn't go to jail and how we, the taxpayers spend  a lot of money to keep these big banks alive. And so when these social traders on Reddit and other  places notice that GameStop is shorted more than a hundred percent, a hundred forty percent.

Start time: 654.06
End time: 661.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I don't even know how that can happen. By the way, that's a failure of regulation,  but the hedge funds have bought more GameStop stock than exists.

Start time: 662.32
End time: 665.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And sold it short. And so people knew that if they took advantage of this,

Start time: 665.78
End time: 669.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they could never make it good. Right. There's not enough stock to buy.

Start time: 673.45
End time: 682.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  How did they know that it had been shorted a hundred and forty percent? Somebody must really,  someone sophisticated must have looked at that and figured it out. No.

Start time: 683.14
End time: 696.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, so the short interest is periodically available. Before this show, I was Googling  around a little bit and you can find data on that. And with more sophisticated tool and like a  Bloomberg terminal, you can definitely find out. But what's really interesting and you raise a

Start time: 697.08
End time: 743.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  good point. By the way, that's somewhat, some people characterize this as 4chan with a Bloomberg  terminal, which is exactly what it is. Wait a minute. Now I got to point out. And by the way,  Elizabeth Warren, AOC and others in Congress have called for an investigation. The SSEC,  which moves like molasses, woke up late last week and went, wait a minute. I got to point out,  it is not obvious. You know, this, this is the superficial description of this,  but it's completely possible that it wasn't just retail traders that maybe other hedge funds were  intentionally short squeezing their competition. We don't know exactly.  Well, I think what's really going on here, do we? No. I mean, I think that what happened,

Start time: 743.22
End time: 754.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  you know, when the squeeze started and when you did have people like, like roaring kitty and some  of the other big wall street, where a kid is deep, a deep effing value. It's his YouTube.

Start time: 755.46
End time: 758.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's his YouTube name. Kitty, Kitty from now on. That's probably right. Yeah. So,

Start time: 758.72
End time: 914.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  so when you have this guy who's turned a $50,000 investment into 31 million or whatever, and he's  an actual, I mean, he's incredibly clever and incredibly smart. When you have people like him  who made those moves, I do think that those were people who saw a, you know, a glitch, a hole in  the system and were able to take advantage and then were able to propel this into other things.  The thing is though, is that once the stock started rising and once everybody started kind of  staring at it, like slack shod, what's happening, and it went up and up and up,  obviously you're going to have like non retail investors who are interested in it too. Right?  So I think that it becomes at that point, you know, people who are doing high frequency trading  and who are trading based on, you know, having, you know, watch lists and algorithms and are doing  all the ways that, you know, most professionals trade now, which is not the way that retailers,  retail investors trade, we're obviously going to be getting in on it. And I wouldn't be surprised if,  and this is usually not uncommon where some of the hedge funds will have a position  to backstop against like their short position failing. Right? So I don't think we know exactly  what it is. I'd be very curious to hear Alex's thoughts. My thoughts just based on what we know  now and so much of it, we're still figuring out, as he said, the news cycle has moved so quick.  But my gut tells me that while most of the interest has been led by retail investors,  once things shifted past a certain point, then you did start to see traditional investors,  whether they be hedge funds or, you know, just, you know, high frequency traders or whatever,  starting to get in on the action too, which is only going to continue to keep this frothy.  And, I mean, look, I expected the crash to have already happened. I was very clearly wrong on that.  But I think this is one of those things where we're all expecting the inevitable crash. We  don't know when the bottom is going to drop. But the completely nuts-o thing about this is that we  don't know how high this is going to go until things presumably regulate themselves, assuming  they do. And maybe this is one of those weird things where it won't. I think the GameStop  as a company is in such a poor position that I don't see how it can continue to, you know,  stay at these levels. But yeah, to your point, I don't think it's, definitely I think that it  started and was largely led by retail investors. But if people are making money in this, like  the game is rigged. It is. I mean, I think anybody who's followed anything and has anything to do  with finance understands and accepts that you can't expect the billionaires to be sitting on  the sidelines and seeing regular people making money and not wanting to get in on some of the

Start time: 914.88
End time: 1040.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  play too. I mean, it's just bizarre roaring kitty. And this is what you do on Wall Street. Betts,  you post pictures of your losses and your gains and so forth. He posted, and nobody can verify  this, but he claims he invested $53,000. And at some point it reached $48 million, whether he  sold, I don't think, because I think he's saying hold, which I think Alex is nuts. Cause isn't  this bubble going to pop at some point? Here's a picture of a kid, 10 year old, Jaden Carr, his mom  gave him 10 shares in GameStop in 2019 as a Kwanzaa present. He's happy. I genuinely love that for him.  She wanted to teach him about investing, but what lesson did Jayden learn really about investing?  That's one of the concerns I have. I see people like my own son, naive investors who say, Oh,  you know, I'm going to get me that Robinhood and I'm going to put some money in here. Cause this is a  great opportunity. But, but what do you think Alex is the bubble about to burst? Is it what I guess  it's not because more and more people are coming along saying, I got to get in on this, right?  Even though now you're buying GameStop GameSpot stock at like 300 bucks. I don't know what the  current price is, but 325. So that's crazy. If this is the year to date graph, it was January 5th,  it was $17. It is now $325. And there was a sell off on Thursday. I'm sure there's some market,  you know, markets off market share trading going on right now. It's insane. It's insane.  So are people going to, but don't you think people are going to get hurt by this Alex or no,  they are going to get hurt by it. I mean, we know the hedge funds got hurt.  Melvin capital had to go borrow money from Steven Cohen to the tune of several billion dollars.

Start time: 1041.04
End time: 1078.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the billionaires bailed out the billionaires. We didn't do it, which is super important to note.  No one knows how long this can stay up because no one thought this was going to happen.  And when you discuss people posting their trades on Wall Street bets and other forums,  what they're doing is sharing with a large crowd. And it's not like the old days where you had to  go on CNBC to talk about your positions, to get people to pay attention. Now you can kind of rally  an army of individual traders who have access to things like options and more exotic investments  than they didn't used to have. And so now you can really marshal a lot of buying power behind you.  People are buying billboards and ads to encourage more people to buy and hold game, stop game,

Start time: 1078.80
End time: 1204.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  game, stop stock, which is a, you know, a deep F value posted, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold,  hold, hold. Of course he wants you to hold. In fact, he wants you to buy more because his value's  going to go up. You have to, at some point you have to start wondering about these people's  motivations. And, and maybe not buy into this. It's, it's, it's crazy. And I don't think we fully  know what's going on here's, but there's a large, to me, there's a larger thing at play here that  actually ties into the events of the last few years. This is essentially mob action, right?  Have you ever, has anybody, I was in a mob when I was a kid, I was protesting against the Vietnam War  with a big group of people. We did things that I would never have done by myself.  You know, we blocked the freeway, we rocked police cars, stupid things that I would never have done.  When you get in a mob, you lose your mind and you start acting as a single brain in a mob.  And we've seen this before. We saw it January 6th of, in a way to me, what's happening in the  stock market with GameStop is similar to what happened in the insurrection in the Capitol,  is similar to what happened, I guess you could say the Arab Spring. And again and again, what I think  we're seeing is how social media, these messaging platforms like Telegram and Discord, WhatsApp,  empower the formation of mobs. When I was a kid, you only became a mob because everybody said,  let's go down and protest the war in Vietnam on a certain day. We all went and that mob never got  much bigger because there wasn't this mass medium. But social media has in my mind, weaponized the  mob. And while this seems benign to me, this is great. I'm glad some hedge funds suffered. They  should, but that's today. Tomorrow it could be less benign. I think the comparison to the January

Start time: 1204.76
End time: 1214.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  6th is a little bit tenuous because that was a rally that the leader of America had called  people to show up to. So it was much more centralized than this sort of Reddit Discord type thing.

Transcript:  I'm not making deep effing value equivalent to President Trump, but I'm saying that had  President Trump not had Twitter and Facebook, had the organizers not had these social media platforms,  to me, it looks like these social media platforms are ripe for this kind of thing. And this is what  we're going to see. And I think we're going to see it a lot more often. Just to add to that point,

Start time: 1238.74
End time: 1290.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  there's currently a new meme amongst the same trading groups to squeeze the price of silver.  And I have not looked into this because all my money is in boring index funds because of journalism  rules. But this is not going to stop. People have now found a lever and they're going to keep trying  to move the world as long as they can. And we saw a lot of issues with Robinhood, disability to stay  up and so forth, but they'll figure that out. They'll get that sorted out. And then once those  pathways are open, there's not going to be the same kind of like slows to the system. And so I  don't know where this goes, but as a person who cares about the financial markets in general,  I'm going to be fascinated to see what the next couple of years look like. If we do actually see  the revenge of retail traders against the professional money, it will be an inversion  of trends that have been going on for decades. And people are going to get hurt, Leo, but it's  going to be really fun to watch the financial carnage either way. I'm Diamond Hens, still holding

Transcript:  on to that GameStop, GameSpot stock. Come be rich someday. I know I am. Coming up, the other big fad  2021 NFTs, but first I would like to talk a little bit about something that's not a fad. Podium.  Oh man, podium is actually the future for small businesses. And I know it because every time now  I leave my dentist's office, my hair cutters, the ice cream parlor down the street, I hear from them.  I get a text message. I, you know, sometimes it says your next appointment. Sometimes it says,  would you like a coupon for your next visit? Sometimes it says, would you like to leave us  a review on Yelp or Google? And in every case, that's podium. Podium is the way to do business  in this kind of modern era. Friction free. It's what your customers want. They like getting that  instantaneous feedback from a business they've just used or a business they've visited.  And podium, if you know, if you own a business, you know,  there's already too much to do can save you a lot of time.  Local businesses are turning to podium to do everything they might do over the phone or through  mail, but now can do instantly in a way customers really prefer. Podium makes every interaction  as easy as sending a text. You know who else loves it? You will, your employees will, because  with one inbox, podium makes it very easy to get things done. Answer requests, offer coupons. By  the way, I have to tell you, I used podium the other day, I was looking for somebody to fix a  window in our house and I sent text messages to the various glaziers listed. And I think it was  on Yelp. What's interesting is the first one to get back to me was using podium. And because he  got back so fast, he got the gig, another score, another win for podium. It's not just a better  way to communicate. It's a better way to do everything. Gathering reviews, collecting payments,  marketing to your customers. Podium makes it easy as pressing a send button. You'll not only free up  more time, you'll grow your business, you'll get more done with podium, you'll close deals with  customers before the competition even has a chance to call them back. You know, I mean, times have  changed. It used to be having an answering machine was the thing. Then it was email, then it was a  website. Well, now it's podium. Communicate with your customers easily, efficiently the way they  want to be communicated with with podium. Join the more than 100,000 businesses that already use  podium to streamline their customer interactions. You can get started for free at podium.

We thank them so much for supporting our year end best of episode.  There was a lot to talk about when it came to NFTs and blockchain. And early in the year,  we had the expert Kevin Rose to join us and explain what all this madness is all about. Watch.  Good to see you, Leo. Thanks for having me. Venture Capitalist with True Ventures. He's got a brand new  podcast. I want to give you a plug right up front. Mo-Fi, the modern finance podcast. You're only in  your you've only done three episodes only two published so far. But the first one is a must  listen. I listened to it immediately. Because I am completely baffled by this whole crazy NFT thing.  We've spent a lot of time talking about the people's $69 million art jpeg sold at Christie's.  But you explained it all very well with IMDC investor, Afthap Hossain, who was it was,  you know, I knew I guess you're also an investor. You've bought some NFTs.

I  heard you say that you sold this is these are the CryptoPunks. They're 25 by 25 pixels. Yeah,  they're icons of zombies, right? What other things? Zombie is one attribute type. Yes. And

Transcript:  but you bought but you buy these, which I don't understand because I see them all right here. I  have them all you you buy them so that if I if I click on the smiling zombie, which apparently you  own I can look at it. I could print it. I could do anything I want with it. But you own it.

Transcript:  That's right. Yeah, you could do the same thing with the get a high res copy of the Mona Lisa  and print it out. That's true. But you don't have it. That's true. So it's like you got the  Mona Lisa of smiling zombies. Is that it? Yeah, I mean, it's basically just a way to use the  blockchain to prove that someone actually has ownership over something that makes a lot of  sense in ownership by submitting it in the blockchain. That's a real problem with artworks,

Start time: 1608.60
End time: 1619.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  with baseball cards, with a collectible is attribution and who owns it. But also is it real?  Is it a and so blockchain kind of solves that. And the third piece that's really important is

Start time: 1619.66
End time: 1659.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  how many were made. I mean, one of the things that that happened in the 90s around baseball  cards and collectibles and comic books is, you know, there's a there's a great story. We all,  of course, know the very famous franchise of the Wolverine. And the very first Wolverine comic is  still $150. And I dug into this, I'm like, how this was made in the 80s. How can this possibly be?  And it turns out they printed like something like 300,000 of them, and didn't tell anyone,  sold as many as they could. And which makes sense as a business. But as collectors,  you didn't know that, you know, and so the blockchain gives you a way to say,  proven scarcity, right, and ownership. So that's, that's nice.

Start time: 1660.38
End time: 1686.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  So there is another way, biological way to, to barcode and to track authenticity, and that's DNA.  So you can spray custom DNA on just about anything. It's odorless, it's colorless,  it leaves no residue, it leaves no mark. And then you have physical so blockchain is great, but,  you know, it's not physical, physical way. In fact, yeah, I mean, the crypto punk is not

Start time: 1686.94
End time: 1690.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 1691.56
End time: 1708.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's not true. Because with crypto punks, it was only a 25 by 25. So small, you could put it a hash  of the Yeah, exactly. You're right. In any modern like the peoples, all that stuff, it is just a  pointer to like an IPFS type, you know, asset, right? Or at least it's like, and there are problems.

Start time: 1709.18
End time: 1717.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  Go ahead. I was gonna say, I think all of that works well as long as you have a ton of redundancy  built in. But yeah, because if it's just one of the cool things, if it were a web URL, it could,

Start time: 1717.76
End time: 1750.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you know, the server could go down, at least with IPFS is a distributed file system.  And so in theory, it's not going to go away. You could spray DNA fragments. So I'm not going to ask  you. It's probably it's not the traditional method of spraying DNA, I'm assuming it's some other  No, that's not what I was talking about. Okay, that's where my mind went. It's a sneeze, right?  You sneeze on it. I'm sure if you think about it, that probably a few van Gogh's have his DNA on

Start time: 1750.90
End time: 1766.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  them. But you're not talking about that. No, I'm not talking about that. I am, you know, one of the  really cool things that's happened. One of the positive after effects of the virus is that  messenger RNA, which has been around forever, it finally found a use case, a business case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  That's right. And mRNA is a pretty cool technology that has some knock on effects, and one of which  is looking at RNA and DNA and sort of a new light. So you can DNA is like nature's hard drive,  you can store a ton of stuff in it. And it doesn't go anywhere. And likewise, you can use DNA as a  tracking system. So if you've got a really valuable collection of comic books, not Wolverine,  something else more valuable, you know, one way to physically mark products like that artifacts  that you can authenticate in the future is using DNA fragments.

Start time: 1809.50
End time: 1829.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the advantages of blockchain in this regard is it's distributed. And everybody has a copy,  there's no with DNA, you'd still have to have some registry somewhere of what's in that RNA.  It doesn't have to be RNA. It could be any encoding method for encoding a long digit.

Start time: 1830.92
End time: 1838.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  Right. I mean, it's like a you can encode spores to it's just like a barcode.  But yes, you would still need a registry that should be distributed.

Start time: 1839.72
End time: 1860.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That works great for like individual objects. But if you're going to do something like say,  fractional ownership of a digital object, that would be possible. You know, smart contracts  enable things like artworks to change over time based on rule sets, like really kind of fun things  like that as well are pretty cool with some of the NFT stuff. I think people, and I include myself in

Start time: 1860.84
End time: 1958.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this, get distracted by trying to wrap their mind around well, people made a JPEG, which is  infinitely reproducible, and then was able to sell it for $69.3 million to somebody who now can claim  ownership in some abstract way. And we get wrapped around this notion of collectibles,  physical versus virtual objects and all of that. And, you know, you can go either way on that. I  mean, I'm kind of of the opinion it's pretty speculative. But so is our collectibles. I mean,  you don't buy a Haunus Wagner baseball card because it has any intrinsic value. You buy it because you  think either you're really a big fan of the Pittsburgh Pirates, or you think it's going to  have more value down the road and you can sell it. It's a way of storing value. Just like,  unfortunately, a lot of artworks now are ways of storing value. They're not hung on any wall.  They're stored in a locker at some airport to avoid customs and taxes. But they're a store of  value. And you know, you'll be able to sell them at some point, probably for more than you paid for  it. Right. So I acknowledge that this is a good way to this is a better blockchain is a better way  to store value. But I think people like me get all tied in a knot over this. Well, you what are you  kids doing? This is this is this is silly. There's also and let me ask you about this,  Kevin, because you didn't address this in modern finance. There's also an environmental concern,  isn't there? I mean, there's a lot of energy being used to create these things. And every

Start time: 1958.26
End time: 2033.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  transaction uses a lot of energy. I think the energy consumption of proof of work blockchain  has been known for for quite some time. I mean, there's there's it's horrible. And so I mean,  that's why there's a lot of work and effort going into making these chains just eco friendly. I  mean, if you take a look at all of the layer two scaling solutions for Ethereum, everything is  they're doing with optimistic roll ups. These are like very lightweight ways to do  cryptographically proven transfers without having to write it back to the main chain.  So without spending a lot of resource power until we get to something that is proof of  stake, which is not proof of work, which is not using very intensive CPU or GPUs to do all these  transaction processing, which is on the Ethereum roadmap. I mean, this stuff is coming. It's been  on the roadmap for a long time, though. Yeah, I know. But you're also talking about, you know,  how many billions of dollars you have to be very careful when you're when you're changing  directions of a plane of that size, right? Like you if you're if you're setting a new destination,  like you don't want you want to really battle and harden the code. And so, you know, there's  been some eth two is like there's they've crossed a couple of major milestones and staking is the

Transcript:  other chains out there that like are getting a lot of traction that are already green from the get go.  Chia Bram Cohen, the creator of BitTorrent, just launched his coin here just four or five days ago.  You actually interviewed him for the very efficient green for the podcast. You just  interviewed him for the podcast. Yeah, yeah, it's a very efficient, super green cryptocurrency.  It's going to have support for smart contracts and other things on top of it. Solana super like talk  about high bandwidth, high throughput, they can do 50,000 transactions a second and it is  super efficient and green. So, you know, these these are all problems that are being worked out.  But I certainly acknowledge that today it sucks. Of course, like,  depending upon where you're getting your energy from, like there are a lot of miners that will go  next to very cheap sources, which can be hydroelectric, they can be, you know, solar,

Start time: 2092.04

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and they're mining in those environments. Sure, sure. In fact, it only makes sense to mine where  electricity is cheap, because otherwise, you probably not making a profit. Right. It kind  of brings up the issue of I saw some wag tweet. Elon Musk said Tesla now will accept Bitcoin  to purchase a Tesla automobile. And of course, some wag pointed out that you might as well just  put gas engines in a Milan, because if you're all the benefit, the environmental benefit of  an electric vehicle is kind of abrogated by using Bitcoin to pay for them. I mean, yes and no,

I just, no one knows where it is.  And people were, and people gave me a 10th of a Bitcoin or whatever. And it ended up being 7.85  Bitcoin. I know. Cause I can see the wallet and I know how much is in it. I know all the transactions,  but I just can't unlock it. So what is that worth? That's $480,000 right now.

When Bitcoin was a hundred bucks,  I would have sold it. So all I've done is gain value. I figure not being able to sell it is the  best thing that ever happened to me.

Transcript:  So, so I'm figuring here's what, here's my plan. This is my long, long range plan.  Someday quantum computers are going to happen and there'll be a computer fast enough to crack  this wallet. To crack that password. By then, you're probably right. Yeah. By then it'll be  worth millions. You're right. Maybe worth a hundred million. We'll have more in just a little bit.  In fact, we're going to talk about, cause one of the big stories of the week was the year,  I should say was, was about Congress investigating Facebook. Some of Facebook's plans for Instagram  coming up in just a little bit. Our show today brought to you by Nureva, complicated and costly.  That's, that's been the state of audio conferencing for big spaces for a long time.  Choosing a traditional system could entail a difficult software design issues, selecting from  a kind of dizzying array of separate mics, speakers, DSPs and more. You've got to get a  company to come in, map the space. Then you bring in technicians to install, often very invasive and  certainly very expensive. And that can take your, your meeting room, your huddle room offline for  days. Really, I think this is a good example of an industry that was just primed for a leap in  technology. It's the same kind of one that's changed so many other sectors, especially during  COVID. That's why Nureva has really come at a time that we need it. Nureva created the revolutionary  microphone mist technology. It's a patented technology that make one or two integrated  microphones and speaker bars work for a giant room, fill the room with thousands of virtual  microphones. It is a perfect, affordable solution for today's bigger meeting rooms. No dead zones.  Everybody can be heard anywhere in the room, no matter where they're facing, no matter how  they're socially distancing. Frankly, I think this is going to be the future of conference rooms,  where it's a comfortable, engaging space and you don't have to pay attention to the microphone.  That's the best way. Meeting participants, classes, it's great for schools, can simply talk and move  naturally in the space and they'll be heard clearly by remote participants. It's just a more natural  way to run conference audio. And thanks to continuous calibration, your rooms are instantly  and always ready with optimized audio. No outside technician required. No matter how the configuration  changes, no matter how many people or how few people in the room, Nureva works first time every time.  And man, has a simplified installation. No installers coming in, running wires everywhere, drilling holes  in the wall. It's a 30 minute job you can do yourself. I've done it. It's simple. It's just like  installing a sound bar. Means big savings in time and cost compared to traditional systems. So it  works better and it costs less. Seems like a no-brainer to me. Simplified management too. You get  the Nureva console which gives IT the power to monitor, manage and adjust the systems from  everywhere. No need for IT to move from room to room. So it means you can have many Nureva connected  rooms and manage them all from a central console. It's just great. So I guess it's time to ask  yourself, do you want to go with a costly, complicated, traditional system or make the leap  to simple and economical Nureva? N-U-R-E-V-A dot com. Nureva. N-U-R-E-V-A dot com. It's simple.  It's just the right way to do it. Nureva, we thank you so much for supporting our special best of  episode. We really appreciate that. Boy, it was a lot to talk about with Facebook and Instagram  this year. Here's a plan at the time that seemed like a bad idea. They've backed down since.  Instagram for kids. What could possibly go wrong? Internal Instagram post obtained by Buzzfeed News  says, quote, we have identified youth work as a priority for Instagram and have added it to our H1

We will be building a new youth pillar  within the community product group to focus on two things.  This is, I think, informative about how they think about these things. Accelerating our integrity  and privacy work to ensure the safest possible experience for teens and building a version of  Instagram that lets people under the age of 13 safely use Instagram for the first time.  For the first time. Actually, Instagram, like almost everything else, because of COPPA,  the Child Online Protection and Privacy Act, will not allow you to join if you're under 13. But of  course, I don't think that stops anybody. They don't make any real effort to verify that.

So get them young.  Yeah, get them young and indoctrinate quickly. And people will once you're used to an ecosystem,  you're comfortable, you're going to stay and keep on using it. That's their thought. That's their  hope for it. Even though no, this is no, this is not good. Social media is not great for kids,  because most kids are not don't understand what they're doing, what they're posting.  Not everyone has Owen as a dad. Let's just say it.

But everything you 90% of what you watch on Instagram anymore,  that's interesting, has a TikTok name flowed around it. They've already posted it on TikTok  and then they put it on Instagram. By the time I look at something on Instagram, my daughter's  looking at me like I'm a 92 year old man. She's like, I was laughing at that two weeks ago, bro.  Like, come on.

Transcript:  That's the rule. Jeff Bezos retiring, stepping down as CEO is going to be the chairman of the  board, but less focused on day to day operations. He's handing over the reins to Andy Jassy.  He's kind of, maybe this is another one of the, it seems like the whole show has been about  corporate spin and PR. And maybe this is more of the same in the letter. He says,  if you've read some of the news reports, you might think we don't care about our employees.  Well, we do, but maybe we ought to do better. He's coming off a victory. Of course, the Alabama  warehouses voted against the union, fairly substantially voted against the union.  He says, while voting results were lopsided in our direct relationship with employees is strong,  it's clear to me we need a better vision for how we create value from employees, a vision for their  success. I'm sure Amazon will continue to fight unions. On the other hand,  there are things they can do to make it better to work at Amazon. He said, our employees are  sometimes accused of being desperate souls and treated as robots. That's not accurate. Remember  was it a book that said that if you didn't cry at your desk once a day at Amazon, you really weren't  working hard enough. If any shareholders are concerned that Earth's best employer  and Earth's safest place to work, that's his goal, might dilute our focus on Earth's most  customer centric company. Let me set your mind at ease. Think of it this way. If we can operate two  businesses as different as consumer e-commerce and Amazon Web Services and do both at the highest  level, we can certainly do the same with these two vision statements. I'm confident they will  reinforce each other. Spin or do you think he genuinely is being a little affected by  all of the blowback and wants to do something to make it a better company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_24
Transcript:  This is Jeff Bezos' last letter to shareholders as CEO. What he's thinking when he's writing this is  legacy, legacy, legacy. For him, he's reading the news and he's seeing what happened with the high  profile Twitter battle that led employees to end up sharing photos of the bottles that they've  peed in and letters telling them to stop pooping in bags with the press. Basically, Amazon is  under fire for the way that it treats employees and it's on its way to becoming the biggest  employer in the US. It's added a million employees in under a decade and it just keeps adding 100,000,  200,000 a year. This is going to be Jeff Bezos' legacy because at the end of the day,  he's going to be the person who's going to be responsible for the state of the American worker  because the American worker is largely moving from places like the factory, which produce things to  places like the fulfillment center, which distributes things. Bezos is going to continue  to grow. Amazon added 50 million prime members in the last year, up from 150 million. That's

Start time: 3390.50
End time: 3395.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 3395.82
End time: 3495.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_24
Transcript:  prime subscribers. I think Bezos is thinking when people look back at him, they're going to look  back at the e-commerce company he built, but they'll also look at the broader transformation  that he led in terms of the economy and the way that work is structured. Of course, there were  other factors that were involved there. That's why I think we heard so much about the worker there.  Does Amazon care? Yeah, actually, I think Amazon cares a lot more than we end up hearing in the  press reports. I don't think it's a miserable place for so many people to work. It can be really  tough. But I do think that the reality there is somewhere in between what we hear and some of  the worst. It's not like everybody goes in and brings their bottle to work and pees in it twice  a day. There are good jobs at Amazon, but they definitely have room to improve. Amazon was  freaking out when people were talking about the way that their employees are treated.  There is some righteous indignation that they can have. The United States politicians are the ones  that sign trade deals like NAFTA and encourage China to join the WTO, which ended up having us  trade those production jobs with women's jobs. Amazon pays $15 minimum wage, where the federal  government has a $7.25 minimum wage. I kind of see Amazon's side a little bit when  they're looking at these politicians from the US government saying, you got to treat workers  better. And Amazon's like, you're supposed to be looking after the workers. And of course,  Amazon, we talked about, has lobbyists. But there have been decades where our politicians have had  a chance to make the situation better, and they've failed. You can also make the case that voting

Start time: 3495.88

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  down the union in Alabama was a vote of confidence from the workers saying, we prefer Amazon

Start time: 3500.70
End time: 3557.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_24
Transcript:  management, we don't need a union. Yeah, I'd buy that more if Amazon didn't go through the  painstaking union busting process that it did. If Amazon had that vote be fair and didn't compel  people to go into education systems and start getting the post office to have this mailbox in  that might have made some people think that they were going to read their ballots. That might be  one thing. I mean, why do you if you really think that you can stand up based off of the merits,  you don't need to bring the union busting firm in. You obviously have a right to defend yourself  against unionization if you don't want it, but to just go through such effort and to be so against  it. Like I don't think this was, you know, entirely the workers standing up and saying we don't want  a union. Obviously, Amazon had a role in it. And Amazon's like, this wasn't a victory for us. It's  what the workers wanted. But Amazon corporate, it was definitely a victory for them. They had a side,  they picked a side, they pushed it real hard. And then we saw the impact of it.

Start time: 3575.26
End time: 3610.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  to work. Well, there's a couple things, a couple things here. Number one,  Bezos is doing what Bill Gates did 15 years ago.  And Andrew Carnegie did before him, right?  And Andrew Carnegie did back in, you know, many several generations ago. And so and people were  skeptical about Bill Gates, walking away from a day to day role with Microsoft. And yet that's  exactly what he did. And became a philanthropist.  And became a philanthropist.  Has really become his primary focus there.

Start time: 3612.94
End time: 3617.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I guess like Andrew Carnegie, some of that was to renovate his reputation.

Start time: 3619.68
End time: 3727.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Yeah, I think to a large extent. But there was also, I think people who know Bill will say that  there was some genuine personal transformation that happened along the way. But I think the other  thing about the whole union vote, there's two factors there that we really need to keep in mind.  One is that this vote took place in probably, you know, perhaps the worst possible place  to have a union vote.  It's one of the reddest states in the country.  One of the reddest states with one of the most powerful so-called right to work traditions.  I just get angry when I have to use the phrase right to work, because it's the exact opposite  of what it should be.  But right now, the United States is one of the most anti-union countries in the world.  And so basically, Bezos is operating as the kinder, gentler face of what every corporation  is doing. They don't have to bust unions anymore.  The unions are in shambles. They're in shards on the ground.  And with an NLRB that isn't able to really influence the course of the election very much,  this one seemed kind of preordained.  It's a country that's anti-union.  It's a state that's aggressively red and anti-union.  So I guess this didn't surprise me at all.  And for Bezos to come back and say, well, thank goodness that our employees love us so much.  I don't think that's what it means.

Transcript:  This is Jeff Bezos's farewell.  Do you think this is his attempt to kind of leave on a high note and then just kind of  walk away, wash his hands of the whole thing?  How well will Amazon do without Jeff Bezos at the helm?  I think for whatever you don't like about him, you have to say strategically, he's amazing, right?  I mean, he's brilliant.  Or no?  I mean, the culture.  Go ahead, Alex, you first.

Start time: 3792.64
End time: 3801.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_24
Transcript:  I would just say that the culture that he's built, when you start to look at it up front,  and, you know, of course, there's an element of how workers are treated, I think could be better.

Start time: 3811.68
End time: 3942.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_24
Transcript:  No doubt, no doubt, but there are some constants where, like, both of those,  both workers in the fulfillment centers and workers in the corporate offices can have  their jobs automated away and will have to adjust.  And in fact, this past week on Big Technology podcast, I had one of the  people who worked in Amazon's corporate offices, a woman named Elaine Kwan,  who had her job automated away.  She was on the phone with Gucci and Versace stocking the fulfillment centers,  and all of a sudden that was handed over to machine learning.  So it's, you know, everybody inside that company needs to be able to adapt and embrace change.  And you look at most big companies and they just kind of make something and they stop.  This was the case with Microsoft for a long time, where they made Windows,  they were the desktop operating system, and they stopped.  And only after we moved to mobile and the cloud did they actually have to catch up.  And they've done a good job, although they were pretty late to the game.  But you look at Amazon and they're always one step ahead of what's going on.  Bookstore, then selling everyone through a first party marketplace,  they build a third party marketplace, logistics and fulfillment, voice computing,  hardware manufacturing, or something like the Kindle, not to mention the fact that  they're a grocer and Academy Award winning movie studio, and now they're moving into healthcare.  And you don't excel at all that stuff unless your culture,  your leadership and your processes and internal technology are locked in.  And I don't think there's anybody on the planet right now that's done a better job at that  than Bezos.  So I think the company will be able to survive.  And the big question is whether they're going to be able to keep that mentality that Bezos  has instilled from his position at the top after he leaves.  Jesse, of course, has shouted him as his technical advisor back in the day before he built AWS.  He's done a good job with AWS, built it into a massive business.  But you never quite know until the person at the top leaves.  And we know with Microsoft, Bill Gates left and they put Steve Balmer in,  who was just there to, you know, ended up making money.  And they needed to make another leadership change to get back, you know, to their more  inventive ways.  So that'll be a question with Amazon.  But I think Bezos' legacy as somebody who is,  who's been able to build a powerhouse company, I don't think that's ever going to,  you know, go into question in the long term.

Transcript:  See, I found the trick.  The way I hacked my insomnia, because Amy, I'm exactly like you.  I just have fought it for years is I found out if I get an auto book that I really,  really, really know well, like something I've read so many times, I kind of can guess what  the next sentence is going to be.  The expanse.  Yes.  Like the expanse.  This is why I've listened to it so much.  What I do is I crack an audible file.  I hope I can say that on here.  I own it legally.

And the way it the way that reason the hack works is because when you get busy brain at  like three in the morning, it's because you're thinking like, oh, I've got to do this tomorrow.  I've got to do this tomorrow.  I've got to do this tomorrow.  But if it's a story you've listened to a ton, then you can kind of follow it.  But you can also drift off and just start thinking about random things.  And this has been the magic bullet for me, Insomnia.  I think that's like a linguistic.

She's going to be back, by the way, in a couple of weeks, we're going to do a very special  looking forward version, a future version of Twitch.  She wanted to do this.  She's a futurist, as you know.  And she said, why don't we do an episode where we just talk about  kind of thinking about the future of tech.  We thought this is a great idea.  We're going to be joined, I'm very happy to say,  by my favorite science fiction author, Daniel Suarez, the author of Freedom, TM,  and many other great books.  It's his job.  It's especially to think about the future.  And we're going to get a scientist.  We haven't decided yet who, but we're going to get a scientist to join us.  So a futurist, a sci-fi author, and a scientist walk into a room,  and there will be an amazing twit.  I think it's next week, isn't it, Jason?  That will be...  Or is it two weeks from now?  Jason's checking the calendar.  Anyway, that's next week.  Next week, the night.  Okay.  That'll be a very special twit.  So this week, we're looking back.  Next week, I'll look forward.  Should be really, really fun.  But I'm thrilled about this because I've been a customer for a while.  We're talking about balloon land.  Lisa and I have been really trying to cut back on our use of plastics.  It's estimated 5 billion plastic hand soap and cleaning bottles are thrown away every year.  We've turned to water bottles instead of plastic bottles.  I've stopped using plastic shave razors.  I really want to cut down our plastic.  We don't use plastic bags anymore.  All of that just goes in the landfill and it never degrades.  It's just there forever, not to mention all the fossil fuels it uses to make it.  That's why when we found Blue Land, we were really excited.  It's not just by the way fossil fuels.  These bottles are also made of water.  So that's another thing we don't have enough of.  People, it's 2022.  Stop wasting water.  Stop throwing out plastic.  What you want is Blue Land, a great revolutionary refill cleaning system instead.  Blue Land was founded on the belief that a cleaner planet starts by eliminating plastic waste.  We talk a lot about cleaning up the plastic waste in the ocean,  but the best way to get rid of plastic waste in the ocean is never to create it in the first place.  Blue Land makes a great powerful effective cleaners,  a range of cleaners for your entire home that eliminate waste.  The idea is simple.  Buy the bottle once, refill it forever.  No more plastic waste.  Of course, the only thing you'll need to do is get rid of all that outdated eco-friendly stuff  that's more expensive and less effective because Blue Land works.  Just fill Blue Land's beautiful Instagrammable bottles.  That's what they call them.  They are beautiful.  They're blue with warm water.  You pop in one of the hand soap or spray cleaner tablets.  That's all the factory's doing, by the way.  They're shipping all that water with just a little bit of cleaning product in there.  Why do that?  Why do that?  Within minutes, you just add the important ingredients to the water from your own house.  You didn't have to ship it.  You've got a powerful cleaning product and the most incredible, by the way, the smells are amazing.  There's agave, there's perine lemon, lavender eucalyptus.  It's just they smell great and most importantly, they work.  They work.  So, you know, I don't...  We all want to make the planet a better place,  but we also don't want to sacrifice to do it, right?  We don't want to use ineffective eco-friendly products.  Well, this is an effective product that's better, that works, uses less water,  doesn't use the plastic and cleans great.  Check out their Clean Essentials Kit, their Hand Soap Duo,  the Plastic Free Laundry and Dishwasher tablets.  Blue Land has something for every inch of your home.  And by the way, back by very popular demand,  if you've been a Blue Land customer, you'll be thrilled to hear this.  Blue Land's Toilet Tablet Cleanser.  The problem was it sold out.  So get it now before it sells out again.  Blue Land's stunning, high quality forever bottles started $10 when you buy the kit.  And by the way, you really do save on the tablets  because they don't have to ship all that water.  They don't have to make the bottles.  It's just $2.  They started $2.  Try Blue Land today.  You're going to love it.  The planet will thank you.  We've been very happy with Blue Land.  We use it throughout the house.  It just makes me feel good to know that we're not adding to all that plastic waste.  It's way past time to make cleaning fun, beautiful and plastic free.  Right now you get 20% off your first order.

This was the year, not exactly something to be proud of,  but this was the year that the world's most famous internet meme hit 1 billion views.  Rick Astley got his billion views.  I am not going to Rick roll you fear not, but the remastered it.  Yeah.  HD.  It's wonderful.  Yeah.  So the official video for Rick Astley's 1987 hit,  never going to give you up is now a 1 billion view video on YouTube because of Rick rolling.  Right?  I don't think without Rick rolling, there would be in fact, any buddy watching this video.  And furthermore, in case you don't know,  Rick rolling is of course, punking somebody by sending him a link to something they really want.  And instead they get a video of Rick Astley, never going to give you up,  dancing like they danced those days.  He's really young in that.  He was very grateful, by the way.

And in front of it, they have a fountain display, kind of like in Vegas,  in front of the Bellagio or Fires.  And they play music on the hour and they do the thing.  So we're standing there waiting for the fountain display and there it goes.  Baby shark.  And I had never heard this song before.  But you know what?  It ended in a minor note.  That really bothered me.  You want the resolution.  Yeah, that actually makes sense.  Again and again and again.  Big birthday this week.  I love the register.  The register is so good at headlines.  Beige against the machine.  The IBM PC turns 40.  Not just a medical emergency.  Also the beginning of the office brick.  It was on August 12th, 1981.  Big Blue released the first IBM PC.  We didn't call it the 5150.  We call it the PC.  And it transformed an industry because up until then,  there were lots of personal computers.  Commodore and Atari and Apple,  MSI, Mitz, all had made personal computers.  But they were very hobbyist focused.  When IBM arrived, it gave it a serious business cachet.  And remember the full page ad that Steve Jobs took out  in the Wall Street Journal saying from Apple,  welcome IBM.  Seriously, they might have underestimated the impact IBM would have.  Do you remember, Mike,  the first PC when it came out?  Do you have a memory of that?  Maybe you're not old enough.

Transcript:  I was not super paying attention at the point where that came out.  It was more like the mid 80s when I started really getting into computers  and stuff like that.  But once I, you know, in 1990,  I started editing a computer magazine that very quickly became Windows magazine.  And that whole, you know, magazine thing in the 90s was 100% a direct  that you can draw a direct line to this very event that you're talking about,  the creation of the IBM Model 5150.  And so, of course, we, you know, we were always writing about the history,  the ancient history of the, you know, during the 80s of the IBM PC.  And, you know, it really, it really,  there are very few things that changed the course of technology the way this did.  It could have gone in whole different directions,  but because they use open components,  because they had a reverse engineerable bios,  because they idiotically went, got in bed with Bill Gates.  That's a great story, by the way.  That set the tone for everything to happen for the next 20, 25 years.  So it was open.

Start time: 5031.40
End time: 5171.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They chose off the shelf parts.  The only thing that was proprietary was the bios.  I don't think they designed it to be reverse engineerable,  but it didn't take very long for Compaq and others,  Phoenix and others, to say, oh, we can make a PC compatible bios,  which meant that within a year, Compaq was selling a compatible.  It would run the same software, run the same oper...  Oh, that was the other smart thing.  And the dumb thing that IBM did,  they were looking for an operating system for the PC.  They came out to Monterey, California,  because DR-DOS was a very popular operating system in the CPM days.  And Gary Kildall, who was the creator of DR-DOS,  digital research founder and president,  was famously flying his private plane and declined to meet with IBM.  So they flew up to Redmond, Washington,  where there was another young upstart company, Microsoft,  known for its BASIC, not for an operating system.  They met with Bill Gates and said,  we need an operating system for the PC.  You got one?  Bill said, yeah, he didn't.  But he knew of a company called Seattle DOS,  which had a DOS that would be compatible with IBM's 8088 chip,  the chip that they were putting in there.  It's an Intel chip.  And he, without telling the owners of Seattle DOS,  went across the street, said, I'd like to buy Seattle DOS.  Didn't mention that there was another company interested,  bought it for a song, and then turned around and sold it to IBM as PC DOS.  The other thing that Gates did, it was probably the single biggest business move in history.  He made a deal with IBM, and I don't know why IBM agreed to this,  not to give it to them outright, not to sell it to them outright,  but to retain the rights to it.  And he looked like he was 12 at the time.  Yeah, we got an operating system.  Actually, that's funny because Seattle DOS came from Seattle Computer Products,  which was staffed by high school students.  Remember, in the early days, this is in the late 70s, early 80s,  this was a hobbyist thing.  Nobody was serious about this.

Transcript:  Exactly.  I mean, he set the tone, I think, as a historian of Silicon Valley,  he set the tone for the industry.  You had these well-meaning companies actually producing good products  that were relaxed about things.  And then you have this bare-knuckle aggressive liar come along and just have this hyper-aggressive  attack on IBM saying that he had things he didn't have, and then a massive work ethic to go with it,  willing to just do whatever it took.  I mean, when he did the Altair, basic, he lived in a trailer in a strip mall,  and he dropped out of Harvard and worked night and day to make that deal happen.  It's not like he's lazy.  Oh, God, no.  It's just a combination of massive work ethic, lots of brains, no ethics.

Transcript:  He bought PC DOS from Seattle Computer Products for $25,000,  like the same month that IBM came to him, and he didn't have anything.  Just prior to the launch of the PC on August 12th, on July 27th, he went to Seattle DOS and said,  I'll give you another $50,000 for full rights.  And they didn't know anything about the PC.  They said, OK.  So for $75,000, he bought an operating system, which basically made Microsoft.  And then he made a deal with IBM saying, well, we'll keep the rights.  We'll just license this to you.  And I don't know why IBM agreed to it, but what it made possible is the compatibles,  because then he was able to sell MS DOS to Compaq and all these other makers of PC compatibles.  And it made it completely 100% IBM PC compatible, which is good for us.

They would, you know, the hobbyists like, you know, the chaos computer club  that Steve Wozniak was part of, they would just write software and hand it around.  And it was free.  It was no big deal.  And then the computers were the thing that monetary value.  And Bill Gates had the vision to understand, no, whoever owns the software has all the power.

What was the code name for the original IBM PC?  I'm trying to remember.  Had a good code name.  Project, let's see, Project Chess, according.  But I don't know if that was the code name for the original PC.  Anyway, they designed it.  You may remember the, do you remember the ads for the IBM PC?  Acorn was the code name.  Yep.  Thank you.

And you would save your programs and your files out to cassette.  They did offer, if you were willing to spend more,  you could configure it all the way up to $5,000.  You can get dual floppies, no hard drive.  There it is with the dual floppies, that big old CRT.

And in which case, Microsoft, which at the time was in Albuquerque, New Mexico,  would have moved to Pacific Grove.  Oh, that would have been wonderful.

And congratulations on your first personal computer.  When we invented the first personal computer system, maybe a little hyperbole on that,  we estimated that over 140 million people worldwide could justify the purchase of one  if they only understood its benefits.  Next year alone, we project that well over a million will come to that understanding.  A million people.  Wow. Little did he know what IBM was going to do and just kind of dominate the space.

And it just so I think a lot of these local towns and cities have just gotten incredibly frustrated.  So there's about a thousand different communities that have in the last decade or two built their own broadband access that routinely winds up being cheaper, faster, more reliable.  The money that the locals spend on this service goes back into the community.  The people who work for these providers tend to live in the communities they serve.  So unlike a lot of these regional monopolies, the money is staying there and they're more accountable to the locals.

But I think COVID really showcased when you saw toddlers like sitting on the sidewalk outside of Taco Bell to try and get online for class.  You know, this has always been a problem, but COVID really accelerated, you know, the awareness.  So it really is driven action.

Transcript:  It depends. Each state has a different variation.  Sometimes it'll be an outright ban on building your own local network.  And sometimes it'll be worded in a very convoluted way to make it as difficult as possible to raise funds or to expand.  Or you can't market in this zone.  Or you can only if it's like a lot of these networks are built on the back of the local power utility.  And so what Chattanooga did that, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  One of the fastest and cheapest fiber providers in the nation.  They have Gigabit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But what a lot of people sometimes do is say you can't expand this network outside of the local utility footprint.  You know, some of the laws will say something like that.  And there's no real reason for it outside of the fact that the regional telecom monopolies, who literally ghostwrite most of these laws, just told the state representatives that they didn't want that to happen.  And there's no... this stuff is super popular.  It's bipartisan.  There's no excuse for the failure that I've seen.

Transcript:  Yeah, but the counter argument is that, you know, a lot of these companies have had 20 years to wire these areas and they don't want to because the return on their investment is low.  But at the same time, they don't want anybody else building their own broadband networks because they might want to go back there someday.  Yeah, we may someday.  Yeah.

And I'd like here in Dedham, where, you know, a friend of the show, Paul Thoreau used to live here too.  We canceled our trail this year, like a just walking trail because COVID has destroyed our municipal budget.  If you go over to poorer areas of Massachusetts, like Brockton, I can promise you the Brockton tax base is not, you know, going to go for a bunch of broadband development right now.  So I kind of I'm for you.  I'm with you in principle.  But I'm also thinking about the people that need it most and thinking about towns like Whitman, where they're like, hey, we're just going to have our library open for three days a week because we have no money.  You know, we're going to have a four day a week police department.  And, you know, I'm thinking about like, is it really a feasible thing all through the United States?  Like COVID affects our local revenues for years.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's not like a silver bullet where you could just do this in every nation.  And there's also like multiple varieties of different types of ISPs that are built out of this model.  You know, some will be on the back of the local power utility that won't use taxpayer money at all.  Some will be a private private public partnership that, you know, just works with a local provider like Google Fiber or somebody to deploy to the area.  So it's not it's not all it's not all just tax based driven models.  I mean, there's a wide variety of models that can exist.

Transcript:  Here in this little town of Petaluma, about 60,000 people, there was a big initiative about five years ago to put in community Wi-Fi.  Initially, Comcast was going to help, but then they bowed out.  Then another provider was going to help.  They bowed out.  They put some stuff up, but it didn't work.  It's gone.  I think it's just a hard thing to do.  And there isn't a lot of support from the incumbents, of course.  So you really have to have a leader, a civic leader who's going to really push it through.

But I mean, they're just like any other business plan and they require a good leader and a sound plan.  And, you know, look at Chattanooga that built its own fiber network when Comcast refused to.  They've been ranked consistently one of the most affordable, fastest internet providers in the country.

Transcript:  Well, the other good reason to do it is evidence shows everywhere that  incumbents were challenged by fiber, whether it was Google Fiber or others,  that prices went down, that, you know, speeds went up.  And even in some communities where there's fiber up to this road,  you can see the prices go up as soon as the fiber from the other company is not available.  It's like no competition. Great. We're going to raise the prices.

Transcript:  And the thing that is frustrating is like, you know, the approach to ban these entirely.  We've spent literally about 25 years where the U.S. ever since we broke up Ma Bell,  the U.S. telecom policy has basically been to do whatever the dominant regional monopolies want.  I mean, with some exceptions occasionally, you know, like net neutrality was an effort to say,  OK, maybe we should apply some very basic rules to these companies.  And any time anybody tries to do that, the companies get Congress to freak out,  you know, trying something different will destroy the Internet.  You know, you know, that's basically their line.

All right, we're going to wrap it up with a look at the 20th anniversary of the iPod  and big changes in China.  But first, I want to talk to you about the food box we got the other day.  Okay, you've probably heard about Imperfect Foods.  And I'm sure like me, you thought, well, they're going to be really, you know, imperfect.  They're not.  They're great.  This is the best food box I've ever received.  How about this for a three-in-one New Year resolution?  Let's reduce food waste.  Let's save time on grocery shopping and let's eat more fresh and delicious food.  That's Imperfect Foods.  Here's a...  You really want to feel bad.  A cringe-worthy stat to start the year.  Every year, 35% of the food supply in this country goes unsold or uneaten.  Wasted.  This is food in the grocery store shelves that gets thrown out because nobody bought it.  Imperfect Foods is working to turn this around.  And I'm really happy to be part of this as a customer by sourcing foods that would otherwise  fall through the cracks of our food system.  Not Imperfect Foods, just foods that are not going to be sold because they're too small, right?  Or the kind of avocado that bruises easily, doesn't look good on the shelf.  But they're great.  When I get them home, they look great and I'm so happy to have them.  I know, you know, we look, we all want to combat climate change,  but that feels like what can we do?  What can one person do?  This is a great way to make an impact.  It's just, let's eliminate some waste.  Imperfect Foods.  Let me explain what it is.  I suppose I should explain.  We get a box every Thursday.  You get a different day, I'm sure, but this is when we get ours every Thursday.  The box, it's a grocery delivery service.  It's not just vegetables.  It's everything.  An entire line of sustainable groceries.  They taste delicious.  They reduce waste and they save you time because they come to you.  And all you have to do is accept that it's not going to be perfect.  Except it is.  It's perfect.  Go to imperfectfoods.com.  See if they deliver in your area.  If they don't, I'm sorry.  I really am.  I'm so thrilled they do here.  Once you sign up, you personalize your weekly grocery order  with fresh seasonal produce.  You can actually get, there's pantry staples, yummy snacks,  and you know, really a lot of the stuff you would just go shop for anyway.  Plus your order arrives on the, you get to choose on the same day every week.  So you can just make this part of your stress-free routine.  On Thursdays, that's my job.  The imperfect foods box arrives.  I put it in the fridge.  I unpack it.  I have to say, again, not imperfect.  Perfect really looks good.  On average, and you can feel good about this because on average,  imperfect food customers save six to eight pounds of food with every order.  Food that would not be sold otherwise.  And it's great.  Unlike on-demand delivery companies, imperfect delivers weekly by neighborhood.  So that's reducing emissions.  It's another goal of theirs.  25 to 75 percent fewer emissions than you drive into the grocery store.  It was on the way.  They dropped it off on the way and they consolidate it.  So that's why we have Thursday.  Your day will be different probably.  You can also say, and this is a big thing for me, say goodbye to packaging guilt.  They're the only national grocery delivery company  that makes it easy to return your packaging after every order.  They also use minimum packaging.  So instead of a plastic bag full of oranges,  then a plastic bag full of grapefruit and plastic bag full of apples,  they're just in there.  And I'm telling you, again, perfect.  Okay, maybe it's a little smaller than you'd see in the grocery store, right?  We got artichokes.  They're a little smaller.  So the grocery store won't stock them.  I want them.  They're great.  They're better, frankly.  Zucchini, broccoli.  I've never had a fresher head of broccoli in my life.  It was incredible.  So I'm sincere in saying I highly recommend you try this.  Right now Imperfect Foods is offering you 20% off your first four orders.  Your first four orders when you go to ImperfectFoods.com,  use the promo code TWIT, please.  20% off your first four orders.  That's like up to $80 off.  ImperfectFoods.com.  They're beautiful.

She also cares about the best produce, the freshest produce,  and we get it from Imperfect Foods.  We're super happy.  ImperfectFoods.com.  Promo code TWIT.  Thank you, Imperfect Foods.  You're perfect.  China's central bank.  China has been really clamping down on a lot of digital stuff,  including the latest.  When we did this show, cryptocurrency.  Boy, did we have a good panel that day.  Listen, I'm going to give you a chance.  Think of all the things China has been able to do.  They've been able to shut down and curtail the ultra growth  in some of their more consumer-focused technologies.  They get kids to only video game three hours a week on Friday,  Saturday, and Sunday, and holidays.  Now they have said all cryptocurrency-related activities are illegal.  Wouldn't it be nice if we had a totalitarian government  and we could just come on in and say Facebook, this is going to be fixed?

Transcript:  and finish up. Well, there was just one other thing. On the clampdown on cryptocurrencies,  I'm not sure that there's- let me reverse. I think there's probably another motive there,  in addition to just general control freakery and related to that, because the economy and,  in particular, real estate is grossly overheated in China. They're in a major bubble on property  values and have totally overbuilt and have had companies that are wildly overleveraged, owing  hundreds of billions. It may be that in banning cryptocurrencies, they're trying to control  or at least slow down the flight of capital that tends to happen from countries that are perhaps  heading toward economic really serious trouble. Of course, the whole world would  be caught in that if it does happen, but that seemed pretty plausible to me. I don't remember  where I read that, but that struck a chord as maybe that is part of the motivation to just

Start time: 6777.58

If the regime could stay popular by everybody getting more money and growing and  having bigger homes and buying more stuff, fine, as long as that lasted. But then when trouble comes,  they have to put the hammer down and we're almost headed to an economic cultural revolution.

Start time: 6809.08
End time: 6857.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that going overboard? No, that makes sense. I think these are intertwined.  Mm-hmm. If we're looking for some specific thing, because I thought this cryptocurrency ban was very  sudden and there were some things that happened that were perhaps in retrospect leading up to it,  but this is a surprise to me. When we look in our own country and other countries about  cryptocurrencies, I think people who are speculating in those areas who are not the  insiders who are already profited and will stand to profit even more, be careful.

Transcript:  I think there's a couple of things going on. These are great points about these real estate  companies. People say this could be another subprime that affects the rest of the world,  but in the last year, I've been really surprised to see how hard China is coming down against the  entrepreneurs like Jack Ma, who were once celebrated as successes of the whole Chinese system.  It's almost reminiscent of what Putin did to slam down the oligarchs in Russia.  And so maybe that's not the greatest way to build a global internet business, to take your  most gloried entrepreneurs and founders and charge them with crimes or remove them. I think certainly  it shows that the control that China shows, it just can't be trusted as a global brand. And you see,  obviously we don't trust Huawei and TikTok was sort of teetering in the Trump era, but now  it's still the most popular download among social network apps.

Transcript:  I was. It was a, it was a notable day, not just because Steve Jobs was really good.  Doing presentations and keeping the audience enthralled, but because it was such a big risk  for Apple at the time, it was primarily known as the maker of the Macintosh. And it was 2001. So  jobs had been back five years and they were still, you know, in financial struggles. They had had the  new candy colored IMAX before, but they still, you know, weren't, you know, solvent, I would say  they were still struggling to make money. So for them to take a risk, you know, to make money,  to take a risk on the consumer electronics market was a big move. And  jobs started out his pitch that day with an, an emotional appeal, which was everybody's into music.  This is a market that's never going to go away. People love music. We love music and you should  do what you love. And he really did a good job of keeping the audience, you know, following along  with him and his logic. There were other music players on the market. Apple is typically not the  first into a new space, but he sold them on how it was going to be. Apple was going to make it  elegant and easy and really fast to upload music to this, you know, very cool looking device. I mean,  I have to admit, this is my original iPod I got it that day. It's pretty good shape, not because  Apple gave away a case. I actually asked jobs about that. I said, have you, have you thought  about making cases? And he said, what for it fits in your pocket. And I was wearing a skirt with no  pockets. And I'm like, cause some of us carry stuff in our bags. So I went home and I sewed my own  little case. I found it. Oh, it's a little cow. It's a gateway case with a, with yarn from my kids,  you know, play thing. And that's what's kept this thing in pristine condition. But  it was a notable moment. Like I said, it was a risk. It did. It took a while for the iPod to be  a success. I don't think people realized that it was not an instant hit. They, it took them four or  five years to really sell in the millions of devices. But by then they'd introduced the  iTunes store and had taken on the music labels. As all of us recall, it was one of Steve Jobs,  famous open letters to the industry and talking about why you should be able to buy songs  individually rather than buying a whole CD. And it was just cool, right? The Silhouette ads,  they had a U2 iPod. Bono was there for the launch of that. I actually got to meet Bono on the edge  on that day. Very cool. And there was a lot of, there was a lot of good marketing hype. And of  course, a thousand songs in your pocket was quite a great tagline. So it was, we still remember it.

This is Steve Jobs playlist. And  so Cnet put together a Spotify playlist if you want to hear it all. Yo-Yo Ma, Glenn Gould, BB King.  Of course, Bob Dylan, Jobs is into Dylan. Just Sarah McLaughlin was the first bit of music played.  And the thing that I remember about that event, aside from people going, well, that's kind of cool.  Yeah.

And if you ripped 10 CDs on Tuesday and then you  went back on Friday and you'd ripped others, it knew what to sync up was, which is something that  we take for granted now. But that was a big deal in those days, honestly. And yeah, it was the start  of Apple moving into this consumer electronic space. And it was cemented in 2007. Obviously,  when they introduced the iPhone, a lot of people don't maybe not remember this, but on the day they  introduced the iPhone, we've had the iPod and all the iterations, the iPhone kind of subsumes  the iPod, right? Because the iPhone is a phone and it's a music player as well. And that was the day  that Jobs changed the name of the company from Apple Computer Inc. to Apple Inc. in recognition  that there was no longer a computer company. Oh. Yeah. On the day they introduced the iPhone,  not the iPhone. Oh yeah, the iPhone. Yeah. Yeah. So it was the start of that whole path. And of course,  $2 trillion valuation later, it was obviously the right call. Yeah. This was before the iPhone. This

Transcript:  You know, I have one story that I want to tell and that is, and no disrespect to Microsoft here,  but at some point I was speaking at an event and someone gave me a Zune. And I still have the Zune.  It still powers up. But I came home and I had two kids and I gave my daughter, you know, this iPod  to use. And I gave my son the Zune. Did he say, why do you hate me, Mom? He did. Do you love,  do you love Laura better than you love me? So. You can have a Zune. We had to, we had to get one.  We got an iPod after that. So a shuffle, by the way, that, that was the years of the iPod  shuffle even smaller with more capacity. Yeah. Anyway. Yeah. How many iPods, I mean, we all have

Transcript:  So that's why it was a big deal. That was a big deal. Getting them to say, okay, you can  sell it digitally. Remember that. Right. God, people forget it's moved so fast. You forget  bands did not allow digital copies of their music. They were terrified by the whole thing.  Napster, boy. Line wire. Yeah. This was the other thing that is, I mean, this was a  early MP3 player. This was for a car, obviously, but this is a hard drive in it. This is a Rio.  Exactly. And I had the little small portable Rio as well, the diamond Rio that was a pre-dated the  iPod. But the thing that all of these did wrong, we even did many shows on the screensavers about  building your own, put a computer in your trunk and have MP3s on a hard drive. But the thing was  hard about all these is navigation. It was miserable. Finding your music and playing it  was miserable. And it was really a brilliant insight. Tony Fidel came up with the designer  of the iPod to have that click wheel. These actually are sold. They actually turn.

I'm going to defend the Zune. The first Brown Zune, not great.  But at the end of the Zune, the Zune HD was actually a really good music device. And I was  kind of sad that Microsoft, having finally perfected that device, gave up on it. I was going to say by  the time it got good, they had already lost. Yeah. I guess that's what it was. There was too much

It was kind of in every way superior to the competition, but it was too late. Just like the  Windows Phone. It was over. I was kind of sad about that. It was shortly after Microsoft gave  up its music. You used to be able to buy music from Microsoft and all of that. And they gave up  all of that. Hard to believe 20 years ago.
