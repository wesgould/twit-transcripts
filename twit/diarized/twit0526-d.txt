Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no a couple of friends of mine close friends of mine had recently been diagnosed and  I was going through  Some big upheaval in my life and had only recently  acquired health coverage Wow and thought that  health coverage would be good because I love to bike and bike to my yoga classes and on the beach and I thought well if  You're gonna  Be on a bike in Los Angeles  bicyclist  You should have health insurance because people are very irresponsible about driving in LA with cyclists. Yes, and you know I thought here  I am vegan I  Run and swim and do all this stuff people like me get cancer  So I went for my first mammogram. I was 41 just turned 41 and  live tweeted it because I was more of an oversharer then than I am now, I guess  You know, I thought that maybe by demystifying the process I could help somebody else who like me thought that  It was too scary or something  and at the end of the day  you know, I could  kind of give you a blow-by-blow but at the end of the day, I had a diagnosis of breast cancer and  My life changed a lot and  We could you know, I love talking about myself, especially my tragedy so I could fill up this entire show  with my tales of woe, but  Yeah, I got I  developed a real  Faith in a power greater than myself, which is called science and evidence-based medicine right on and  You know my doctors aren't gods and there are no guarantees in our treatment  Sorry for my bad camera work. I'm sitting on my foot. I'm kind of enjoying it. It's very naturalistic  Very strongly that if you're not having fun, you know, if you're not enjoying the fullness of life every day  No, you're you're living life wrong because there are no there are no guarantees. But yeah currently  I'm I'm my health status is very very good today  And I'm doing both things that are fun and things that are not fun to help ensure that I'm I'm I remain in treatment  But my status is great right now and it's not holding me back from anything.

Budapest where apparently I guess Hungarians loved their sauerkraut  They don't like migrants much, but they love the sauerkraut and we went to a  Market and there were and there were many booths many vendors selling sauerkraut  Big giant bowls of fermenting cabbage.

End time: 496.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I  Guess we should start with Wednesday because that is of course, you know the big event. I don't know how Apple they're so brilliant  I don't know how they make this the big event every year. You can have if you can have CES you can have all sorts of  Announcements and events and products but boy the day Apple announces the new iPhones each year

Start time: 496.80
End time: 501.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the tech event of the year and I think it's also the different from all the other manufacturers

Start time: 501.98
End time: 513.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They all know what they all try to beat it, right?  All the announcements predate the Apple announcement because they know once Apple announces  I and yet I don't feel like the iPhones are technologically way ahead of anything else  I don't know people love them

Start time: 514.19
End time: 537.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that again I you know  I have a couple iPhones and a couple androids and the issue is I think still the iPhone is still  Simpler to use than the Android the Android  I think there's a lot of features on the androids that I really like better than the iPhone and there's things that I use them  For specifically but it's but it's not again  It's not something that I would necessarily you know hand to my parents and say here's a you know  My parents are have enough they work hard enough on the iPhone

Start time: 538.48

Transcript:  So Apple has become the Brussels sprouts before a chocolate pudding

Start time: 552.32
End time: 594.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I might say it's let's you know life's short. Let's have dessert first  I don't you know it's up to your up to your point of view  It's certainly true that if Apple does something it  Impacts the tech community it impacts users. It's a big deal  For instance when we've talked about this a lot of the last few weeks Apple's iOS 9 when it comes out will allow ad blockers  And there are a number of companies already positioning themselves to be the ad blocker for mobile Safari and a lot of people  very worried  Publishers and so forth about it Jenny on boing-boing  You were one of the first you use the federated ad network. I think when you first started running ads is that right

Start time: 596.56
End time: 653.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One could say that federated media was developed around boing-boing yes as a  proof of concept John Battelle we invited John Battelle to  come in and help us figure out if maybe selling some ads might help us offset our server costs and  We found out that the answer was yes, and John went on to build a service that would  Answer that same business problem for lots and lots of different blogs that were popping up and that's what became federated  currently we're with another company and  The business is changing a lot the business is changing a lot and it's I  Don't think I'm sharing anything exclusive in saying that a lot of independent publishers are really having to rethink  what they do and what matters and  What kinds of possibilities are out there for doing things other than banner ad based

Start time: 655.04
End time: 683.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Businesses you could argue that boing-boing does it right? I mean there's a if we look at boing-boing right now  There's a banner ad at the top  There's a couple of block ads. There's three or four units on the whole page. It's it's not annoying. It doesn't there's not a takeover  There's not pop-ups and then pop-unders  It's exactly  What you know a reasonable ad?  Supported page should have unfortunately very few pages anymore do it as an unobtrusively in a simplest way

Start time: 685.18
End time: 706.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it you know it the wildest coincidence could happen and  You know mere days after this show we might launch a slight upgrade to our design  Who knows what could happen?  You never know what's gonna happen on boing-boing net on  a day soon

Start time: 708.16
End time: 750.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We actually like this said this is a read relatively recent redesign. It's already isn't it yeah, and you're gonna. Okay. Well see what happens  Some have said that if block ad block ellipse happens, which is what I'm calling it  It's not it's not very felicitous, but it's  If if it does in fact seem that people are as they are I think starting to widely use ad blockers  That one way to completely defeat that would be to take these simple banner ads  It's an ad for vodka that I'm seeing at the top of boing-boing make it an image served by boing-boing  It wouldn't be blocked by an ad blocker. It'll be part of the pages content  Right the problem is that this that as almost all ads come from third-party ads ad services

Start time: 751.48
End time: 791.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and I think that what makes it hard is the kind of  Trajectory based advertising which is just that you know we have a profile of the user  And we're gonna put in whatever they last saw and B&H or Amazon or whatever I buy something  I don't need that again right but the  But you know so so those types of ads I think may have a lot of trouble which of course is more of an issue  For Google I think the I think when you have a specific sponsor for a specific blog or or for or the kind of things  You have here, you know it's what I think that those there's lots of ways of embedding that into the you know into what's going on  It's kind of the the random stuff

Start time: 791.96
End time: 814.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's harder to that may be what ends up getting fixed now the reason that these are served by ad networks  Is because the ad network wants to know  Well at the very minimum how many people saw it yep  But they probably would also like to know more about who saw it as much as they can determine age demographics  You know income that kind of thing and by combining information from a variety of sites plus

Start time: 815.72
End time: 826.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Information provided by users unwittingly well you get much more personalized  I mean like every ad I see now every display ad I see is something that I'm definitely interested in and I go but  It's but it's stuff that it's a little

Start time: 827.76
End time: 835.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I almost don't know anything about me. I don't want to see an ad into oh, I like that that feels dirty  I almost like when they're random that I can ignore them more easily just move on you know I

Start time: 836.68
End time: 874.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Didn't do anything to encourage this vodka ad so I'm presuming that does not know who I am  However, I don't find it obtrusive. I'm going back and forth on this I  Look we're at we're free ad-supported media. Mm-hmm. I think this really important that ad-supported free media exists  It's democratic it allows anybody to look at it if it's done tastefully and unobtrusively  I don't think there's any problem with it  I can also see why a lot of people are becoming very perturbed these pages are tripling in size  They're slowing down by a matter of tens and sometimes half a minute tens of seconds

Start time: 874.96
End time: 890.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I get annoyed by the just I mean I get that the you have to be imagined to keep people's attention  But what really has me want to have an ad blocker is when it takes over the page  And it's gonna now gonna hold me there or you know I'm gonna have to you know those types of things really become like okay  Now I want a blocker and there are sites you really cannot read

Start time: 890.94
End time: 905.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, they're just they're overwhelming with that and then there's the third part problem  Which is malware injection because these networks ad networks are very often automated and it's possible for a bad guy to buy an ad inject  flash malware  Before the ad network can catch them

Start time: 906.24
End time: 918.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, we have that problem at TechRom sometimes we do a lot of our own ad sales  But we do use some networks and occasionally we'll just get served an ad on the site  That's like an autoplay video or really noisy ad and then we have to kill it and they just come so annoying  People

Start time: 920.52
End time: 937.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  know  So in some ways the ad advertisers have brought on this ad block ellipse  But having Apple term but kind of apples by the way Apple is just allowing it  They're not they're not they're not putting one on your system  They're not even encouraging presumably you to use it, but they're just making it possible

Start time: 938.14
End time: 944.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and I don't think it'll happen overnight, but I definitely think that it's gonna they have a couple years before everything's yeah blocked

Start time: 944.96
End time: 973.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is not the big announcement. However, of course the big announcement will be new hardware  New iPhone probably an iPhone 6 plus an iPhone 6s 6s plus  The latest the rumor mills been pretty accurate I think as we get this close to announcements like this last few Apple announcements  There's been nothing surprising rumor mill says the new camera will be 12 megapixels 4k video capable. That's a catch-up  pretty much

Start time: 974.94
End time: 985.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Most of the other companies phones are doing that it'll be interesting to see what the resolutions are for stuff like high frame rate  You know whether it's 4k at 120 frames a second or maybe it's probably all those high frame rates will probably be the same

Start time: 986.50

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the interface the thing that worries me is I of course we have forced touch on the Apple watch some of the Apple  Laptops have forced touch. I never know what's gonna happen if I have three levels of touch, which is new  I'm not now gonna know twice as much what's not gonna happen  And how am I gonna distinguish between a medium and a hard touch?  And what did I just do and and so for instance?  You could look up a point of interest in the Maps application by pressing it and  Then force touch on the destination to give start turn by turn  But do you know that's gonna happen and how would you know and I mean?

Start time: 1100.22
End time: 1108.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you just keep pushing things harder and harder and harder to figure out what happens?  I mean, I guess that's gonna be a lot of learning curve for people. We'll see

Start time: 1108.36
End time: 1113.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think I mean, I think typically what happens is that you don't use it very much and then you and then it and then it

End time: 1120.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  Apple will have a new TV to an Apple TV not a TV set but the Apple TV  Streaming box will be upgraded for that. I'm not sure because I've read conflicting stories  Some say it'll be 150 bucks some say it'll be 200 bucks. Some say there are two different

Start time: 1165.02
End time: 1185.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apple TV boxes it sounds like the rumor is they're gonna have a cheap  They're gonna keep selling the one that they have cheaper so that you can always get an Apple TV  They dropped that to 69 earlier this year  They're gonna soup up the one that they have and by adding things like I think that I think that  It's interesting a lot of the rumors are that they're not gonna go for 4k  Which seems odd to have a phone that shoots 4k and an Apple TV that won't play it

Start time: 1186.92
End time: 1189.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They even have computers. They have IMAX that will do 5k, right?

Start time: 1190.06
End time: 1215.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it just seems it seems like that's an odd rumor if it turns out to be the case  I think that the the I think the game changer with the eye with the Apple TV is going to be opening up for app development  There are not just for games but but for also for education for  Enterprise there are so many possibilities  For what you can develop with a little puck that you can you know add a lot of features, too

Start time: 1216.48
End time: 1221.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I think that's gonna be very interesting is this finally the Apple TV that we're gonna care about  No, I still just don't care about it

Start time: 1225.14
End time: 1250.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's only two reasons you'd want an Apple TV one because you buy stuff on iTunes  movies and TV shows or because you want to do the airplay from an Apple device to your screen and  That's the only thing that Apple TV has to itself  Everything else can be done on a Roku or an Amazon Fire TV or an Android TV  So Apple owns that market and I guess that's why you'd I have an Apple TV because I I do buy stuff or I have bought  stuff on iTunes

Start time: 1251.58
End time: 1258.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, what do you think of Apple music in its own its current state? Actually? I was gonna ask you what you think of that  But I asked you first, okay

Start time: 1260.84
End time: 1264.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't see this is an example of something where I don't see that Apple innovated in any way

Start time: 1265.00
End time: 1268.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It just and they could innovate there's ways that they can innovate and there's not doing it yet

Start time: 1269.12
End time: 1298.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe you know we're actually all gonna have to make a decision because if you turned on the three day three month  Trial it will expire in a few weeks at the end of September  So I turned it on on June 29th when IOS a came out and or 8.4 came out  So that means at the end of the month I'm gonna decide if I want to spend ten bucks a month to keep this  I already have Spotify already have Pandora pay for both of those pay for Google music  I probably shouldn't pay for all of those  I don't see any reason to keep playing for Apple TV if you've or Apple music if you've got one of those

Start time: 1299.00
End time: 1336.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think they've added  I mean the guys in the other in my studio and listening to the whatever it is beat one and  That would be worth it for me the the I think that  I still use Spotify and I'm I like spot, you know, I'm I promise  Invented into it. I don't see I don't see anything that Apple TV is giving me that  I really want there are things that I would love to see from both of these things like cross fades  Between songs like you know, it's always be a day. So it's like if I do across no  It does automatic cross fades. What I want is I just want a little curve  Just give me a little let me let me do a little mix  You can set how many seconds I know but what you want is to be able to when you buy your playlist, I mean

Transcript:  hmm  you know, I love so much of what Apple does I  Absolutely love my iPhone I've done work that I'm so proud of that wouldn't have been possible like  News work with this device that I feel like the quality wouldn't have been possible with any other device  And I feel like the exact opposite is true with Apple music. It's just  below chasing a product in  instead of  something that was  Really designed with the users experience in mind  I  Spotify does it well, they don't do it perfectly  but  Hell I I still miss win apps.

Transcript:  How many how many these are gonna survive well, there's a big question because of course they really only survive  At the pleasure of the music industry at any point the music industry could just say to all any or all of these  Yeah, right. It was nice nice experiment. We don't really think we're making enough money  I mean we've seen it already happened to me with with some artists pulling their music from these  Well, I mean Taylor Swift, I mean, but the whole industry there's no reason that there's only three labels now, right?

Transcript:  I think it's no accident that Spotify and others are doing this now too  Has turned to podcasts and other kinds of content that are not owned by the music industry  Because they need stuff in case the music industry they don't have to turn off the  Spigot they could just say, you know, it's good. We've decided to make the royalty rate 8%  Yeah, that's all they have to do  And most these companies are so close to the edge anyway  Right of not I mean Apple could keep it going just because they just say well, okay  We're gonna lose money, but it's important to us to have the service

Transcript:  Every time we see the the the numbers we see the numbers with Pandora and the reason that they all pick Pandora is because Pandora  Pays almost nothing Spotify is about half a cent a play  And if you look at an album that you might have bought that you listen to a lot  You ended up paying about half a cent  You listen to it a lot, but they got nothing for radio play

Start time: 1565.58
End time: 1576.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The only people who got money for radio play were the songwriters performance. There was no performance royalty, right?  And they accepted that because it was a promotional value. They figured well if we get airplay we could sell records

Start time: 1576.78
End time: 1585.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was how it used to be done and really the the bands that are making money now are really focusing on tours  I mean that's you know the money the money's made by performing you're not not necessarily by selling

Start time: 1586.78
End time: 1626.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they do make a lot of money doing that so I think the problem for Apple is that unless Apple music is  Significantly head and shoulders above whatever you're using today. It's a it's a hard sell. I'm not gonna make a lateral move  It's the same price if it's roughly the same service as Spotify  I'm not gonna make that lat why would add a loyalty to Apple make them move  They've also kind of missed the boat I think they missed the boat on Android users who are I know Apple you don't love  Android users, but that's a significant number of people there is still no Apple music for Android here  We are one month left in the trial offer and they still haven't released Apple music for Android  I don't know that's just maybe they won't at all

Transcript:  They said they would know if you know it'll happen eventually and I think that  There's a certain inertia that Apple has them and you look at like the top apps that anyone uses them  No matter how much fun we make of Apple Maps, it's still the 12th most popular app ever  You know, right now it's right on the screen because when you click on anything on your phone you end up in Apple Maps  So there's a certain level of inertia that Apple is gonna get out of this that I think that they can take advantage of  You know and probably grow it into a medium business, but I don't unless they do something really transformative  I don't know how they what they have now is not transformative. It's not enough to pull people away from Spotify

I will not be here  I'm flying back east  on Tuesday night for  The IAB up fronts where I guess pitch. I don't know what it is some advertising  Actually, it's a big deal for podcasting it really is kind of a  kind of a watershed moment for podcasts  Upfronts the networks have had up fronts for years. They get all the new shows together  They get the stars and the new shows together. They get them in the room with the big advertisers and they say, okay  You want to buy a year worth of ads on heroes? It's gonna be huge  They sell a year ahead of time a year upfront in effect. I  This is you know, there were the new fronts that happened with YouTube not so long ago same idea  I don't know how successful those were this is as far as I know the first podcast up front  So I'll be it there instead of at the Apple event, but we'll be covering it  Live at 945 and then right after a Mac break weekly. Will you be here for that? I'll be here for both good  Thank goodness somebody will be  And it's always interesting it's a well, how does Apple do that? What do you think Alex?

Transcript:  Think the proper point is that the devices are just better  I mean Apple hardware is in my experience just such a more superior product that we all get excited  Is that I mean I don't think Samsung I think I think it is I mean how do you think Samsung feels every Apple event?  They just have to watch Apple beat them, you know again  I know and so I think it's gonna be dispirited for the larger industry  But I mean fundamentally if you look at the media and you talk to them  They're nearly all on iPhone still and so I think that mind share that Apple controls, you know  Guides coverage and therefore they just get more total attention paid to them

Transcript:  Okay, that is inertia. I think some of its inertia, but I also think that it that Apple has a lot of discipline  I mean, I think the issue that you have with a lot of the other manufacturers. They're releasing phones year-round  I mean and there's a thousand phones and there are a thousand different sizes and they release four at the same time and they're  all slightly different and you can't I  Don't understand how anyone could pick an Android phone in a Verizon store because or you know  T-mobile store because it's just so many of these you have to go  It'll take you hours to figure out which one is the one if you're not really you have to really be an expert to figure  Out exactly the one that you want or you just give up and buy something, you know  Just buy something and so I think that's the trouble that they have is that there's nothing stands out. Apple only does it once a year

Transcript:  Well, you know I  It's so fun covering them like it's just always been you know, what that's that's the truth, isn't it? There's the there's a truth  Yeah, look I I use  Apple products because they don't get in the way of my work and  They for so long placed usability and good design  above all else and  I think  You can't fake good design and I think there's a reason that a lot of designers find themselves oriented towards  Apple hardware. Yeah, it's it's it's beautifully made and  it tends to  Just work  No, and like the events are just they're beautifully staged. They're beautiful theater  It's it's a it's the gold standard of corporate theater and I don't say that in a mocking way like no  Fake and you're just phones man. Look, yeah  They're phones and we use them every day all the time and they become our  Interface with the world and with everything that we love the design of your phone matters  What other thing are you gonna hold that much and use for that many fun things?  important things mundane things  It's maybe the most importantly designed thing that you have

Transcript:  And I actually think that the the events have gotten better since really yeah, I mean I  Think they're a lot shorter  They're a lot shorter and a lot less BS at the beginning and and they've they've actually I feel like they they move from one  Thing to the other in the last couple years and you know, we stream a lot of corporate, you know large corporate events  You got Dreamforce coming up next  Yeah  a couple weeks and and so you we sit in the back and I don't think anybody has any idea of how much work it takes  To do something like what Apple does Apple's been rehearsing in all likelihood for the last two weeks already at least at least  And and so they they have you know, they'll be I you know  I we're not involved in in that one  But but the but in the ones that we have though a lot of the ones we work on they'll be rehearsing for months  When they get up there that they're once they're on stage with all the gear up there  They're going over and over for days, you know, you know rehearsing it to get every last little bit like oh the mouse was a little  Bit here.

We'll get Alex to show us this  This is something that's actually gonna put me back in the iPhone  Family because I want to use this lightning enabled camera from DXO  But we'll ask Alex about that just a bit our show today brought to you by stamps calm use stamps calm  Instead of going to the post office with stamps calm you use your computer your printer to print official US postage  Without a visit the post office. It's not a postage meter. It's much better than that  No special ink what you've got will work and you get you know, you don't have to go to the post office  You get the postage you need always the right amount because you get a USB scale that will automatically  Weigh and print the postage whether it's for a letter a postcard a package right at your own desk  You even get discounts from stamps calm you can't get it at the post office  Which is pretty awesome a fraction of the cost of a postage meter to you save at least 50%  And no more trips to the post office  I I love stamps calm we use it here if you are in the business of mailing stuff  Whether it's brochures or products  It's important that your mailers look professional. I you know, I hate happens all the time. I'll buy something on Etsy  And it comes in a rumpled brown paper  Squished box with lots of stamps all over it and I just it's it doesn't give the right impression  I mean it works  But it doesn't give the right impression with stamps calm all your packages look pro and your customers will like it too because they'll if  It's certified mail or you know, you need a confirmation. They will get an email with tracking number  Postage insurance is discounted through stamps calm and if you have to fill out forms for certified mail or international customs  stamps calm will do it automatically right from  The the website so you really not doing any data entry on this it saves you time  It saves you money and it looks more professional. I look there's no question. You need to try it. Here's the deal  Go to stamps calm right now click the microphone  Up there in the upper right hand corner and use our promo code twit  Watch this because it said five dollars in free postage. I think we can improve on that  Just put TW IT in the promo code there and then whoa  Suddenly, it's on a hundred ten dollar bonus offer including fifty five dollars in postage. You get the scale you get a month of  Stamps calm you got to try it today  I'm telling you it will change the way you look at mailing  Stamps calm before you do anything else click the microphone at the top of the home page and type in twit  Stamps calm use the offer code twit. I need this I got a I got really have to praise stamps calm  Because they're one of the early podcast advertisers. They've been so supportive. I don't know how many years now  We've been doing their ads on the twit and they just it's a great company  I've always loved them and I'm really glad that they have been so supportive so many podcasts are supported by stamps calm to be Frank  Including ours, so thank you stamps calm Jenny.

Robot we all know what a Raspberry Pi is  I  Like this article from Benedict Evans in his blog forget about the mobile internet  It's it's the internet as more and more people visit websites on mobile devices  It's silly to say there's a mobile internet and a regular internet.
