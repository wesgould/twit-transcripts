Transcript:  out about this this announcement on the 22nd is Apple has done this very  unappled thing where they have announced a product and they're talking about it  but it doesn't exist yet and that's the Mac Pro and that's expected to be one of  the things coming this this week it's made in the US it's their first product  made in the US in a long time out in El Paso is that made in Texas is made in  Texas all right yeah made in El Paso right and probably with one of the joint  Mexican US factories over there and my suspicion is that I'm real curious as to  kind of why I still don't understand why they talked about it so far in advance

Start time: 503.98
End time: 516.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

They're going to send assassins after you for having this prototype.  It's got the blower in the top but it's made out of duct tape so it's not exactly.  That's gaffers tape. I like the little logo on the bottom.  But we wanted to kind of estimate about what it would be like.  You can't tell from the ad. It probably weighs more than that.  It's in space you know but it isn't very big it's small enough that you  could you know put it on your desk like that. Of course what this doesn't include  is all the external peripherals and hard drives you're going to have to add to  make it do anything. All Thunderbolt right? Yeah. Thunderbolt 2. I don't think the pro

Start time: 595.08
End time: 607.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  community is all that happy with what they've seen because it does it's not  very expandable from within it all relies on these external devices and I'm  not necessarily sure that that's what the pro community wants. Well as we have 49.91

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cthulhu? It's gonna look like Cthulhu. That's why I got a Thunderbolt Drobo on my system. It's fast.  That's nerdy I like that. That's pretty nerdy. But it's gonna cost $12,000 to buy one of these  things with a raid. I think you can get one cheaper than that. I think you're  exaggerating the price. You're gonna need like I don't know 20 gigs of RAM in there  and you're gonna need you know all the hard drives. The people using this. What if you're just  running WordStar? Nobody runs WordStar. What are you talking about? You can run that on an Arduino board.  You don't need to have a $12,000 Mac for that. I mean the people that are using this thing

Start time: 737.88
End time: 754.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's my prediction. There will be a relatively inexpensive and I'm gonna say $24.99 version of  this that no one will want but that will establish the starting at price right? Yeah that's all that  matters. Yeah it's the old radio chat. Starting at $24.99. But the one you want will be $5,000 or more.

Start time: 757.78
End time: 773.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The one you want is fully decked out because $12,000. And you have not priced this out you're just  making this up. The last Mac Pro my friend bought when it was $12,000 when he got all the SSD and  all the hard drives. It's easy to. I think you want two new Mac monitors. There'll be a lot of people

Start time: 773.86

Start time: 780.26
End time: 844.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm hoping the $24.99 will have 128 gigs of storage. It'll have 8 gigs of RAM. It won't be it'll be like  or even 4 gigs of RAM. It'll be the simplest dumbest one. In fact by the way notice if you go to buy a  Mac Pro today quad core $24.99 again starting at but it's not hard to get to 12 core $37.99 and then  start to add features. Well you know let's have a little bit faster processor. Let's get to a 64 gigs  of RAM. Let's put in a solid-state drive. Let's put in a 2 terabyte second drive third drive. And already I'm up to 10 grand. I'm up to $92.49 already.  Plus you're adding drive after crazy drive. I'll take out those extra drives. Back some stuff up. One solid-state and one spinning.  Okay and then so I won't fill up. Now graphics do I want you don't want the 5770 you want the 5870. Why? Can you add like a Tesla? 100 better. We'll just get a Tesla.  100 better.

Start time: 850.46

Start time: 856.02
End time: 864.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's still even if it was the same price as the old model. If it's Apple. It's more expensive. Yes it would. So a 4k cinema display is going to be what?

It's got the cooling core is hollow. What are you laughing at? This is an exact repeat. The cooling fan is hollow and one fan draws the heat up through the core.  It makes noise. No no no. It's a big you know so you know the bigger the blades and the quieter it is. So it can rotate slower. I suspect this will be a very quiet machine.

Transcript:  Exactly and it would have worked better.

Start time: 1078.54
End time: 1102.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it wouldn't be down.  I could tell you that right now.  You even if a million people tried to sign up at Squarespace dot com you can't bring a Squarespace site down.  You know I could have saved the government a lot of money a lot of money.  I'm going to save you a lot of money.  We had a caller today on the radio show say I spent a lot of money on my radio.

XM kicked all the Clear Channel stations off the America's Talking station.  Well what do you think that was?  Oh that's a good story and I'll tell you that as soon as I get to Squarespace.  We'll do it when we get back to the show.  Yeah.  So this guy called up and said,  you know I spent a lot of money on a website and the developer has absconded.  I don't know who did the name.  Is it the government you're talking about?  No it could have been though.  I don't know where it's hosted.  I've lost the keys to the kingdom and this happens all the time.  Because people don't know.  They want to do a website.  They go and they get a contractor and they don't realize the contractor has got the domain name in their name.  They've got the hosting in their name.  And if they leave or they move to Aruba, you're out of luck.  That's dumb.  Squarespace, you've got complete control of it all.  They will register a domain name for you so it's all set up.  When you buy the annual plan they'll do that for free.  And you'll get the greatest hosting in the world.  It never goes down.  Attached to the best content management system.  And that's I think one of the reasons the hosting works so well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that everyday users complain about, but it kind of doesn't  go far enough.  There are little things in it that make it a lot easier.  When people would complain to me that they didn't like Windows  8, they couldn't find their programs, I would tell them to  use the search box.  And that brings up that kind of wide field of apps.  So you can see all your apps like the program groups.  And they've put that in there with that little arrow down at  the bottom of the live tile, the live tile field.  And that gives you, lets you see everything.  So if you kind of take somebody who doesn't like Windows 8 and  show them Windows 8 one and walk them through it, I've done this  with a few folks, they tend to like it better.  But there's still that annoying, that start screen just really is  irritating to people.  It makes them feel like they can't find their stuff.  And I like David Pogue's review where he essentially...  I thought he was right on.  I think he nailed it.  Yes, he did.  What did Pogue say?  He said there's two worlds.  There's tile world and there's desktop world.  And the two just aren't really, don't mesh that well.  Microsoft did one interesting thing where they finally allowed  you to have the same wallpaper for the tile background as the  desktop.  But find that setting.  I cannot find that setting.  I've been searching.

Transcript:  It really does unify the experience.  But I tell you, my experience is a little different.  I was always a Windows guy.  I never had an Apple computer ever until a couple of years ago,  a company I was at, they were like, we don't have a Windows  laptop handy, we're going to give you a Mac.  And I said, I'll try it, sure.  And so I've been Mac ever since.  And that was the sort of the Windows XP days and it was a  pain in the butt to manage the computer.  But I kept an eye on Windows and then I got this Surface RT,  and Windows 8, and the first time I played with it,  with Windows in years.  And what they call tile world and Pogues framing of this  thing, that's all I use.  I've got a bunch of apps.  They're all native to Windows.  I use it every day.  Now, my main machine is still my Mac, but I go in there and I  fire up Skype.  I set up a couple tiles.  Next to it is my chat or whatever I'm doing or a browser  open to whatever we're talking about in Skype.  And I got the next one.  It's the best Skype on any platform.  It's the best Netflix on any platform.  It looks really nice.  It works great.  And I'm kind of like, maybe I'm crazy.  Maybe I'm like the only person that really gets this thing.  But I'm like every once in a while I can drop into office if  somebody sent me a Word doc.  But that's how often does that even happen anymore.  But for the things that I'm doing every day, I use Trello  that sort of list making app, the to do app kind of thing.  Dan Bricler, right?  Yeah, it's Joe Spolsky.  Joe Spolsky, that's right.  Yeah.  And that's a great app.  And they're all really good apps.  And I feel like, hey, and I can have two of them up at a time,  which I can't do on my iPad.  I can copy and paste really easily, do all those kinds of  things I would do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not that bad is not a sterling endorsement.  It's not that bad is a very wimpy kind of thing to say.  What Poe said, and I think he's right on is, and I believe  I'll extend a little bit what he said, is that I believe this  is an adolescent software program that Microsoft is in  between two stages of growth.  They're going from the desktop world.  Two stages of death.  They're going from the desktop world to the tablet world.  They've acknowledged that we're in a post PC universe.  They understand we need to be a tablet operating system.  In fact, Mary Jo Foley says her sources at Microsoft says the  next version of Windows, which won't be out till spring 2015,  is going to be based on get this Windows phone.  This is where Microsoft's going.  And so when you use Windows 8, you're using an adolescent  product that's halfway grown.  It's half between desktop and half between tablet.

I didn't see a single Windows box there.  And these are the kids who are building the companies.  They're bringing cool stuff to the market.  And so if you are betting on the Windows ecosystem.  What did they have?  Macs.  Mac laptops.  I saw Androids everywhere.  These kids are totally into the mobile phones.  That's where they're developing the cool stuff.  iPhone or Android, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree with that.  But in business, if you go to any office, it's Windows  everywhere.  Even our office, it's Windows everywhere.  That's what people use.  And this is Microsoft's problem is that there are all these  people who are using Excel on the desktop.  They can't abandon them.  That's just Microsoft historically has always had so  much trouble leaving legacy behind.  But they really apparently have decided that the world is  post PC and they don't want to be in the PC business.  They even call themselves a devices and services company.  This reorganization is along those lines.  They bought Nokia because they want to sell Surface and  phones.  You know why?

Start time: 1777.30
End time: 1787.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because how many phones are selling this year?  900 million smartphones.  And 4 to 10% are Windows phones.  And Microsoft does not like that.  And Microsoft does not like that number.

End time: 1824.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  I think that the...  Microsoft is doing well in legacy.  Leo's right.  You go into any business in America, you go into  middle America and everybody's using, everybody's still  using Windows, but there's no growth there.  And Microsoft as a public company has to go where the  growth is.  And so this is their shot at it.  The problem is they're not doing well in the areas that  are growing heavily.  They're not doing well in tablets.  They're not doing well in phones.  And Microsoft is...  They have to serve legacy because that's where their  current cash cow is.  It's very similar to the newspaper business.  They have to serve legacy.  By the way...  You can't kill the old.

You know, Robert's an enthusiast,  but you put it on the head of people  who want to do it, actually do things,  and I think it becomes more clunky than useful.  And the same thing is true with the Galaxy Gear.  Galaxy Gear is a great proof of concept,  but it is not there yet.

There's games, for instance,  that I've seen built that were hacked into the glass  where aliens come off the ceiling  and you shoot them just by looking at them.  This would be great for someone on drugs.  There's a lot of functionality to come.  And that's why you can't base  where the market's going to be based on this product yet.  Oh, I agree.

The last time they were at Erbibuena Center  they did stream.  So we're hoping they'll stream.  If they do, we'll carry the stream  and then we'll put silhouettes of our heads  in front of it as we comment.  What we are pretty sure is going to be new iPads  and possibly a new Macro.

Everybody who's seen this Apple I watch say,  Pebble is not going to be the watch anybody wants.  How much will the Apple watch?

Meeting is believing.  Okay, we kind of think we said everything there is to say  about Apple.  According to Verizon, 51% of smartphone activations  are now iPhones.  What do we think about the sales of the 5S versus the 5C?  No surprise, I think.  I don't think there's any...

Start time: 4861.75
End time: 4885.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think anybody thought that the 5C would take off.  And I'm surprised Apple, you know,  that they've had to kind of rejigger their production  between one to the other.  I think they should have had the 5S production level  higher all along.  I think they were hoping maybe in development  that they would have had a little bit more of a  more interesting phone.  We're hoping maybe in developing countries  there'll be more interest,

Start time: 4885.58
End time: 4894.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 4896.58
End time: 4914.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I think these things are relative though, right?  That's within Apple's universe.  I think a 5C probably outsells any individual Android phone  except for maybe the top end Samsung Galaxy.  It's a relative thing.  It's like a failure for Apple is a success  for almost everybody else.

Start time: 4915.04
End time: 4920.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

End time: 4942.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which makes sense, right?  It's not that big a jump.  It's the second choice.  It's not that big a jump over the 5, right?  I mean, I have a 5S, and if I wasn't in the business...  The fingerprint's pretty awesome.  I like it, but it's not the killer feature  that makes people...

Start time: 4946.70
End time: 4958.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

End time: 4979.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah, whatever.  Well, that's usually the case for the S series.  They're usually a, yeah, whatever kind of phone.  It's a marginal upgrade, yeah.  Right, right.  But it'll be real, but my suspicion is,  and I think most people who watch Apple think,  that with the 6, you'll actually have a substantial size increase  and that'll be the next killer feature.  I think it'll go close to a 5 inch phone.

So the Play Store accidentally put up an ad for the Nexus 5,  which looks to be another great phone.  It's from LG.  $350 for 16 gigabytes.  That's half what comparable phones like the HTC One cost.  I think these are dynamite phones.  But it's delayed.  I don't know if it's because the FCC was closed or what,  but it's delayed.  Waiting for 4.4, KitKat and the Google Watch and the Nexus 4.

Start time: 5369.34
End time: 5434.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, not really.  It's really simple.  We're all like, we want everybody to have a fair shot.  I don't think there's anything complicated to it.  I've known Dick a dozen years, more than that,  since he had a startup back in 99 called Spy On It,  which few old timers will remember.  What it did is it would send you an instant message  when your favorite website updated,  if that sounds familiar.  Wow, I don't remember that at all.  It was a great startup based out of Chicago.  Of course, the dot coms collapsed back in 2000, 2001,  and they ended up selling to some enterprise company.  But that was where we connected.  A lot of early blogs...  I remember Boing Boing used to have a Spy On It button.  Follow us on Spy On It and you'll get  an AOL instant messenger update when we update.  So that was cool, and that was where we connected.  I've known Dick a long time,  and other folks on the Twitter board have Williams,  other folks like that.  I think they are and have been working earnestly  to get women on the board.  Then there's a New York Times story about,  hey, they don't have any women on the board.  I think the majority of Twitter users are women,  so that makes sense.  There's nothing complicated about that.

Start time: 5434.34

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The New York Times story quoted an academic,  Vivick Wadhwa,  saying Twitter's imbalance was elite arrogance  and the same male chauvinistic thinking  that permanates in Silicon Valley.  Costello's response was,  Vivick Wadhwa is the carrot top of academic sources.

Start time: 5451.74
End time: 5491.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think Vivick is a firebrand.  Anytime you're an advocate,  you need somebody who's going to be all in,  just the radical kind of pounding their fist.  I think Vivick is that guy,  and I appreciate him doing it.  If you're all going to be billionaires anyway,  you can take a little bit of criticism.  What I was surprised by knowing Dick a long time  was that he would go with the sort of Vivick is carrot top.  Either the criticism's legitimate,  or it's not,  but I don't like that guy is sort of unrelated to the concept  of, well, does it make sense to have  a woman on the board of Twitter?  So you tweeted,

Start time: 5491.66
End time: 5500.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  sorely disappointed to see Dick respond defensively  to criticisms of industry sexism.  Why not just lead, as Twitter does on free speech,  and that's true.  They've really led on that.

Start time: 5500.50
End time: 5517.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're great on free speech,  they're great on patents,  they're great on a whole bunch of other issues.  I think they've got incredible women  who are executives at the company,  like a Katie Stanton who heads up International,  or a Chloe Sladen who heads up Media.  They're incredible.  So the company's good at this overall,  and it's just like you don't need to be defensive about this.  Costello responded to you,

Start time: 5518.82

Transcript:  Well, it is different too,  where I think that if Dick had said that to me,  I would have gotten it as funny  because we know each other a long time.  I don't think he knows Vivek personally,  I don't know, but I don't think he does.  And certainly, yeah, I mean, Dick is really funny.  He's not like a little bit funny,  he's like professional grade funny.  He was on Second City with Amy Poehler and Tina Fey  and folks that are household names.  He was real funny.  Why did he give up the career to run this company?

Start time: 5594.76
End time: 5619.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The team that did Spy On It sold that company.  They, however long they had to sit in the enterprise company,  they sold that too.  As soon as they left, they started Feedburner,  which they said,  let's try this real-time delivery of information again.  And that got bought by Google, of course.  That got bought by Google.  And then they, you know, and then Dick left there  and now he's like at Twitter, he started as COO,  working on real-time delivery of information  again.  This is an obsession for all these...  You know, what shocks me is that Carrot Top,

Start time: 5635.62
End time: 5678.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  which is finding...  So board of directors are directional things.  If you want to change your company  and your company is going that way,  and you want to change it to go that way,  you have to put new board members  that have the skills to drive you this way.  And, you know, we've been thinking a lot about this  and it's really hard to say you need,  let's say, really hardcore mobile talent,  somebody who's built a mobile company.  And the women who are in that space,  who are really good candidates,  are fully booked and fully...  Oh, sure, but...  It's really hard.  Times came up with 25 people  that could have on the board.  It is a hard problem.  You know, that's actually...

Start time: 5679.02
End time: 5700.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think broadly that's true.  The difference is Twitter is going to be  the hottest IPO of the year.  They are a household name.  They're an important tech company.  They're not struggling.  Should there be more women candidates  who are able to participate in boards?  Yes.  But that's not the issue for Twitter.  Whoever they ask is going to say yes.  They've got binders full of women.  There's no problem.

That's what I don't get is why they don't just say that  because I'm sure, 100% sure that's true.  If they just said we're working on it  and we're going to talk about it when we can...

Start time: 5719.74
End time: 5727.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

This is true on Twitter.  It's across the board.  Women are more active in social media and spend more.  I was at a conference called Focus 100  and the stat on stage was that no group spends more  through mobile on products,  no sort of individual demographic spending.  No sort of individual demographic spends  more on mobile spending than black women in America.  Wow.  It's stunning to me.  That is a surprise, isn't it?

I sent Vivek an email too saying,  I'm glad you feel strongly about this  but I don't think there's any reason  we need to be the advocates on this  when I look at somebody like Rachel Sklar  or I look at...  There's dozens of women that respond to this  and none of them got quoted in the Times.  That's part of the problem.

When I was traveling, I went to Troy and I thought,  well, I should listen to the Iliad.  Then I got a college course on Homer's Odyssey and Iliad  as I'm walking through Troy, which is good,  because Troy really, you know what?  It's just a bunch of rocks.  Yeah.  It really isn't a lot going on.  They do have the horse.  They close the clubs.  The wooden horse from the movie they have there,  but that's about it.  Is that right?  That's true.

Transcript:  So Sony is the first major movie company  to do a deal with Netflix.  Now Netflix has did a deal to do House of Cards  with Trigger Street, the production company.  Awesome show.  I can't wait.  Season two is coming soon.  Orange is the New Black by Jenji Cohen,  the creator of Weeds.  They brought Arrested Development back.  Sony Studios did Breaking Bad.  They did The Blacklist.  And the creators of Damages,  they're going to do a TV series, a TV show for Netflix.  This is, I think, good news.  I think Netflix has done a great job.  And I'm thrilled to see a real studio doing this deal.  In the deal, Netflix gets the right to premiere  the one-hour drama everywhere.  Surprising, maybe, that Sony's doing this,  but I think a sign, there's a new model afoot  for television production.  Good news.  You can email cash to anybody.  This makes me nervous,  and I want somebody to reassure me.  Square is going to let me email cash to people  if you have a debit card.  Has anybody used this?

But I mean, I could email cash through my Chase account  or through my PayPal account for years.  Okay.  So that's okay.  It's just marketing, really.  It's marketing.  It's an alternative.
