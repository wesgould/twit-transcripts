Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Last hurrah. I mean, it's hard to say last of anything. I don't think it's really going to be your last.  In fact, I just did a course on this over the summer of how Jesuits used to go and that's the last you would see of them.  Well, we live in the modern world, right? And I'm flying back and forth to the states 15 times a year.  Plus, y'all live longer. We live. Well, I might. He's going to Rome.

Start time: 138.26
End time: 149.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's going to be working in the Vatican, in Vatican City.  But you will be coming back here. I know you're next going to be back for Dreamforce and CES.  So we're going to see more of you, I hope. Right. Yeah, I booked a gig at Dreamforce.

Start time: 149.08
End time: 160.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I'm doing a talk for a company that wants me to talk about the next generation of CRM.  And I figured as long as I'm in town, I'll stay for Oculus Connect. Sintillating. I know, right?

Start time: 161.10
End time: 170.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just so it's so odd that the guy who goes to the Vatican to be in charge of technology is talking about the next generation of CES.  Talking about the next generation of CRM. It's just it's just odd.

Start time: 171.12
End time: 179.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is odd. But you should come because you can be there with at least 20 to 30 other people listening.  No, you'll be fine. Thank you.

Start time: 180.06
End time: 203.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although, they did have a couple of years ago, they had who's got got a white wedding, the song.  Oh, Billy Idol. Billy Idol. He played Dreamforce and he changed the lyrics of the song to It's a Nice Day for CRM.  That's really all you need. It was that bad. It was just like, OK, right.  The check was that big. Yeah, exactly. You're off the artistic register into the cupboard with you with the advertising.

Start time: 204.98
End time: 227.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's Ian Thompson for the register.co.uk, where he's now editor for news editor. Right. Yep. Yep. Great to have you, Ian, as always.  Recovering from DEF CON. But yeah. Yeah.  We're asked about that. And of course, Patrick Norton is also here from TechThing.com. Hey. So it's kind of an all star panel.  Really wonderful to have you. Did you go to DEF CON this year? I was at DEF CON. All three of us were at DEF CON. All three of you.

Start time: 228.14
End time: 233.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I was being stoked at DEF CON by somebody. We were at it. We were at a Pony Awards.

Start time: 235.04
End time: 247.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I started taking pictures of Ian and I could see him looking around to see where I was.  So I started taking video of him looking around. I was on Twitter.  And I was like, you're supposed to get permission.  And this is true. This is true. Unless it's funny.

Start time: 248.50
End time: 252.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that was the rule. All depends on who you're taking a picture of and whether they consider it funny.

Start time: 253.90
End time: 275.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can we get a taller microphone for Robert? Oh, no.  It's like you have a little. We'll just put it. We'll just put a dictionary or something underneath. I like the baby mic.  Your microphone's way down there. It makes me feel so dainty.  So did you both go to did you all go to Black Hat and DEF CON or just DEF CON?  And B-Sides, yeah. And B-Sides. So now three conferences all in Vegas at the same time.

Start time: 276.28
End time: 282.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Three conferences you can't get into anything at unless you wait nine hours in line for.  Well, not B-Sides. B-Sides is pretty cool.

Start time: 282.02
End time: 289.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say, B-Sides you could get into. I'm kind of biased because I was presenting a couple of talks there.  But DEF CON was just ridiculous.

Start time: 289.48
End time: 291.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what are the three different conferences and what is the role of each?

Start time: 293.74
End time: 306.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, B-Sides started up as a conference for people who couldn't get into Black Hat,  but in fact has metamorphosized into stuff which is slightly too edgy for Black Hat.  So that's quite fun. Black Hat's more corporate. Black Hat's RSA with hookers.

Start time: 307.02
End time: 311.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, Black Hat's turned into a place. No, Black Hat's where people, Black Hat's where you go.

Start time: 311.00
End time: 312.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's robots in the audience. Please.

Start time: 313.73
End time: 314.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, with robot hookers as well.

Start time: 315.08
End time: 328.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Black Hat's where you go if you're trying to find your next job.  B-Sides is where you go if you're actually serious about staying ahead of security.  And DEF CON's where you go if you can't afford Black Hat and care about security,  but couldn't spend the extra, get out of work for B-Sides.

Start time: 329.04
End time: 353.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Although there has been an evolution of Black Hat. I will give them this.  Because Black Hat used to be, for me, it was the place that your corporation would pay for you to go  because it's a professional conference.  And executives, C-suite executives, could learn enough so that they don't sound stupid when they're speaking to their engineers.  That changed. The last two years, but especially this year, there were talks at Black Hat  that I previously had only seen at B-Sides or DEF CON.

Start time: 353.78
End time: 367.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The talks at Black Hat this year were a lot better than they have been in previous years.  The last couple of years it's been getting pretty nasty, but the way we describe it to readers is basically  if you want to know what isn't in the manual, then you go to Black Hat.  If you want to know how to hack the source code, you go to B-Sides or DEF CON.

Start time: 368.19
End time: 400.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So DEF CON and B-Sides are very similar in that sense.  What we're used to with, at least from the outside, is that DEF CON is where all the people with zero days go  to announce their unique ways to hack cars or hack ATM machines.  In fact, we always have on Security Now a bunch of stories after DEF CON about,  okay, now you've got to worry about this. In fact, was Foreshadow announced at DEF CON?  There were a whole bunch of new vulnerabilities that came out.  But is that not the case anymore?  No, they still had a lot of vulnerabilities at DEF CON.

Start time: 402.10
End time: 411.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In some ways, DEF CON has always been the more affordable punk rock little sister of Black Hat,  or little brother if you prefer, where it was much more democratic in the sense that just about everybody could afford to get there.

Start time: 412.42
End time: 417.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But now it's like Burning Man, like everybody's there. Is that right? Has it become very popular?

Start time: 417.48
End time: 425.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It felt that way 20 years ago when it was 2,500 people and it kind of feels like...  It's funny because a lot of people...  Well, how many people is it now?

Start time: 426.54
End time: 445.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean Rob Joyce, the NSA's former tele-access operations guy, gave a keynote on the second day.  And that was a 5,000 seat auditorium he was talking at.  It filled up within 30 minutes and there were at least twice that number of people trying to get in, queuing all the way down the hall and back again.  It's just got too big.

Start time: 446.24
End time: 451.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I remember DEF CON where you could jump from one keynote to the next, from one track to the next. You can't do that anymore.  That was a lot.

Start time: 452.04
End time: 463.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have to pick a track.  That's been like 12 years. I think it was like 8 years ago.  I realized I was either going to wait for 4 hours to get into a session or I wasn't going to be able to see a session,  I mean seeing one session a day.

Start time: 463.04
End time: 478.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was about DEF CON 22 or so where I just realized, look, these talks are all going to be available afterwards.  I'm going to spend my time in the villages.  DEF CON to me is now hacker summer camp.  It's where I get to meet up with people that maybe I only see once a year and then I'll learn the stuff later on.

Start time: 479.04
End time: 491.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, one of the big stories of course was Voter Village this year.  They had voting machines, some still in service, right?  Many still in service from all over the country and encouraged people to hack them.

Start time: 491.52
End time: 498.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, an 11-year-old managed to hack a replica of a government election results website in just 10 minutes.

Start time: 500.49
End time: 510.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a lot of talk about whether or not that was actually hacking an election.  And the base is he was able to gain access to a replica of something that would have been, quote unquote, official information.

Start time: 510.20
End time: 522.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Secretary of State's website where they would announce the winner of an election.  So even if it's, you know, we'll fix it, it's disruptive that he got in. That's not good.  I did see though a number of voting machines easily modified, easily hacked.

Start time: 524.32
End time: 549.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I spent like an hour in there and one of the, it wasn't a voting machine, but it was the poll worker tablet.  So it's the device that the poll worker would have so that he or she knows how to run what's going on, would direct people to the right machines, et cetera, et cetera.  And it was just noob stuff. It was using a PCMCIA card for its configuration.  The file was not signed in any way, shape or form.  So anyone could pop the thing out, reconfigure it and change what the poll worker was doing.

Start time: 550.52
End time: 559.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of them had a memory, an SD card, which was physically available to anybody who was in.  Just pop it out.  Just pop it out, put in the operating system and that's fine. We're done.

Start time: 561.26
End time: 594.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was interesting because one of the things, the kind of the Association of Secretaries of State, which I'm getting the name wrong,  but essentially a group that represents the Secretaries of State were like, this is not legit because this is not how, you know, the security isn't in place.  People wouldn't have access.  And the truth is, is, you know, on one hand, sure.  You know, generally speaking, you don't have all these voting machines and tens of thousands of hackers circling around them during an election.  But the flip side is that a lot of this stuff that was being caught was stuff that makes security professionals go like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Start time: 595.48
End time: 601.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Something as simple as not signing a file.  Why would you not sign a file? Why would you not design the hardware so it won't work without a signed file?

Start time: 602.26
End time: 609.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why not? Is it the companies that design election and voting machines are not sophisticated or are they not worried?

Start time: 609.68
End time: 611.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've already been paid. Yeah, exactly. They don't give a monkey's.

Start time: 612.24
End time: 622.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's hard with plenty of other industries where secure best practices are known and adhered to.  Why is it you would think this would be an industry where it would be important?

Start time: 622.96
End time: 630.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because in their mind, they think that the attack surface is so small that it's not worth it because they think, oh, these these machines are brought out what?

Start time: 630.64
End time: 643.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Once a year. And we've heard that also, that because our system in the United States is so heterogeneous that even if you figure out how to hack one machine, there's still many, many other ways.  Every every county effectively decides how it's going to vote.

Start time: 643.00
End time: 665.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But if you looked at what the stuff they were doing, I mean, basically they were taking a whole variety of manufacturers machines and taking them part.  I mean, and some of the manufacturers kind of tried to preempt the whole thing by putting out press releases.  Oh, this is a very, very, very minor use case. I know.  It was so sad. It was just like, we know you're going to hack us, but, you know, it's not really that important.  But we recognize that ahead of the facts, so it doesn't really count.

Start time: 665.48
End time: 666.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's like, no, it was pathetic.

Start time: 667.00
End time: 682.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like it. It was funny because like Matt Blais did a follow up on this.  He's like every expert on voting security use precinct counted optical scan balance at risk limiting audits.  Internet. I don't know what that is, but here's my idea. I spent 10 minutes on that. I'm sure it's better.  Your idea doesn't work. Internet. But it has blockchain.

Start time: 683.42
End time: 684.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, my God. That's how we solve this.

Start time: 685.02
End time: 686.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The minute you hear blockchain, you know, the arguments.

Start time: 687.00
End time: 690.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I walked away. Every booth at Blackhat that did and block. No, no, no.

Start time: 691.36
End time: 704.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it was great. I mean, Perissa Trebritz is to British keynote at Blackhat when she started.  First off, blockchain is not going to save you.  And you just heard a million vendors go, we need to redo the signage.  Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

Start time: 705.54
End time: 712.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In principle, the notion of an encrypted decentralized ledger system seems like it'd be perfect for voting.

Start time: 713.60
End time: 737.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's been used in something came up with a I forget the name of the system now, but they used it in university elections.  And it enables both privacy and also checking for results.  But I was talking to one of the guys that actually was one of the voting villages.  She's like, yeah, those kind of things are great when you're running them out over like a thousand people in the university sector, but trying to run out on national scale.  There's all kinds of bugs.

Start time: 737.16
End time: 747.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The irony is the old method of paper ballots is still the best.  And in fact, I'm seeing a lot of technology experts say just go back to paper.  Yeah, no, exactly.

Start time: 748.06
End time: 752.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was the optical scanning of paper ballots that leaves trail because you can then go back recount.

Start time: 753.72
End time: 760.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think part of this comes from 2000 when the hanging chads in Florida became a big issue and we saw recounts on TV for hours.

Start time: 761.00
End time: 764.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Fortunately, we don't have anyone trying to influence elections in the United States in the current cycle.

Start time: 764.54
End time: 767.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's harder to influence paper ballots, isn't it?

Start time: 767.14
End time: 786.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, actually, there was a very interesting point that the old paper ballots.  This is one of the guys that this is a talk at Schmooch on.  They suffered from their own denial of service attack because if you've got a very popular candidate, you'd press down on the thing.  It would punch through.  But if enough people have punched through before, there was a lot of paper underneath the ballot and you couldn't vote.  And you couldn't punch all the way through.

Start time: 786.26
End time: 791.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, can we just get them to clean the tray once in a while?  Just right across on a piece of paper.

Start time: 791.79
End time: 793.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's worked for the UK for 500 years.

Start time: 794.18
End time: 822.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, the other thing is if you're going to hack paper ballots, if you have electronic counting, that's where you hack it.  You don't hack it at the paper ballot.  In fact, much more efficient just to hack the counting machines.  So the paper trail is important because you need to be able to audit it in some way or fashion.  And there are unfortunately quite a few still electronic voting machines used in the United States in elections do not have a paper trail at all.  There's no there's not a receipt.  It's computerized.  That makes it better, Leo.  Yeah, it's Internet.  Yeah, everything's better with Internet.

Start time: 822.80
End time: 833.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's why the suggestion that the block chain will fix it is kind of ridiculous because the block chain is great for many things, specifically for auditing,  but not necessarily for verifying that one into the audit was valid.

Start time: 834.02
End time: 883.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then there is the whole issue.  And this is something that Facebook and Twitter and other big tech companies are concerned about of influence being used over the Internet during the election.  This week, a dozen of the biggest tech companies in the US met at Twitter's headquarters.  This was the second meeting they'd had Google, Microsoft, Snapchat.  They had gone before to meet with the with the FBI and the Foreign Influence Task Force.  And at that time, they were very unhappy because the FBI said, you tell us, but we won't tell you.  They didn't give them any information about what threats they should be aware of.  That makes sense.  I think that the second meeting, it sounds like these guys are saying, well, we're not going to be able to get much help from the feds.  So what are we going to do?  How are we going to handle this?

Start time: 884.64
End time: 910.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, the thing is, I was actually watching a this is not a phrase.  I'd say I'm kind of a swisher gave a very good point about this over the weekend to say, look, they aren't hacking Facebook and Twitter.  They're using it as it was meant to be used.  So whether or not tech companies can get their act together to actually do something about this in a way that isn't going to balk their entire business model, I'm highly skeptical about.  I don't think that that motivated to do it.

Start time: 911.60
End time: 918.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How can we be held not responsible for the content of our services if we actually are responsible for the content of our services?

Start time: 918.18
End time: 924.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Even if they wanted to, it's hard for them to fix it if their entire business model is based on it.  Yeah.

Start time: 925.70
End time: 951.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Also, social media is based on two main principles, the ability to be anonymous and the ability to amplify.  That's that's the whole social.  People like it. The more it gets amplified.  Well, if that's the core of your business, then you buy by design, you can't fix that problem because anybody with a sufficient enough network can amplify any message and it can be anonymous.  Well, all right.  So the only way to fix your service is to stop doing your service.

Start time: 951.08
End time: 962.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm just laughing like, you know, really would have Facebook to eliminate Facebook.  But just needs make promotion so expensive that no one can use it without bankrupting their nation.  So that'll take care of that.

Start time: 963.47
End time: 996.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah. But Mark has a program to cure the world of all known diseases in 20 years and that takes money.  So is that true?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. The Mark and Melissa.  Oh, no, no. What's his name?  The Gates Foundation.  No, no. Mark.  Oh, it's Priscilla Chan.  Yeah.  They they did an announcement about 18 months ago where they said they wanted to eliminate or make manageable all known diseases.  It works so well for Bill and Melinda that Priscilla and Mark wanted to honestly build.  Melinda have done great work with nearly polo polo is nearly gone.

Start time: 997.12
End time: 1019.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I was just reading a review of Steve Jobs, daughter Lisa.  Oh, yeah.  She says is a love story to her father.  But if you read it, apparently I haven't read it yet, but I read the review is like this guy was a complete jerk.  He was.  And but she says, but he did it in a loving way.  That's called Stockholm syndrome.

Start time: 1021.00
End time: 1038.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The funniest thing I thought it was at the end is she did.  The good news is she inherited from the jobs estate exactly in the same proportion as the other kids did.  All three inherited millions of dollars.  She didn't get the full estate.  And she said, which is too bad, because if I had, I would have given it to Bill and Melinda Gates for their charity.

Start time: 1048.16
End time: 1051.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

What's interesting about Zuckerberg is instead of waiting until he was done with the company,  he looked around and went, I have more money than I can ever spend for the rest of my life.  Perhaps I should start doing something useful with it now rather than waiting 30 years.  And I admire that.  Whether or not anything he's doing is realistic is entirely different.  No, no, no.

And it's not a charity.  It's a private enterprise being run in his name.  So it's not strictly speaking a nonprofit.  I don't want to discourage it.  I think it's great.  No, no, no.

This medical resonance, magnetic resonance imaging, a trove that will include as many  as three million images of knees, brains and livers to help Facebook's AI get smarter.  Now, I'm sure Facebook says, oh, our intent is to make MRIs work better and faster and  maybe, you know, eliminate radiologists.  But honestly, do you really want to be helping Facebook?

They're even behind IBM, whose Watson is a dog that hasn't found it.  Watson turned out not to be very good at medical.  Watson's painfully bad.  They've been shopping around all these industries.  They've just tested Watson on medical stuff.  It's like, ooh, actually, that's making a significant number of mistakes.  Honestly, Facebook is...  Do you remember, were you at F8 a few years ago?  And they're like, oh, yes, we're building AI into our messenger system.  And then they had to admit, well, obviously, there's a human being at the other end, but the AI will be there.  You're like, right, okay.  This is why the software developers' wives die.  So who do you trust, then?

Start time: 1450.63

Transcript:  It seems to me...  At first, I was saying, oh, Facebook.  But then I thought, well, Google.  Is that better?  Apple.  Is that better?  Is Waymo better?  Is Tesla better?  Any commercial entity is going to be working first on profit and secondarily on making the world a better place.

Transcript:  My thought is it's one thing to have a company that is...  A company that's going to maximize...  Since most companies are publicly held or the VCs will eventually decide that they want their return and will force them to go public,  I think I'm probably a lot more comfortable with companies that are like, we have this scientist, this person, this individual, this idea.  And feel free to point out certain blood testing systems in a couple of minutes after I finish my sentence.  But if their focus is actually improving MRI and they're not going to survive as an organization if they don't figure out how to make MRIs work better...  But that's also...  You know what I mean?  That's the motive.  This is like yet another sideline for Facebook.

Transcript:  These announcements mean nothing to me unless they come with exactly what they're looking for.  What is the measurable?  Yeah.  So it can't just be, oh, we're going to hand over 10,000 MRIs to Microsoft's analytics.  It's got to be because Microsoft wants to see if there's a commonality in X disease.

Start time: 1556.28
End time: 1569.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

So that's a problem.  And they don't have it.  There's not enough humans to monitor two billion users.  There just aren't.

People talk about the advertising market online being split up.  Like 90% of the revenue goes to Google and Facebook.  Google actually sends some of that back out in AdSense.  Facebook not only doesn't really particularly send the advertising revenue out,  they also are now making publishers pay for their carriage for all intents and purposes for their reach.

It's not like they don't have money to invest in a lot of areas to figure out how to do this.  No, there's an article on Motherboard that's interesting.

Start time: 1691.56
End time: 1743.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me finish my first thought, which is one of the reasons Facebook wants to kind of promote this notion  that we're working on AI, AI is smart, AI is good, is because they hope that people will buy the notion that AI is going to solve this moderation problem.  You and I know it's not.  Dave.  Dave.  It's not. It's not anywhere close to it.  And every time people...  Apparently Mark Zuckerberg has been having meetings now.  So this was a great article on Motherboard, the impossible job inside Facebook's struggle to moderate 2 billion people,  billions of posts a week in more than 100 languages.  Let's not forget that.  So what Mark Zuckerberg is doing is having dinner parties with leading social media academics,  a series of off-the-record dinners at his house in Palo Alto centering around the most important problem plaguing the company, content moderation.

Start time: 1745.14
End time: 1765.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a very smart PR move for Facebook to actually leak that stuff out.  But I'm sorry, it's just like, well, Mark Zuckerberg has...  He's having dinner.  He's talking about it at dinner.  But can you imagine a dinner party with Mark Zuckerberg?  You saw the photos when he went around America and had dinner with ordinary people.  I was like, hi, I'm trying to make it look like I'm enjoying this delicious mac and cheese, whereas I just want to get home.

Start time: 1766.22
End time: 1800.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Yeah.  We don't want mac and cheese. We'll handle this for me.  Yeah.  Remember when we went to Montgomery, Alabama for a tech TV event?  I think you were there, Patrick.  And we had breakfast at a very lovely home, a mansion in Montgomery.  Wasn't you?  No.  And the hostess served cheese grits to everybody, which I'm sure is a delicious Southern treat.

We've got some great people filling in.  Don't worry.  But we were going to bring our our regular toothbrushes.  And I had a brilliant idea.  I ordered two quips for travel.  This is the best electric toothbrush for travel, among other things, because it doesn't use a charger.  It's battery powered, a single AAA battery.  So it's very compact.  I love it's got this stick sticky adhesive on one side.  So you put it right on the mirror so you never forget to brush in.  And I'm sorry, I'm being terribly sluggish.  This is the first subscription electric toothbrush accepted by the American Dental Association.  Thousands of five star verified five star reviews.  The thing about this is this is not this is a system.  In America, we don't just like toothbrushes.  We get a system.  I mean, first of all, an electric toothbrush.  And we all know electric toothbrush is better.  My dentist, the other day, I had my teeth cleaned and she said, you use an electric toothbrush, not you.  And I said, yes, I do.  She said, very good job.  I should have said I use the quip.  The quip is awesome.  It makes brushing your teeth more simple and more enjoyable and more effective with their sonic, their sensitive sonic vibrations, gentle enough on your sensitive gums.  You don't want to brush too hard.  You don't want to wear away your teeth enamel.  It has a two minute timer that pulses every 30 seconds.  So you know when to switch sides.  Ninety percent of us don't brush for a full two minutes or don't clean evenly.  But here's what I love about the quip.  It's affordable, as little as twenty five dollars.  This is the best electric toothbrush you can get.  It's awesome.  We got his and her.  They're so inexpensive.  We're basically taking them on the trip.  We're just going to leave them on the boat because we kind of come home to our regular toothbrush.  What a great idea.  Brush heads are automatically delivered on a dentist recommended schedule.  So you don't use the head too long.  Every three months you get a new brush.  Just five dollars.  That shipping is included.  You don't want to use bristles that are old, worn out and ineffective.

Transcript:  Yeah, there's always one.  Did you see this?  This actually is very upsetting to me.  There was there were a series of robberies in southern Maine and the the cops had no idea.  So what they did, they went to a judge who signed a search warrant, which they sent to Google.  And they said, would you please send us the name, address and location of anyone who was in the vicinity of at least two of the nine robbery locations within 30 minutes of the crime?  Just everybody.  This is not based on the fact that they knew the guy had an Android phone.  Right.  By the way, it's Android or iOS, because if you use Google Apps.  This is a blatant data grab.

Authorities found the guy, arrested him, not based on his location data from his phone.  It actually was based on a footprint.  He and he had run out of his shoes.  Oh, you mean like good, good old fashioned old fashioned police?  But you see the thing I'm afraid of.  And look, I want to catch crooks as next as as much as the next guy.  What you don't want is law enforcement saying, oh, let's get a search warrant for everybody who was in the area.  Let's get everybody's name, address, phone number and and let's just sift through that.  See what we find.  That's that's what they call a phishing expedition.

They could have just bought the information.  This is the information that's for sale.  There are at least three startups that are partly funded by the CIA.  This is part of their incubator.  Secure Us.  This is the information that they buy so that they can provide real time data graphics on what people are doing because they can say, oh, look, there's a group forming.  So this is information that's already saleable.  The reason why this made the news is because this kind of didn't pass the smell test.  It wasn't being done for data analytics.  It wasn't being done to sell something.  It was being done because law enforcement said we need we know easier way to do our job.

Transcript:  And this is the problem is that I think so.  We've got to the point now where and this is something Moxie Marlin Spike said at RSA, the crypto panel RSA a couple of years ago.  You have to have the ability to break the law because when you think about it, civil rights, if you know, if the if the OK, if going back further, if the British had had the kind of data monitoring techniques in 1776 that are available, the tea party wouldn't have happened.  Well, I'm sorry.  Jefferson and his uncle would have been up a rope with a hemmed neck tie.  You know, the civil rights movement wouldn't have happened.  If you have a civil disobedience.  Yeah, you've got to have the ability to break the law.  And, you know, whether it's civil rights, whether it's in the last decade, it's gay rights can be privacy rights in the next decade.  There's got to be a certain.  That's how laws change, isn't it?  Yeah, laws change.  Because if everyone just obeyed the law, then we'd ossify.  No one would do anything.

I don't.  This isn't Minority Report.  I could just I know where everybody is at all times.  I know who they texted.  I know it's all in there.

It's just it's not perfect.  And, you know, I don't want to live in a country where law enforcement has a perfect view of everything that's going on.  I think that that's that sounds awful.  It's it's not an evolutionary state.  I don't want crime and I want law enforcement to have tools.  But I also don't want to live in a state where the state knows everything you're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Crimes Act under Australia's existing crimes act, this assistance and access bill strengthens the penalties.  It's already illegal for you not to unlock your phone for the police in Australia, apparently under the Crimes Act.  But now judges could jail if this bill passes a person for up to two years.  Just for not unlocking the phone.  And the bill extends proposed bill extends that for up to 10 years.  Oh, I get I'm sorry.  It's already two years.  They want to extend it to 10 years, 10 years in jail, not because you committed a crime, but because you won't unlock your phone.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They made it illegal to not unlock your phone.  That's been that's been the case for a while.  Because and what happens is I'm refusing to unlock my phone.  I get yanked into whatever they call the police stations in Australia.  There's a discussion which I'm sure is highly intellectual and thoughtful between the arresting officer and myself.  In the meantime, I played a lot of rugby with Australians.  OK, it left impressions.  The but at that point, what happens is that one of my associates, should I be someone who actually did something nefarious, has erased my phone remotely.  Possibly or they want they want to make this so threatening that people that aren't afraid of two years.  I mean, it's you know, it's it's it's like a classic like we're going to make life more complicated for everyone.

Start time: 2626.38
End time: 2637.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 2637.00
End time: 2644.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Transcript:  This is this is from a so naked security blog on so first dot com.  The flow chart in Australia for what they call the industry assistance process.  So law enforcement first is to ask for assistance from the telecommunications industry.  OK, if does the agency require assistance, assist accessing communications content or data?  Yes. Then get a warrant.  No. Well, maybe think figure out if a warrant's required.  Then they consult the provider.  Does the provider want to provide voluntary assistance?  Yes. Oh, good.  No problem. No.  Oh, is the provider currently capable?  In other words, is it encrypted?  We can't do anything if so agency and provider negotiate terms, conditions and any costs.  Agency gives provider a technical assistance notice.  Yeah, you have to help if they can't because it's encrypted.  Oh, that's fine.  Attorney General issues a proposed technical capability notice to the provider for consultation.  In other words, they order them to break the crypto.

Start time: 2783.20
End time: 2833.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, in a way, this is the problem.  We've when it comes to encryption, we've won the battle and we've lost the war.  And I think now the half encryption.  Well, I think now the governments have got the idea that they've accepted that it's mathematically impossible to backdoor encryption in a way that only you can access.  They've accepted that argument.  Now, what they've been saying is really I think they have.  Oh, how I think what they've been said decided is right.  We actually need to break encryption.  We just need to break the device.  So with the Australian law, if you want to sell a device or run a communication service in Australia and you get served with one of these notices, you have to give root access to that device to the government.  So you forget about breaking encryption.  You just give them the route to the route to their phone or their computer instead.  And that gets around all those mathematical problems of dealing with encryption and just basically everyone gets the shaft.

Transcript:  It's a difference between data at rest and data in transit.  For the longest time, they thought that they should be able to get at data in transit because that's the way they used to do it.  They would tap someone and they could hear things happening in real time.  They've I think they've understood maybe if they don't actually think that a backdoor encryption won't work.  They at least know now that politically it's untenable.

Start time: 2870.26
End time: 2900.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I also have another theory that they have learned over experience that even if they can't get the data as it's coming, they can get it after egress from the encrypted.  So they don't have to get it somewhere.  Yeah, they don't have to get Apple to cooperate.  They just get it on its way somewhere along the line.  We can we can capture.  In fact, that's that's what was going on.  The NSA was getting all of this data on the on the cross country backbones, not from the they didn't have to ask Google for it.  They just get it as it comes out of Google.  No problem.

But then there's also there's a hidden data partition.  So inside the encrypted partition, there's an encrypted partition that you cannot access.  That's thanks to the Qualcomm 845.  Thank you.  It uses the real time encryption.  No, but you know, it's just I mean, now that I said that, I mean, I think it's a good thing.

It's the it's the same thing as a secure enclave.  But it's one step beyond that, which is they won't even know it's there.  It looks like you've given them access to your device.

Yeah, you can because they literally because they can't really boot anything because it goes up to BIOS.  So the next evolution was to put a stripped down operating system install.  They show them the operating system, but all their files are stored on a server.  That's that plausible deniability.  TrueCrip used to do that.  It looks like normal files there.  But it literally like what they do is they basically travel with a blank laptop.

I have to say, even President Obama did exactly that.  Absolutely.  Yes, he did.  By making it easier and easier to prosecute whistleblowers and things.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you  by My Dinner.  I love it when we've got Blue Apron waiting at home.  Because I know I've got everything I need  to make an amazing gourmet meal  in half an hour to 45 minutes.  Blue Apron is awesome.  Number one fresh ingredient recipe delivery service  in the country.  Skip meal planning, get straight to cooking  with Blue Apron. All you've got to do, once a week  I go to the Blue Apron site, I pick our menu for the week.  Blue Apron delivers  perfect, fresh, pre-portioned  ingredients and the step-by-step  recipes. They show up  on my doorstep and  I am ready to cook. And we usually get  three meals a week. It's awesome.  You can choose two, three, or four recipes based  on what best fits your schedule.  Of course you can put it on hold any time.  We will for our vacation.  You can count on non-GMO ingredients.  Meat with no added hormones. Really delicious  stuff.  This is actually when I cooked  this week.  I'm still loving the summertime.  We're coming kind of the end, right?  Experience the joy of summer.  Mouth-watering grilling options. I do the grilling stuff  always. Seared chicken with a tangy barbecue  sauce. That was so good.  Juicy cheeseburgers with spicy slaw.  The side dishes often for me  are the real inspiration. There's things that I will  cook again and again.  The Blue Apron menu changes every week. It's always  based on what's in season, right?  Be sure to check out the menu for their  chef-designed recipes and exciting partnerships.  Are you ready for this?  Bob's Burger.  Bob's Burger and  MasterChef. The Gouda Wife  Burger from Bob's Burger. Yes!  Gouda Wife Burger.  Cheeseburgers with cucumber radish salsa.  If you're Bob's Burger fans, this is  like heaven. It's epic.  For grilling,  Tuscan pork chops with farro and  marinated mozzarella. That's a perfect example.  I'd never had farro before until I got Blue Apron. Now I  cook it all the time. Vadovan  shrimp and sweet chili sauce  with aromatic rice and almonds.  Great for date night.  Great to turn your family on to cooking. If you've got  kids, families with Blue Apron  and you're not a fan of blue apron,  you can cook together more often.  The kids can't help it. They smell something amazing.  They come in and say, what's for dinner?  And then they go, and I say, oh, this is great. You can help.  Just go over there, start stirring the shrimp or whatever  and it really gets them into cooking.  They have vegetarian choices as well.  Sweet and spicy soba noodles with cabbage,  cucumbers and fried eggs. Vegetarians will love that.  They're no longer, you know, kind of getting the side  dishes. They're getting something delicious just for them.  Check out this week's menu and get your first  three meals free.  Go to www.vadovan.com  slash twit. We love  our Blue Apron every week.  And I just, it's so much  fun to cook for somebody you love.  To cook a delicious meal for your family.  And have them enjoy it.  And 15 minutes later they left and you have to wash  the dishes. But, those 15  minutes are great. The cook never washes the dishes.  No, I know. I know. It's a rule.  But it is a little sad because when you make something that  delicious, they eat it really  fast. And it's like, okay, thanks. Bye.

Location history. Let's talk about Google.  We were talking about Google and location  history. As you know, the AP  did a, I thought  fairly interesting story, which  exposed...  The thing is, I have mixed feelings  about this. I kind of almost got in a fight with Steve Gibson over it.  So I'm going to let you  adjudicate. Here's what  the AP said.  They actually hired somebody at Princeton to  prove this. That even  if you turn off  location  collection on your  phone, actually we should be very clear  in our verbiage. Location  history on your phone,  Google will still  figure out where you are and save it to their servers.  If you open  Maps, for instance,  or  the browser Chrome, for instance,  because now, here's what I would  say.  And I got yelled at.  Well, duh.  There's a difference between  I don't want you to keep a location history  of me, everything I'm doing as I use my phone,  but I would like to have  Maps work. Well, of  course, as soon as you open Maps, it's going to send  to Google's servers where you are, download the Map,  and even keep track of that so you can  go back.  Same thing with Search.  And I would further say you could  turn it off. The problem is Google  didn't make it easy to turn it off. They made it all

Start time: 3989.12
End time: 4017.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well and difficult. If you go to  location history and say  no, I don't want you to track, they'd still track  you. If you wanted to get rid of  the tracking functions, you had to go into Web  and App Activity options and go  and drill down right to the specific level  you wanted. This is  just like, well, you can do it.  This is the equivalent of  HHLK's Guide to the Galaxy having the  plans here in a filing cabinet in a dark  cellar with the aware of the leopard written on the front  of it. I agree they should have made it

Start time: 4017.08
End time: 4022.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  easier. But I also understand  why location history does not equal  turning off all location information.

Start time: 4023.02
End time: 4050.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  On one hand, I get where you're coming from. On the other  hand, they literally  put it under  you know,  so if you're on Android,  your Google account, data and personalization,  Web and App Activity, and  it's very easy to turn it off. Then you just  hit the button or the slider and you turn it off.  But Web and App Activity  does not really imply  we are going to keep a very  detailed tracking of the location  of your phone for the entire time you use it.

Start time: 4051.00
End time: 4060.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what Steve Gibson said. He said, of course  you open a map, you know you're going to be sending  location back to Google. That's obvious.  But there's no reason Google should be saving  that. Right. Well, okay, there's a very

Start time: 4061.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  good reason.

Start time: 4063.10
End time: 4085.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Aside from their own business interest.  I understand that, but I  feel like maybe there is a technical reason why  they need to. I mean, they're logging it.  If you're doing search,  Google says, well, if people search for pizza  places, what they mean is pizza places  near me, not just they don't want  Manhasset pizza places or  pizza places in Timbuktu,  they want pizza places here. Great. Then why is it accessible later on?

Start time: 4085.46
End time: 4088.45

Start time: 4089.06
End time: 4095.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's what Steve was saying. Okay, fine. You can get it.  But it should go away. It shouldn't be preserved.  I feel like there's technical reasons

Start time: 4095.38
End time: 4128.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  why they're preserving it. Well, there is.  And it's, okay, let's put aside  any of the theories about, well, it's because they can sell  it. It's because they're trying to make a better app.  If you're using the Google  Maps app, which I do all the time,  it knows where my home is.  It knows where my work is.  When I start typing an address that I've been to before,  it will pop in. And I kind of  expect that. In fact, it would upset me  if I have to type in the address every  single time. I find it a little creepy, but  that's because, you know. But I understand  what's going on in the background. And I think there's a lot of  people who don't actually understand what they're doing  when they're typing that into their phone. So

Start time: 4129.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to Google. There was an article I  tweeted out earlier this week.  Douglas C. Schmidt, professor  computer science at Vanderbilt University,  digitalcontentnext.org slash blog,  Google data collection research.  So, a dormant  I'm going to quote from some  of the key findings. A dormant stationary Android  phone with the Chrome browser active in the background  communicated location information to Google  340 times during  a 24 hour period, or an average of  14 data communications per hour.  In fact, location information constituted  35% of all the data samples sent  to Google. For comparison's sake,  a similar experiment found that an IOS device  with Safari but not Chrome, Google  could not collect any appreciable data unless  a user was interacting with the device. Moreover,  an idle Android phone running the Chrome browser  sends back to Google nearly 50 times  as many data requests per hour as  an idle iOS phone running Safari.  An idle Android device  communicates with Google nearly 10 times more frequently  as an Apple device communicates with Apple servers.  These results highlighted the fact that Android and  Chrome platforms are critical vehicles for Google's  data collection. Again, these experiments  were done on stationary phones with no  user interactions. If you actually use  your phone, the information collection increases

Start time: 4205.06
End time: 4222.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  with Google. But, to point out, these were also not  phones where location history was turned off.  Right. I mean, these were just with standard  defaults. So, nobody had made  any request to Google  not to collect this information. But, I agree  with you. Google clearly wants to know more  about you. And, in fact, why else  is Android out there? They want to know

Start time: 4223.02
End time: 4224.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 4225.55
End time: 4236.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google puts out Android.  But, I mean, okay, quick roundtable thing. I  keep my location turned off unless I  absolutely need it. Really? GPS turned off  unless I absolutely need it. I take it you don't.  I take it you do. Oh, I leave it on all the time.

Start time: 4237.00
End time: 4258.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm back and forth. Mostly I leave it on because I use GPS  constantly. Right. But, yeah,  I... It depends  on how tinfoil-hattie I'm feeling.  It's off security for me. So, a lot  of times when I travel, I can't have it on. If I were  doing what you do, I would probably have it off  all the time. You know, I'm not running into a lot  of situations where I have to worry about people tracking  sources or stuff like that. So, it's not as...  You know... It's just...

Now, by the way,  if you go to myactivity.google.com,  you will see  the detail  that Google gathers in. This is my  activity. And I can even...  I can do it with the clappagus. Yeah. Well, now you know.  These are places I've been  that Google knows because I carry  an Android phone and an iPhone and the iPhone has a location  as well. And I can go to any  particular year.

Transcript:  Well, and the other thing I would say is  even if you didn't find that creepy, there are  things Google can infer  from... For instance,  if you and a person  that you like  end up at a location and stay  there for six hours, Google  might make some inferences from that.  There's a great book  about all of this  written by my friend  Rob, who... Rob Reid,  who...  At the beginning of the scene of the book, it's called...  It was after on, I think it's called?  At the beginning and the scene of the book,  coworkers are all gathering together,  and one of them gets a pop-up for a coupon  for a drink, an adult beverage.  And then another one gets a  pop-up for, you know, since your team  is all together now, you should be  getting slack or whatever.  And of course, all of those inferences can be  made if it's not just me, but it's a  database of information  about a lot of people. All sorts  of things can be inferred.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's true. I mean, basically,  because my experiences with Facebook  execs tend to be that all  about growing the platform  and not about thinking about it so much,  whereas I find with Google people, they  do think a little bit more about what they're doing  and they're aware that they are  legally, I mean, they've just been hit by five  billion in fines in the EU. They're  more aware that, hey, this could cost us some  serious money, whereas Facebook  hasn't been seriously slapped down yet  and they've come out of the Cambridge-Anne list.

A couple of years ago we were on  the Anthem of the Seas, which is basically a floating  apartment building.  Four or five of those stuff. They're all floating apartments.  I have 3,500 passengers.  But, oddly enough, it had better  internet than my house.  They have this thing called VOOM and I think it's a  dedicated satellite per ship.

Start time: 4787.59
End time: 4796.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

The day pass is eight or nine bucks a day.  But it's unlimited for up to five devices.  It's still a pretty good deal compared to what Verizon would charge.  But for 99 bucks you get a month.  So we're going to be going long enough to pay 99 bucks.  Unlimited data for five devices.  Excellent.

Transcript:  Can I put a public service announcement  to any engineers for cruise ships?  Yes.  Okay, so if you are designing a network for a cruise ship  and you have jacks in the room so that the TV  can access the on-demand entertainment center,  a VLAN is not security.  That does not separate me from the internet.  It does not separate me from the system  that gives internet access.  I'm impressed that they've got a VLAN.  How do you cross a VLAN?  So it's...  They didn't tag anything.  So if you know there's a VLAN,  you can actually scan to see which  VLAN tags are coming through the switch.  And you just keep switching VLAN tags  until you find the one that's...

Which when you, you know,  you're trying to get to Defcon, there's a bit of a handicap.  And they've now got this policy  where they're really  cracking down on this stuff. And also  if you have the Do Not Disturb sign  on your door for more than 24 hours,  you're going to get the door open by  security and searched. They did not get me.

So somebody, a friend  of mine was like, well who puts  their Do Not Disturb tag on for more than  24 hours? And I was sitting in a table  and every single hand went up.

That was  one of my less favorite, like, Vegas  stories during CES. I don't think I've ever  talked about that one. So imagine if you're a  125 pound female with two guys pounding  on your door demanding entrance  and you're trying to call the front desk.

Do you know, Karsten?  I should probably check. It's probably on here.  Jason Snell. Snell will be hosting  Tweet next week.  And then the week after,  it looks like some guy,  some British bloke,  Ian Thompson. Becky Worley will be  hosting on the 16th. So that's  going to be a lot of fun.  Lots of shows. It's actually, the shows are better  when I'm not here, let's face it.  I hear that though.  They say people send me, they tweet at me.  Stay home. Stay in the Europe.  You live very big shoes to fill.  Well, they're not that big. I'm only about 8.5.  Doubly. Our show today brought to  you by Wordpress.  That's where I'm going to put my travel photos.  I actually had an epiphany.  I've been posting  on social media, right? I thought, why am I doing  that? You should always start at your  website. And if you're,  I mean, as an individual, your website is what  people, you want people to find when they search your  name. If you don't have that,  people will find other things when they search your name.  You really need to control that.  I tell this to teenagers all the time.  Get a website. When parents have a new baby,  I say reserve their name  .com.  And I did that for my kids, by the way, and I'm really  gratified. Abby set up her Wordpress.com  site. Henry, I'm still working on him.  He says he wants to do it. He says, where can I  post my pictures? Facebook just degrades  the hell out of them. Henry,  Wordpress.com.  If you're a business, man, you got to have  your own website. It's like not having  a answering machine or a, you just  got to have it.  With Wordpress and Wordpress.com,  they do the hosting. They do the  security. They do the software updates. You'd focus  on what you do best. Create content,  talk about your business.  For me, travel photos.  There are no limits.  You're free to create the ultimate online hub  that's truly yours. Yes, you can upload  images and video and audio and  more. You can import and export content  to and from your Wordpress website.  You can email to your Wordpress site.  It's easy. You can also grow  your audience and reach new customers with built-in  SEOs, social media features, marketing  tools. You can do more than just post  with your Wordpress app. You can moderate comments.  You can look at stats.  The apps are fantastic.  And you can launch your site with confidence because  you can get help from Wordpress's amazing  support team 24-7 whenever  you need it. Plans started just $4  a month. You know, when you  add it all up, it's no wonder 31%.  Almost a third of all the  websites in the world  run on Wordpress. 31% of the  internet is Wordpress.  Get 15% off any new plan right now.  Go to wordpress.com  slash twit and create that website. It's fun.  It's easy. If you've been kind of  putting it off, don't. It's really  satisfying. Wordpress.com  slash twit for 15%  off your new website.  Go to wordpress.com slash twit.  I love the web.  I feel like the web, we've got  to preserve the web and preserve  websites.

Transcript:  while I'm gone, I'm sure  Apple will have an event. But when is not clear,  typically they do it on  First or second week in September. Yeah.  The second Tuesday after Labor Day, right?  They don't want to do it the Tuesday after Labor Day.  This year is September 3rd, so not  September 4th. September 11th? Well, they don't want to do  it September 11th, I don't think.  That would be the second Tuesday after Labor Day.  It would be a crashing show. Oh no, sorry.  Actually, in 2012, I looked  at it, they had an event that would have normally  fallen because they like to do it on Tuesdays  on September 11th. They moved it to the next day,  September 12th. So I'm going to say that's  my deduction  is it will be September 12th.  There is some evidence that's the case.  For instance, a German phone company  who said you'll be able to pre-order  the phones  September 14th on Friday  at midnight, which would be  comport with a September 12th announcement.  And another site that said your  phones will be arriving  on the 21st, which is exactly  what you'd expect. Pre-order the Friday  after the event. Phone comes  a week later. So  I think that's a fair guess. We pretty  much know what Apple's going to announce.

Because we've been seeing  all of a sudden all of these tweets  about unboxing.  By the way, yeah, no headphone  jack. It'll come with wired  Pixel Buds with a type C connector.

Start time: 6497.00
End time: 6614.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am not sure where I come down on this.  So good, you can tell me.  So here's the story  which is that firefighters  from the Santa Clara Fire Department  went up to Mendocino, it's about 100 miles  north, it's just north of us, to  fight what has been a horrific  wildfire that will continue until next month.  They won't fully control it until next month.  They were using  Verizon phones to communicate.  Apparently used a lot of data, at which point  Verizon,  by the way, the Santa Clara Fire Department says we paid  Verizon for unlimited data.  But Verizon throttled  them.  Making it difficult for them to  provide an emergency  response to communicate with first responders.  All sorts of stuff.  Freaked out, the Santa Clara Fire Department  contacted Verizon. Verizon said  the only way we could fix this is if you pay twice  as much.  The vehicle that they're in  actually has a  SIM card, Verizon's SIM card  for internet access. Here's the quote.  In the midst of our response to the  Mendocino Complex Fire, county fire discovered  the data connection for OES  5262. That coordinates  all the local government  resources deployed at the fire.  Was being throttled by Verizon.  Data rates had been reduced to one  two hundredth or less  than the previous speeds.  These reduced speeds severely interfered with  the ability to function effectively.  My information technology staff communicated  directly with Verizon via email about the  throttling, requesting it be immediately  lifted for public safety purposes.  Verizon did not immediately restore  full speeds to the device, however.  They confirmed the throttling, but rather than restoring  us to an essential data transfer speed,  they indicated county fire  would have to switch to a new data plan  at more than twice the cost and they would only  remove throttling after we contacted  the billing department and switched  the data plan. This is in the midst of  the worst fire in California history.

Because, you know, people  look at me like, you know, twenty two gigabytes  of data is enough for any human being. And it's  like, I understand what people are saying that.  But there are situations  where there are, you know, pretty  strong reasons for, I guess,  one, I want to say quit calling  unlimited, things unlimited that are  not unlimited. That's job one.

Start time: 6645.59

Start time: 6651.73
End time: 6658.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I mean, that's the problem is it's  now an accepted industry standard.  You have unlimited data unless you get up to this many  gigabytes and we have the option of throttling you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  old FCC, the new FCC has nothing  to say about this. The old, they said, call  the FTC. We don't do that. The new  FCC, the old FCC said, no, no, that's not  unlimited. Courts have said, no, no, that's not  unlimited. Yeah.  In an update, ours published  this. They said hours after our  article was published, Verizon acknowledged it  should not have continued to throttle  the fire department.  This is the quote, regardless of the plan,  emergency responders choose, we have a practice  to remove data speed restrictions  when contacted in emergency  situations. We've done this many times,  including for emergency personnel  responding to these tragic fires. In this situation,  we should have lifted the speed restriction  when our customer reached out to us. This was a  customer support mistake.  Right. We're reviewing the situation  and we'll fix this. Now that we have been

Start time: 6744.09
End time: 6768.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  okay, so this is why  I have mixed feelings about this. You can talk me  off the ledge here. Verizon  says, like all customers, fire departments  chose service plans that are best for  them. The customer purchased  a government contract plan for a high-speed  wireless data allotment at a set monthly  cost. Under this plan, the plan  the fire department bought, users get an unlimited  amount of data, but speeds  are reduced when they exceed their allotment until the next  billing cycle, just like we were talking about with T-Mobile.

Start time: 6769.42
End time: 6784.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, and I understand from a  legal and accounting perspective,  that's a good cover to  hide under. But when you've got the largest  wildfire in the state's history,  when you've got firefighters on the ground who could  die if they don't get the call in time,  then that is not a time to be throttling.

Start time: 6785.38
End time: 6793.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Verizon says their policy is normally  to lift these caps. Verizon also  said it, quote, made a mistake in communicating  with the department about the terms of the plan.

Start time: 6821.24
End time: 6845.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe. Furthermore, had  they still, one of the ways that they repealed  net neutrality was Title II.  They said, you are, the  way we got net neutrality is Tom Wheeler  in the FCC a year ago, said  we'll regulate these telecommunications companies.  But with the repeal of that,  their broadband providers like Verizon are  not regulated like telecommunications.  If they were  Telco, you better believe there would have been recourse.  If the 911 system

Start time: 6847.02
End time: 6862.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  goes out, if you're a Telco, you pay serious fines  on that. Whereas something like this,  they're just like, well, it was a customer  service issue.  We'll fire some in our call center,  but in the meantime, about that data plan,  it's a nice phone system you've got there. Be a shame  if anything happened to it. It sounds like you're doing

I am not allowed, according  to SEC rules, and unlike some,  I adhere to SEC  rules, I am not allowed to be a customer  because I can't do an ad if I'm a customer.  If you start putting away money now for  retirement, the sooner you start,  the more you'll have at the end. I wish  I had started earlier. Betterment  is the way to do it. It's the largest independent  online financial advisor  designed to help customers build wealth,  plan for retirement, achieve their financial  goals. Betterment is a fiduciary.  They make recommendations in your best  interest. They are not incentivized to recommend  certain funds. They don't have their own investment products  to sell. And better yet,  while there is a management fee, it's a  very low management fee, 0.25%,  25 basis points,  and there are no  transaction fees. Once you  pay, that's it. It trades  on your behalf, sometimes even daily,  every minute, sometimes no additional cost,  no transaction fees. You pay  the one low management fee, that's it. These are  tax-efficient investment  strategies. Hidden costs  nowhere to be found at Betterment.  No matter who you are or how much you  invest, you get everything for one low transparent  management fee. You know  exactly, and 25 basis points  is nothing. It's really great.  Betterment gives you constant access to  information and tools that allow you to track progress  towards your goals so you can always feel like a smart,  savvy investor. I love the technology.  I've looked into it. Have you seen the Betterment  ads on the internet?  I think they're on TV too.  So they got this  from Billions, if you watch Billions.  It's awesome.  She's awesome.

That's the same  for priests, right?  Yeah, so basically it's an ordained network.  You can't leave the network?  You can't. So any device that's on the network,  if you disconnect from the network, it's disabled.  And you can't ever join again.  And what's the theory there?  Well, it maintains security of the network.  There's never a device that you can plug in  and start siphoning data off. And if you  have a device on the network and you take it off,  it's disabled. Interesting.

Said, well, when we're going to be on an Android,  we're not going to go through the Google Play Store.  No, you can sideload this.  And we get all the money.  Which many of us pointed out  is potentially a little risky.  You have to turn on sideloading in Android  and so forth. Well, it turned out  the installer they put out for  Fortnite, which was a two-part installer, one of those  things where you download a small thing and then download  the rest, could be reprogrammed by  an app on the phone to instead of downloading  the second part of Fortnite, download  any arbitrary app at all.

Apparently that was designed for  ARM.  Frankly, I have an ARM based  Windows machine. I have that HP and VXL  and it's really hard to use. It's pretty slow.  So limited.

Now if you're not  we were arguing about this on  Yeah because I bought that i9 MacBook Pro  But it's a bunch of that they fixed in firmware  but it's also it's like if you expect  certain things out of your laptop  they are not delivering.
