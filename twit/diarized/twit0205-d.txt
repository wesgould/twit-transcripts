Great to have you back, Pete.  Thank you. Good to be here.  Thanks for being here.  Also here, the man who helped me get elected president of the internet, Jason Heiner of  Tech Republic, the editor in chief.  Hi, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, Leo.  Glad to be here.  I have to tell you, I listen to a lot of podcasts and I always come back to Buzz Out Loud,  Twit and Cranky Geeks.  So being on Twit's kind of like checking something off my bucket list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, if only Pete would do a podcast.  Do you do a podcast, Pete?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's not really.  I mean, you've got that market sewn up, Leo.  Good.  Thank you.  Keep up the good work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I appreciate it.  And also here, first time ever on video, which is really remarkable.  From his-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not the first time I've ever been on video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I got a camera out there glued up to the wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So folks, if you listen to the audio of the show, which most, which is like 99.99% of you do,  you're missing out.  You can watch the video.  We produce it live 6 p.m.  Eastern every Sunday.  We never, we don't release the video.  We just produce it.  We never release it.  And it's kind of a treat to see you see John.  Well, thank you all for being here.  And John, thank you for filling in for me when I was in China.  I really appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that was fun.  And by the way, this, when you go to the commercial this time, you can see when I leave to go base the meat.  We'll know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You'll know.  There'll be no mystery about where John has disappeared to.  Yep.  Yeah, you did a great job with Becky.  You had Natalie Delconte, Becky Worley, a bunch of people in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was Carlos from Mevio who was a producer.  I think he worked at Tech TV for a while.  But yeah, it was actually worked out okay.  Natalie was, I'm glad that people get to watch this on video because for some reason, I mean, she's pretty anyway, but she looked really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She did look good.  She had a good lighting, good camera.  I got everything.  Yeah.  Well, China was amazing.  You told me it would be, and it was, I didn't get to Shanghai, but the boy Beijing blew me away.  It was, did not seem like the place I, you know, I was expecting people in Mao hats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  The first time I went, which was long ago, we were expecting, this was before they even turned over Hong Kong.  I was expecting Mao hats and Mao jackets.  And we went around looking, we actually asked to see if we can get some as souvenirs.  And they said, what are you kidding us?  There's, they haven't sold those things for decades.  They, they're all peasants in the middle of nowhere.  I have all of them.  And then we had to actually scrounge around to get a Mao poster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My son bought a, my son turns out to be an amazing bargainer.  I didn't know this.  He can haggle.  Send him to Iran.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's good with that.  And he went, he, he haggled a Mao shirt, which says something in Chinese.  And I'm, I have no idea.  I'm a little nervous about it, but it's got chairman Mao on the shirt and he was going to wear it as we were leaving the country.  And I said, wait, you know, Henry, maybe you want to change it to something that says Levi's instead of, yeah, really?  An unknown Mao slogan.  We are back from red China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So anyway, we found some guy who got into the library archives and found some of the original old posters and he pulled about five or six of them out.  And we took those.  And, but I was all the time I'm there, I'm thinking, wow, the souvenir opportunities for the little red book and all, cause you know, American tourists are looking for that stuff.  Even though it's, you know, I guess it's offensive to somebody.  I don't think it offends anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to, I went to Mao's mausoleum, you know, I waited in line to see his body and thousands of people.  They get there two hours before it opens.  The line was two hours long from, from getting there an hour ahead of time.  And people are putting chrysanthemums on his grave.  I don't, I think that for a lot of people, even though, you know, if you, if you look at his history, this guy was as bad as Stalin, as bad as Hitler.  I mean, this guy was awful.  I mean, he, he, he was the author of the world's worst famine.  20 million people died during the quote great leap forward.  I mean, this guy was a nutball.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're not going back.  So, yeah, I guess not now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So let's talk about, can I briefly mention congratulations to the Netflix prize winners?  Have you been following this horse race?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did that just change?  I was just following that.  I think that just changed at the last minute, didn't it?  Is that just sort of story go up on Mashable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It just changed.  So what happened?  You know, this is Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that must be annoying.  That must be so annoying.  Oh, these guys.  Wasn't it like a million dollars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  So Netflix wants to make its recommendations better.  You know, when you go to Netflix to run a DVD, it says you might like this movie too.  And there are, you know, these recommendation engines suck.  They've always sucked.  I've never seen one that worked.  But Netflix said we're going to put up a million bucks for any artificial intelligence team or whatever that can figure out a way to make this 10% better.  Now, I don't know how you measure 10% better, but they had some metric and a team called Bell Core's Pragmatic Chaos.  You might recognize Bell Core.  That's the old AT&T Labs name.  And in fact, members of the team were from AT&T's Labs and others got it up to 10.08%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My editor just pinged me and said, winners not announced yet.  There are two scores to calculate.  We don't yet know who's going to win.  So it's kind of down to the last minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought, yeah, Netflix, I thought, announced that they had a winner, but in any event.  So Bell Core was, now the way the rules worked, once you broke 10%, that started the clock ticking.  And then all the other teams had 30 days to beat your result.  And this second place team yesterday came up the ensemble with 0.01% better.  I think Bell Core had 10.07, then they came up with 10.08.  Bell Core, about an hour ago, this is really sneaky, said they held onto it and they put up 10.09%.  The ensemble comes back four minutes before the closing time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, these guys get all their experience from eBay.  It's like sniping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Four minutes before closing time at 18.38.22.  And they put up 10.10% improvement.  I don't know if they have, I don't know if they've, Pete, if they've announced it, but I think I saw that  the Netflix had said that we do have a winner.  But I'm looking at the website now, netflixprize.com, and they haven't said.  So I don't know what the latest is, but isn't that, isn't that amazing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been going for ages as well.  Yeah, years.  Suddenly this, you know, so we kind of assumed that once you hit the 10%, oh, they're going to win that, surely.  I mean, if you've been working on this for how many years, it just seemed like it would be the obvious winner.  And then how come all these two groups should get together and split it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's what happened initially is the, the, the Bellcore was AT&T commando, Yahoo research,  pragmatic theory, a bunch of team member, different competing teams compooled their results to get this result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know who the winner is though?  It's Netflix.  Oh man.  Yeah, I'm going to make way, way more than a million dollars out of this.  You know, think of all the media attention.  Firstly, everyone's been writing about it.  But secondly, just like it would have cost you more than a million bucks to improve your recommendations by 10%.  How much is that worth to them in terms of, you know, bottom line?  It's well worth it.  Oh, it's well worth it.  So I think it's a lesson for other companies.  You know, if you can't be bothered getting developers on something for years, just start a content.  They will. I think the novelty is going to fade, though.  I think you're not, if you do another Netflix prize type thing for another company, it's not going to have the same media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's worked for space exploration with the X prize and Google put money now into the new X prize, which is what,  I can't remember what it is, getting to the moon, right?  They want to do moon exploration.  The interesting thing is you should, any, these guys obviously are master strategicians.  It should have been in hindsight obvious that they would hold off to the last minute.  They would hold better results back and fire away at the last minute, but they blew it because they fired too soon.  This other team, the ensemble came back and said, no, we can beat you by 0.1%.  This is a, I love this story.  I just, I think that's wonderful.  And you're right, big winners Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hopefully it'll be finalized eventually.  Hey, there's one of the stories on your list that I wanted to talk about.  Yes, sir.  Microsoft tweaks ad after Apple complains.  Yeah, you know, we talked about this last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now I would love to get your opinions on this.  So Apple, you know, well, it starts with Microsoft.  It starts with a Microsoft guy saying, oh, Apple's lawyers called me to complain about our ad.  And they said that it wasn't true anymore.  And he said, I never had such a good call in my life.  I was jumping up and down, running down the halls, yelling at everybody because he, you know, big victory for Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What, that Apple was complaining?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That Apple was, oh, so upset about the ad.  But it's my opinion that Microsoft, this guy made this up.  Apple didn't call him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just, that's kind of the opinion.  I think they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I'm pretty sure Apple did call and actually tell them, you know, look, you're, you're, you've got our price wrong for the machine that you're comparing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, first, okay.  Last, this is the story.  Last week at Microsoft's worldwide partner conference in New Orleans, COO Kevin Turner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Said he did quote cartwheels down the hallway after getting a phone call from Apple's legal department complaining about the campaign.  We're just going to, he says, we're just going to keep running them and running them and running them.  First of all, he's at a, he's at a sales conference.  I think it's BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a developer conference.  It's a, it's a partner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Partner.  It's, this is BS.  Apple sends a letter.  They don't make a phone call.  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  No, I'm sure it was a letter, not a phone call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The whole thing's suspect.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, for one thing, it wouldn't be a phone call because you wouldn't know who to call 90% of the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no doubt.  Not at Microsoft.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, let's call Kevin.  He'll know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Sounds like bogus.  It sounds like a bogus story.  What's he cartwheeling for?  Is he 12?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In any event, apparently Redmond has quietly changed, according to advertising age, the ads, because remember the Laptop Hunter ads kept saying that MacBooks were $2,000 or more.  Apple's dropped the price, so they just kind of, they snipped that part out.  Big deal.  I think this is all just publicity for Microsoft.  Even this story is just more pro-Microsoft propaganda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's lousy propaganda because those ads, for one thing, suck.  They're not selling Microsoft.  They're selling laptops.  Microsoft, I hate to bring it to their attention, but they don't even make a laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I do think it hits Apple where it hurts though.  And I do think that that's why Apple has reacted to this.  And the fact that Apple has knows that it hits them where it hurts is that right now people perceive them as a premium brand.  And in this economy, premium brands are taking a little bit of a beating.  And that's how they're pitching them.  And Microsoft should have been doing this.  I agree.  The ads are actually lousy, but they are.  The strategy is right.  The execution is wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm as far as premium brand is concerned, I can't imagine anybody being more cost conscious than my son.  Who I wrote a column about, I guess, in PC Magazine saying my son bought a Macintosh because he bought one of the Macbook Pros, the unibody one.  13 inch?  Yeah, I think so.  Sweet.  I like that.  Yeah, it's a nice little thing.  It's got a little SD card thing in it and the whole thing.  It's got little buttons that show you the battery.  It's got a lot of interesting features.  I actually like the machine and it's light.  And, you know, he could have bought something cheaper.  But, you know, the thing is he got the thing for like just a little over a thousand dollars.  And I was thinking I'd buy this myself.  It seems like a good...  Maybe if Apple's got a complaint is that they're not as premium as you might think they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know if you want to go any cheaper, to be honest with you.  According to NDP, the analysts at NDP, Apple's got 90 percent of the quote, premium laptop market.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep. Yep.  But you could have got some...  I mean, your son could have gotten something a lot cheaper, John.  I mean, he could have gotten probably for what you get in that machine.  You could have got a five or six hundred dollar machine.  But it would have been crap.  But it would have been crap, right?  And Apple, what Apple's done well is say, look, it's not just about price.  They don't say spend a little bit more.  But that's what they're saying.  You spend a little bit more with us, but you know you're going to get good support, decent support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's why this story is really bad news for PCs.  First of all, when we're going to get to it, the results for PC makers and Microsoft were horrendous this quarter.  Yeah.  But nine out of NDP for the month of June, slightly more than nine out of every ten dollars spent on.  Now, we say premium, any computer over a thousand dollars, Apple got 90 percent of the buy.  That means whatever PCs are selling are these kind of low end, sub thousand dollar PCs.  Low margin, too, I might add.  And probably most of them are netbooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep. That's where all the money is.  The ones that Apple's selling.  When I saw that, I mean, I'm still a little skeptical of that report, to be honest, but I think it's probably the numbers are close.  But that's where all the money is.  I mean, I was kind of shocked when I saw that.  It shows that Apple is just stealing the best part of the market from all of these PC makers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Average sale price of a Windows laptop, if you exclude netbooks, 569 bucks.  Average sale price of a Mac laptop, 1400 bucks.  Geez.  I mean, this is much better news for Apple than it is for PCs.  And it's why probably Cupertino doesn't even care about market share.  Who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No. Yeah, exactly.  They care about margin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've always been a margin oriented company.  Always. They've never...market share is just an embarrassment to them, but it's not what they're all about.  They've always been big on margins.  I mean, Microsoft's kind of the same way.  They don't sell any hardware, but they're huge on margin because they're just selling a 25 cent disc that they stamp out and mass produce.  It's all margin.  Two, three hundred dollars.  I mean, it's like, holy crap, talk about margin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'd rather be in that business, to be honest with you.  For the first time ever.  Microsoft reported its first year over year decline in sales in company history.  Now, they still made money.  Fifty eight point four billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, those poor bastards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you're the one, and we're going to get to this, who wrote the article in MarketWatch saying it's all over for Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. I heard you earlier because I was listening in while you're trying to communicate with me about how I've been saying it's all the more excessive.  You've been saying it for years.  Back in 1903.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, I won't say that.  But I think for, in fact, for a while.  No, I think it's been at least four years you've been you've been proclaiming the death of Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they haven't focused for 10, so four is...  I think that's reasonable.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they lost Mojo ever since the DOJ went after him.  I mean, Microsoft has been on defense and they've been playing zone defense.  It's not like they're playing aggressive man to man.  They're playing zone defense.  So, you know, I like sports analogies.  Yeah, they're playing.  No, worse than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's take a move with the football.  They're they're playing prevent defense.  Exactly. Exactly.  That prevents you from winning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep.  Now, but I do think they're doing they are getting there.  Now, but I do think they're doing they are getting a little aggressive.  I mean, I wrote something last week saying that, you know, has Microsoft switched from  defense to offense?  I mean, with Bing, which they've wasted a zillion dollars on and the Microsoft stores,  you know, all of these things, at least the push forward.  I think they're pushing forward on the wrong stuff.  They've taken their eye off their their core market, which is similar to what John is saying.  But at least they're acting a little aggressive again and just not sitting back and  letting people come apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I personally don't see that them being any more aggressive than they were with the pen  computer that Bill Gates is going to take over the world by, you know, twenty two or  two thousand three, where they were any more aggressive than they did.  Everyone saw they get a kind of they get a bug up them.  And it's all of a sudden they've got to, you know, they they get all jazzed about  something like Bing and they get all worked up and then they let it slide and they go  on to something new. I mean, my column was about not so much about Microsoft fall, you  know, ending at the end of the rain.  It's mostly about the fact that they they're letting the cash cows languish and they keep  jumping from one thing to another. Yeah, Bing is really hot for them right now.  And then they're going to look at the numbers at some point.  It's going to be the same numbers they've always had from search.  And then they're going to do a deal with Yahoo and they're going to be buzzed about  that. And then that'll languish. I mean, it's just one.  I mean, I just it's the same. That's why I keep predicting the demise, because it's  the same story. I've seen it forever and I don't see it changing.  And at some point, when the numbers start to turn like they just did, it could be the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  beginning of the end. Yeah, they're wasting a lot of money.  I mean, they're wasting money and effort and focus.  I mean, they have not focused on their core businesses, Windows and Office and servers.  Actually, the big winner in Microsoft's lack of focus is Oracle, because they're going  in and they're running roughshod over the whole business software market where Microsoft  actually has some decent products and could undercut Oracle and make a lot of money with  products like SQL Server and Windows Server and all of this kind of thing.  And Oracle is just going and running roughshod over that whole market and making a zillion  dollars. And Microsoft is out there messing around with search engines and antivirus  software and all this kind of stuff.  And I agree 100 percent with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's actually the thing I left out of that article.  Now that you mention it is that element, the fact that they could actually take Oracle  on head to head. But, you know, again, it's you know, there's just they kind of got into  the database business on an offhanded way.  They bought FoxPro. They, you know, they saw this other people making money in it.  So they got interested and then everything folded.  And so they kind of lost interest.  And, you know, meanwhile, you're right, they could probably because they do have a good  product they could easily take on Oracle if they if they had a mind to.  They don't they don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Pete, you were going to say something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I don't have any insights into Oracle versus Microsoft.  I was going to say, you know, I remember.  I remembered a on the consumer side, at least I remember to survey from back in May.  And, you know, John saying that maybe those ads are kind of useless.  If you look at the stats that came out, there's a report by a company called BrandIndex  that was Microsoft versus Apple consumer value perception ages 18 to 34.  Essentially, you know, which do you think is a value brand?  And you look at when they started that campaign, there's an article on on Wired  called Survey Microsoft's Laptop Hunter Ads are hurting Apple.  And it's pretty clear that the value perception school for Microsoft went way,  way up and the value perception school for Apple went way, way down.  In other words, you know, young people look at these two brands and say,  oh, I've seen those ads and I kind of think that I'm getting more value from,  you know, a PC than a Mac.  I think, you know, if you look if you look at those ads,  John Hodgman's way more sympathetic in the Mac ads than in the than the Mac guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So but nobody would contest ever in history that the that  the value proposition is better for Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, well, people who have Macs think the value.  I mean, why else would you buy a Mac?  You think you're getting more value for getting a quality value.  But quality is value.  I mean, if it's a high quality product, then I bet if you asked, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See, I think that's a different question.  If you ask people, what's the better value proposition?  Windows, what's the better quality?  What are they going to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mac, well, of course, they're going to say Mac.  Definitely. I think that's the same question.  I think Macs are better value.  But I think the perceptions change.  Yeah, that's a British.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The British are more likely to think of good quality because it lasts longer  and has a than Americans.  Americans are into disposable more than the English.  And so your your commentary there actually matches your culture  because, you know, no, seriously, people buy like an eight hundred dollar  pair of shoes in England because they know they're going to last 15 years.  And we won't do that. We buy plastic shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We invented McDonald's. We buy dorks on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think I don't think you do buy Crocs anymore, do you?  I think you buy the clones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I was surprised, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, who's buying Crocs? Chinese.  There's a there was a Crocs store in China. Wow.  Interesting. All Crocs in one store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's such a fad, isn't it?  I don't see the long term in that at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How did we get to Crocs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Crocs just killed it.  I was in a British.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was in a British.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but I think that you're well, I mean, we're the land that invented  the the the the Big Mac.  I mean, I think you're right.  We're the disposable society.  However, Apple does better in the US than it does in any other country  in the world, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, like that's that's that's the marketing issue of channels. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, that was on the consumer side on the PC versus home  act debate, which is never ending.  But I don't know anything about the Oracle debate.  I think on the Web site, which is where I have kind of knowledge, I think,  you know, things are good products, good search engine.  People, you know, I think has beaten expectations.  So if you look at how dominant Google is in that space,  no one would have imagined that Microsoft could have a play.  The tech industry said, you know, that's actually quite good.  It's OK. It's a it's a contender.  It's not going to beat Google.  But, you know, they've made more headway than you might expect.  We'll have to see what happens when the kind of the initial spike  was off from that huge ad campaign they've waged.  But on the Web in general,  no, they're losing that battle.  They're going to continue losing that battle.  And seeing as the Web is the entire operating system battle going forward,  they've I agree with John overall that long term, they're kind of done.  They're they're coasting on prior revenues.  They don't really have a direction on the Web.  They don't dominate that space.  It's pretty obvious that Google's going to dominate that space.  With the Chrome OS, you think?  I was thinking a bit more holistically than that.  I, you know, that's TBD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, the thing at Microsoft, the problem Microsoft has is they want to be on all.  I think John said it best in his Market Watch article.  It's like they go after these shiny objects and they get,  you know, caught up in that.  And Bing is the one right now.  The only thing Bing has done for them is it's kind of be a bee in the bonnet at Google.  Google's, you know, they've taken some of the buzz around search engines  and they've taken that.  But, you know, a four or five billion dollar be in the bonnet of Google's.  I don't know. Not sure if that's a really good value investment.  But if Microsoft would just step back and try to say, look,  we're going to be more of a background player, we're going to provide the software  that people want, we're going to be a great software company.  They could still be a great player for for decades.  And but they're not doing that.  They want to be the the coolest kid on the block.  They want to be the the one who, you know, has all of the shiny stuff  and the one that gets all of the attention.  And it's like at some point they're going to lose if they don't just say,  you know, we don't care about getting all the attention.  We want to, you know, create, create great products and make money  because we're a public company.  If they do that, they still have a shot.  It's not over for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  John, do you have a set of speakers open?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry.  It's really echoing back in here.  Now, can you hear it fine?  Much better. Good.  Sorry. Yeah.  You don't have to turn down your speakers phenomenon.  You know, I got to fix the studio up  because the speakers are unfortunately not the best thing would be to wear

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  headphones because there's always going to be a little echo coming back at us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't mind wearing headphones, except that, you know, wearing them  in over an hour show, it just bugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know it gets sweaty. I know.  I'm wearing them, too. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I'll put some on next time. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you want to take a break, you may.  We're going to come back and talk more about Microsoft.  We're going to talk more about shoes, of all things.  And and Google privacy.  There's a lot to talk about. AT&T, the iPhone.  But first, I want to talk about audible dot com audible, of course,  our great sponsors, the folks who do those audio books that I am so hooked on.  You can get a special deal right now.  The audible platinum deal gives you two free books  when you sign up at audible dot com slash twit to.  That's the platinum two books.  When you sign up for the platinum plan, audible, of course, is  kind of the ultimate in online bookstores.  Even the contents digital.  And it's not no, it's not like a Kindle.  It's it's audio content.  That's what I love about audible.  I listen to audio books all the time in the gym,  on the plane when I was traveling, it was just a lifesaver.  And I want to encourage you to give it a try.  A U D I B L E dot com slash twit to.  That's the place to sign up for the platinum account and get your first  two books free.  I'm just looking through my audible collection here to see if I can find  a good book for for you.  Nelson Mandela's favorite African folk tales.  That's for John. You know, you love that.  The panic. He's still there.  The panic of how about this one?  The panic of 1907.  Lessons learned from the market markets.  Perfect storm.  Did you know that there was a you knew you know that, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm back. Yeah.  1907. Yeah.  It's a whopper. 1907 actually matched perfectly.  Going by my 80 year cycle.  It's an interesting year because 80 years later, of course, we had 1987,  which was exactly the same.  It was a foot. And this happened, by the way, 80 years earlier.  You had a market collapse that there was no real explanation for at the time.  But it was always, you know, these collapses always reverse engineered.  They keep looking at them.  Oh, maybe it was because of this monetary policy.  And they would go on and on.  But the panic in 1907 is an absolute classic.  And it's beautiful because it's right on the money.  People don't know.  Everybody knows about 1929.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nobody knows about 1907.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, 19. No, that's that's a that's a big one.  In fact, and you can expect the same thing to happen in  say, in a 60, 20, 80 years from 1987.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, none of us will be here to prove you right or wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can put this in a time capsule, ladies and gentlemen, just sell around June.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you go, it's well, well, well, well, well, was this year  an 80 year cycle from something 1929, 19, 2009?  I guess it was. Yeah. And take a look.  Why eight years, though?  That makes that seems very mechanistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I know. No, no. It's not, though.  Well, I mean, if just another reminder, I got to finish my little tome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So please finish your tome.  But meanwhile, until then, the panic of 1907  lessons learned from the market's perfect storm, Robert Bruner, Sean Carr.  What are you laughing at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lessons learned is what I get a kick out like we learned anything.  Nobody's learned anything ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's a good book to listen to anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, I've got a pick. Yeah, sure.  It's it's actually not, you know, Ottawa has more than just books.  They've got some some other stuff, too.  They've got one.  I don't know. I'll hold it up to the camera if you can see it.  It's a day. Now it's to it's called Day.  It's called The Course of Human Events by David McCullough.  It's actually a lecture. I love David McCullough.  I do, too. Just fantastic author.  And this is about the founding fathers.  It's about 40 minutes long.  And his point is great in this.  It's like, look, these guys, it wasn't just that, you know,  they were these sort of gods that knew everything and had it all together.  You know, they argued with each other.  They couldn't figure out a lot of this stuff.  And, you know, they were they were really just trying to figure it all out.  But also some of their imperfections balanced each other out.  And and then, you know, in unity, they they came up with some great stuff.  So anyway, it's a great lecture by McCullough.  It's in it's in takes place in D.C.  It's to have some really great stuff in it anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're absolutely right.  I mean, that's it's more than just books, lectures,  comedy performances, radio shows, even podcasts.  But this, you know, they have a lot of McCullough stuff.  The Johnstown Flood, which I haven't read.  John Adams, which I did, which is incredible.  And on some of the best of them, he narrates him because he has the best voice ever.  You know, I just did you just say I haven't read.  Yeah. Johnstown Flood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't read the Johnstown Flood.  No, but you haven't. But you listen to these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, you're not going to be one of those pedants who says you're not reading, are you?  No, I'm just saying I'm reading them by listening them in my  pouring them in my ear.  It's it's every it's the same.  It's it's it. Look, it's the same thing.  It's the words on the page.  But somebody's reading out loud, isn't that having read a book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't believe so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I listen to it. All right.  Well, I haven't listened to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll tell you why, because writers, in fact, our writer is up there.  We'll have to agree with this.  Is that when you when you read something out loud or reading to yourself,  that you get a different impression?  You do. That's right.  Far better impression.  You you absorb it.  I'm not going to say it's better or worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, when I read your column, John, I hear your voice.  And I think any good writer, I think you should see a doctor.  Any good writer, you hear that I'm standing behind you.  I hear John.  Well, I've I've known you for so long.  But I mean, I think that that's true.  If you knew.  I think when I read David McCullough, I hear his cadence, his rhythm.  Yeah, he's got a good voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just call it voice in writing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Anyway. Yeah, it's voice.  In fact, I was always told that when I write, I should read it out loud before  I fit in before I'm done.  That's one of the final things you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's for editing purposes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do that, too. I do that.  It's kind of old school, but I had a real old school journalism teacher.  And so and so I do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And if it's well written, it will scan.  It will read well as well.  Yeah, I think.  Well, anyway, this is a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I usually read it to my cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And if the cat doesn't get up and leave, it's a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you read it to your plants?  You know, that's supposed to help plants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good one. Yeah.  There's a joke in there. I'm not going to use it, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There are two books that we recommend you get to.  That's nice. Audible dot com slash twit to get the course of human events.  David McCullough's great speech about the founding fathers.  And you can also get 1907 lessons  from the great crash that nobody remembers.  But, you know, that's just two of sixty thousand titles.  Audible dot com slash twit to we thank them so much for their support.  And they owe me now about a thousand dollars for that extra long commercial

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they just got. They're on Twitter as well.  And they are audible audible underscore com.  Yeah, that's awesome.  And I also just find this is a UK version of you're in the UK.  Audible UK is their Twitter handle here.  I don't think your codes work in the UK, but sometimes they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sometimes they don't.  But they don't pay us.  You know, I will try. I'll get back to you on that one.  This is a really classic issue in general, which is that advertising  agencies are at best national.  So they have a budget and they don't care.  Right. The fact that 30 percent of our audience is outside the U.S.  they don't pay us for that 30 percent.  They don't care. And it's just drives me crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the next stage. They've got to figure that out.  And some of the smart ones will and they'll leapfrog their competitors when they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think they know.  And they just say, hey, we're going to save 30 percent.  But, you know, some of our sponsors are paying for the full international  audience, almost all of them, except audible has been with us so long that  we let them get away with murder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Listen to Jason's voice and tell me who you think he sounds like.  Jason Calacanis? No, Jason Heiner.  Oh, Jason, talk to me a little bit here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do you mean, as we go, as we go, he sounds like somebody we know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. But I have not been able to nail it.  All right. Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm usually pretty good about that.  I know that Pete sounds like Sean Connery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do I? I'm told that I don't really have a Scottish.  It comes and goes. It's like a line.  So I'm a bit more Scottish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a little Scots there.  There's a little Scots. I like it.  I like it.  So Amazon, as long as we're talking results, Amazon also  reporting bad results, in fact, weaker than expected earnings.  That's always bad. You don't want to disappoint the market.  It's OK to have bad earnings as long as they thought you were going to have bad  earnings. A steep decline in its flagship business of selling media products,  books, music and DVDs.  Net profit down 10 percent.  You know, when you you mentioned what was it Microsoft made in the year?  Fifty four billion or whatever.  Amazon in its quarter only made one hundred forty two million dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Chicken feed. Yeah, nothing compared to what Microsoft's made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they had to have warehouses.  Second quarter,  revenue up 14 percent.  It's a more normal business. That's right.  Yeah. Analysts thought earnings would be 32 cents a share.  Well, they were 32 cents a share.  Part of it was the legal settlement to Toys R Us.  Now, Amazon spent some money this week.  They bought Zappos.  I found that peculiar.  Because Amazon sells shoes already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And Zappos was the one company I thought that could really push Amazon online.  I mean, Zappos has got great customer service.  They really know what they're doing online.  One of the few great e-commerce retailers out there.  And I was like, this is the company that's going to kind of come up and nip Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's why they bought them.  Isn't that the I think that's the point.  I think it's take out its competitor.  I mean, what if what if Zappos suddenly said, hey, we're we're doing shoes really well,  because they're not really a shoe company.  They're a marketing and, you know, customer service company.  So if they suddenly say, hey, you know, there's all these verticals that Amazon have got.  Let's start doing books and music.  And they'd have a real chance there.  So I think it's removing the biggest threat online to Amazon's business.  And why does Zappos sell, you think?  Well, apparently this, you know, I don't want to weigh in too much, but apparently the CEO wasn't  perhaps on board and the investors were kind of pushing for it.  Tony Hsieh didn't want to do it.  Yeah, but he's he's he's not talking.  So who knows? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He I think he's part of the secret to the success of Zappos.  Who where did they have a unique corporate culture?  I mean, it really is customer focused.  It is very I mean, you go to the Zappos offices.  It's very different from anywhere else.  Very Web 2.0.  And I think his Twitter presence had a lot to do with the success of Zappos.  So he's a very important part of the whole picture.  I don't know if you could duplicate the culture in a bigger company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, how much are they?  Well, they've done very well culturally.  I you know, their revenues are so significant that I I would be hard pressed  to put it all on Twitter. I think that's kind of our perception because we see them  through the through the kind of the lens of Twitter.  I think it's far more significant online presence than just Twitter.  Well, they do a lot of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, the fact that they that, you know, I when I buy shoes from them  every once in a while, they say, hey, we thought we'd FedEx your package for free.  You know, just surprise you.  They do a lot of little stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  ZDN actually just did a special report on Zappos and their social marketing strategy.  And I think they said that they spent like three hundred grand  a year on on the social media stuff.  They never Tony said they never tried to put ROI on that.  They just felt like it was part of being out there, being connected with customers.  And they just took that as part of doing business and being,  like you said, Leo Web 2.0 company.  But, you know, they were making so according to their revenue,  the revenues, I think, like one billion, if I remember right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, they turned themselves into a one billion dollar company, like almost overnight,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  almost overnight. So so it's pretty impressive.  But they weren't spending a whole lot of money or putting a ton of energy, you know, Tony,  even in this in this report, which is great.  I'd recommend everybody read it if you're interested in Zappos.  And they're a fascinating company.  You know, they they said that, you know, like I said, no ROI.  And they were just trying to get their name out there.  And still, he said the best social networking is with phone and email.  He said Twitter, Facebook, none of them compare to phone and email,  which I thought was was pretty wild for him to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And also, they're a very established company.  And Twitter's only really grown significantly in the last kind of six months.  So I was supposed to be the social media guy.  I wouldn't put too much of that emphasis on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think. Well, I admit to being I admit to being completely myopic because, of course,  that's how I found out about Zappos that, you know, my engagement with Tony Shea on  Twitter is what kind of made me like Zappos.  And, you know, OK, you're right.  I mean, that was maybe how many people did he reach?  Thirty thousand or something.  And not enough to make a billion dollar company for sure.  However, I have to think it's had some significance.  And now, do you think, Pete, going forward, now that Twitter is much bigger,  it could conceivably be a tool that companies could use to to to gain that kind of market share?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, eight hundred million dollars. Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what did Dell did?  Did Dell not come out with a report recently that said they'd done about three million  in revenue from their Dell outlet?  Their Dell outlet? Yeah, we don't have that many numbers.  I mean, it's single digit millions for Dell. Yeah.  Not billions. I think going forward, Twitter is growing like crazy.  And there's a lot of those accounts have,  you know, critical mass in the sense that, you know, everyone knows them,  everyone on Twitter is marketing for them.  I think I don't think it will be that big, but I think it's going to become more  significant as an outlet. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the key to Twitter, I think, is reaching influencers like you, Leo.  I mean, Zappos, you know, Tony getting connected with you,  connected him then with a lot more audience. Right.  So influencers are key to Twitter, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think you're right.  By the way, I got Jason's voice. I finally figured it out. Who is it?  Well, you probably don't know him, but I think anyone who's listening to the show  who watches a lot of sports will pick it up and then they'll be amused  because it's so good that I think we could actually use him to punk somebody.  He's a dead.  He's got the dead ringer voice for Max Kellerman, who used to be on ESPN.  Now he's on HBO Boxing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you know, do you know Max Jason? Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's hilarious.  I've never gotten that before, but that's very cool.  I'm a big sports fan, so I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to have to find Max Kellerman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You hear it, you're going to go, oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've always wanted to do a tweet where everybody sounds exactly the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was either a family guy or a Simpsons episode where they had all these guys  who sat around the table, sounding exactly the same.  It was very confusing, very confusing in audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, totally.  So here's a story that just will not die.  Yahoo's board of directors, according to the Wall Street Journal,  met Thursday to discuss an ad sales deal with Microsoft search ads.  Industry analysts expect the deal is close.  I love this. You know how you know a deal is close  because Carol Bartz is saying, I just love that Bing.  Yeah, that's a pretty good sign.  That's the giveaway.  She says, quote, Carol Bartz, the CEO of Yahoo was brought in to save the company.  Quote, I think actually Bing is a good product.  I don't know how you say this with a straight face.  It actually extends sort of the experimentation around search  and how people use it instead of just thinking like a standard blue link.  She said, I think they've done it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She said, by the way, she's saying this, Leo, as she's doing a calculation  on her stock. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think they've done a good job.  I think Microsoft should be given kudos for Bing.  I think they've done a nice job.  It's pretty strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like Larry Ellison saying complementary things about Balmer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No kidding. That Balmer, he's a good looking guy.  Wow. Go ahead.  No, Jason. Go ahead, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was just saying, my colleague, Larry Dingan, wrote an article about this  too, about the whole he was on the call where Bartz was very complimentary  and he's like, what's up with this?  Because she doesn't. That's just not her take usually.  And so, yeah, it's it's got to be there's got to be something going on there.  But still, it's one of those stories, like you said, that just won't die.  I mean, I remember talking about this and a lot of people felt like  it was never going to happen anyway.  And now maybe the business, them buying the search business  makes more sense than them buying all of Yahoo.  I mean, it's still a massive distraction for Microsoft.  But I don't know what is it, Calacanis? Why would they want it?  I know. Yeah, it's a dying.  Why would you want to buy something that's dying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Although, although, well, Microsoft's profits down 29 percent.  Yahoo actually, this is weird.  I guess it's because it was so low to begin with that their profit was up 8 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, their profits were up, but their sales were down.  I mean, this is the let's fire everybody.  We make the profits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I got it. So they got the bottom line up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Got it. Well, Yahoo still has good businesses.  It's not that Yahoo doesn't have some good business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love Yahoo. I use Flickr. I use Delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, boy, they're raking in the dough from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know they've got a problem.  OK, they've got some good properties.  They just haven't figured out what the hell to do with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they're making they're making good money off, you know, these  these broad mass market CPMs, you know,  because they do so much broad traffic and they're they're making.  Yeah. Buzz, you know, all of these things, the meat and potatoes of the Internet  is some of what Yahoo does, and they make money, you know,  decent CPM money off of that. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of our chatters, Kishkaman says Yahoo, and I don't know if this is true.  See if you can you confirm this.  Yahoo has a patent that Google is using and Microsoft wants the patent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. You know, I wrote about this actually about this when  they when this thing first developed.  Somebody sent me a note about this patent and I wrote it up.  And this was like early on in the negotiations.  You know, they were first talking about this rumor.  And I can't remember the pat.  There is a really important patent.  It's something that Yahoo seems to just they bought some other company  and that patent came with it.  This is kind of vaguely remember the story.  The patent came with it and they've kind of kept it on the shelf,  but it's needed. I think something Google's doing in particular,  I think it has something to do with AdSense or the way you present ads  by by doing the keyword search.  That's that's what it's all about.  And so they both everybody needs this patent.  And I think Microsoft would love to get a hold of it because the way I understood  it when I wrote this was they could put the screws to Google.  I'd love to read more about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's interesting. That's a very interesting story.  I can dig that column up and post it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I'd be very curious about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When we come back. Yes.  Oh, we're going to add. We're going to add.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't interrupt the ad. No, no.  I want to speak about MySpace when we when we move on.  MySpace, they have a whole new thing they want to try.  I also want to talk about the Palm pre it's on between Apple and Palm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Back and forth. Fascinating story there.  And some complaints to the USB folks over all of this.  But before we do that, I'm going to mention the folks at Squarespace.com.  Squarespace is more than just a blogging tool.  Squarespace is your future on the Web.  In fact, lately, we've been thinking more and more about moving everything to Squarespace.  Squarespace.com slash Twitter.  Take a look at it.  It's it's, you know, it first, you might say, well, this is like a,  you know, a blogging tool and you could certainly use it for that.  In fact, if you are a blogger, you're going to like the fact that you could try  Squarespace for free, no credit card necessary.  And it imports from all the major blogging tools.  So it's a very easy way to try Squarespace.  It'll import all your blog comments, all your blog posts, removable type,  WordPress, type pad blogger and export.  So you're not going to have to do all that.  Type pad blogger and export.  So you're not you're never stuck.  But it has all sorts of additional tools that make it really useful for any kind  of website, including form building, data collection, incredible statistics,  photo galleries, complete integration with all social media without third party scripts.  You know, Disqus, I use Disqus for my comments.  And that was the first thing I said.  There's a Squarespace iPhone app.  I said, do you use do you support Disqus?  No problem. Just a little JavaScript.  Snip it. Try it for free.  I think you'll like it.  Ten percent off if you use the coupon code TWIT and if you decide to buy,  but you don't need a credit card, you just need to go to Squarespace.com  slash twit and you can try it out for a few weeks and see what you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Squarespace is actually a really awesome platform.  I've been checking it out.  And, you know, this is where blogs are going in terms of, you know,  it's not quite this defined thing where it's just like, hey,  I'm going to write some text.  It's pulling all the social media stuff.  It's the one that discuss comments.  So you want to bring in all the comments from everywhere else.  You know, I think in calling it a blog platform might be kind of limiting its scope.  It's kind of more like a it's more like kind of a basis for starting your whole presence online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So every time one of our every time one of our servers goes down,  which it did at the beginning of the radio show today, that's kind of why the server goes down  at the during the radio show, not, you know, just.  But I think, in fact, Bear, our assistant man said,  why don't we move into Squarespace?  The virtualization technology they use, they put more bandwidth online.  You're you're not on any one machine.  It's it's it's it's cloud hosting.  It's very interesting what they're doing.  These guys are brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the future of apps, by the way.  I think so.  Virtualization and the failover and all of this kind of stuff.  Everybody is putting big money into this right now in Squarespace.  I don't know how they did it.  Just a bunch of smart guys really trying to get this together.  But they actually leapfrog a lot of really big companies  who've been trying to do exactly what they figured out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting. Well, I don't know if you guys remember when everyone started blogging,  we had to, you know, install a server and then you get dog or something  and your site will go down. It was a pain.  You don't want to deal with all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the I have the patent number here, John.  Anyway, Squarespace dot com slash twit.  And somebody in our  chat room has put up a Valley Wag article.  I always go to Valley Wag for the most trenchant.  Yeah, yeah, that's that's where I go for my facts.  Patent comment.  And especially enjoy the tinfoil hat.  I don't know what's going on here.  But but but apparently there is a funny looking article.  Apparently there is a there is a patent.  Yeah. And the number is six million two hundred sixty nine thousand three hundred sixty one.  Thank you, Web six three seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It can do a big product product call out.  Yes. Because the reason I didn't get up to Sonoma  was because I went to a camera swap meet in Hayward.  How fun. Yeah.  My daughter thinks I'm a complete nerd.  So so I the reason was because I was looking for this lens, which I got,  which this is one of the new this is the new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you love your EP one? You love that camera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I find it's a great travel camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm really interested. It's a little pricey.  It's a three quarters frame. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know it's four thirds. I mean, four thirds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Four thirds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't have a mirror in it.  So that allows them to have a little more room.  And so they have these adapters.  This is what's cool about that.  I think this is the adapter for the thing.  It's a so you could put a Leica lens on it or anything on it.  This lets me use an OEM one lens.  Oh, I loved that.  So I tracked down this guy here, which at the swap meet  this very small 50 millimeter OEM one basic how fast focus less.  But this is the one that says made in Japan.  The outside is extremely famous lens. Yeah.  So I got it for 20 bucks. Whoa. Wow.  So so I put it on here and I took some sample photos and holy crap.  I mean, this now you're making me want this camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is not an ad, folks. This is just no, I'm just as a product review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then the review is the camera, you know, to you.  Camera is a great little camera.  But the product review is for this cheap lens that you can buy a camera swap meets

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  because nobody wants a film camera.  The OEM one was, I think, one of the best film cameras ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a great camera.  It's a tremendous lens.  So this little lens, by the way, so what you do with a camera like this is  you set it to aperture only and then you set whatever you want  for your aperture on the lens.  You do have to auto. You have to focus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to say, because it's a manual lens, you can't.  It doesn't do all the electronic stuff. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it's a lot of it.  It was an autofocus lens on those old cameras, not on this.  So essentially, when you put it on a for aperture,  then you just set your aperture to what you want, typically eight.  And then you can just focus it and shoot.  And this is in the camera itself will adjust the shutter speed.  So you get the exact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I might have to get this camera because my wife is one of those people  who's a film buff has an old has an old Olympus that she loves  and would be, I think, very interested in moving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, because with this camera, you can put all those old lenses. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This guarantees my wife will actually watch the show.  My wife is a photographer.  So now I can tell her, look, Devorak talks about this really funny thing.  So you got to listen to to tweet this up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're going to do a Derek story.  Who's a photographer, was on the the geek cruise with me.  Also has a EP one and is going to we're going to do a whole show on it  because it's really a neat camera.  I mean, they're not cheap, though, right?  They're like 800 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think if you shop around, you get for the high sixes.  That's not too bad.  No, it's not cheap, but it's a really well.  It's not a it's not a cheap camera.  There's really it's actually it's all metal and it's it's a rugged camera.  I dropped it on a cement floor already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a loner, though, right?  Is it yours or is it a loner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's I'm borrowing it for the moment.  So who cares? Drop it all you want.  Well, I didn't do anything.  There's like there's like a small nick. It was astonishing. Wow.  Any other camera have been shattered. Yeah.  It's kind of like the Mac Book Pro with the unibody.  I'm angling, angling for one.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Will my space become my video game space for my space?  You know, I just got talking to products.  I just Clarion sent me their new GPS, which is has built in Wi-Fi.  And the idea is that this thing is going to be kind of a GPS  and a little computer's got an atom processor in it.  And but the sad thing is they must have designed it a few years ago  because, yeah, it's got Wi-Fi so you can get weather and other stuff.  And it it you can get on my space with it.  Yeah. I thought, who? Wow.  What's the market for that?  God. So I'm thinking this stuff.  Well, they must have designed it like, you know, there's a cycle.  I probably designed it a few years ago when that would have been a good.  Yeah. That would have been a good thing.  No, I thought, oh, maybe it has Twitter.  No, Facebook.  No, friend feeding my space.  Anyway, my space integration.  What is happening to my space?  Are they going to survive, Pete?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And my space is in a really difficult situation strategically.  You know, one of the problems with these social networks is that you  you know, we saw the same thing with Friendster,  where it suddenly becomes uncool for whatever reason.  There's a better option, you know, and by the same way that,  you know, you go where all your friends are, all your friends move.  This is Exodus, which has happened from my space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I don't understand, frankly, Pete, why this didn't happen years ago.  That's the most ugly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There wasn't really an amazing alternative.  I mean, Facebook's come a long way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess not. But it was my space is discussed every time I look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just my space made LiveJournal look good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. It made GeoCities look good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Plus, it's just there's so much crap on there.  And, you know, my son uses it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My 15 year old uses it.  And I don't know why, but I guess it's because, as you said,  his friends are there.  Maybe he likes to collect animated gifs. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's definitely a demographic.  You know, it's the same myopia that you were saying on that we have,  or at least we have this different lens that we know that Facebook is very much  kind of college kids, people like us, people in tech.  And, you know, maybe we have a slightly different perspective on it  because we know that the demographics are using my space, a kind of more  minority or, you know, just a completely different  cultural and social set up to the sites that we use.  So I think, you know, maybe we're not seeing it.  But by the same token, no one disagrees that my space is kind of in decay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What would you do if you were going to save them in this new thing  to become a gaming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is actually not a bad idea.  So the idea is they're going to start becoming a video game portal.  This is Jonathan Miller's brilliant idea.  Yeah. So, you know, he's saying they want to become a video gaming platform.  And it's true that nobody has really taken that market yet.  I mean, where do you go if you want to play games socially?  What what is the YouTube of  gaming? Yahoo, Yahoo Games. Right.  So there's obviously an open opportunity.  If this is the kind of gaming we're talking about, you know,  not the kind of the the Xbox kind of market, but the more online gaming.  It's a huge market.  There's money in it because you can, you know, get people to pay for these things  in a way that's not necessarily gambling.  So and remember my space, I started covering my space years ago,  like maybe three years ago  when they were doing kind of gaming things.  Now, actually, they had this kind of partnership thing  where you could play games with your friends and really work out.  But I think there's definitely a market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My kid plays like the Mob Wars games and stuff like that.  These are kind of not kind of asynchronous,  almost move based games.  They're not very exciting, and yet they're kind of compelling social games.  Is it that kind of game that you think they'll do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or I think they're going to do flash games, but I haven't like like hearts.  I haven't been through the whole story, but I think of the stories,  they're going to do flash gaming.  I think there's definitely a market for that.  I think Facebook, unfortunately, is already  getting some traction there because it's got the app platform.  There's not that many ways to get your games.  It's a dumb idea.  What's your idea for saving my space?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't. Well, I think what they have to do for what?  Let's start with what they can just point out, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They have one hundred twenty five million users.  Yeah. Well, then there's money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So recently they were dominant in the music, or at least we perceive them  to be dominant in the music space, where if you're a band,  you're creating my space page, you go and push your my space URL.  And some people still think they're salvageable, although we put out stats.  I think it was maybe last week saying they're losing in music  and entertainment now as well, that that market's kind of going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's where I think this is the this is what I think the mistake is.  You don't jump from one thing to something crazy like my video.  It's two different. You're going to lose all of them.  Yeah, yeah. Yeah.  But starting from zero, they were the dominant factor.  And I don't see anybody that's really replaced them in this music scene thing.  And what they should do is ask their users  what they can do to improve this situation, make the thing more appealing  and and maybe push the music thing even more so they just own it.  I don't see that. I agree with you.  I think that's the opportunity. This is nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, start a gaming site and call it my space games.  You don't have to change what you've got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they've already done that in the past.  It didn't work too well. Oh, what did they do?  I don't recall, but they definitely had casual game.  And by the way, I'm just reading through this.  It's not really clear on whether they're going to be doing casual gaming or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think I'm with John that it's possible to salvage the music thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I think everyone agrees it's possible to.  The music is their only remaining core.  It was always their core.  It's why they were started in the first place.  Facebook has absolutely no play there.  And they should by now. They're kind of lagging on that.  There was obviously I like to cooperate really quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  People use Facebook are too old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And by the way, a social network for music, which is, you know, so labels.  I mean, the great thing is that they did was they let indie artists  skip the whole they let them basically give the finger to the music industry  and say, you know what? Forget you.  We're going to go up.  We're going to put our music for free or some of it for sale on my space.  And we're going to show you when our events are and when you can come see us.  And we're going to make money on it.  And you know what?  We'd rather do that than sell out to the music industry  and let them give us pennies on every piece of music we make.  If they if they, you know, kept pushing that culture and keep doing that  and let the big artists come in if they want.  I mean, they've still got a wide open field ahead of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree. But here's another thing that's completely missing from the model,  which is where is the is where is the publication that is part of my space  that helps people find the music on the site?  I mean, if I wanted to look at new bands of a certain ilk  that I like to listen to, you can't do that.  I couldn't find one on my space unless I knew the name of the group to begin  with, they don't help these people at all.  There's no marketing angle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's also it's a it's the poor.  It's a very poorly designed site.  They've never gotten out in front of that.  They've never built a good search.  They've never built a good directory.  And there's no excuse for as long as they've been around that they haven't done that.  And so for all the problems that they're having, they really deserve them  because they're these are things they should have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the worst platform ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think they're almost in a position that's harder than new players  coming into the market because not only do they they have this challenge  where they have this horrible code base, they they are essentially having to  people who start from scratch almost have more opportunity to define the space.  I think my space is just really going to struggle here.  Music is I think we all agree the direction they need to go in.  You know what?  But they've got they've got so many they've got baggage.  I think that's the word I'm looking for with this horrible code base.  We all think it's horrible.  Like if a new player came into the music space, we give them a chance.  My space, we're kind of already against it.  Yeah.  So I think they've got a lot of baggage right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And well, there's also a huge security issue, which has yet to explode in their face.  But I think any day now, the security flaws on that site,  the number of unsophisticated users, mostly kids who are using it,  it could be a vector for a horrible infection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you mean like cross site scripts?  Yeah.  That was that was the biggest issue they suffered because you can  essentially put your own code in there.  Exactly.  Yeah.  But that was why it took off in the first place.  They had this system, so they almost in a way define this whole  what we now have as APIs and very structured and how developers can build stuff.  They did that way before, where they, you know,  paste arbitrary code in your profile.  Well, they say they would say it was accidental, that it was actually a security issue.  For whatever reason, this widget thing sprung up and we had sites like slide.  Remember slide came up.  We had image check.  We had photo bucket.  All these sites built on the top.  And it was kind of like the first version of what we now have with the Twitter API,  where there's just thousands of applications.  So, you know, that that was both a blessing and a curse because you had this  huge security hole, which still hasn't really been solved.  And then you also have this idea that people could just paste code that made a theme.  And then we have this issue where you're going to have to take that feature away  because people hate that.  They think they go to the pages and they're slow loading and they're ugly  and they have all these animated GIFs.  So then they have to backtrack.  Now they've tried to make clean profile pages, but they don't want to take away  the features they've already given to the users who really like those pages.  So that's where all the baggage comes from.  There's all these users who want the features that aren't going to work  going forwards and how can you like keep them on board but change it dramatically?  They're screwed.  I think they're in a difficult position.  You know what happened with Friendster and these were the guys that were before them.  They went in a different direction.  Friendster reportedly is doing quite well, but outside of any of the markets.  Yeah, outside of any of the markets that we ever cover.  So nobody knows about it, I think.  They'll probably go off on a tangent.  They'll probably, you know, maybe they'll bring back with the music thing.  They've obviously peaked unless they can really turn around this music thing  and do something huge. But iTunes has just deleted that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is interesting because there is this network effect.  And so Friendster, solely because everybody in the Philippines uses it,  can become a success in the Philippines or could, because everybody uses it in Brazil,  can become a success in Brazil.  And there's this kind of localized network effect.  Weird.  Yeah, but it can keep a site alive long after everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, in terms of the MySpace complaints that I keep hearing,  which just seem to be technical, why can't they use two code bases?  I mean, there's no reason they have everything running on the same code base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  God knows Murdoch's got enough money to say.  Hire 100 good programmers and start from scratch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, second code base haven't run in parallel.  And as people start slowly abandon the old one for the new,  you know, they have the same URLs that wouldn't make any difference.  That can all be dealt with.  And then you just pull the plug on the old one.  Yeah, by the way, I don't think MySpace is going to do the same thing as,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  oh, the chat room wants us to move on.  I don't think MySpace is going to do the same thing as  as Friendster and go into other markets.  They don't have any real significant international reach.  Facebook has the international reach there.  I mean, if you write here in the UK, people using Facebook,  they've sort of been transitioning from Bebo, which was very big.  MySpace was big as well.  Is Bebo losing ground?  Oh, it's just not it's just not a player.  I mean, after the AOL acquisition, that was pretty much it just started.  People just started a whole exodus from Bebo to Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Facebook is the dominant platform.  Three hundred. I just saw three hundred million in this article.  Three hundred million users now. Unbelievable.  Of course, there are more.  I was just reading this statistic.  There are more internet users in China, John, than there are people in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Why can't we find some way to sell them something?  Three hundred thirty eight million.  Exactly. So we open the Chinese market.  I remember hearing this years ago when the Chinese, you know, the Chinese market.  So good. All we have to do is sell every Chinese person one pair of shoelaces  and we make all this money.  Meanwhile, they ended up.  Yeah, it opened up all right.  And they ended up selling us everything.  We never sold them anything. We got ripped off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're smarter than us, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the truth. So are we ready to talk about the Palm pre thing that Palm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this is an interesting story.  So when Palm actually, I mean, John Rubenstein said this, he said,  and among our other features, when Palm first announced the pre,  it will sync with iTunes, which I thought was a very bold thing to say.  Remember, Rubenstein used to work on the iPhone team at Apple.  In fact, most of the most of the pre-pokes did.  So when the pre ships, first thing I did when I got my review,  you know, is plug it in.  Sure enough, it shows up on iTunes.  It says it's a pre and I can synchronize it.  I thought. Does Apple know?  Are they? Well, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this licensed? Apparently they found out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apparently not licensed.  I think that's the thing is that apparently Palm did this.  They didn't license iTunes and they synced it.  They sort of did it, you know, said, hey, it made it look like an iPod.  Now, it doesn't sync anything with DRM, but obviously,  or anything I think bought in the store, you know,  so you can burn your CDs and stuff and then sync those.  But what's interesting, and there's an angle that I'm trying to follow on this story.  So I was hoping we talk about it is that Blackberry does the same thing.  Blackberry desktop software really syncs with iTunes.  And so I'm trying to dig this up like, OK, did Blackberry actually license it  because they're not trying to shut Blackberry down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  Well, why would Apple, who is trying to survive against Blackberry,  whose Palm, the Pree is completely aimed at the iPhone.  Why would Apple cooperate in any way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, wait a minute. What are you thinking there, Leo?  I thought my impression is that Apple would be more concerned about Pree  because Pree came out as a targeting Apple.  I think Blackberry's shown no ability to to to go against the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not true at all. It's the it's the number one smartphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I realize it's the number one smartphone, but it's not.  But I think that market is discrepant.  I think there's a I think there's a different type of target.  I think there's a different type of user.  I don't think it's I don't think it's the same person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right. Yeah, yeah.  I mean, I could be wrong.  No, you have a point. I think it probably is.  The in fact, after reading this account of the hacker who said,  by the way, the iPhone is completely insecure, doesn't encrypt the data.  As soon as you as soon as you log in, your data is fully unencrypted.  It's completely inappropriate for enterprise use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  After some, but I'm sorry, somebody in the chat room said that  what what the difference is, is that somebody Blackberry made software  that communicates with iTunes, whereas made its made the the Palm  pre look like an iPod.  So it's taken a different approach. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Apple ships iTunes eight point two point one this week  and it stops sinking.  Palm makes a very interesting change.  And in fact, there's there's some palm complains to the USB folks,  whoever this is, this the folks who USB,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the working group that does the USB.  Yeah. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Saying that Apple's acting inappropriately here, that  you can't block an individual USB user.  You know, you either allow people to use it or not.  You can't say, well, is it a pre? Well, forget it.  Then, meanwhile, Palm comes back and and solved, by the way,  completely reverses the the block by.  Announcing itself as an iPod, they modified the Palm software,  they shipped out an upgrade to the pre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, was that any different than the early versions of Opera  telling the the servers that it was?  Well, you're not supposed to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're supposed, according to these rules that the whoever these USB people are,  you know, because you have IDs and stuff and they assign an ID,  you're supposed to identify as who you are.  So the Palm pre now says, I'm an iPod.  Although the USB, but it's not over yet because somebody's  pointed out that the USB hub still identifies as a pre.  So iTunes may come back with 822 looking at that and Palm will have to change that.  So we're in a little shooting war here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It sounds like fun. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, you got to like a company that's going to stand up to Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I'm most best.  I mean, we're I'm going to assume everyone's kind of supporting  Palm to some degree here. What's best for the consumer?  Do you want integration between these things or don't you?  Of course you do.  So it's kind of anti consumer by Apple.  Apple obviously always like this bubble.  They don't want anyone else kind of.  They say, oh, we're trying to maintain the consumer experience.  We don't want people ruining the experience.  What if this palm breaks?  That's that's going to reflect badly on us.  But really, it's about, you know, protecting, protecting their asset.  And it's a monopoly.  Let's say the M word. It's a pre M word. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  So what's what the real root of this story is, we're all kind of rooting for Palm  and hoping that they're going to keep fighting that battle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me defend Apple in this thing.  It's my understanding that from the get go, even though Apple makes a lot of money  and they have a lot of downloads, is that the whole orientation,  that it was a razor blade scheme to begin with, and it was actually iTunes  that was the loss leader designed to sell more hardware.  Their expensive phone and the iPod, both high margin items.  So now some interloper comes along and takes advantage of the loss leader.  In other words, you know, they're losing money by running the service  in the first place and they don't want them on there.  It's just like it's just like this money out of their pockets. It's ridiculous.  I don't blame Apple for being upset about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Palm says that Apple should not be allowed to set iTunes  to respond only to devices with the Apple USB codes.  And so they have gone to the USB implementers forum to complain.  However, the USB implementers forum says  a vendor ID used by a product must match the ID code of the company  producing the product. Palm is not doing that.  They're saying, no, I'm an iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Palm's strategy is really flawed here.  I mean, they really anything they do with this,  they're really reinforcing sort of Apple's position in the market.  And they can't win in the long run.  They cannot win. No, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They they can win in the EU if somebody cracked down on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true. That's true.  But I mean, they really just need to come up with their own software  that pulls in just, you know, use their desktop sync software,  pull in like the MP3 store from,  you know, from Amazon, pull in AAC files.  You can get AAC files. These files are unlocked now.  You know, they don't have DRM locking them down.  You can take those files and pull them on to the Palm Puri  and play it in their software.  It'd be a much better move for them just to create some really good  desktop software that pulls the stuff in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's kind of childish, to be honest with you. It is. It is.  It's kind of an odd thing for a company to do.  We can do it. We can sync.  And it's not that important, really, for the functionality of the pre.  Let's face it.  Yep. I don't think they need to do it.  Let's see here.  iPhone will not be exclusive forever, says AT&T CEO,  kind of admitting to the world that AT&T  isn't going to be able to own this phone forever.  In fact, Verizon's CEO is kind of intimating that they're going to have  the iPhone soon. And now we're seeing from Apple Insider,  what they say is we believe, given our source, that this is absolutely true,  that the Apple tablet has been approved for the first quarter of 2010.  Maybe this will be a device that ships on the Verizon platform.  Verizon's pushing its new 4G.  The tablet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, a 10 inch.  The one, the big old thing you get to hold up to your ear.  Hello? You get the dial on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think it'll be a phone.  Here we go again.  I hope not.  I think it's supposed to be a computing device, but maybe not.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How about this story, by the way?  Skype singled out a threat to Russia's security.  Did you do that one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I throw those in so I can use my Russian accent.  That's the only reason.  Fantastic.  It's all I do.  Look for a story that says Russia.  Russia's most powerful business lobby moved to clamp down on Skype  and its peers this week, telling lawmakers  Internet phone services are a threat to Russian business and national security.  How is this? What's their logic?  I have this makes no sense.  You know who the former world champion of chess, Gary Kasparov,  who's become a very political, in fact, ran for president in Russia.  He said, if it weren't for Skype, I'd be in jail right now.  He said that whatever the modern equivalent of the KGB  taps all my calls.  I only use Skype because of the encryption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're looking for his moves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not safe out there.  It's dangerous.  With with with government without government restrict.  This is really crazy.  This is crackpot.  Without government restrictions, IP telephony, they say,  causes certain concerns about security.  Most of the service operators working in Russia, such as Skype and ICQ, are foreign.  It's therefore necessary.  It's necessary to protect the native companies in this sector and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. I kind of wonder if there's something under  under the surface going on here.  I mean, Russia has a lot of serious hackers and cracking rings tied to the mafia.  They have a really bad organized crime problem.  I don't know. I kind of wonder if maybe this is about, you know, trying to keep those  you know, those organized crime rings from getting out of the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe maybe they know something we don't know. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a possibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of communications and security, can we do our  daily Twitter segment, weekly Twitter segment, the Twitter app  that someone created for Twitter skips past? Sure.  Because we haven't mentioned the T word at all.  No, I've.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're doing really well.  John, John, it makes me nervous to mention the T word with John in the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, now I have to say the real devour, ladies and gentlemen, go and I did try to  I'm trying to get my numbers up a little bit, but they just seem to be stagnant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A lot of people lost followers this week as Twitter clobbered spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there was a big drop.  We had a couple of stories on that  and just crazy amounts of people piling in.  And I think like a thousand comments on the stories about, you know, obviously,  people seem to really watch that number and, you know, be kind of offended  that they lost 20 followers.  That wasn't the story is going to pick up on actually.  What is the story you want to talk about?  It was that you you put in this Twitter ban from the White House story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yes. Well, of course, the White House has a Twitter account,  as does Barack Obama.  They use it for, you know, PR, publicity and so forth.  However, I don't know how exactly they're posting, according to Read Write Web.  And Steve, rather Robert Gibbs,  the press secretary, mentioned casually to CNN  that Twitter is blocked on official White House computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's censorship.  That's censorship.  How dare they?  Now, censorship makes no sense.  It's horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If I was running the White House, I'd block Twitter.  I would as well.  I'm supposed to be the social media guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody's a big talker about the Internet and all this.  And then you want to block stuff left or right.  But if the Chinese do it, oh, my God, they can't put up with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't see the value out here of using Twitter in the White House.  I mean, this is all it's going to do is leak stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can fire somebody, you can monitor them.  But I think blocking is a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, that's true. That's a good.  You just have a policy.  Maybe it's better to just have the policy and say, look, if you do it,  we're going to fire you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A lot of businesses block social networks, not for security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They block Dvorak Uncensored, for God's sake.  Yeah, you're blocked in China, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're blocked in China.  I couldn't get to your site in China.  I was so going with withdrawal.  It was so tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Seventy one percent of IT departments block social network.  You bet. Not because of security.  Because it's a time sink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's censorship.  Oh, it's a time sink.  I block Twitter here at the cottage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I think that's different, though.  I think, you know, if you're at a business, then all your employees can be a marketer.  If you've got all your employees with a good Twitter policy that are saying,  hey, I'm working on this awesome, you know, new project service we've got coming out.  And you can get people really engaged with your business.  It's marketing channel.  The White House doesn't really, in my opinion, needs, you know,  all its staff to be marketers for White House.  I just don't. I'm against all censorship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree with John, though. Do it as a policy.  Don't block it. Do it as a policy.  Here's the funny thing.  Here's the funny thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  According to Mitch Kapoor,  they're doing the same thing that people in China do.  The White House staffers are using their iPhones and they're getting around the block.  They're using IMs.  Yeah. Well, they use iPhones to any of the Twitter apps.  They don't go to the website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. You go to the Twitter app on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. You use Tweety or, you know, and it just goes right out.  You don't need to.  You don't.  It's the same problem in China.  I was able to get on a lot of these sites, even though they were blocked, just by using

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  iPhone. Well, I found most of the propaganda about China, you know, with,  you know, you drive around, everyone's got a dish network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely. But I was watching CNN.  And as soon as they started talking about the Uyghur rebellion, it goes black.  And you actually caught that.  Oh, yeah. For two minutes, it's black.  And then it comes back when the next story is on.  Oh, they they're they're they're pretty I think they're pretty aggressive about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  blocking. What hotel were you at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Raffles. And then the Sofitel in Xi'an.  Same thing happened.  But these are these are Western hotels for Westerners, and they still do it.  But you're right. Everybody has a dish.  I was in the countryside.  These people raise kumquats.  They they make their own tofu to make a little extra money on the side  in the local market.  And they've got a 50 inch HDTV with a satellite dish in their house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wild. Even people internationally.  I have some friends that are Iranian in the U.S. here.  And they have satellite dishes that pick up all the Iranian satellite channels  here in the U.S.  Amazing. They watch all of the channels.  Now, some of them don't come from some come from in Iran.  Some of our broadcasts like from L.A. and London and places like that.  But it's pretty wild. It's just a different world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, actually, if you get a hold of the Dish Network, folks,  they actually have international plans that they don't advertise much  because I know someone that it's all Dish Network is on their menu  and the whole thing, all Russian TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I love that. It's good. I'm going to get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll make some dubs for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Will you please? I need to practice accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think, you know, one key thing and you say it sends a shit is, OK,  there's a risk of leaking.  But what about kind of consuming information?  I mean, you were saying, Leo, that you're using Twitter to read  what you're going to use and consume content.  It's true. It's true.  And it's a reason to argue that at least on at least on the inbounds,  you're going to get a lot more value out of something like Twitter  than reading RSS.  You're going to be a lot more clued in.  I think there is that argument on the inbound.  Yeah, this certainly should be reading to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think you got to grow. You got to grow up.  You got to assume your staffers, adults.  This is to block.  Something is absurd. That's just absurd.  That's treating them like kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It means you don't trust your people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sorry. That's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. You should spy on them instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we can see what you're doing.  We don't have to. We don't have to block anything.  Let's take a little time out.  If you want to go base your meat, John, you may you may do so.  Is this a euphemism?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hear this in every show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It all started with John.  It's become a it's become.  Yeah, it's a euphemism. It's a euphemism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I cook.  He literally it's Sunday afternoon when we record the show.  John frequently is making pulled pork or some other fine roast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So why can't we just make it worse?  Why can't we just have this at the Dvorak's house and have dinner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I agree. I think, John, we should be going over there.  And what are you cooking tonight? Are you cooking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just doing some flank steak.  But, you know, doing a pulled pork would be a good.  The problem is, it's the timing on pulled pork.  It's like takes 12 to 14 hours, sometimes 16 to make this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, flank steak is a fantastic cut, but it can be a little chewy.  Do you tenderize?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you what you do.  Flank steak is a simple thing to cook.  Actually, you had a recipe that I posted when it's very lean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's very healthy for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's very tasty. Oh, I love it.  But it's essentially you have to cook it over extremely high heat,  very short period of time, and you marinate it for a very short period,  about 20 minutes max with and what the easiest one.  I've tried a lot of different things, but for people out there  want to catch this recipe, you take a flank steak and you soak it in.  Of all things, this is the best, believe me,  Kikkoman soy sauce, the one that's made in the United States.  It's soy based, the tender.  It's actually a tenderizing product.  And you soak the meat in that for about 20 minutes at the most.  And if you over soak it, it will cook the meat because it's so salty.  And then you get a really hot barbecue going about.  You definitely have to have the thing blazing.  So it's around 800, 900 degrees on the surface temperature.  And you throw the flank steak on there, cook it on each side rather quickly  for about two, three minutes.  You get the hang of it after you do about two or three of them.  And then you make the sideways cut.  You do it. You cut in at an angle with the you have the grain going across.  And then the grain goes this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because it won't a flank steak curl because don't do you do this?  Do you know? No, you don't have the curling problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It won't curl if you do it this way.  And also that membrane is broken down by the soy sauce.  Ah, OK. Throw it on through the three, three and a half minutes on each side.  Bang, bang, bang.  You get thing is the most unbelievable cut of meat.  They're always available.  There's only two of them on a steer, but they're always available  because nobody knows how to cook them.  If you don't know what you're doing, they will be horribly tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tough and dry and horrible. Yeah.  So fast cooking, marinate and keep them on for 20 minutes.  Ladies and gentlemen, there's our recipe of the day.  Thanks to John C. DeVora.  I love this show.  You can go you can go listen to your buzz out loud.  You can go watch your news on TV, but nowhere  you're going to get a flank steak recipe.  No other tech programing will give you those shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, especially on social.  They eat burgers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Those people know other no other show will give you this quality content.  The good folks at Citrix are our sponsors, and I want to mention  their product, Go to Meeting right now.

From the great folks at Citrix,  we thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.  So we've had now in the last month, two,  count them two false positives in antiviruses.  And the most recent is a nasty one, computer associates antivirus.  I hope nobody's using that.  Had a false positive that if you're running it,  and this was the latest version updated,  it would warn of an infection, quarantine the files.  The files turned out to be critical Windows system files.  As soon as it did that, boom, your system crashed.  That's it. It's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love these stories.  What a piece of crap.  Thanks for your help.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What a piece of...  I actually related to that.  I covered a story on, I think it was Friday, AVG.  Another false positive.  Had a huge issue because AVG is a big, big, very, very popular  antivirus software.  And it was identifying iTunes as a...  So it would pick out all these iTunes files,  and then you'd go, okay, let's quarantine those.  And then you try and use iTunes.  And obviously it won't work because you've just quarantined  a bunch of the files that iTunes requires to work.  I think they've issued a patch.  I think if you go and update AVG now, which is they updated  their virus definitions, they included iTunes files,  but no particular reason.  People say, oh my goodness, have I got an iTunes trojan?  And obviously...  CA has a patch.  CA has a patch too.  That one's slightly less annoying than the one that you  just mentioned, which essentially sounds like it just...  End of the world, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I swear.  I'm a big fan of AVG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I think probably, I would bet you most of our audience,  more than half of our audience uses it because it's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, if you can find it free.  I mean, it's free.griisoft.com, ladies and gentlemen.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Free.grisoft.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I used to use it, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what?  I don't mind spending 30 bucks for a good antivirus,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to be honest with you.  I don't mind it either,  but I don't like them getting on my machine  and then reminding me for the rest of my life  that knew it or they interrupt me.  That's Norton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's Norton.  I hate Norton.  I use non-32.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of the best ones was actually OneCare,  Microsoft OneCare, and they got renovated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, but now they're gonna,  now, and this is the interesting thing,  all these companies are gonna be out of business  because they're gonna give it away.  Microsoft, in a couple of months,  you're gonna get free security suite from Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm glad you brought that up  because some people are talking about this,  this is an antitrust thing,  although they're gonna offer it as a free download.  So it's like, I don't really hope  we don't hear any of that crap.  Because it's like, okay,  so Microsoft's is gonna fix its own product,  build something in they should have done a long time ago  and make it more user-friendly security features.  And they're gonna get sued for doing that  for putting people out of business.  Look, if you're a virus,  antivirus maker and you made a product,  you've always known that someday  Microsoft could include this in the system.  You took that risk when you became an antivirus.  You've been lucky.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You've been lucky all this time  that Microsoft was screwing up so bad  and didn't bother to fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, Leo, this is a great transition  to your story that you bookmarked about  machines taking over the world.  Okay.  Where you, and there was actually  some good points in that article.  So I can't remember where the article is.  I haven't got it up, but basically it was, you know,  that people are, there's been meetings  about seriously considering this possibility.  Well, you know, this has been the stuff of,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  yeah, this has been the stuff of sci-fi, you know,  the Terminator and all that.  But it turns out actually,  scientists are actually worried about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And one of the points in that article is that,  you know, there are viruses out there  that are essentially like cockroaches now.  We can't send them out even if we wanted to.  Right.  You know, and if we get to a point  where these viruses can mutate,  much like biological viruses,  they're in a situation where we could have  no control over these viruses  and then reach a point where we have no control  over actual physical hardware  that's, you know, able to self-replicate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of the things they were actually  particularly worried about is autonomous killing machines.  Right now, the US has become more and more adept  at fighting a war with these predator drones  that are piloted out of a complex in Las Vegas.  And I think that's where we're headed,  where the video game jockeys growing up today  are gonna end up piloting these machines.  But autonomous machines are a little bit scary  because they're not piloted.  And that was something that particularly  scared these scientists.  There was a meeting of artificial intelligence researchers  and roboticists at a Cilimar in Monterey just recently.  And there's a New York Times article on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's always a good movie about this.  What was that movie that these guys are out in the desert  and there was these autonomous things  that were under the sand and they grind you up.  And then one of them came along, it was a robot.  And it was just not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's called Transformers.  It was a fantastic film.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it wasn't Transformers.  And by the way, we should always give a shout out  to the classic movie, The Last Starfighter,  which was a movie where the kid was a great video game player.  That's right.  And was recruited.  That's right.  And that's like, every time I see those drone guys  in Vegas, I'm thinking, there you go.  There you have it.  Yep, yep.  What's the difference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the greater concern immediately with these drones  is that they just go wrong.  There was a story, and I think it was on another podcast  called Buzz Out Loud, which is equally awesome,  about the problem is you arm up these robots.  They have the exact same issues of software  that we have on our machines,  except when they make a mistake,  they kill a bunch of people.  And that's the immediate concern that-  That's life.  Software is imperfect.  And we're arming up for, you get a bug,  it's gonna kill someone.  I wanted to transition.  I have no transition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To never, never land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have no transition here,  but you got a story about Bill Gates quitting Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's dropped his Facebook.  And you had a, I actually saw this on Mashable  because I followed your link to PC World.  You saw it on Mashable,  but you linked it to the New York Times.  What's with that?  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'll put it in the New York Times link.  But well, the New York Times link has his more  from his speech.  He talked about a lot of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know, I just went for the cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He talked about a lot of things,  but I did like the fact that he said,  I stopped my Facebook page  because 10,000 people wanted to be my friend,  and I didn't know which ones were actual friends  and which ones weren't.  So I just-  What?  Screw it.  Hey Bill, wake up.  I can't tell which of you I know.  None of them are your friends.  None of them.  You say yes.  But PC World did a very funny parody Bill Gates  Facebook page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When I was looking through on this,  I found this PC World thing,  and we actually put out a post today  called Top Five Funniest Fake Facebook Pages  where I started digging into this stuff.  And there was actually a funny bit of the story  was that PC World, no one had really seen it.  It didn't get dug or anything.  They'd created back in April,  like a parody Facebook page of Bill Gates.  And it has Steve Jobs saying that the new iPod,  well him saying Steve Jobs that-  Well, no, no, no, get it right, get it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cause it starts.  It starts, it says, Steve Jobs says,  oh Bill, hey, remember that great operating system  you wrote, oh yeah, neither do I.  And then Gates respond, this is on the wall,  and then Gates responds back, says,  yeah Bill, that iPod Nano, it looks like a tampon.  And it's just really, I mean,  it's like if they had a Facebook page,  this would be what it was like.  It was very funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brilliant, and then we did a top five funniest  fake Facebook pages.  So are these on Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cause you can't really put a fake page up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they're mockups.  There are people in art departments who still want to.  So who else, what other people have Facebook?  Let me go pull out the post.  I mean, there was one from,  there's one for the story of Genesis, God's Facebook page.  There's one that's Satan's Facebook page,  and he's just signed the Jonas Brothers for 3,000 years.  There's some really good ones actually.  I'm not doing adjustments.  Actually that explains a lot.  There's Obama's first 100 days from Slate,  all told in kind of Facebook updates.  There's Hitler's Facebook, the Steve Jobs,  they didn't want to see Jobs, which is very, very funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way, that's an internet meme that can die now.  They use that scene, the Hitler scene  from the Bruno Gans doing Hitler.  Honestly, yeah.  And then they just tie some other,  it's a subtitle, it ties to like,  Hitler learns that Michael Jackson is dead or.  Yeah, I still don't.  I'm so sick of this meme.  You can stop that now, kids.  No more of those, okay?  Here's an interesting story.  For seven years, the National Transportation Safety Board  has known the Highway Safety Agency,  actually I should get this right, the NHTSA,  the National Highway Transportation  and Safety Administration has been wanting to recommend  that cell phone use of all kinds be banned in cars  because they've known since 2002,  it's just as dangerous even with a hands-free unit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's because people can't concentrate  and drive at the same time.  How many times have you been down the road  with somebody yacking on the phone,  they're swerving all over the place  and they're, eh, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah,  and they, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's studies galore that show  that this is just as dangerous.  This is the equivalent of having three or four drinks in you.  And in fact, this report, which was suppressed,  the only reason we know it's out is because  a public citizen in the Center for Auto Safety  filed a Freedom of Information Act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, obviously somebody was paying off somebody's phone  because of the handset makers.  Actually, it would have to be the cell phone companies,  not those handset guys.  That's who it is, it's cell phone companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I have to admit, you know, this spring,  I spent some time in San Francisco  and, you know, they have the ban, of course, in California,  you can't do hands-free.  I do think, you know, not having your hand on the phone,  having your hand on the phone is even a more impairment.  Yeah, because you can't actually,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you can't even steer because you're on the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  So I came back, when I came back to Louisville,  which is where Tech Republic's headquarters are,  and I was there and I noticed I was sitting at the light  my first day back, you know, at work,  and every freaking person is on the cell phone.  And I'm like, I just.  It's scary.  I felt, you know, yeah, kind of scared.  It was like, none of these people  are paying any attention to anything,  and they're driving.  Why do they need to talk so much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know, yeah.  Well, this is my, there's two theories.  There's a conspiracy theory  that the cell phone companies suppressed this report.  By the way, one of the things they said in this report  was that they didn't recommend state legislation  requiring hands-free units,  because that quote may erroneously imply  that hands-free phones are safe to use while driving.  So they didn't even think that there should be laws  banning the use of a cell phone  or requiring the use of a hands-free.  They said this should be banned in cars completely.  Now, here's just two scenarios.  One, that the cell phone companies got to them and said,  hey, you're not, you know,  there's no way you're putting that out.  The other one I think is maybe even more likely,  they realized that voters would go crazy  if anybody attempted to ban cell phone use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not convinced of that second scenario,  and I'll tell you why.  I think most of the people that are on the phone all the time  are too dumb to vote.  And they probably have no influence,  and the rest of us have been scared once or twice a week  by some maniac that almost kills us  because they're on the cell phone.  Oh yeah, absolutely.  And with texting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know, I think it's,  texting is important. I think it's on popular policy though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, texting's really, I mean, I've done that.  I've held the steering wheel and texted with my thumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I saw that Will Smith movie,  I quit messing with my, you know,  where he's texting on his Blackberry, you know,  and then he hits the other family, and oh yeah.  After that, I was like, okay, I gotta quit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's very dangerous.  You don't think that, I mean,  I think legislators probably realized  that it would be hideously,  it would be death, political death,  to sponsor a bill that prevented people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  from using cell phones. They should have some guts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it would be hugely unpopular,  but if you're saying, you know,  it's as dangerous as,  It is?  Not quite drunk driving,  but having a few drinks in you, you know, clearly,  you know, it's very, very popular,  talking on your cell phone.  What are the laws in the UK? It's hugely dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can you, are they required hands free?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually can't remember, that's a good point.  I can't recall, I just never,  I don't have a car phone, so I don't speak on the phone.  So you don't do it?  No.  Good for you.  No.  But I think, you know, it's not about,  it's ultimately about the right of whatever  the pedestrian that could be killed,  or, you know, the other driver that you could crash into,  it's, you know, rights and responsibilities thing,  and if this is as dangerous as the studies suggest,  then obviously, it's not gonna be popular to ban it,  but you know, it's what you're gonna do if you're gonna,  if a significant number of deaths happen.  Yeah, it's happening from this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm gonna blog about this next week.  I'm on vacation, but I'm still gonna blog about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good, good.  Now, there's one story that before we finish,  I wanna mention, did anybody take a look  at this PowerPoint presentation of the Microsoft store?  Just leaked out?  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't seen this.  Tell us about it, John.  This sounds good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  First of all, their plan is to build stores  next door to the Apple stores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, and by the way, and I've mentioned this before,  and I'll mention it again,  and it was actually in the MarketWatch column,  but they kind of took out the name of the company,  and also, this took place in the 60s,  not the 70s, like I recall,  which is the, there used to be a hamburger chain,  and Leo might remember them,  but they were called Henry's,  and you can look them up on the internet,  because there's a bunch of people  that collect their old signs and stuff.  It's actually one of these nostalgia places.  Anyway, Henry's 15-cent hamburgers,  their strategy was to find a McDonald's  and figure that somebody knew what they were doing  to put the McDonald's there,  and they'd put a Henry's right around the corner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's true.  McDonald's, like Starbucks  and any other really sophisticated retail operation,  does a lot of research before they choose  where to build a store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, especially in the early days,  and so, Henry's would just find, say,  oh, let's put one here,  and they have it.  I went onto one of the Henry's sites,  and they showed, they failed to mention  that there was a bunch of these places in California,  and I remember the Henry's hamburgers in San Jose,  but anyway, the thing was, also McDonald's cloned.  They tried to look like a McDonald's,  only the theme was green and red,  and it just sucked.  I mean, the burgers were almost identical,  so that didn't make much difference,  but it was like a bad, stupid idea.  There was no originality, really,  and this is exactly what Microsoft's doing,  which is another point I try to make,  which is, okay, Apple's got the store.  Nobody's done well with the stores.  I mean, everybody's pretty much  almost gone out of business with stores.  Gateway, remember?  Gateway and sales took up. Gateway and sales took up.  Before that, Compuad.  Compuad, yes.  And before that, IBM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Microsoft stores are basically very similar.  Apple stores really succeed,  whether they sell computers or not,  they succeed in kind of positioning the Apple experience,  and I could see why Microsoft would wanna kind of  get some of that magic. Well, yeah,  but Apple's a lifestyle brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's completely different.  I mean, if you're selling a lifestyle brand  and you're selling hardware,  Microsoft sells some hardware,  but they don't sell the computers that are running Windows,  so I don't see the sale here.  Here's some of the copy from the PowerPoint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's some of the copy from the PowerPoint.  Emily has come in for an appointment at the Windows Bar.  It said genius. Is that what they're gonna call it?  It said genius, it said genius when they crossed that out.  The Windows Bar for personal training.  The easy-to-find iconic glass back wall  boldly showcases the service offering throughout the store.  The dynamic video or screen projection  inside the wall broadcasts brand messages.  Truth is beauty, war is peace.  No, no, that's something else.  As well as queue status and announcements  welcoming new PC users after a sale.  Congratulations, Lauren. You're a new PC owner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This sounds fake to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, Microsoft has confirmed these are real.  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's how bad it is. It would sound fake.  That's how bad it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Before her appointment.  I was just about to defend them on this, actually.  No, this is real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Always a mistake, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't defend Microsoft.  Before her appointment,  Emily receives an email notification.  By the way, this is everything Apple does.  Reminding her of the appointment.  Real-time email notifications  keep her informed of her place in line.  The friendly associates enhance the Windows Bar  experience with their distinctive style,  knowledge and recommendations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. It's pathetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is one scenario where they could actually,  this thing could actually work for them.  I don't know if you guys have seen their booths at CES.  If the people who put together their booths at CES.  Those are quite beautiful, yeah.  Did their stores, it would be great  because it was kind of similar to Apple.  It's a showcase, right?  It shows what they're working on now, but even more,  it shows like here's stuff that we're working on  that's kind of coming, and some of it's concept car-ish.  But I think technophiles like that stuff.  The technophiles that go to the Apple stores  that are Mac boys would like that.  They would think it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is no chance in a million years  that the scenario you describe would ever take place.  Microsoft does not have very good  inter-corporate communication to begin with.  You're right, you're right.  And there's so much jealousy at all kinds of levels there  that you wouldn't let this guy who does the trade shows,  who even talked to these people.  I guarantee there's gonna be none of that element  at these stores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If they did, they could win, but I think you're right.  I don't think they will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just think it's so funny that they can't come up  with anything original.  They've got a genius bar, they've got appointments.  If you look through it, they might as well have just taken  the plans for the Apple store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even they have the plans in slide five,  and it looks like the layout of an early Apple store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they have a theater, they have a stage  where they do instructional stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, anyway, these companies have failed me.  This is the hardest thing in the world to do.  It is, and it's expensive too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're setting yourself up with this massive overhead  of all these stores.  Even if you decide it fails, it's not like shutting down  Bing or something and say, all right, we're gonna move  some people here or there.  I mean, shutting down stores is as expensive  as opening them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sorry, they call it the guru bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even worse.  Can we have something that starts with a G?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They basically opened the thesaurus and said,  okay, what's good for genius?  No one will notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Genius, genius, guru.  Hey, guys, I want to, not Bing, bingo.  I want to thank you so much for being here.  Pete Cashmore, we love Mashable.  I'm so glad you could spend some time with us today.  It's really great having you on.  Mashable.com, and on Twitter you are?  At Mashable.  At Mashable.  There's no Pete Cashmore account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I just use the at Mashable.  That's all you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's great to have you.  Thank you for joining us.  Jason Hiner is the editor in chief of the Tech Republic.  Go there now and you can see my cabinet.  That's right.  Who do we make John?  Is he the secretary of?  Secretary of Justice.  Justice, John.  Justice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, you're out, you're life sentence.  And Adam Curry is secretary of conspiracies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'd never join a government that would have me.  Jason is the editor in chief of Tech Republic.  Great Ziff Davis publication, one of the last remaining.  Seen it, isn't it?  I'm sorry, it was Ziff Davis, now Seen It.  It never was Ziff Davis, was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was never Ziff Davis.  Yeah, yeah, it was.  And so I know it's a conglomerate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hate to get it straight, but I'm not even there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  ZDNet, you know, Znet bought ZDNet  and then NTech Republic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then ZDNet.  Oh, okay, you were merged with ZDNet  and then made into Znet, which was made into CBS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, pretty much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which is soon to be a MySpace property.  No, that's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you can also find me on Twitter at Jason Hiner,  just H-I-N-E-R.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  J-A-S-O-N-H-I-N-E-R.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can catch him on the HBO every Saturday night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Using his pseudonym, Max Kellerman.  Right, that's right, of course.  And Mr. John C. Dvorak is at Channel Dvorak.  And of course, he's the host of Cranky Geeks  and Tech5 and No Agenda and many other great programs,  which all can be found on Channel Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And substitute host once every two years on this show.  Now, that's me.  I'll have you back anytime, you were great.  The real Dvorak on Twitter is what I need,  because I've got to get my numbers up a little bit.  And I'm falling, I'm lagging here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How many followers do you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I'm like 58, 400.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, it all pales compared to the two million plus  that Ashton Kutcher has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's the master of true engagement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually don't think it would be good to have that many,  because I'd like to still crowdsource,  and I'm already at 58, it's actually too many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It becomes very hard once you get over that many  to actually track all your replies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you don't follow, you can't follow everyone.  No, it's not that following me, it's the crowdsourcing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You ask your crowd a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you know, the truth is,  I bet you have those two million,  how many are actually engaged very few?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've done some testing, and I think you're lucky  to have 10% of those people ever paying any attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what I did recently, which really worked out well?  Jay Rosen, who's a professor of journalism at NYU,  and is a great guy to follow on Twitter,  said, and he just posted a tweet,  I follow 600 tightly tuned people  in the journalistic community,  and so I just stole all the people he followed.  I just started following them,  and it's worked out really good.  There's this great discussion going on in journalism.  In fact, I'm thinking I recommend this to people,  maybe look for somebody who is interesting himself  or herself, and see who he or she follows,  because that's a very good way to find out  who else is interesting, particularly in an area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you should post your list, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I've got a post coming up,  100 technology experts on Twitter,  including all the present company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what they could do is like RSS,  where you know with RSS, they need an OPML.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They need OPML for follower lists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'd be cool if I could go, who does Leo,  because I want to get started in podcasting,  who does Leo follow?  I would like to add that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All Leo follows are just B and A list celebrities.  And porn stars.  And porn stars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I keep hoping one of them will say something interesting.  Ha ha ha.  Constantly disappointed, let me tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's kind of the drawback to those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The most boring people in the world are porn stars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a shoot at one.  Not even that.  I'm gonna wear my red shoes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not even that.  I would love to hear that.  Not even that.  My cat is pink.  I mean, I don't know.  It's like inane.  You misspelled pink.  That's the worst part.  Yeah, inane.  I don't know why I expected more, but I did.  Thank you all for being here.  We will, don't forget, of course,  you can get a tweet at the iTunes store for free,  even though it's in the store.
