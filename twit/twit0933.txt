[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:40.360]   Denise how you're not an oldie you're a goodie internet and technology lawyer former host of this week in law her new podcast is coming soon
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.180]   Here's say culture dot com. Hi Denise
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.440]   Hi there. Wonderful network will have a number of podcasts there. What's yours gonna be called?
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:57.040]   I'm gonna be on to mine. My main one is gonna be called uneven distribution with a nod to William Gibson
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.920]   and
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.260]   I'm also going to be on R&D with D&D
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.480]   You're one of the D's I presume I'm one of the D's. That's awesome
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.720]   Dave Levine is the other D. I can't wait
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.720]   It's great to see you we were down your way, but I didn't knock on your door because we just drove by and waved
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.880]   I hope that was good enough
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.320]   Another oldie and goodie Alex Lindsey is also here normally you see him on Mac break weekly
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:31.320]   But every once in a while we let him come up to the adult table office hours that global and zero non-zero dot media
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:38.400]   Hi, Alex. I was thinking about rum slag when I was at the Disney the new Disney Star Wars
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.320]   You see rum slag was he there? I looked for him. I couldn't find him
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.880]   We did buy two hundred fifty dollar lightsabers though
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:53.320]   You know for a good good quality lightsabers about that there there's some folks that I work with that make like really like
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.320]   Movie quality when they're from the island model shop. These are like that metal. They're really nice
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.800]   Yeah, but of course they don't have it. They don't actually they won't cut you in half
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.980]   Which is probably a good thing. They have fluorescent tubes and then they always thought that they should
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.040]   Know they should make little ones little ones. Yeah, just thank you slice your bread whiz or maybe a turkey slices
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:20.000]   It dices it dices while it cuts. Yeah, Dyson could make one you know like for Thanksgiving. It'd be great the turkey lightsaber
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.680]   Hey, we want to welcome somebody new never been on the show before but I'm thrilled to have him Jason del Rey
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.080]   He has just published a hot ticket
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.560]   winner sells all
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.560]   Amazon Walmart and the battle for our wallets
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.080]   On audible I have the Kindle version also in hardcover for you old timers
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.960]   It's great. Whatever you want Jason. Welcome great to have you
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.680]   Thank you for having me. Yeah great to be here. It's a it's a really good book
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.400]   I bought the Kindle version, but I also read the excerpt fortune published about pill pack and I read it with interest
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.640]   Because pill pack used to be a sponsor and I did not realize Walmart was ready to buy him
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.240]   That's correct and then it fell through
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:11.080]   It did they drag their feet a bit as they've done on a couple of big acquisitions that Amazon was also involved in and
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.640]   Amazon's they've already I guess talked to Amazon, but Amazon said hey, you know
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.400]   Walmart's not interested. We still are
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.000]   But TJ doesn't seem too happy at Amazon
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.120]   well, he yeah, he's he's out now and
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.640]   Doing the VC thing which
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.520]   So he got it doesn't wants to work a big enough check
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:42.200]   That he could do that. That's that's all I need to know 32 years old when he sold for I who knows hundreds of millions probably
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.160]   Around a billion yeah a billion
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.120]   pill pack as you might remember if you saw the ads had these machines it would
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.680]   package your prescription and your
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:59.000]   vitamins in little plastic pouches and send them out to you so they were already ready to go and it was actually quite a I
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.720]   Thought I used it for a while. It's quite a cool service
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.800]   Is I haven't used the Amazon version is is it the same is it changed?
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.520]   I've so I do not use the service, but I saw some very
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.600]   Big media personalities on Twitter
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.320]   Complaining about the service post Amazon acquisition yeah
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:28.000]   Amazon struggled with health haven't they for a while they had it looked like they were gonna get big
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.160]   Maybe still looks like they're gonna get big into the health business. Maybe
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.920]   regulatory
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.600]   Snafus, but they go ahead you write about this in the book. I know
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:47.920]   Yeah, they they they're still going at it. I mean they just spent almost four billion for essentially a
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.520]   Future-looking doctors chain. I mean one medical
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.000]   and
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:01.760]   Walmart the same I mean the biggest issue at Walmart with their healthcare initiatives is that they can't keep a health leader
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.960]   More than like 18 months at the company. Yeah, I think they've gone through like nine or ten and ten years
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.960]   But they both want to be there so
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.280]   It's a space space. I didn't know much about before reporting the book, but
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:19.920]   Space I think they're both potentially could have profound impact in I think that the challenge really
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.160]   I've been thinking about this a little bit related to
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:28.840]   medical specific specifically and I think that one of the problems is that what Amazon does when it buys a company is usually
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.600]   Drain out the goodness of it to to make it more efficient
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.520]   You know like let's take a little bit of the goodness out and then make it more efficient so that we can make more money at it
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.520]   Your margin is our is our opportunity and they squeeze that and you can feel that even when you go to Whole Foods
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.920]   You know I you go to Whole Foods and now you can't you know
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.400]   You every once a week you can actually get a Rugola
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.960]   My salads and there's some kind of supply chain thing there and you know that they're just cutting corners somewhere
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:58.160]   Like there's there's there's you know and there's things that just run out and then some and then they're slowly turning Whole Foods into
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.080]   Trader Joe's you know they keep on adding 365
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.760]   Brands and so and so forth and everything gets kind of dumb down
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.160]   You know and and I think that that as a trader Joe's lover
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.680]   We'll continue that conversation later
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.840]   Anyway, so anyway, so I'm like if I want to go to Trader Joe's
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:20.600]   What kind of evil person hates trader Joe? I just want to pick I just what it's weird. It's a weird place anyway
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.440]   So it's and it's it's like a weird layout and it's all with you don't like snacks
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.120]   With humorous names actually
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.120]   No, I don't and the thing is is that I have brands that I want and I have things that I want and I want to go and get the things
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.760]   That I the things that I want to have I want to have them
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.500]   I don't want them all under one brand and so I kind of feel like the Trader Joe's is like three blocks from Whole Foods in the
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:45.020]   Baudow feel like if I want to go to Trader Joe's like go to Trader Joe's, but I want to go to Whole Foods and buy the brands that and
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:51.500]   You just watch I'm just watching them slowly work those brands out and put their own own in and they make it harder to find the brands
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.700]   And you as soon as it becomes hard to find the brand in Whole Foods
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:58.220]   You know that there's gonna be a 365 brand that's gonna get added to where that one was
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.020]   You know like then the tell is gonna go away and they're gonna add their own version of Nutella
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.960]   And it's gonna be in there and so and so or then and they just do this and so you just watch this thing
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:11.680]   And I think the reason I bring this up is because I think people are more sensitive to that when it comes to medicine
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.600]   Because that's a good
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.200]   And so that's the thing is is that yeah, don't be putting the peanut butter in my Cialis. That's a very good point
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.940]   Yes, I agree it so I think that that's why they have trouble with it is they
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:28.000]   Cialis pretzels would not be a bad product. I'm just saying I
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.780]   Think Trader Joe's would sell that not Whole Foods. Yeah, exactly exactly so
[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:37.840]   So I think that I think that that's the challenge that they have with medicine is that people are a little bit more sensitive
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:44.440]   You know a lot of people have anecdotally said that the some of the generic drugs are not as effective as the real drugs
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.320]   They're like hey, I know that's not true saying but they're not it's not true. Is it?
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.600]   No, it's now it's coming up in India. They've all kinds of problems with
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:59.860]   Legally they're identical right they are supposed to be formulaically identical, but when they're made cheaply it turns out that they're not identical
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.720]   Accative in my my men are you put more sawdust in there?
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.500]   It's not as effective and so and I've I've had friends that have had you know
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:13.200]   They've had all kinds of problems with those and so the thing is is that in the same sense though
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.500]   I think the problem is people get sensitive when they think that that it might affect their health or that might kill
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:22.240]   Yeah, no, they're more sensitive you cutting quarters and so I think that that's where health is
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:27.220]   You know gets a little more complicated, you know for them, you know
[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.720]   You know and I think that that's gonna be continued to be a challenge because they're so margin
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.120]   formulaically
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:40.040]   Pointed Wow. That's the first I've heard of that and I am now concerned for the entire health insurance
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:44.060]   industry that only covers generic drives I
[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:51.580]   Pretty much because I'm on Kaiser, which is a health maintenance organization in HMO and the west coast
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:54.920]   Pretty much all I can get is generic
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.520]   But it saves you a lot of money. I hope I'm getting medicated
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.900]   properly
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:07.100]   I hope you're not getting harmed. Yeah, because the losses I
[00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.460]   Thought they were they were identical
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.340]   But they should be
[00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:18.980]   It's just that there's maybe it's just India that we have a problem with right. I don't know
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.380]   I mean it's there's no margin in engineering drugs
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:26.920]   There's no money in generic drugs and so when there's no money in some brand you can expect the quality to be there to vary
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:33.080]   Not I don't want to channel RFK junior or anything. I'm not I'm not but I'm not trying to do that
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:38.840]   I but I have I specifically have a that's not this show that's Joe. I had a friend who had a mother who had a you know
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.840]   how all time, you know, she was
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:47.080]   Drugs for that and sometimes they worked and sometimes it get something's are really effective and sometimes they weren't and as I started talking about it
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:51.200]   They started realizing that oh, you know the the you know the formula
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.520]   It wasn't that it was damaging. It was just that it wasn't
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:58.500]   Some batches weren't effective. Yeah, you know and they were they were varying enough that it was a problem
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:04.040]   So that's your next book Jason. I want you to get to work on that right now man. Yeah, but so yeah
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:10.060]   You see you mentioned Trader Joe's and I have my mind immediately went to the slate article this week
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:16.060]   Called trader ooze. You're not imagining it trader Joe's employees are all bone in each other
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:25.060]   My daughter worked there for a year. I immediately said is that Trish? She said. Oh, yeah
[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:29.260]   That just
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:35.660]   There was a lot of a lot of stuff going on at the Clifton, New Jersey trader Joe's, but I didn't sense that well
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:43.400]   I think it's the lion shirts and just the vibe just the age group - I hire a lot of young people
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:48.820]   Anyway, I'm sorry to derail this what was a very highfalutin conversation
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.700]   We never got there
[00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:56.940]   All right, let's talk about talk about the week's
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.420]   Tech news
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:06.220]   There was a there was a lot happening this week and I was unfortunately out of pocket for three days Jason how I produced her said
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.460]   Hey, Jason Del Rey's coming on and there's nothing
[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:15.180]   It's Saturday and there's nothing to talk about I said don't worry. I will be
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.300]   retroactively going through the news and
[00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.660]   in fact a lot of stuff happened, but I
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:24.060]   kind of wanted to put the Amazon and Walmart stuff up front because
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:28.540]   Jason is an expert on all of that Amazon
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:33.380]   I think the big story for Amazon this week is the EU is
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.820]   is mad
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:40.100]   Because they say Amazon Prime is using dark patterns
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.660]   Actually, I'm sorry the US the US it's us
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:50.780]   FTC robot and yeah, I row bus EU I get them all confused
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:56.140]   Okay, actually this is a liena cons FTC sewing Amazon over manipulative tactics
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.920]   Used to enroll millions in prime according to the Wall Street Journal
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:05.660]   Using dark patterns not so much to get you in but to make it hard to get out
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:11.140]   Unfortunately the filing the FTC filing was heavily redacted
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:14.860]   Did you look at it Jason oh I I
[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:20.820]   Attempted to yeah, there was more black than I don't know what but yes. Yeah, so
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:26.740]   Definitely an issue. I mean they are alleging you know in some cases, especially
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:30.540]   You know when someone thinks they're signing up for just prime video
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:35.900]   They're got kind of getting pushed in the direction of the more expensive prime offering and a couple other
[00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.940]   tricks and
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.460]   Other dark patterns using on the way in to get people signed up
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.340]   but then they were also alleging that the
[00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:48.300]   16 step
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:55.820]   cancellation process which Amazon has largely corrected I think the FTC alleging not until April this year so
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:15:01.020]   So yeah, that that was not necessarily the FTC
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:09.300]   Complaint that many people watching this dynamic were expecting but perhaps just the first of two with with
[00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:16.540]   something on the antitrust front coming eventually that we've been waiting I'm curious because I
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:24.420]   Think politically this might not be the first thing I would have filed as the FTC because I think people
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:28.620]   Correct me if I'm wrong. I think they like Amazon Prime. I mean I
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:32.820]   Didn't know people actually got the video service without the without the shipping service
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:37.100]   I thought the video service just kind of came for free with the shipping service because I've had the shipping service
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:41.300]   Like since it started - and then I got video and then I know I get video
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:46.620]   But if they killed that if they killed the video apart or separated out I wouldn't get it anymore
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:52.980]   I'd be like okay, whatever you get a lot you get Amazon Prime members get unlimited photo storage for free
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:59.700]   The delivery for the today delivery seems to be a little less
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:04.260]   Then it used to be right like I get mine on the same day
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.260]   Like I get mine on the same day. I get them
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:13.020]   The same day and sometimes it's two weeks from now and it's not clear what it's gonna be go ahead Jason explain that no
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:16.860]   No, I mean I've been trying to some parts of the US
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:21.660]   You know where I live now in New Jersey, you know overnight
[00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:26.260]   If you have a warehouse near you you get it right away, right? Which I do there's one in Napa
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:31.060]   Yeah, yeah, and we have we have one being built in our town, but we have many others
[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:35.220]   But in some parts of the country, I mean I had a piece on this last year
[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:39.060]   Two-day prime just sort of completely went away
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:42.940]   And the company's just not saying and it's not better than today
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:47.540]   It's it's become worse and actually had a former Amazonian logistics
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.860]   data analyst
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.780]   volunteer to do a little test and study for me and
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:17:00.340]   In some parts of Washington state and some other regions in the country just with the pandemic it kind of just went away for good
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:06.780]   But companies not I was never able to figure out exactly what's going on there, but for many people
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:13.300]   Like Alex is saying it Alex is saying it has gone faster. It's just it's kind of look of it's inconsistent
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:20.180]   They're living right and I definitely feels like it's it's it's a it's definitely a cost center for Amazon
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:23.140]   I don't know if they make money on
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:30.460]   Prime and they certainly are trying to push you to for instance delivery day saying oh everything comes on Monday
[00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.620]   It all comes on Monday. That'll save you gas and stuff
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:42.580]   So I do like that. It is the if you aren't rushing to get your item. That is the most environmentally friendly way to go about it
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:47.220]   Yeah, especially the order multiple items a week. I didn't know this
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:55.980]   Amazon package at the door every day. It's not just me. It's a family worth
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:02.500]   My man says Amazon Prime includes grub hub free delivery. Who knew that I didn't it does I need that
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.500]   So we've been doing that
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:10.780]   My point is that politically I don't know if people are gonna support attacking Amazon Prime because I think
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:17.020]   Yeah, it's hard to get or used to be hard to cancel it, but most people never cancel it
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.620]   Well, I mean I yeah
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.980]   I think it's so part like and I think that the lock-in for Amazon is on the other side too
[00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:26.780]   Like you go to Whole Foods and you drop off your your stuff you don't want and that at first
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:30.380]   I was like how does this make them money because they asked you not to even put the box put them back in the box
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:34.100]   You know, they're not going back on you know, they say don't put them in the box. Just bring them over
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:39.660]   Yeah, no, no, they don't throw them out. I actually had a conversation with someone about this. It's in our it's an
[00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:43.980]   Put them in a giant bin and they ship it to Amazon where they throw it out
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:51.460]   No, no, they they there's a box at at Whole Foods and they scan them and throw them in scan them throw them in
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:58.020]   It'll never come out of that box. It goes to it goes to a bot it goes somewhere and people get people who sell stuff on
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.820]   Yeah, they get told what's in it
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.980]   I'm told what the condition is but they're told like hey
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:06.140]   There's a whole bunch of stuff in here and then and this is the price of the box like you take it
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:09.140]   You know, you know, you know and then they go and they buy it and it's it's a frack
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:14.420]   I mean it's pennies on the dollar, but that's a good way to recycle it. That's better than any cell it's burning it and causing cancer
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:18.700]   Yeah, they're no they're selling it back into they're injecting it back into eBay and then letting people do whatever they're gonna
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.340]   Do with it, but people get to see what's in it because they scanned it. It's a very efficient system
[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:26.500]   But I was still like they're losing a lot of money. They're not there's you know, that's it felt like
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:30.700]   But I realized no way to make money in returns. You're gonna wait or save money
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:38.940]   This is gonna cost you huge, but what I realized is I am super resistant to buying anything that's on Amazon anywhere else because if I buy it
[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.420]   Right, I know that I can just take it the whole foods
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:42.780]   I'm gonna go pick up my arugula
[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:47.100]   Yeah, and I can I get and I can I just hate drop it off and move on and I'm like oh
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:54.500]   I'm gonna ask Jason, but my guess is Amazon does a lot of these things that seem like a very good idea in the early stage of
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:59.300]   Inshitification when they were trying to build their customer base, but late stage Amazon
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:05.100]   These are cost centers that they would love to get rid of Jason. Am I right? Yeah, they've been they've been I mean they've
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:12.620]   They've given us this convenience, but you're right it has become you know problematic as they scale and so you see you know
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.780]   we do UPS drop off for free in our town and
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:21.220]   No packaging nothing although my wife actually will package stuff up just to get rid of
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:27.500]   The cardboard all the cardboard that we have and I don't know if that's doing anything better for the environment, but
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.820]   She likes to think it is
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:35.620]   But now they're experimenting with charging charging again a dollar for UPS drop offs or you know
[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.620]   We have we have a big delivery
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:41.660]   If we bring it to Coles, it's free, but if we bring it to UPS now
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:48.380]   It's gonna be seven bucks and so they are you know the return logistics is is super costly and I think they're still
[00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:54.460]   They're still trying to sort it now as they cut costs in other areas. Yes, it's it's expensive
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:58.340]   But but is it like like Alex was saying? I mean it's such a locking just to
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.420]   know
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.420]   You can order 77
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:05.180]   variations
[00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:10.940]   I was trying to figure out long USB C cables for my little cameras and and I just bought like four sets
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:15.620]   People like just like just four different different versions and then I just took three sets and I gave them back
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:19.900]   I'm like I was like that. These don't work. I mean last I'm not proud to admit this but last night
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.020]   I couldn't find my ethernet adapter and
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:29.420]   For overnight delivery any other show. Thank you. Yeah, so I bought two
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:33.020]   right and just get the ones that I sure and
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:38.860]   They hit the minimum and right and want to go back tomorrow, right? Wow
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:44.340]   I could do a little pattern recognition for us on the dark patterns issue
[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:51.060]   You guys will remember that the FTC also came after Epic Games for that and they
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:55.780]   ultimately settled that complaint for two hundred and forty five million dollars
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:22:01.980]   About explain it. What is the dark patterns that they're talking by the way Vonage Vonage paid a hundred million
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:05.340]   Do same thing how hard it was to cancel?
[00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:10.820]   Always you let me read makes it the dark pattern or they let me let me read you the complaint
[00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:15.240]   Or part of it the part that we can see underneath the black marker from the Wall Street Journal
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:21.300]   The complaint alleged that Amazon used quote manipulative coercive or deceptive
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:29.380]   User interface designs known as dark patterns and quote to dupe users into automatically renewing prime subscriptions
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:35.540]   Amazon leadership slowed or rejected changes that would have made it easier for users to cancel prime
[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:40.980]   Because those changes adversely affected Amazon's bottom line. They talk about
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:46.580]   How many clicks to to get Amazon Prime which is a couple?
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:55.760]   Compared to how many clicks at least until April to cancel Amazon Prime which was a four page six click 15 option
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:01.900]   cancellation process Amazon internally called the Iliad flow in
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:06.980]   A reference to Homer's endless Trojan War story
[00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:11.320]   The agency said the quote labyrinthine
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:17.260]   Procedure and quote was designed to make a cumbersome and confusing for customers to cancel prime
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:22.100]   So go ahead Denise explain to us what are dark patterns and why are they wrong?
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:29.380]   Dark patterns you see them every day. They are every time you have you come to a decision point that
[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:36.820]   involves commerce usually or or involves some sort of giving up of your rights or
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.820]   Turn
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:47.460]   Yes, or we're gonna give you a whole bunch of pages you can't actually find the button right right
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:54.220]   So the EU actually cracked down on that and you you may have noticed there's been a shift in all those GDPR
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:24:01.940]   Cookie warnings that you're getting where it used to be that they could default you to opting in to all the data collection
[00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:08.780]   Etc. Now they have to default you to opting out and you have to affirmatively check that you're gonna opt in
[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:13.340]   Because the EU also like our FTC is no fan of this practice
[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:17.700]   So it's that it's when there's a big colored button that
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:24.260]   makes it attractive and you almost you know rush to go click that and there's something
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:29.480]   Small or grayed out or white or whatever that is your eye doesn't go right
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:38.740]   Microsoft does this when you're gonna buy windows or upgraded windows 11 big colorful button that says yes and then
[00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:44.380]   Barely discernible because it's gray on white or something. It says or you can just not
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:50.420]   But we don't please right you know those are so we've all experienced dark patterns like crazy
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:56.340]   But the FT is the is this a new trend that the FTC's cracking down on these
[00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:59.860]   Seems to be I didn't know about Vonage. So that's three
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:08.020]   There's there's definitely been there's definitely been other cases in in e-commerce or online retail for sure and so
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:10.780]   Good
[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:15.140]   I mean, it is good. This is so people love Amazon Prime. Well, that's yes
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:15.860]   See that's the thing
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.740]   I don't know politically if it's if everybody's gonna say oh yay
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:22.300]   Finally the FTC's cracking down on Amazon Prime
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:26.580]   It was you know, it was the same problem with zero rating back in the day when
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:34.100]   Telecom companies would not charge you bandwidth costs for certain streaming services
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:38.580]   Which to a consumer is hey, that's great. What's wrong with that?
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:45.540]   But if you're a competing streaming service that doesn't get that it's like see they're putting their thumb on the scale
[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:48.060]   very hard to tell consumers
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:55.740]   This isn't good for you. I've tried to explain zero why zero rating is bad for gears and it's with little success
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:26:03.180]   Here's the website deceptive dot design. I've referred to many times. This is I love it is a
[00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:07.020]   Hall of shame of dark patterns and
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:10.180]   There are a lot of them
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:16.620]   There are a lot of them in fact 24 for Google 20 for Facebook 17 for Amazon 12 for Microsoft
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:23.220]   The the Trump campaign has nine LinkedIn has eight Instagram has eight Apple seven and
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:29.180]   That's just what's in the Hall of shame. This is a great site if you're confused about why dark patterns are a bad thing
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:32.140]   and apparently there are you know
[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:37.380]   Federal laws against dark patterns in the US as in the EU
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:45.140]   I I think there are laws against deceptive practices, right? That's why this is called deceptive dot design not dark patterns. Yeah
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:50.900]   Yeah, yes, I think this is as a as an iPhone user why I'm so attached to the iPhone stores
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.300]   Because I can always cancel all my subscriptions
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:56.060]   I can see where they all are and just go no no no no no no no no no
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:01.700]   And the idea of it getting me having to deal with like how figuring out where I was subscribed to what?
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.820]   I'm not excited about
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:07.100]   Denise also you probably interested in this
[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:13.500]   Epic games this is also from deceptive dot design epic games paid two hundred forty five million dollars
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.620]   Yeah to settle charges. They were using deceptive patterns of fortnight
[00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:22.940]   our our sponsor noom the diet app paid sixty two million dollars to settle charges
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:26.340]   They were using deceptive patterns in their subscription and auto renewal process
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.940]   AT&T paid a hundred five million dollars
[00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:34.100]   This is all to the FTC to settle charges. They were adding unauthorized fees for services
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:39.940]   That's not a dark pattern exactly, but it's deceptive for sure and there's a long list of
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:45.340]   effective lawsuits in the EU and the US
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:52.660]   On this website. It's a good. It's a good source if you're you know wondering there were 90 total
[00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:57.940]   Decisions against companies for deceptive patterns
[00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:05.700]   Yeah, and you can imagine I mean the problem obviously it's a problem whenever you do it, but when you're targeting
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:10.980]   Young people and children. Yeah, and they're spending the family money
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:16.780]   That's particularly well if my kids want to subscribe to Amazon Prime Dammit. I'm gonna let them
[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:25.460]   It's good for all of us actually that's another thing Amazon Prime everybody in the family gets a benefit which makes it even harder to cancel
[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:32.580]   I know I once I canceled YouTube premium and man did I hear about it from the six family members
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:39.140]   We're all suddenly getting ads on their YouTube. I don't I don't even know how someone can watch YouTube without
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:44.460]   Had a for you have had a for so long and we I've had it where I've changed my credit card or something
[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:51.260]   So it goes off for a day and I am like it is my numbing like it's like how would you ever watch this content without turning
[00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.940]   May I introduce you to my 10 year old son?
[00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:59.020]   It's all the same
[00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:04.860]   He'll be beyond it
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:10.220]   Wants to buy a lot of the stuff he sees advertised on his on his all right. He is so best
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:15.460]   He is so basketball obsessed that frankly it is I don't hear about anything else
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:21.900]   I probably should occasionally watch over his shoulder though see what he's saying. Yeah, so he's watching basketball videos
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:29.820]   That's all interest all for now for now. So the real ones he wants to watch football in the fall YouTube is the
[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:37.020]   Exciting. Yeah as a Pittsburgh stealer down in San Francisco. I'm super excited about that because I can finally watch all the games
[00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:39.340]   Yeah, so as our unaccountably
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:44.860]   Addicted to the green Bay Packers 20 year old son. I don't understand how this happened
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:51.020]   But he will be able to watch I mean everybody knows that the Steelers and the Packers are the only cool apparently so okay
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:59.660]   Michael's going with Lisa and and his father to green Bay this fall to watch a Packers game and that'll be it's a
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:06.220]   Really cool. Yeah. Yeah, I worked it. I worked up the green Bay game. It was really cold
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.980]   That's all I can remember like I can't feel my thing. Well, there is a debate in the family
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:15.500]   I say they should go in December or January where you get the real fan experience and ideally as a packer fan
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:21.200]   He'd paint himself half gold half green and take off his shirt in the 40 below weather for the real
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:27.740]   Lambo and if it's snowing extra points anyway back to the FTC
[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.740]   Uh
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:35.340]   What are their odds
[00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:42.540]   What so lina con has really this was her the promise made when biden nominated her chairman of the ftc
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:47.180]   She had already written as a professor. It was at harvard, uh, you know
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:54.300]   No, he's a student. Uh, yell. Yeah, yeah, oh phd student right or law school. Okay written a number of
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:31:00.780]   anti big tech, uh articles in the law review. Um, so we kind of knew what we were gonna get
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.340]   Greater
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:07.180]   Denise greater performance so far. She's certainly been fairly aggressive
[00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:11.020]   Uh, you want to let her grade? I
[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:15.260]   That's tough. I think we have to let this play out a little bit more
[00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:18.700]   See yes, that's a good point until we know whether it succeeds
[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.860]   Yeah
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:23.740]   Uh, but as far as I mean she she seems to be
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:28.460]   Um very aggressive particularly on
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:32.700]   uh, the question of child online safety and
[00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:35.340]   I mean
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:37.340]   It's hard to argue with the fact that
[00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:41.820]   We could use some help in that regard, but I just don't know that
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.700]   lina con and the ftc
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:53.020]   Are sophisticated enough about how to implement and enforce she's been in office exactly two years since 2015
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:55.980]   Um
[00:31:55.980 --> 00:32:02.620]   She has a three nothing majority on the ftc. Let's not forget that she's also got a commission
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:07.020]   Uh, but the republicans haven't not haven't filled out their three seats
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:10.140]   so, um
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:12.940]   I think she's been aggressive
[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:14.700]   Tim woo
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:20.940]   Says she's doing the stuff congress should be doing taking on privacy non competes and ai
[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:24.300]   Um
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:29.980]   She's rebooted the anti-trust law, right brought it back into prominence. There was no very little
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:31.180]   lady trust
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.900]   Action in the last 10 years under republican presidents, right?
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:38.300]   Yeah, and abama. I should point out didn't do much either
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:44.380]   If the alternative is to leave it to congress to do these things then you know
[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:49.500]   US chamber of commerce says uh, she's trying to ruin american business
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:54.700]   and entrepreneurship with owners and unfair rules, okay
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:33:02.140]   Um, she's she's not alone though. I mean she's hand in glove with the EU and
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:04.220]   california
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:09.660]   And some other states that they're did you know there are now 144
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:16.460]   Pending proposed child online safety laws in the united states almost all of them various states
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:22.460]   That though, right? I you got me. I haven't read all the california laws
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:26.060]   No, no, but the i'm sure they're based on the california law, which was
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:33.500]   Uh, I think not a not a good direction to go and and and effective, but maybe i'm maybe i'm wrong
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:34.860]   I don't know
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.860]   This is the problem with government regulation
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:40.140]   I am not anti-regulation by any means
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:45.100]   But there's always this risk that the government will be slow and heavy-handed
[00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:48.700]   And misunderstand the problem. I don't think that the government is
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:53.820]   Is capable of it to be honest and I think the problem isn't so much they don't care or that they're wrong
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:56.380]   It's just the to what danish was kind of talking
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:59.020]   I don't know if they have the tools to do this well like I don't think that they have
[00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:04.380]   And when you when it has to go through that process it's it may look like a scalpel when you started talking
[00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:07.260]   But by the time you get you know by the time it becomes law
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:13.100]   It's a dull broadsword that you're just swinging around and it you know and I think that that's the real the real problem with a lot
[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:16.780]   Of these things. I think that we have to think about what's safe for kids something
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:23.580]   Obviously if you look at the data something obviously is going wrong like something is going horribly wrong and it starts at about 2013
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:30.780]   And the and then the you know depression starts spiking all you know all kinds of problems have happened because of online
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:36.540]   Access, we don't know exactly. I don't think anybody knows there's other communities. I mean there's a lot of discussion about that
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:42.460]   No one really understands the math of what it is because it's not clear whether it's facebook or it's twitter
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:45.260]   Just messages, you know like like just going back and forth
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:49.180]   But but there's something going wrong, but I don't know if the government is the
[00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:55.340]   Has the the apparatus, you know to actually make any meaningful change, you know, I think that's the problem
[00:34:55.340 --> 00:35:01.980]   And short of appointing leo dictator of all things tech policy, which I I think would be a grand idea
[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:06.860]   No, because I'd be frozen. I'd be frozen in an action not knowing
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:09.260]   What should we do?
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:13.580]   Because I understand both sides. I think you want to encourage innovation
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:16.860]   Uh sometimes that means antitrust regulations so that
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:21.740]   New companies can sprout up, but sometimes it means you punish the innovators
[00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:25.740]   In a way that discourages other innovators. It's very very difficult
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:32.380]   And our legal process is so messy that the latest iteration of the california privacy law you were referring to leo
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:36.380]   Uh is coming to us courtesy of a valid proposition
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:42.220]   Right amended the privacy law. So the courts got involved in that so that got amended and
[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:44.060]   It's great
[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:51.820]   Well, and I think I think sometimes we I think one thing we oftentimes mix miss with regulation is regulations very hard to manage
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:57.180]   Tort is actually really effective. So companies being afraid of being sued
[00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:03.100]   Actually often makes more change than companies, you know when you start suing companies for things that they're not doing
[00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:07.980]   So sometimes I think that the government needs to think about not so much regulation but taking away protections
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:12.700]   Like hey, we're not going to protect you for doing the things that you're doing and we're going to let people sue you for it
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:15.820]   And I think that one of the things that and I'm going to
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:18.700]   I come from family lawyers
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:20.940]   So that a trial lawyer we might add right
[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:24.540]   But when you you know like the the when you
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:29.660]   You look at like the one that most people make fun of is the mcdonald's suit about the hot coffee
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:32.540]   Yeah, hot coffee, but when you get into the details of it
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:36.540]   It is a completely reasonable thing that the the jury came up with which is
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:39.980]   I think it was one day of coffee, you know like the cost the
[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:46.060]   How much mcdonald's makes on one day of coffee because they won't make the they won't make the water a little
[00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:48.620]   It's literally, you know a little bit
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:54.940]   Cooler because they think that because it'll last longer, you know, so so that's so they've decided that that's just the way they're going to do it
[00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:57.020]   They had they had tons of things ahead of times
[00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:02.700]   But what happens is is that people start lawsuits force people to start thinking about force companies
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:07.100]   To start thinking about it. So I think the real problem we get into is when we start limiting torts
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:12.140]   You know and saying you can't sue for a lot of money. You can't cause real pain for corporations
[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:16.300]   Um, then I think because I think that's a much more of a scalpel
[00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:20.540]   Than government regulation, which is that when someone's doing something stupid
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:24.140]   Um, you can it's going to be get really expensive and when they have to write that big check
[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:27.420]   They have to make and you know, someone goes back and says let's not do that again
[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:31.100]   You know and and that's the I think that that's one of the things I think you still need regulation
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.180]   But I think sometimes in the finer details of things
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:37.740]   Um, you know because I know a lot of companies that spend a lot of time not doing things
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:40.300]   Not because that there's a law. It's just they don't want to get sued
[00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:42.700]   You know like, you know
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:47.580]   Alex the problem with that is if you take that to its logical conclusion
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:51.260]   You do away with section 230 of the communications decency act
[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:54.620]   Because a lot of these companies are protected from
[00:37:54.620 --> 00:38:00.460]   Tort actions by that law and that's you know, and I don't I don't again. I think it's a balance
[00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:01.980]   I don't think it's I don't think it's an all or one
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:06.380]   I think but when I when we look at some of these things because I I am a huge proponent of 230
[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:10.380]   Yeah, so I think that 230 should not be messed with I don't think it's perfect
[00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:13.100]   I think it's broken, but I don't think we should touch it because
[00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:18.300]   If we pull one little pin out of that we have no idea what's going to happen to what we're doing
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:21.420]   So I completely agree with you there. I don't think that torch are the only answer
[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:23.420]   I just think that sometimes they come in and they start
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:27.980]   Um making things that they can handle things sometimes when we think about regulation
[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:30.700]   I think sometimes we have to think about that process as well
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:36.540]   There's something in the rundown that that tackles this head on it's that after babble
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:41.580]   Why hate and schmitz proposed social media forums. That's a great story. That's a great story
[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:45.260]   Yeah, I want to take a little break before we get to that, but that is a great story
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:51.900]   I do want to wrap up the lina con report card because axios pro had a very interesting article this week about this
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:57.980]   uh on the negative the ftc which went after metas acquisition of uh within
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:01.740]   met the ftc gave up and said all right fine
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:08.700]   Uh, and we're going to cover this but more recently if you've been watching the testimony in the activation blizzard
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:16.940]   Administrative law case it has not been going well for I believe for the ftc's case. They're trying to block the acquisition
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:21.100]   Um that will be interesting to watch that
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:24.220]   Uh, and then axios points out
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:30.620]   Yes, she's two years in but she may only have two more years because we've got a presidential election in 2024. So
[00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:34.860]   Uh, this stuff takes a long time and she may not have enough time to
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:37.420]   Finish her job. I think
[00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:40.300]   I think my biggest complaint with her is that she doesn't have any life experience
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:45.820]   Like like she's just she's never been young you sound like an old man. Alex. I don't mean young
[00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:50.540]   Look at her schedule when has she actually looked in commerce? Yeah, she's she's an academic
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:54.780]   She has no she you know and academics very rarely understand how companies run
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:59.660]   You know and so I think that she's getting a mixture of being heavy handed in places that she doesn't understand
[00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:04.540]   And also losing because as soon as you start unwrapping this you realize so this is really complicated
[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:10.540]   You know and so and that's what an ap what happened to an academic when they get into into actual production is like they open it up
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:12.780]   And they're like oh this was so simple when I was writing a book
[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:15.260]   Jason. Yeah, like you know, I like her. She read her
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:22.540]   Her essay in the Yale law school amazon's antitrust paradox because it's right up your alley. Was it accurate?
[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:30.060]   I mean there was there was a to me a compelling argument that the framework we've been using
[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:33.660]   to establish
[00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.780]   antitrust wrongs
[00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:38.780]   in the last few decades
[00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:41.100]   Is not sufficient just kind of
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:45.420]   Rain in some of some of what might be problematic with the companies today, you know
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:50.620]   Just just back to the prime the prime case that that lawsuit that they just filed
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:56.380]   you know, what's interesting to me is and uh, someone saw someone commenting publicly
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:58.860]   I'm forgetting his name and this is going to sound like a
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:03.980]   Not nice way to describe his role, but basically he runs what's essentially a front front group for
[00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:06.380]   Amazon and google
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:11.980]   Policy but uh he was saying why you know, she could have just said she's they've settled with all these other companies
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:18.380]   Why didn't they just settle with amazon on this and um, I did wonder if while prime is really beloved
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:25.980]   If uh, she went after this first related to amazon because it's something more, you know, the average person can understand
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:28.620]   At least know that yeah, they at least know the name. Yeah, yeah
[00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:31.100]   but uh
[00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:35.900]   Yeah, I think it's too early to grade her, but I think I think there are fair concerns about um
[00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:38.620]   Some of the selections they've made so far
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:41.420]   Um, my big thing for me in my world is
[00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:50.620]   Does she get do they have the manpower to first of all really go through with a suit with this and then a separate antitrust suit?
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:51.660]   Um
[00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:56.940]   And will she have enough time? Right? Um, so always a product in the air still right
[00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:01.500]   Because every four years there's a new president off in the new f tc chair
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:07.180]   Uh, and often a new power party in power and they reverse each other back and forth
[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:12.300]   Back and forth. Um, I agree with you, Alex about uh tort law maybe being
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:19.900]   Something it's a necessary corrective. I worry. It's not a replacement. It's just that it's you know
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:23.340]   I don't want to make it sound like I think that we should get rid of all regulation and no but understand
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:27.900]   There are there are companies who say well, well, I've got to stop that we can need tort reform
[00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:33.740]   And we need to stop regulation. They want to take all the tools away, right? And uh, and and I think
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:39.260]   Maybe I don't have an opinion on lina com, but I do think it's about time we somebody
[00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:47.500]   At least said big tech is running ramp and unchecked. Maybe we should look at this. I mean look we're technology
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:51.740]   Podcast I based my entire career covering tech
[00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:56.940]   Uh, I like tech. I think we get a lot of benefit from big tech
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:00.860]   I don't think there's any company in the world except apple that could have created the vision pro
[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:03.980]   I mean, there's a certain value to size
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:08.540]   But at the same time there's a huge valued innovation and competition
[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:13.260]   And I believe in that too. So that's why it's this is such a challenge, right?
[00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:18.140]   It's it and government seems like not an ideal tool. I mean, I'm glad to see government involved
[00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:22.620]   You know, they should say something if you see something say something
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:26.940]   But whether that'll be enough to be effective. I don't know at least it'll raise people's awareness
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:31.420]   You know, if nothing else people now looking at well, if I wanted to cancel prime, what would I have to do?
[00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:34.860]   Is prime still most the problem with prime is
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:37.500]   Nobody ever thinks about it
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:41.020]   Like i'm yeah, just every year. I'm gonna renew. I'm sure it's worth it
[00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:47.740]   Well, and I and I think that there's something's just the government showing people what's going on like I think a california law that makes a lot of sense
[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:50.220]   California makes a lot of bad laws
[00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:55.340]   But one of the good laws that they do make is you have to show the calories for everything that you're selling at a restaurant
[00:43:55.340 --> 00:44:00.380]   And I got to tell you there's things that I look at that I used to I used to think we're healthy and I look at it like whoa
[00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:05.500]   I'm not gonna eat that anymore. You know, they didn't have to go ahead. You just feel bad though. Oh, no, no
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:11.660]   It is definitely made significant changes of of my behavior based on
[00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:18.380]   Yeah, on looking at food and just going that's the salaries. Yeah, if nothing else, you know, like in that's the value, right?
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:24.380]   But I think that's that's very valuable and I think that should be nation. I mean, I think that just doing those kinds of things where you really
[00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:27.660]   Show people like what's actually happening there?
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:34.780]   I think makes is where the government can be very effective is research and and publishing information information. Yeah, all right
[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:38.220]   We got to take a break. I want to come back. We have lots more to talk about great panel here
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:45.500]   Alex lindsey, you know from Mac break weekly Denise howl, you know from this week in law and don't forget here say culture.com her new
[00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:51.580]   Podcasts coming and a new member of our panel great to have you Jason del ray
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:56.540]   his new book winner sells all is about the battle between amazon and
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:45:00.380]   Walmart and you know speaking of exposing
[00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:05.660]   Information we weren't aware of there is a lot of interesting juice about walmart in here
[00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:08.620]   And how seriously they took the amazon threat
[00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:12.300]   That's right or or how
[00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:19.740]   They didn't take it very seriously until they did right until they did and now and now the last five to seven years
[00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:24.860]   They they're starting to move pretty aggressively to the to the point that
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:31.180]   No longer at least in my opinion a laughing stock in digital, right? Which um they weren't for about two
[00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:34.380]   I remember them buying jet calm and just
[00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:42.300]   Not just just destroying it basically not that it had much promise to begin. Yeah, it's there's there's a whole bunch of
[00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:44.380]   on that in the book and um
[00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:52.380]   And then the clashes between that leadership team and the old guard at walmart who to be fair had a very difficult job
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:56.460]   grinding profits out of those super centers and uh
[00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:02.060]   And did not look fondly upon mark glory just uh, especially admitting publicly
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:04.380]   They make the money and I spend it
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:07.020]   Probably not probably doesn't go over well in arkansas
[00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:10.620]   Mark glory was the founder of jet calm right that's correct
[00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:14.620]   Yeah, and when they bought him he became a power broker within the walmart
[00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:21.660]   I'd love your story about sam waltin who's dying and discovering how much the hospital is charging him for an mri
[00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:27.020]   Saying the walmart leadership team. We gotta do something about the health care costs
[00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:29.340]   uh
[00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:34.940]   That was I mean, yeah, they um, there's a lot of what would sam do uh
[00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:41.820]   Sticks spoken about inside that company. I have to say probably because i'm a uh, a metro
[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:43.500]   sexual
[00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:45.740]   That's probably didn't come out right but because i'm a metro
[00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:53.260]   Politent type guy i'm team amazon right and I would guess that in rural markets team walmart for the most part, right?
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:57.660]   I mean amazon's everywhere now, but uh matter
[00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:01.260]   But I will tell you I visited uh
[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:06.220]   what walmart calls their home office and ville arkansas and uh
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:14.220]   It it ranks top 10 for places to raise a family in the us almost every year now it is it is we have
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:16.860]   unique place but
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:20.860]   a pretty cool uh regular panelists and our show phil libin who was the founder of ever note
[00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:23.660]   Oh, yeah last time he was on he said i moved to petenville
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:26.300]   It's the best place in the world
[00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:28.460]   He loves petenville
[00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:32.380]   He talks about all the new restaurants that are opening up because it's getting gentrified
[00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:36.220]   It is uh the waltin family's just pouring
[00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:40.380]   I want to I was going to say billions, but maybe not billions but a lot
[00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:46.940]   Of money into that that place including a 350 million dollar new walmart campus
[00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:51.100]   The uh my friend compared it to pleasant ville
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:57.420]   Yeah, I think it's pleasant ville, isn't it? Yeah, um, phil libin
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:01.980]   Uh, has built uh their company headquarters in this really cool
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:06.220]   Um building in benton ville really is very interesting

[00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:04.780]   Oh leo told me to say twit. I saw it on twit
[00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:09.740]   Denise howl Alex Lindsey Jason del racers. We're talking about
[00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:12.620]   lena com we should probably talk about
[00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:14.940]   the activation
[00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:17.500]   hearings the microsoft activation acquisition
[00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:21.260]   Testimony began this weekend and wow
[00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:25.500]   Don't think it's going well for the ftc
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:31.740]   Among other things revealed now. It's not a trial right there's an administrative judge. So it's more like a hearing
[00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:37.900]   But the judge will decide if if the action to block the acquisition goes forward
[00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:46.060]   Uh, here's this from the verge tom warren. I guess is in the courtroom. We're only minutes into the hearing
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:48.940]   We've already had a bombshell revelation
[00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:53.180]   Jim ryan of playstation says
[00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:57.180]   blocking the acquisition isn't about exclusives
[00:50:57.180 --> 00:51:02.940]   According to sony. That's all it's about according to a newly unsealed email within internal email
[00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:05.580]   Uh
[00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:07.740]   Microsoft's lawyers reveal the exchange between
[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:13.180]   Uh, playstation chief jim ryan and chris dering former ceo of sony computer entertainment
[00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:17.580]   ryan said in the email quote. It's not an exclusivity play at all
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:20.940]   They're thinking bigger than that
[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:22.620]   And they have the cash to make moves like this
[00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:27.180]   I've spent a fair amount of time with both phil spencer and bobby kotok over the past dam pretty sure
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:31.980]   We'll continue to see call duty on playstation for many years to come. Oh no
[00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:39.100]   As as my lawyer as my internet lawyer, Denise you probably would advise me not to put thoughts like that in writing
[00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:42.460]   Uh, yes, please don't
[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:45.020]   Discoveries a bitch
[00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:46.380]   Yeah, um
[00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:48.540]   This kind of undermines sony's
[00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:53.980]   Entire case in which they're saying well, you know, we're worried about call of duty leaving our platform
[00:51:53.980 --> 00:52:01.260]   Uh, and by the way, microsoft has said again and again phil spencer signed a deal saying we'll give it to you for 10 years guaranteed
[00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:04.940]   Um
[00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:09.100]   And it's hard for them to say that they're gonna give it guaranteed like what if sony changes the rules, you know, like
[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:11.500]   And which has been brought well, that's they have a contract
[00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:15.340]   Hey, do we know what this is what for 10 years or this is what the deal is right?
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:18.460]   Right if they do that absolutely because they have to see try to press
[00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:21.260]   Hey, are you going to like are you prom?
[00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:25.260]   Well, I mean promising that that's our goal and they said they're trying to press down on the goal and they're like well
[00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:29.260]   If they change the rules, we're not gonna make everything available. Like, but that's not gonna make sense
[00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:31.660]   So so I think that that's like a side
[00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:34.380]   I do find this one to be a little bit
[00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:36.060]   digging a little
[00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:38.060]   Deep, you know for the ftc
[00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:41.180]   Like this one was like the EU has already approved it
[00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:49.100]   Uh, japan the EU proves it it's kind of like okay. Well, japan where sony's headquartered has approved it
[00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:53.100]   uh, the only other person blocking it right now is the uk
[00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:59.900]   And they and they chose a very interesting tech they said not so much that was a cons about the console wars
[00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:03.180]   But it was about the future of cloud gaming
[00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:08.940]   Whose future I might add is pretty cloudy after google pulled out with stadia
[00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:13.260]   Mike as sony doesn't really have a strong play in cloud
[00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:17.660]   Uh, I don't and it's not a big market for microsoft either at this point
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:21.980]   So the uk's kind of out and left field on this
[00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:24.140]   um
[00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:28.300]   Among other test of money at this at this hearing it's really kind of fascinating
[00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:30.940]   Phil spencer was pressed
[00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:35.900]   to kind of for a long time microsoft said no, it's a three
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:38.700]   player game there's
[00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:41.340]   Xbox playstation and nintendo's switch
[00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:44.140]   A lot of people say the switch is not a console
[00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:48.380]   Uh microsoft would like it to be a console because if it is then they're number three
[00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:50.860]   in the market
[00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:55.500]   at some point they got uh, they got spencer to agree that uh
[00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:59.260]   That microsoft was losing the console wars
[00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:01.580]   Which is
[00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:06.140]   Ftcs lawyer asked uh spencer has as microsoft lost the console wars
[00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:11.980]   Spencer paused for 10 seconds again from tambourin in the verge to gather his thoughts
[00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:15.100]   And said I thought a very a very
[00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:17.900]   judicious statement
[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:20.140]   And the verge decided to put it right next to his picture
[00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:25.180]   As the console wars is a social construct with the community
[00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:28.380]   I would never want to count our community out
[00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:31.260]   They're big fans
[00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:36.300]   If you look at our market share in the console space over the last 20 plus years
[00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:39.020]   We're in third place
[00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:41.900]   He didn't want to say we've lost, but he didn't want to say we've won
[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:50.220]   That first sentence that that's a real quote. Yeah as the get this. Okay. Can you imagine this? This is well
[00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:57.580]   Yeah, this is this is the quote from the verge as the console wars is a social construct with the community
[00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:01.900]   I would never want to count our community out there big fans
[00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:08.860]   That's doubles that's corporate doublespeak if I ever he's just saying I don't want to say we lost but we're at third
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:12.460]   Like and third is still making money like I think that's what he's trying to say
[00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:16.140]   Third is still a profitable place to be it's just that so it's not like a
[00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:21.260]   Because lost is that that becomes the headline, you know across many things as much as you try
[00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:25.420]   I think it's still the headline at the verge has xbox really lost the console wars
[00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:28.060]   Well, but I think that I think Microsoft
[00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:33.340]   I mean one of the things we have to look at is Microsoft has mentioned that what they're really interested in or what they may be interested in
[00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:35.180]   Is the mobile market mobile of which?
[00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:39.420]   Activation is actually a sizable player and Microsoft is not a player at all, you know
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:44.620]   And so there you know, so Mike I think activation is like the sixth sixth largest in sales
[00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:51.580]   Well behind apple ten cent alphabet sony net ease. I don't know even know what net ease does but but it's um
[00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:57.100]   So but so but but activation is is sitting at number six or seven and
[00:55:57.100 --> 00:55:59.660]   Net ease is I think that's not any means
[00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:05.260]   Uh, yeah competitor and ten cent being like 30 percent of you know, I mean a huge percent or 17 percent of the market
[00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:07.980]   Right, uh or maybe not 30 percent of the market
[00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:13.660]   How the activation deal could help xbox consoles. This is the transcript ftc
[00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:17.100]   If the microsoft is going to grow particularly in a business like console
[00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:23.260]   It can grow by taking sure from its competitors. Spencer says there is no console growth in this deal
[00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:30.460]   ftc yeah, they're not so so the thing is is they're not so the fdc is trying to say they're trying to take control of consoles and micro
[00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:33.660]   Microsoft's not even interested in contest like they're like it's mobile
[00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:37.740]   That's what he's saying. He's like we're interested in mobile. We're interested in cloud. We're interested in these other things
[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:39.980]   They're not even playing the console war anymore
[00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:43.900]   They have everybody has what they have and they're gonna they're gonna support it and keep on making money at it
[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:48.620]   But there's that's not that's not what microsoft. That's not why microsoft bot activation and blizzard
[00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:52.060]   Uh, they acquired zenie max
[00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:54.620]   Uh
[00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:57.740]   Because sony had done an exclusive deal for two big
[00:56:57.740 --> 00:57:02.060]   Zeni max games death loop and ghost war and they were very concerned about starfield
[00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:04.940]   Which is now by the way, there's a lot of buzz about it's about to come out
[00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:10.380]   When we heard this is again spencer when we heard that starfield was potentially also going to skip xbox
[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:15.900]   We can't be in a position as a third place console where we fall farther behind on content ownership
[00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:19.260]   We bought zenie max to stay viable in the business
[00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:24.220]   They thought about buying zinga to get into mobile good thing. They didn't
[00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:27.900]   But they thought about it
[00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:33.500]   I think this is when I hope the judge it's up to this administrative judge. I hope the judge is hearing this and says
[00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:35.660]   Yeah, no sony
[00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:36.700]   No
[00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:38.700]   This was just an anti-competitive measure
[00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:43.660]   Uh, even your own country japan has as approved the the acquisition let it go through
[00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:48.220]   I mean, I don't have an opinion. I don't care whether microsoft gets activation or not, but
[00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:51.020]   um, just thought it was
[00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:55.020]   It's kind of don't commit it to writing if you don't want it to show up in discovery
[00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:57.900]   I I tell Lisa that all the time
[00:57:57.900 --> 00:58:00.940]   No, I don't
[00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:04.540]   Uh
[00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:05.500]   All right
[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:09.660]   I think we can uh, we can move on from the federal trade commission
[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:17.980]   Prime day is coming up july 11th and 12th. How important is prime day to uh to amazon Jason
[00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:22.540]   Huge to the company's top line. I mean, uh
[00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:25.980]   Christmas in uh
[00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:29.660]   What month is it in this year july keeps changing july july again? Okay
[00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:33.820]   They had it they moved to october during the pandemic at some point now
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:42.300]   There's another event in october. I mean, it's important. It's a revenue booster. Um, I think this year might be the first year that uh
[00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:47.900]   Third party that's right sellers who have the buy with prime button can
[00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:54.620]   Can now offer deals on their own site? Um, that I mean, this isn't a side
[00:58:54.620 --> 00:58:59.980]   But the you know that little side battle between amazon and shopify which um
[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:03.180]   You are you're as interesting. So somebody asked you
[00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:05.980]   Because you were talking about the competitive
[00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:09.500]   Space and like nobody's a winner forever walmart
[00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:12.700]   Nobody thought walmart would beat beat but they did get beat by amazon
[00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:19.100]   And so somebody asked you I thought a good question who's going to beat amazon and I was surprised to hear you say shopify possibly
[00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:24.140]   Well, you know, I look at the landscape and for a couple years. I thought maybe
[00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:31.740]   Maybe insta cart really moves aggressively outside of gursaries and they come at it from the last mile and then work backwards and then
[00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:34.700]   um, we'll see but uh
[00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:43.420]   Shopify is one. I think in the software realm that has been interesting to me now they thought they would become a logistics company as well and they
[00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:46.300]   bought a robotics company and
[00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:53.660]   A warehouse warehouse and company and they just offloaded all that uh at a loss. So that didn't really work but
[00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:58.940]   Smart folks and they have a lot of allies in the small and medium size, you know
[00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:08.620]   uh online retailing community but but that was the that was just one and and then uh tiknok tiktok was another one as tiktok this week launched their
[01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:11.740]   By with tiktok
[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:16.700]   Uh, that's really interesting. They in fact we were at vidcon and that they were pushing that
[01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:21.180]   That you could sell stuff on tiktok like you saw a video on tiktok
[01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:24.620]   Alex you said this for years. I remember you saying this 15 years ago
[01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:29.980]   That was just a matter of time before companies started making their own videos and in we were going to test r&d
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:35.260]   Yeah to to make it interactive to see we were doing r&d and i don't know 2002 2003
[01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:41.980]   Um to do to basically you're watching a video and you could click on multiple things theoretically and order any of them
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:44.540]   And not have and have it be completely seamless
[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:46.780]   I think that the challenge right now is the seamless part
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:52.300]   Is that you see something like that? I see a lot of things I have to admit I get a lot of ads on twitter that are related to hey
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:54.700]   Look at this cool thing and a couple of them are pretty tempting
[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:57.500]   But i'm like, please i can't order it
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:00.460]   No, but the thing is here, but here's the here's the amazon lock i look at it and go
[01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:02.780]   Oh, i'm not going to buy that if i can't buy it on amazon
[01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:05.580]   So a lot of times what i do for that item on amazon
[01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:09.660]   Me too i do and then i buy it through amazon and it comes down to the it just comes down to
[01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:12.700]   I don't want to give my credit card to somebody else and I want to know I can return it
[01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:16.860]   Have you seen the you know like the ad on twitter on twitter for that
[01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:20.540]   Basically, it's a police baton that extends out
[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:25.420]   And they say it's great for camping least once a day. Yeah at least once a day lisa wants to buy one
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:27.740]   For a long time she doesn't need that but
[01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:30.940]   They there's been around for i don't know since i was a kid
[01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:35.420]   It's a police baton it's an extendable thing that you can't police be people with
[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:38.140]   Yeah, yeah, they have them please put them on their on their thing there on the back
[01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:40.940]   These ones i don't i doubt are quite as robust but they
[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:43.820]   You could drive a truck on it. I know i saw it on twitter
[01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:47.420]   I don't know if that would really work with that one, but it would be interesting to see
[01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:53.420]   Think they're highly effective, but but the but the um but what I would say though is that is that the
[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:59.500]   You go in and again, that's a great example of they figured out what I will say is that the twitter ones have figured out how to
[01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:04.140]   Really just show you how a product works, which I think that is genius. I watch a lot of them mostly to go
[01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:09.420]   In five research. I understand in five seconds. I understand what that product is
[01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:16.700]   I understand what the solve is I understand what it does and it does it better than almost anything i've ever seen so from an education research
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:19.420]   education
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:22.620]   These are tick-tock videos basically on twitter for powerful
[01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:27.740]   Yeah, they're super powerful and everyone who does education should watch these ads because I look at them and I go
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:31.500]   Look at look at the edits are perfect. You know to show how this works. These are all I think
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:36.140]   I'm combining them and and I've started somebody told me last week. I think Ashley is get the
[01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:40.860]   I said I don't want to see that ad for the airplane that you can't break ever again
[01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:43.180]   It's just blocking. Oh my gosh. Just block it
[01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:47.660]   But then you look at the name comes out of southern this one is from poxo of the day
[01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:52.540]   And I know that that's a made-up AI generated name that if I block this one
[01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:55.420]   I'm gonna see the same damn ad again
[01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:57.420]   Right
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:59.420]   See and I enjoy them. I'm just like I'm always like
[01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:03.100]   Look at how they did that
[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:09.100]   Tick-tock absolutely had to do this to compete with instagram and I guess twitter
[01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:14.220]   I mean, I don't you guys are talking about twitter ads like you enjoy them. I don't lock them
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:17.420]   Yes, I do
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:21.100]   If they're not those video ads, I block them all I watch the video ads because I think they're interesting but I
[01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:23.420]   From a technical perspective
[01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:26.540]   Yeah, he's unique. Yeah, he's unique. Yeah
[01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:34.140]   Instagram has been doing this for for a while now where where you go by directing on your platform. Oh my god
[01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:39.020]   I'm wearing instagram underwear. I've got it all everything
[01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:42.300]   I am such a sucker except that instagram's mistake
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:47.820]   They've decided once I cross 65 that the only ads I'm gonna see are for erectile dysfunction ads
[01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:54.540]   So that's all I see now like every other ad is all I certainly hope that doesn't happen to me when that time comes
[01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:59.740]   I don't know what you're gonna get. I don't know you're probably gonna get ads for adult diapers or something
[01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:03.500]   It's very insulting. I have to say it's extremely insulting
[01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:09.820]   But do you ever click the thing where you tell it that's not relevant to me? Oh, see I don't know about this
[01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:12.860]   This stuff with that beat
[01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:21.020]   I don't know. See here's one do that every third every third thing on instagram is an ad now used to be every 10th picture
[01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:24.540]   Now it's everything I find the picture. I don't have an Instagram on my phone
[01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:29.980]   And I find it very cumbersome on the web so I I don't see a lot of ads on instagram benefits of testosterone
[01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:36.540]   I don't see it increased energy improve focus reduced fat stronger drive. Oh, that's what I need more testosterone
[01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:42.860]   I tell you though the existence of platforms like hey pal and apple pay
[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:47.740]   Counterman's that amazon lock-in problem
[01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:52.540]   Well, and I that's that's the answer the question that you were answering Jason. Yeah, maybe shopify
[01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:57.260]   But maybe tick-tock. I mean it's smart of tick-tock to do this right Denise. I mean this is
[01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:00.780]   Oh, yeah, they had to they call it project s
[01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:06.460]   They're experimenting with but this is the the twist selling their own products
[01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:11.180]   They want to become like she in right they want to sell their own
[01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:13.900]   Uh, and why not right?
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:16.780]   UK users have begun to see this is from financial times
[01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:21.340]   A new shopping feature within the tick-tock app called trendy beat
[01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:31.580]   You can tell a Chinese person wrote that right a section offering items that have proven popular on videos such as tools to extract earwax
[01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:34.140]   Or brush pet hair off clothing
[01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:41.500]   Have you seen the the pictures of the of Chinese influencers under a bridge on the side of the road?
[01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.500]   Oh, isn't that wild hundreds of
[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:44.860]   You know, this is a big business
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:48.780]   We when we think about like people doing these streams and selling things in china
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:57.260]   It is at a whole level that is hard to completely normal shopping behavior and and uh, yeah tick-tock's parent company
[01:05:57.260 --> 01:06:03.180]   I think uh the the the app there that is essentially tick-tock the original
[01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:09.900]   I think is selling something like 10 billion 10 billion items in in a year and a lot of it as you're saying through
[01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:12.780]   live streaming commerce, right and uh
[01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:17.100]   There's been a big bet that this is going to take off here eventually
[01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:24.460]   You know, amazon's made of you know trying their hand at it in different forms and um, I keep here in venture capitalist
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:27.020]   Tell me it's going to happen here as well, but um
[01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:32.460]   It's huge. I guess that's that's what's showing right now. Although I will say that amazon has largely been
[01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:38.780]   I think amazon live has not been very successful. No, anyone everybody I've talked to has said it's been kind of a dumpster fire for them
[01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:44.940]   It is there you know, i'm to me at least that was on to buying platform not a shopping platform. You're
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:53.740]   Exactly you're not you're not you know, that's a good distinction. That makes maybe a lot of people browse, but um, I don't i'm in and out
[01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:56.540]   minus the uh
[01:06:56.540 --> 01:07:02.060]   Deceptive patterns or trying to avoid the dark dark matter. I'm mixing. I'm mixing up all my terms here
[01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:05.740]   But that's fine. I remember leo you and I talked about this the last time I was on twit
[01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:09.580]   I went jason. I'm a i'm a in and out on amazon mostly
[01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:15.020]   And you said you're the opposite well when you go okay certain these when you go when you walk in down
[01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:16.220]   uh
[01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:21.740]   Down uh, abbot kenny and do you will you go which is the great?
[01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:28.300]   Beautiful cool shopping street in san moneka or uh venice right venice you go down abbot kenny
[01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:32.860]   Do you go into the stores and browse or do you walk by and walk by and walk by?
[01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:40.620]   Oh, I mean physical shopping is very different. Yeah me than online shopping. Yeah, you're a browser in that
[01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:44.540]   Yeah, I'm a browser. Yeah, why is that why do you do that?
[01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:48.060]   at least is kind of least is kind of half and half she'll
[01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:52.460]   Duck into stores look around and see if there's anything she's the catcher. I and then duck out
[01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:56.540]   But why do why do you do that in physical space but not on amazon?
[01:07:56.540 --> 01:08:00.060]   Uh for fun and recreation, I guess
[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:05.340]   And you're out you know a lot of we have a lot of beautiful shopping malls in southern california
[01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:09.900]   I think amazon's missing a bit because I think amazon doesn't make it browse friendly, right?
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:15.900]   They've they've tried for years and years and then they figured well, we can't do it online
[01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:20.380]   So then they experimented with these four star stores. I don't know if you've ever been
[01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:28.380]   Yeah, yeah, it's basically like kind of a bizarre gift store with you know four star items from appliances to I mean like
[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:32.780]   I feel like there was like a blender and then uh some other
[01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:36.380]   gifts and uh that was one of their physical store
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:42.300]   Experiment the idea was we failed their idea was that that all of these are four star ratings, right?
[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:44.380]   So they're closing the right by the way
[01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:53.020]   16 I think yeah, I think they're done. Well, there's a mix that in the bookstores. Oh, that was the bookstores too. Yeah, it's not really odd
[01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:55.260]   Like I there was one in uh quarter medera
[01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:57.420]   I think there's there might still be there or whatever
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:01.020]   But it always walked in it was that I think they tried to create that apple like hey
[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:06.700]   There's a bunch of space between all the objects, but it was kind of like this weird like I don't understand why i'm here
[01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:13.820]   I tried I was like I was interested but it it just it did feel like it was like an odd selection of things that I don't know why I would buy
[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:17.740]   Yeah, they don't listen. They don't go together either. I mean, it's like uh
[01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:21.580]   It's like a hodge it's more of a hodgepodge, right?
[01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:29.500]   Yeah, yeah, they're they're gone now, but um, you know, and maybe they don't I mean maybe they don't need to
[01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:35.180]   Create a shopping experience. That's I don't know what some would call inspiring or you know
[01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:42.940]   uh the window shopping effect, you know, there are you know, it's not Pinterest or you know, yeah, I don't have it
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:47.500]   I get the feeling they have teams almost in competition
[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:51.980]   Uh saying all right you guys are in charge of making us browsable
[01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:54.540]   you're in you know like
[01:09:54.540 --> 01:10:00.780]   I kind of feel like that's how maybe it's because I read the breadstone books. I feel like that's how they figured out how to
[01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:07.740]   Kind of incentivize internally people innovating with new ideas. I mean, I'm looking at the front page amazon right now
[01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:14.060]   This is this is kind of their idea of what a browse. This is like a four star store, right? It's browsing
[01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:18.780]   Uh pick up where you left off by again. Keep shopping for top deal
[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:23.420]   Prep for prime day deals on free, but this is based on what i've already purchased
[01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:26.460]   Which is one of the problems and which is I already own all that
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:30.940]   I love getting ads for ads for the next two months on things that I already bought like i'm just kind of like okay
[01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:34.620]   I already bought that like that's an algorithm issue right that's that's happened since like
[01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:37.020]   1999 it's just it's
[01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:43.580]   It's never been solved. Yeah, exactly. I probably shouldn't show this on the on the screen because then people are going to be able to figure out
[01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:45.580]   What's wrong with me right?
[01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:50.540]   By again pork rind i was waiting i was waiting for something really embarrassing
[01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:54.460]   Right after the pork rind crumbs you're gonna need high
[01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:57.260]   Absorption magnesium
[01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:01.180]   To purge the pork rind crumbs
[01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:05.340]   Uh, yeah, don't look at what I buy does walmart
[01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:08.300]   Let me go to walmart does walmart try to do this too is there?
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:13.500]   I mean walmart at least has a retail experience. You know a real presence there
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:20.860]   They do although, you know, we we are walmart shoppers in in our home too out in uh, new jersey
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:26.540]   And as we already know and alix embarrassed me or poke fun at me for trader joe shoppers as well
[01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:33.740]   But uh, we we are almost exclusively walmart pickup pickup in the parking lot right?
[01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:36.460]   shoppers
[01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:40.940]   I'm looking here's walmart's home page. This looks you know similar in some ways
[01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:46.140]   To amazon they don't have the data about what I buy because I don't buy from them
[01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:50.060]   So they don't right, you know, they think I might want to pink bicycle with a basket
[01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:56.140]   Um, I realize as you're showing these home pages including the amazon one. I almost never go to a home
[01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:58.940]   Never see it
[01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:03.740]   On any other site like walmart or anywhere else I might be shopping I go straight to search
[01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:08.220]   Yeah, because that's I know what I'm looking for or you do like alix did and said well
[01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:11.260]   I see this thing on twitter how much can I get it for at amazon and
[01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:14.700]   I do it all the time like if i'm interested in something that I see somewhere else
[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:19.180]   I come back to amazon almost all the time the only place I don't do that is bookstores of all places
[01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:23.740]   So if i'm in a bookstore, I will buy the book there because i'm like if I don't buy the book here
[01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:26.380]   The bookstore won't be here when I get that's exactly right
[01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:32.060]   Yeah, so that behavior will kill that bookstore and so the one place that is like which is I find the irony
[01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:37.020]   Thick in the fact that amazon started as a book a book thing and the one thing if i'm at a bookstore
[01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:42.700]   I'm like i'm going to buy this book from this from this reseller because I I like the fact like Denise was talking about
[01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:48.060]   I like going into book a great bookstore like the best bookstore in california as far as i'm concerned as builders bookstore in
[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:49.260]   berkeley
[01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:54.860]   It's all design or design and architecture and everything else and you know gardens and stuff like that
[01:12:54.860 --> 01:13:01.340]   I love going in there because it's so well curated and I think this is where companies have to figure out where they're going to be in that area
[01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:04.220]   Yep, I have a relationship, you know, I know the owner
[01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:09.500]   I've seen him for the last 25 years. I I buy one book when I come in like I know i'm gonna buy a book
[01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:15.180]   And i'm guessing that that one book every three weeks is not keeping them afloat. I hate to tell you
[01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:18.780]   But a lot of us are but but nothing is that that's right?
[01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:20.700]   No, I do the same thing, you know
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:24.220]   But I get frustrated because I go in and they don't have the book they say we can order it for you
[01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:27.900]   We'll have it in five days and I say where I can order and I'll have it tomorrow
[01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:31.420]   But the distinction is is I don't know what i'm going to buy
[01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:37.020]   I go into that you browse to find something that I I'm going into that and this is what this is what we got back to
[01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:42.860]   Is with amazon I go and i'm looking for a book right with builders bookstore. I am going to browse
[01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:49.100]   I'm going to wander around and i'm going to find an interesting book that I never knew existed and i'm gonna buy it
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:55.420]   Like, you know, and that's are you also taking recommendations from from someone working there? Are you usually just browsing on your own?
[01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:58.620]   So that's another piece of it. It's it's an it's uh, it's uh,
[01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:04.300]   It's not a very big bookstore. It's like it's like the size of my living room, you know, like like it's it's a very small
[01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:10.060]   Bookstore and it just has all the perfect things, you know, and so that I could buy every book
[01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:14.940]   Yeah, no, it's it's a incredible if you're a designer. That's an incredible store
[01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:18.860]   There's there's a whole section on topography like just like
[01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:22.060]   Like a book after book after book
[01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:28.140]   Okay, but what I would say is that is that there's there what's interesting about that is that
[01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:35.580]   Um, is that I think that's where companies who are trying to be successful have to figure out what's how can I have a niche?
[01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:37.580]   that I just
[01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:39.980]   Own, you know, not not how do I do?
[01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:44.540]   How do I have every book out there? That's not like tattered cover in Denver is not
[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:46.940]   I don't I gotta show you I gotta take a break
[01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:49.500]   But I gotta show you this chasing because I'm on the walmart
[01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:56.300]   Page and I'm kind of one of those nerds that goes to the bottom of the page and there's this thing hashtag. I
[01:14:56.300 --> 01:15:00.700]   Y w y k and I go. I wonder what that is
[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:07.100]   It turns out that's their social feeds says shop our social feed. Do you see anything on the social feed? No
[01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:11.900]   Oh, no, I don't I don't I apparently nobody's using hashtag. I
[01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:14.540]   Y w y k
[01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:20.220]   Ooh, that's sad, which I'm guessing is if you walmart, you'll know I'm guessing. I don't know
[01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:23.260]   If you want I
[01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:26.940]   That did not come up in my book research. Maybe that's why
[01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:33.180]   Here's one more great feature. Uh walmart social feed, which is absolutely
[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:41.180]   Empty yik yik. All right. Let me take a little break and I love this panel and we're so way behind now
[01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:43.180]   I don't know what's gonna happen, but
[01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:46.860]   I haven't too much fun with the niece howl so wonderful to see you as always
[01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:50.540]   Look for her new podcast that here's say culture.com
[01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:55.900]   Uh, she's my internet lawyer. I just want to say every time I do something lit Denise goes
[01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:59.660]   I open her mastodon instance. She said well, you know, you should know
[01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:05.500]   Thank you, Denise. If it weren't for you, I'd probably do a lot of stupid things
[01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:12.380]   Uh also, Alex lensy from mac break weekly always a pleasure office hours is an amazing achievement
[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:15.020]   I'm trying to be more like you
[01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:20.940]   Uh, in fact, I've gone to the team and I've said if we were going to start twit today
[01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:27.580]   How do we do it differently because really we've done it kind of old school right? That was 2005
[01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:31.580]   Like a like a little mini internet radio or tv station
[01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:36.940]   If we were going to start today, how will we do it and inevitably the offer the answer is office hours. That global
[01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:44.460]   That's how you do it. Well, I have a huge q&a engine. You're welcome to have. Yeah. I mean, it's just the whole the whole operation
[01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:49.260]   Mind pop really powerful. Yeah, what you've done incredible
[01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:53.580]   Uh, well and as always this community, isn't it? That's what makes a difference. Yeah
[01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:57.420]   Jason del ray so great to have you his new book
[01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:00.780]   Uh, which came out like a couple of days ago, right?
[01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:08.060]   Yeah, I want to say you're getting the sharpest Jason del ray you could but that would be a lie because it came out on tuesday
[01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:11.660]   And i've just been in oh can imagine how many interviews how many?
[01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:17.180]   I've uh, well for the last three weeks combined i'm probably up to about
[01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:21.340]   Uh 30 to 35 something like that. See that's great
[01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:27.340]   And this is number one when yes, of course as all of them are this is uh, he's the author
[01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:33.180]   of the new harper collins book winner sells all Jason for years. I did a radio show in san francisco
[01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:35.820]   on knbr where I would interview
[01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:41.020]   All the authors on tour and because we were on the west coast it was always the end
[01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:44.860]   Of a 30 city tour. Let me tell you I know
[01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:47.580]   sharp authors
[01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:53.820]   They come in and of course as you as you might know, I don't know they don't think they do this anymore
[01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:58.780]   The harper collins would put a piece of paper in the book with the questions you should ask
[01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:00.540]   Uh
[01:18:00.540 --> 01:18:04.940]   My purposes may yeah may have may have put together a sheet
[01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:09.580]   I'm sure they did because most interviewers if you're in good morning mil walkie
[01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:12.700]   They are not going to read the book. They don't know what you're talking about
[01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:15.660]   So they're going to ask the 10 questions which means you get the same question
[01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:20.300]   Over and over and over and over and over and over
[01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:24.940]   Uh, at least you don't have to travel anymore, which is probably a good thing
[01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:30.700]   This is a book you should read. In fact, the best thing you you you you you do it is to the excerpts the excerpt and fortune
[01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:35.180]   Really makes you want to read the book. It's like oh, I got I got to get more. That's really cool. Yeah
[01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:40.620]   Thank you winner sells all it's really about walmart and amazon
[01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:47.180]   Uh, but there's stuff in here about walmart. I had no idea. It's fascinating. It's really fascinating
[01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:51.580]   Our show today brought to you by a g1 by athletic greens
[01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:56.540]   I this is a tradition whenever I have the athletic greens ad I don't eat my vie

[01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:13.980]   I was taking literally a fistful of pills

[01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:21.740]   I am late to the game. Everybody's heard of ag1. I think it was founded in 2010 when I started asking around

[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:52.700]   Will tick tock will tick tock be I think Alex
[01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:56.620]   This is what you were talking about all those years ago
[01:20:56.620 --> 01:21:02.460]   With videos that have products in them right that you watch the video for the entertainment
[01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:04.940]   But then you say but I want that 10
[01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:11.260]   It's it's some of it. I mean I think that what what we were really you know doing on our end was to build
[01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:15.340]   Clickable items within a movie so that if you're watching a movie and you see something
[01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:20.540]   You would get into the habit of I can just push a button down and I can select Brad Pitcher
[01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:23.260]   Yeah, like what is that?
[01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:26.540]   First but then there's an opportunity to buy well
[01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:30.460]   And the idea is it's totally passive. You don't it doesn't run into you
[01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:35.420]   It just is you just get to a point where you know it and I think that Amazon is actually really close to this working
[01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:39.820]   So they have x ray inside of amazon prime where you can see all the actors
[01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:43.660]   What they haven't added there is you'll show you all the actors in the scene
[01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:46.860]   Well, it wouldn't take very much for them to add all the items in the scene
[01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:49.980]   You know like you know, so these are these are all these these are all the relevant
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:52.780]   Extra maybe that's the whole purpose
[01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:57.660]   That might be what they're kind of getting towards is figuring that model out and it wouldn't take them very
[01:21:58.220 --> 01:22:05.100]   It's a little bit of work interesting. Yeah, but when you talk about product placing product placement gets really competitive when the idea is
[01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:06.620]   Do I have a product that's in there?
[01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:09.100]   But not only that I wanted to make sure that it's in amazon
[01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:15.260]   So that you can select it you could just hit and what will happen is the idea is is that it leaves it as a passive experience
[01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:16.940]   someone doesn't have to
[01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:21.820]   Do anything and if it was successful enough you'd end up with a situation where I never have to run ads
[01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:24.620]   Because there's enough sales. There's enough CTR to
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:29.580]   There's a high enough CTR to make that work. You know click through rate where you have
[01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:32.940]   Basically you have all these hot these hot items
[01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:37.020]   And you know you sell a thousand shirts because Brad Pitt was wearing it
[01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:40.140]   You know, that's what we that's what we started working on 20 years ago
[01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:45.980]   And no one's done it yet or partially because apple gutted out the quick time in the case of chris evans
[01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:52.380]   Sweater and knives out exactly they could assault a lot of these right now
[01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:55.420]   They would have sold millions they would have sold they would have made more money on that sweater
[01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:59.180]   Uh, then the movie. Yeah, so yeah
[01:22:59.180 --> 01:23:03.340]   Or lots of sweaters like it depending on well, that's the problem
[01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:10.540]   It's an air and sweater and you can get them from a lot of different places. I guess but well, but at least two hbo shows where
[01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:13.740]   I can't fathom why they're not already doing this
[01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:16.220]   Succession is one
[01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:21.580]   Yes, because people are fascinated by the wardrobe in that show you find out how much we're trying to
[01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:23.580]   That was what I was going to say
[01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:29.660]   $600 baseball cap is more of sort of a novelty item than something that everyone's going to go
[01:23:29.660 --> 01:23:32.620]   Is it and just like that?
[01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:36.780]   Well that and sex in the city the whole franchise. I mean
[01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:44.780]   You have no if you looked on the socials there are so many accounts that exist
[01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:53.900]   Only to tell you exactly what all the characters are wearing and the whole costume department of and just like that
[01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:56.380]   Has its own instagram account
[01:23:56.380 --> 01:24:02.780]   Carrie has her own store in New York city, which i'm dying to go to
[01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:11.660]   Did you know that would be sarah jesica parka? Yes. Yes. Why does sarah jesica parka who probably has more money than god
[01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:16.140]   For some reason has decided to open a retail outlet selling shoes
[01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:23.020]   In she's been telling shoes for a while. She thinks she's a good shoe designer and you know, she does design
[01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:26.220]   She's much like the ones for characters where
[01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:29.180]   jp
[01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:32.460]   New arrivals for the color lover shop now
[01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:38.460]   So how long before amazon buys this maybe that's her plan, right?
[01:24:41.260 --> 01:24:45.260]   I don't know. I mean, I think she's doing fine. I not just a revenues and centred
[01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:52.460]   But she you know there there would have been a day a couple years ago when mark lori was still at uh walmart that
[01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:56.700]   They were on this they thought they were going to buy all these up and coming brands and
[01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:58.940]   different different
[01:24:58.940 --> 01:25:01.020]   type of customer coming into walmart and
[01:25:01.020 --> 01:25:05.340]   He would have been a prime. I'm sure he would have went and talked to her about buying that thing
[01:25:05.340 --> 01:25:08.460]   I don't think she's I don't think she needs this. I think she does it for fun
[01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:15.420]   There was I just read a profile of her. I can't remember where it was in New Yorker somewhere where they talk about going and she loves
[01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:17.740]   selling shoes
[01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:24.700]   To people who come in and and of course the people are going wait a minute. Carry bradshaw selling me the shoes
[01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:31.180]   Okay, i'll take five. Thank you very much. It apparently is a but I don't think she does it. I can't imagine she does it for money
[01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:33.980]   Uh, that is just a that's a wild story
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:36.940]   Uh, so they're not cheap
[01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:40.300]   No, she's selling it volume at all. She's
[01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:42.940]   Trying to further money. Yeah
[01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:45.100]   She's not under a bridge with a ring light
[01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:48.460]   Uh doing videos for her
[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:57.020]   So what's the story Alex you brought this up before the break? Yeah, so the the story is is that for I and I i'm not sure which platform but basically
[01:25:57.020 --> 01:25:59.740]   it is the
[01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:03.980]   The sorting of where the stream starts sorts into that community
[01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:11.660]   So in in china so it's regional it's a regional stream and so what they're doing is they want to be in the region where there's a lot of
[01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:17.020]   Potential buyers so they may not live there, but they need to be somewhere where they stream with their phone
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:21.820]   They're near the way that the algorithm works is that it's it's trying to only show them in that region
[01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:24.700]   So they go to the regions and they're like under a you know
[01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:26.300]   They're somewhere under the highway
[01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:30.940]   But in the region that they need to be in so that they can reach the the buyers for that specific
[01:26:30.940 --> 01:26:34.460]   So they're trying to game basically game that the game in the system. Yeah
[01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:37.420]   Yeah, we're attempting to yeah, absolutely
[01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:39.180]   That is amazing
[01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:42.940]   but the scale the scale of of yeah, it's the scale is
[01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:44.460]   um
[01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:47.660]   Kind of unbelievable in in china there must be a hundred
[01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:50.780]   That's why everyone's interested. They can't figure out how to do it in the united states
[01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:51.500]   Yep
[01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:56.940]   Um and it and it may have to do I think with the reach the quality of the retail outlets in china or not as you know
[01:26:56.940 --> 01:27:00.700]   They're just not the same level. It's harder to find the things that you need necessarily
[01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:04.620]   Of that are specific verticals and so because of that there's more friction in
[01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:08.860]   Being able to get them that the online streaming might make more sense
[01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:13.660]   Um, but it's it's it's it's it's like as a live streamer. We we watch
[01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:20.700]   Live streaming in china all the time like we watch the trends because we're everyone's trying to figure out how to crack that because that's like the
[01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:23.100]   A very big golden egg
[01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:29.100]   What's interesting is it doesn't exist here is how misinterpreted this was some people said oh they're homeless
[01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:31.740]   They have to do that under a bridge because they don't
[01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:39.100]   No, it's because as you said they're gaming the algorithm. They're in kai-fung in the hanan province
[01:27:39.100 --> 01:27:40.940]   And some of them are making a lot of money like that
[01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:44.860]   You know, this is where they start and then they end up with their own little studio somewhere and then they make up
[01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:45.980]   I mean some of these
[01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:48.780]   Influencers are you know, they're making influence for money
[01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:52.380]   Yeah, well having you know the other reason we were down your way
[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:56.940]   Denise's that vidcon was being held at the anahime convention center
[01:27:56.940 --> 01:28:02.060]   And that is a fascinating place to go originally started by the greens
[01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:06.220]   Uh, it was acquired by viacom which tells you something
[01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:11.900]   Uh, the the key sponsor has been almost every year youtube last year. It was tick tock
[01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:13.740]   It was youtube again this year
[01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:18.620]   And it's not you don't see mr. Beast there anymore, right? You don't see the established youtubers
[01:28:18.620 --> 01:28:22.220]   You see the uh up and coming the hungry
[01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:25.020]   streamers there
[01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:28.140]   But there are long lines
[01:28:28.140 --> 01:28:33.820]   You go into the conference there's a whole bunch of conferences, you know seminars going on
[01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:38.380]   But on the main conference floor, there's two large stage areas 500 people
[01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:45.420]   And they're two going on at the same time two different presentations one was uh, uh, uh,
[01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:48.860]   Some ghost hunters youtube video. I don't remember what the other was the
[01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:53.740]   Audiences filled with screaming fans
[01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:58.380]   And I was watching the ghost hunters one they said well, we got our video. We're gonna put it up in a couple of days
[01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:00.380]   You want to see it now in the fan
[01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:05.820]   But what's really clear is that these are all very narrow niches
[01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:09.900]   That have this very strong fan base
[01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:12.620]   And there's probably hundreds of them
[01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:19.340]   Yeah, it's a long tail lives. Yeah, it is though. I mean we're the we're the long tail, right? I mean we don't
[01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:22.300]   When we started there was nobody
[01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:26.940]   Hardly doing podcasting and so it was easy to get a big audience now. There's a lot more shows
[01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:32.220]   Uh, and you know, we still have a large audience relative to 90 of the other podcasts out there
[01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:34.380]   But it's it's definitely sliced up more
[01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:40.780]   But if you want if you want to podcast about tech news, there's only a handful so we're in you know, we're in that niche
[01:29:40.780 --> 01:29:47.420]   Uh, it's just to me. It's fascinating and it's and it's I imagine it's the future. Yes
[01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:51.820]   Yeah, I mean I I probably
[01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:53.820]   Well over half of my viewing is now on youtube
[01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:58.780]   It's not even youtube. Yeah, every you know, I mean it's mostly everybody there's under 25
[01:29:58.780 --> 01:30:05.980]   But everybody under 25 that's they're watching youtube, right? You're 10 year old. Yeah, my Jason is not watching network television
[01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:10.860]   When my my daughter learns, she's learning guitar and bass and stuff like that. She doesn't go
[01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:12.940]   She doesn't take lessons. She literally just goes
[01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:17.580]   I'm sure that that song's on youtube and and there's somebody doing it's not that the song is on youtube
[01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:22.860]   There is almost any song you can imagine there is somebody that will show you how to play it on the guitar
[01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:25.900]   Like it and you know and and sit there and and has you know
[01:30:25.900 --> 01:30:30.060]   listeners that are our viewers enough viewers that that's probably they're only business
[01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:33.020]   Right tick-tock too very useful in that way
[01:30:33.020 --> 01:30:37.660]   This the vidcon show, which I think would be really interesting to go to one year
[01:30:37.660 --> 01:30:43.100]   Uh, but I haven't been it sounds almost more like comic-con where it's not an industry event but fans come
[01:30:43.100 --> 01:30:46.220]   Yeah, it's yeah, it's a vidcon is there's an it's called another one
[01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:48.860]   There's there is a creator track there. I've spoken
[01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:55.020]   Industry track so we go upstairs and there's real serious business going on
[01:30:55.020 --> 01:30:59.180]   But on the ground floor they got cost players just like you would at a comic-con
[01:30:59.180 --> 01:31:02.700]   You have fans you have screaming teenagers
[01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:10.860]   Okay, I fondly reminisce for one second about the fact that the first time I ever met Alex Lindsey in person
[01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:18.940]   Maybe the first time that I met you in person Leo was at the podcast and new media expo in Ontario, California
[01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:21.660]   in 2007
[01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:27.180]   There was nobody screaming at that I can tell you right now no screaming teenagers
[01:31:27.180 --> 01:31:32.060]   Wasn't that how to get into the high o' mikes? I think that was the it is I won uh, I won podcast
[01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:35.660]   Of the year award or whatever and the prize was this microphone
[01:31:35.660 --> 01:31:39.180]   Yeah, and I fell in love with it use it ever since
[01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:41.740]   Alex you had a zoom
[01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:43.980]   You were showing off your scene
[01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:52.380]   I was like I was excited that I had a then I had the the new thing and you did I never used it like I I tried
[01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:56.220]   But I never yeah, that's where I met uh chris markward our photo guy
[01:31:56.220 --> 01:32:00.380]   Uh, and he interviewed me on a nokia camera
[01:32:00.380 --> 01:32:07.260]   Called I think it was the p90 it was a video it was a smart smartphone. Yeah, really that looked like a camcorder
[01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:15.900]   Yeah, and it was like wow very modern remember I remember I met I mean we went to a party that was kent nickels from askin
[01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:17.660]   And that's a
[01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:23.740]   Kent and and then the airport I met uh dr. Kiki, uh, you know kiki sandford and uh, so it was it was that that was a great
[01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:26.140]   That was a moment, you know that
[01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:28.780]   2007 that one here's the lesson
[01:32:28.780 --> 01:32:34.460]   Nobody's ever heard of any but you know, I mean askin ninja which was tip was number one right?
[01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:40.060]   I mean, I know kent has done very well as a consultant since but that's what happens right?
[01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:46.220]   I wonder how brother love has done exactly, you know, I mean I'm doing a lot of googling right now
[01:32:46.220 --> 01:32:52.140]   Brian abbot's abbot is still doing a cover ville right
[01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:58.780]   So there were a lot of pike us that are still around we're still right frank zay frank was like uh was like a safe frank rockstar at that
[01:32:58.860 --> 01:33:06.060]   Safe rag. Yeah, he ended well. He's like this video right yeah, he's done very well. He went on to do uh
[01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:12.940]   Uh, was it tastes uh he did a cooking thing he invented the top-down recipe video
[01:33:12.940 --> 01:33:21.180]   Which nobody you know, you don't get royalties for but but you get the claim to fame. Anyway, his his short his short on procrastination is like
[01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:24.620]   Like it's just so good
[01:33:24.620 --> 01:33:28.780]   Oh god, we feel like old old timers here n-nostalgically
[01:33:28.780 --> 01:33:30.780]   Remember
[01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:33.740]   Remember interviewing the guys who made 405 the movie
[01:33:33.740 --> 01:33:41.260]   About about how they put that remember 405 you see it now we're really showing our age 405 the movie was like that was like one of the first
[01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:43.820]   uh like
[01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:46.780]   Now Jason and I are both googling this one all right
[01:33:47.180 --> 01:33:51.180]   405 the movie was like the 2001 2002 I think
[01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:54.140]   First viral viral video of the internet
[01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:57.260]   It really was it was it was
[01:33:57.260 --> 01:34:00.700]   Uh, it's really great a lot of us were like oh, this is really there we go
[01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:03.340]   And now you can watch it if you go to 405 the movie
[01:34:03.340 --> 01:34:09.900]   Is it v405 is it the highway and in l.a. It's about the 405 yeah, it's about the 405
[01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:13.020]   I mean, it's only a couple minutes long. It's it's uh, it's
[01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:17.740]   This is it kids the fact that they shot it like in out in their backyard like it was they you know
[01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:22.060]   It's that's the part that you know, it was great Jason if you told you 10 year old
[01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:27.340]   That the first viral video was this video people going down the 405
[01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:30.780]   You know what he
[01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:35.180]   He'd get a i don't have to watch it. You just have to watch it. See there's an airliner
[01:34:35.180 --> 01:34:37.580]   Oh, is it gonna land on the 405?
[01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:44.780]   You can tell it's cgi though, right? It looks too good compared to the rest of the video
[01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:47.180]   Oh
[01:34:47.180 --> 01:34:48.860]   Lovely
[01:34:48.860 --> 01:34:51.900]   It feels like 75 years ago. It really does
[01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:54.780]   It's a couple of decades ago
[01:34:54.780 --> 01:34:56.940]   But this was when you know in 2000
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:35:03.420]   How did you stream video? I don't know it was just on somebody's website, you know, and um did you have to do it?
[01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:05.420]   in real player
[01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:11.820]   No, I think it was on like um you could do a you could upload a quick time. So it was just like a quick time you just run into it
[01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:13.660]   um
[01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:19.260]   Wow actually this is quite good show this to your 10 year old and say this is this is the jazz singer
[01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:22.060]   This is al jolson's the jazz singer for the internet age
[01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:26.300]   This is when talkies started. It's an amazing
[01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:29.100]   Thank you. Oh my god. This actually is quite good
[01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:35.340]   It says before five years before youtube 405 amassed hundreds of millions of views
[01:35:36.060 --> 01:35:42.460]   Well, like, you know, it was before youtube, but there was lots of little like I my uh, I did a some silly video
[01:35:42.460 --> 01:35:44.060]   about
[01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:50.300]   How the new iphone was going to be all you know videos gonna be it was the second iphone or the new iphone that had video and i built a rig for it
[01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:53.660]   That afternoon when I bought it and I did a little video about it
[01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:55.020]   Like this is gonna be the you know
[01:35:55.020 --> 01:35:57.740]   We're gonna be shooting videos and movies and all kinds of stuff on our iphone
[01:35:57.740 --> 01:35:59.660]   And this was like, I don't know 2008 or something like that
[01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:04.300]   And it got like two million views, which is why I had to pay a lot for the surfer because
[01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:08.860]   Because um, uh, wired picked it up, you know, and it was one of those things that
[01:36:08.860 --> 01:36:13.580]   But back then that's when you learn like don't that's why youtube was so powerful is that if someone picked it up
[01:36:13.580 --> 01:36:15.580]   You didn't have to write it checked
[01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:21.340]   The number one video today on youtube 12 billion views
[01:36:21.340 --> 01:36:24.460]   That's more than there are people on the planet
[01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:26.140]   I think that's impressive
[01:36:26.140 --> 01:36:28.940]   But I what I really think is impressive if we watch someone like mr
[01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:31.500]   Beast where it's not that he has one big movie
[01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:34.700]   It's that everything he puts out gets 30 million or more views
[01:36:34.700 --> 01:36:41.820]   Is kind of a thing like it like that is a like he has a model that that actually works over and over and over again
[01:36:41.820 --> 01:36:47.740]   Um, I think that's interesting, but but it's so see this no so you talk about succession, which is
[01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:51.180]   Great writing great dramaturgy great acting
[01:36:51.180 --> 01:36:59.340]   Uh direction everything so much energy and thought goes into even the smallest prop and you create a masterpiece
[01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:04.380]   but the number of views of succession is
[01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:07.820]   infinitesimal compared to mr. Beast
[01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:10.700]   uh, you know
[01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:19.020]   Getting a thousand deaf people to hear for the first time 89 million views or ages one to 100 fight for half a million dollars
[01:37:19.020 --> 01:37:21.820]   140
[01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:23.820]   43
[01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:25.980]   More people saw that
[01:37:25.980 --> 01:37:30.300]   10 times more people saw that than saw succession and but but I don't know if I want
[01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:32.300]   media to become mr. Beast
[01:37:32.300 --> 01:37:38.860]   Why would you make succession if you said well, why am I doing why am I working for peanuts here?
[01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:44.540]   I paid a real assassin to try to kill me 157 million views
[01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:48.620]   Well, and again, but I mean if succession's making money, then that's great
[01:37:48.620 --> 01:37:52.700]   I think that the challenge really is is can we keep on making as much narrative?
[01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:57.820]   Will the market support as much narrative is coming out a succession is not the problem
[01:37:57.820 --> 01:38:01.580]   It's for all the little things below that that it's unclear whether
[01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:04.220]   those become viable. Yeah
[01:38:04.220 --> 01:38:07.980]   I uh, I was uh reading the um
[01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:11.100]   review of the new indiana jones movie
[01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:18.700]   Uh, I think it was in the new yorker and he quoted uh, pauline kales review of the original indiana jones
[01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:23.020]   Which was when 1981 something like that
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:26.060]   um
[01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:28.940]   It's called whipped which is by the way
[01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:33.580]   The seo on this title is wow god awful
[01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:35.660]   god awful
[01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:40.860]   And yet it is a brilliant title for a review of a movie about indiana jones, right?
[01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:47.260]   But in it she says something that I think is very interesting. I've already told you this alexon not mac break weekly
[01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:49.260]   But i'm going to mention it again
[01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:54.140]   This is the lead the marketing executives are the new high priests of the movie business
[01:38:55.660 --> 01:38:59.020]   Her thesis is you can't make a movie. This is 1981
[01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:03.500]   If you don't go first to the marketing people say can you market this?
[01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:07.420]   And if they say no, you don't make it
[01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:14.860]   So she says right now the easier product a project looks to market the easier it is to finance
[01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:19.580]   Which means and this is in 1981 all you're going to see is horror movies
[01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:22.220]   and fantasy films
[01:39:22.780 --> 01:39:26.220]   And it's the end she says for prestige pictures
[01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:31.340]   You know that offer middle-class group therapy like ordinary people in the four seasons
[01:39:31.340 --> 01:39:35.900]   Do you remember the four seasons? No, you don't with alibalda. No, you don't
[01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:40.060]   But do you remember indiana jones in the temple of doom? Absolutely
[01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:46.700]   But I would argue though, I mean this is this is a little bit of eric hollywood arrogance for today because they all talk about this
[01:39:46.700 --> 01:39:52.540]   And the fact that streaming now has has created a huge market for things that would traditionally fail
[01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:58.140]   at the movie theater and we can actually watch it, you know and and because those that because it doesn't have to make
[01:39:58.140 --> 01:40:01.900]   Money directly so there there's a downside to not making money directly
[01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:07.820]   Which is that this is why the writers are on strike is because they want to get paid for how many views and how many people watch it and everything else
[01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:13.180]   But the upside is is that you can there is a it's a distributed risk across the media production pipeline
[01:40:13.180 --> 01:40:18.780]   So you're the the the streamers are not losing, you know, unless they they mess up on everything
[01:40:19.180 --> 01:40:24.060]   You know as long as they keep on as long as disney keeps on putting out something like mandolorian every eight weeks
[01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:26.780]   All the other stuff that they're experimenting with
[01:40:26.780 --> 01:40:32.300]   Is is all kind of like just kind of filling those those things in and making sure you have something new to watch
[01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:34.940]   We're seeing more behind the scenes. I love behind the scenes
[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:36.780]   I've seen more behind the scenes now
[01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:39.980]   Then we've ever seen before because disney has decided that that's a product
[01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:43.660]   And so they're putting up that because that just adds to the value of your membership
[01:40:43.660 --> 01:40:46.060]   You know and so now we get all these behind
[01:40:47.020 --> 01:40:49.660]   What disney decides it can make money on
[01:40:49.660 --> 01:40:53.340]   Right we had behind the scenes with dvd
[01:40:53.340 --> 01:40:59.420]   Everything we see space on the dv. Yeah, but I just don't know if well, I guess you're right
[01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:02.780]   I mean it has to it has to pay for itself. I understand that but I
[01:41:02.780 --> 01:41:07.580]   You're only going to get blockbusters that everything's going to be a marvel
[01:41:07.580 --> 01:41:10.140]   MCU move. I don't
[01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:15.820]   I don't think that's I mean I think that again for feature films you're you're 100 right the problem is
[01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:20.620]   Is that you know so features are you know the business because they're so expensive like the theater
[01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:25.180]   The theater business is in all kinds of troubles like the house is on fire
[01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:31.020]   You know and it's because the the the they've kind of the only thing they have left is action films
[01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:34.220]   And people are getting tired of those like if you look at what happened to flash
[01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:38.620]   like people aren't automatically going to uh, uh, one of the you know the
[01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:43.260]   The MCU or whatever, you know, they're not doing that automatically anymore
[01:41:43.660 --> 01:41:47.260]   Because they and I thought DC comics or DC universe, but the
[01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:50.940]   They're not automatically going to these things because they're they're worn out
[01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:54.380]   They're worn out of these of these effects effects heavy films
[01:41:54.380 --> 01:41:56.460]   Um, whether they say their effects or not
[01:41:56.460 --> 01:42:00.780]   There's a lot of effects in all these films and they're getting worn out of of these high pressure films
[01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:03.500]   And so they're going to the movies, you know, they they
[01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:07.580]   You know it did well after covid because everyone missed it, but it's not going to keep going that way
[01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:11.100]   You know and and so that because it you know, it's all it's a it's a mono
[01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:15.580]   Uh, mono supply, you know, there's not there's not any
[01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:22.220]   All the other stuff is going to streaming like that's where you put things now if it if it's got heartstrings you put it in streaming
[01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:26.700]   You know and of course, I got a budget for it. The reason i'm very aware of this is because this this week
[01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:28.780]   I was at vidcon and disneyland
[01:42:28.780 --> 01:42:32.380]   Which are apposite right vidcon's long tail
[01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:34.460]   niche
[01:42:34.460 --> 01:42:39.260]   Disney's interested in how many toys can we make based on this property?
[01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:43.980]   How many rides can we make and i'm and you go to disney and it's and it's
[01:42:43.980 --> 01:42:45.900]   I mean
[01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:48.220]   The kid made a $250 lightsaber
[01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:50.780]   $250
[01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:55.580]   But I think on the other side of that like the interest like for instance, I love this show called chef's table
[01:42:55.580 --> 01:42:59.180]   Like it's just an incredible. Yes, you've watched it because of you. Yeah, that's on
[01:42:59.180 --> 01:43:03.740]   And it's yeah, it's a great show. It would never be made for tv like that would never have an audience
[01:43:03.740 --> 01:43:06.780]   You know on tv and netflix it makes sense for them to do it
[01:43:07.340 --> 01:43:12.460]   The but also when you go to youtube and you look at veritasium or tom scott or rick biano or yeah
[01:43:12.460 --> 01:43:15.820]   Yeah, you know, these are all verticals that that don't exist
[01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:22.860]   In the real you know, they don't exist in the broadcast world that are that bring a lot of value a lot of mark rober
[01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:29.180]   So are you saying that both both exist and both should continue to exist and this is because of it a vital
[01:43:29.180 --> 01:43:33.820]   I think and growing market. I think it's going to get harder and harder for hollywood to make films that make a difference
[01:43:33.820 --> 01:43:36.060]   I think that there's a I just don't want to see all mr
[01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:37.820]   Beast all the time
[01:43:37.820 --> 01:43:40.220]   No, I don't think I don't think that's what you're gonna see in youtube because I mean
[01:43:40.220 --> 01:43:47.820]   I most people I talk to he has all those followers most people I talk to in the real world don't know who he is
[01:43:47.820 --> 01:43:54.140]   I know it's amazing. So you know, like you got to get like he has all these viewers and all this this backing and most people don't know
[01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:57.980]   Even know that that he's around you know and so the thing is is if I talk to my parents about it
[01:43:57.980 --> 01:44:02.380]   They're like who's mr. Beast, you know and so but that's how how vast that that group is now
[01:44:02.380 --> 01:44:07.980]   What I will say is that it's going to get harder and harder because I think that we're about to go into hyperinflation when it comes to
[01:44:07.980 --> 01:44:15.260]   Content, you know content is going to become less and less valuable on its own the the community is more important than the content at this point
[01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:19.980]   um and you know and and which is you know, it's just a it's a commodity that is now
[01:44:19.980 --> 01:44:28.220]   The ability to produce it is going to you know with ai with all the tools becoming easy with everybody in the everybody making podcasts like us
[01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:33.900]   um, there's there's the value of it is going to be very challenging and you know, it's it's a
[01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:41.020]   That's going to be the biggest problem for hollywood is is how do you keep rationalizing the the big cost for really expensive productions?
[01:44:41.020 --> 01:44:45.100]   Hi, this is bonito by the way, bonito our technical director. Hello bonito
[01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:49.900]   I just wanted to mention a 24 the production company. This is one of the bright spots in this here
[01:44:49.900 --> 01:44:54.860]   That's making it was original kinds of films. I love it. I know it's a good brand
[01:44:54.860 --> 01:44:57.420]   That's really is yeah
[01:44:57.420 --> 01:44:58.540]   um
[01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:04.380]   And they're completely well like if I see if I see something that I think remotely looks like it's going to be good
[01:45:04.380 --> 01:45:09.180]   And it's kino lobar or a 24. I'm gonna like i'm gonna watch it
[01:45:09.180 --> 01:45:13.980]   Like i'm like like if I think it might be good from the trailer and I see those low those
[01:45:13.980 --> 01:45:18.780]   Those brands I go. Oh, it's gonna be this is gonna be really interesting and i'll take a chance on it
[01:45:18.780 --> 01:45:23.740]   So like that's a company that I think is doing the right thing in terms of how to market and create
[01:45:24.540 --> 01:45:30.780]   Truly original content did it's funny that their latest movie is never coming to a theater near you is the name of their latest
[01:45:30.780 --> 01:45:32.700]   latest movie
[01:45:32.700 --> 01:45:34.700]   uh, interesting but uh
[01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:40.300]   Are they profitable? Are they are um, they a model for success? Yeah, everything ever
[01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:43.820]   Everything everywhere all at once best picture of the year
[01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:45.740]   Yeah
[01:45:45.740 --> 01:45:47.740]   I have noticed that my youtube
[01:45:47.740 --> 01:45:53.660]   Feed what what it suggests that I watch has altered a bit. Um, I never
[01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:57.580]   I guess my my long tail interests are
[01:45:57.580 --> 01:46:02.220]   substantial enough that it has has enough to feed me without trying to
[01:46:02.220 --> 01:46:04.540]   Make me a terrorist
[01:46:04.540 --> 01:46:09.180]   So I never see videos that that I think are
[01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:17.340]   Problematic in in any way really in my youtube feed. It's very hopeful really that we're all gonna get served right
[01:46:17.340 --> 01:46:21.740]   And that there is money to be made. Uh, maybe not as much
[01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:25.020]   so
[01:46:25.020 --> 01:46:30.940]   I think of the music industry as a good example because in the music industry the multi platinum
[01:46:30.940 --> 01:46:33.740]   Acts made the most money
[01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:40.780]   Uh, and those guys got infinitely rich and there was really no long tail. It was it was like those guys are nothing
[01:46:40.780 --> 01:46:46.220]   And and now there are many many artists who can make a good living
[01:46:46.220 --> 01:46:52.460]   It's harder to become a multi platinum artist. They're fewer of those because the labels aren't as powerful. You don't have radio
[01:46:53.020 --> 01:46:56.940]   But there are a lot of people who can make a good living. Is it going to be kind of like that Denise that
[01:46:56.940 --> 01:46:59.100]   that
[01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:01.420]   Many a thousand flowers will bloom
[01:47:01.420 --> 01:47:08.460]   I guess that's what I was getting at is that um, I've noticed there's a definite high quality
[01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:16.780]   Degree of content. I've never heard of that shows up in my youtube feed that I go. Mm. I watch that and I learned something. Um, so
[01:47:16.780 --> 01:47:19.500]   You know, I have I have hope about that
[01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:22.700]   um, you're talking more. I think sort of
[01:47:23.260 --> 01:47:25.260]   music and narrative
[01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:29.820]   Uh, which is harder and requires writing and creativity
[01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:32.620]   um, so
[01:47:32.620 --> 01:47:38.140]   You know, I can only hope that that also pans out there. I wanted to ask you all since we're talking about mr
[01:47:38.140 --> 01:47:43.260]   Beast and we've referenced him a few times. Any of you ever watched a emma chamberlin video?
[01:47:43.260 --> 01:47:45.420]   No
[01:47:45.420 --> 01:47:48.460]   What does you don't know who I'm a chamberlin? How much money does he give away?
[01:47:48.460 --> 01:47:50.860]   Emma, Emma, she's a she
[01:47:50.860 --> 01:47:52.860]   How much money does she give away?
[01:47:52.860 --> 01:47:57.020]   Uh, she's she's just an incredibly successful youtuber
[01:47:57.020 --> 01:48:00.700]   Um, and she is she a makeup, uh, youtuber? What is she?
[01:48:00.700 --> 01:48:08.460]   No, no, no, no, she's the opposite of that. She she does styling. 21 years old. Yeah. No, no, no, no, not really
[01:48:08.460 --> 01:48:12.860]   No, you're you're putting her in a niche. She doesn't belong in she started out at age
[01:48:12.860 --> 01:48:15.260]   She literally dropped out of high school at age 16
[01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:18.140]   To do her videos, which were much more
[01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:23.500]   First of all, she's a talented videographer and editor and she her
[01:48:23.500 --> 01:48:29.420]   Editing style is responsible for a lot of what you see on youtube now
[01:48:29.420 --> 01:48:36.780]   Emulated so many times. Yeah, you should look into her. She's 21 years old. My son my son follows her
[01:48:36.780 --> 01:48:45.980]   So very relatable very um 16 million followers and insta. So that's good. Yeah, no, she's she's she's a force
[01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:51.020]   and I I raise her because again like people haven't heard of Mr. Beast
[01:48:51.020 --> 01:48:56.540]   I think you'd find a lot more people who have heard of Emma Chamberlain like out in the non tech
[01:48:56.540 --> 01:49:03.420]   Lay people of the world and I think that that's the thing that's amazing is that you have people that have a
[01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:10.940]   Really large following and they're making a good living doing what they're doing and there's a whole lot of people that don't know
[01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:15.180]   Look at this 3.9 million views one month ago
[01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:18.860]   3.1 million views 3.7 million views. Yeah, no kidding
[01:49:18.860 --> 01:49:23.580]   5.9 million views. She doesn't have a single video that's below a million
[01:49:23.580 --> 01:49:30.060]   They're all in the three four and five million some are even higher and and I think that one of the things
[01:49:30.060 --> 01:49:34.540]   It's incredible when you get to know some of these youtubers is just the level of work that they do
[01:49:34.540 --> 01:49:39.020]   And they you know, mark has brownie talked about it at one point where someone asked, you know
[01:49:39.020 --> 01:49:41.820]   How to be successful? He's like we gotta do a hundred hundred videos
[01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:48.380]   Right, you know from scratch and know that they're all gonna fail and then they'll start to pick up and and many of these folks started when they
[01:49:48.380 --> 01:49:51.180]   Were young, you know, they were they were they had the extra time
[01:49:51.180 --> 01:49:54.140]   They weren't trying to make money and they just they didn't give up quickly
[01:49:54.140 --> 01:49:59.180]   They just went well, I'm just gonna keep just making a problem though that you have to exist on
[01:49:59.180 --> 01:50:02.460]   Platforms that you don't control like youtube and tiktok
[01:50:02.460 --> 01:50:09.580]   I think somewhat of a problem. I mean the hard part for them is that they don't it's very hard to get a it's very hard to
[01:50:10.540 --> 01:50:13.900]   Move your audience from one platform to another
[01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:18.860]   So if you decide those platforms spend a lot of like if I post a youtube link in twitter
[01:50:18.860 --> 01:50:25.020]   I know that I'm gonna be penalized for the next week like my twitter the number of people who see my twitter in the for you page is gonna
[01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:29.020]   They don't want you to buy like a percent. You just get really penalized by it and so
[01:50:29.020 --> 01:50:35.260]   So I think that you know, so sending people off the you know off the system is very
[01:50:35.820 --> 01:50:43.340]   You know complicated there and so and that happens in facebook that happens in and so and the problem is like facebook is one of the worst because you
[01:50:43.340 --> 01:50:49.980]   You get a huge following and now you have to pay to even get a hold of the people that followed you and like that is just
[01:50:49.980 --> 01:50:53.340]   I mean and they have you locked in there's no way to get a hold of them
[01:50:53.340 --> 01:50:56.380]   There's no, you know, and you can't even get to them all anymore
[01:50:56.380 --> 01:51:00.780]   So it's it's a really dark hole for creators that are on facebook and instagram
[01:51:00.780 --> 01:51:05.740]   I think but the you know twitter is a little bit more fluid and I think youtube is probably the best for them
[01:51:05.820 --> 01:51:11.180]   Because it doesn't make an attempt to to contact most of their followers when when they put out another video
[01:51:11.180 --> 01:51:13.820]   But it's still that is a problem where they don't have a solid
[01:51:13.820 --> 01:51:17.500]   I don't think that they actually need everybody's email. They don't think they want it with gdpr
[01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:20.460]   I don't think that they actually I think they think they want it
[01:51:20.460 --> 01:51:22.940]   But managing that is going to be really complicated
[01:51:22.940 --> 01:51:26.060]   So you want someone to hold on to that without you having access to it
[01:51:26.060 --> 01:51:29.900]   But what you do want to do is say I want to email everybody and know that it will go to everybody
[01:51:29.900 --> 01:51:33.820]   And everyone will know and I think that's something that's missing right now
[01:51:34.300 --> 01:51:36.300]   So
[01:51:36.300 --> 01:51:38.860]   It's a very interesting world we uh we live in
[01:51:38.860 --> 01:51:44.060]   And I feel like paulin kalen 19a one kind of foresaw what was going to happen movies. I wonder
[01:51:44.060 --> 01:51:49.100]   What we said a lot about it in 2023 about what is going to happen with the media?
[01:51:49.100 --> 01:51:53.820]   Landscape because it's changing so rapidly so dramatically
[01:51:53.820 --> 01:51:55.900]   Well, yeah
[01:51:55.900 --> 01:52:01.500]   Who would have ever thought that youtube was going to be the place that you went for your nfl games?
[01:52:01.820 --> 01:52:03.820]   Right
[01:52:03.820 --> 01:52:08.220]   Or
[01:52:08.220 --> 01:52:10.780]   Quite a lot of money to make sure that that happened
[01:52:10.780 --> 01:52:16.700]   Well, and that's been you know, that's been all the work that's been done by the youtube youtube team to get that off the ground
[01:52:16.700 --> 01:52:23.180]   I mean that is no minor thing to put that many streams out youtube TV. Yeah, yeah, youtube tv did not work when it came out
[01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:26.460]   Like they put football games up and you're like, oh, that's not gonna work
[01:52:26.460 --> 01:52:29.580]   And um, you know, like it was painful
[01:52:29.980 --> 01:52:34.140]   Um, because i've been a subscriber almost in state one and so the early days of youtube tv
[01:52:34.140 --> 01:52:38.460]   You could never watch nfl games on because it break up. It was low res
[01:52:38.460 --> 01:52:44.460]   It really come a long way. Yeah, have we closed the digital divide enough
[01:52:44.460 --> 01:52:50.460]   Such that youtube tv is going to reach all of the nfl's audience in an effective way
[01:52:50.460 --> 01:52:55.020]   Isn't that interesting the broadcast it doesn't affect the broadcast. I was wondering so thursday
[01:52:55.020 --> 01:52:58.380]   So thursday night football move to amazon. You don't get
[01:52:59.500 --> 01:53:02.540]   Last you won't get that on youtube. I don't think and you don't get it anywhere, right?
[01:53:02.540 --> 01:53:09.660]   I don't know what's gonna happen with the sun with the uh sunday ticket, but uh thursday because that's just sunday, but thursday
[01:53:09.660 --> 01:53:15.340]   Amazon and I was really wondering maybe you know something about this uh jason because
[01:53:15.340 --> 01:53:18.540]   It looked like the nfl was giving up a lot
[01:53:18.540 --> 01:53:23.660]   Going from broadcast tv to streaming
[01:53:23.660 --> 01:53:29.100]   But I my sense was it was actually a great success. It's just the
[01:53:29.500 --> 01:53:34.060]   Nfl doesn't get money from those advertising they get money from someone who says I want the rights to that
[01:53:34.060 --> 01:53:39.500]   So the nfl sells rights and so i'm sure that they made just as much money or more money probably more probably a lot more
[01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:45.900]   Um for thursday night to be only on on amazon. Yeah, and a lot of the ads were amazon properties, weren't they?
[01:53:45.900 --> 01:53:49.660]   And the thursday night games typically were crap
[01:53:49.660 --> 01:53:59.020]   But yes, but they spent money they got al michaels to you know and and kirk herb street to do it
[01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:05.100]   Right so they spent a lot of money on the best talent. You don't think al michaels is any good. Come on now. Don't get enough
[01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:08.300]   But he's good. Good. He's great. I'm saying they gave them the money
[01:54:08.300 --> 01:54:13.900]   To do it my al michaels is incredible at it. I just wish they would have pulled chris colin's worth with them
[01:54:13.900 --> 01:54:19.980]   I'm not a big fan of chris colin's worth, but that's only because he doesn't like the uh 49ers and he's always saying
[01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:25.660]   Uh, was this a success for amazon? They're doing it again this year, right?
[01:54:26.540 --> 01:54:32.380]   Was a success a success for them? I'm trying to remember what i'm trying to remember how many years the deal was maybe you remember out
[01:54:32.380 --> 01:54:33.660]   Well, the
[01:54:33.660 --> 01:54:36.060]   I think this was last year was the first year of the second
[01:54:36.060 --> 01:54:38.700]   I think last year was the first year that they had exclusive rights to it
[01:54:38.700 --> 01:54:42.300]   And they pulled the I mean that the team that does thursday night football
[01:54:42.300 --> 01:54:44.380]   I think is the old monday night football team
[01:54:44.380 --> 01:54:48.940]   So they so they really pulled um so they brought not only do they bring a great announcer?
[01:54:48.940 --> 01:54:51.180]   They brought the production team that's going to make it actually work
[01:54:51.180 --> 01:54:56.140]   Um or maybe it's the sunday sunday and football game. I think it's actually sunday the sunday night football team
[01:54:56.540 --> 01:55:00.140]   Came to the thursday night football team. Um, you know to the production team
[01:55:00.140 --> 01:55:05.500]   Um, you know kind of took it over so uh because the monday night football has not really been a thing espan kind of
[01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:11.900]   Like a little espan toy at this point. Um, but the sunday night football has been the big one like that's been the state of the art
[01:55:11.900 --> 01:55:17.180]   This is as good as live video gets a lot of us watch that as the ultimate
[01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:22.220]   Oh live experience amazon has exclusive rights through 20 33
[01:55:24.140 --> 01:55:26.140]   Yeah, pon your 10 years
[01:55:26.140 --> 01:55:29.580]   Well, and that's the I mean and those that's kind of how those deals happen
[01:55:29.580 --> 01:55:31.660]   You know, you don't they don't want to keep on negotiating them
[01:55:31.660 --> 01:55:35.340]   So they're like five or 10 years. Yeah, kind of the the standard standard fair
[01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:36.220]   But
[01:55:36.220 --> 01:55:42.620]   What it does allow them to do by not doing any broadcast it doesn't limit them to broadcast and and what I mean by that is the broadcast
[01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:49.420]   Pipeline the i mean someone who does this a lot the broadcast pipeline is so limited, you know by you know the frame rates the
[01:55:49.980 --> 01:55:56.300]   The resolutions the all the all the production is really really limited when you go into into broadcast
[01:55:56.300 --> 01:55:59.420]   Just because they don't have the money to upgrade as fast as you can do bits
[01:55:59.420 --> 01:56:03.420]   And so you just you you can make the bits better all the time and so we're seeing
[01:56:03.420 --> 01:56:10.220]   Uh, if you have a 4k tv with you know the stuff you're going to keep on seeing it get better and better and better off of your
[01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:14.620]   You know device your apple tv or whatever you're going to watch it on is going to keep on getting better
[01:56:15.020 --> 01:56:18.380]   Because they can evolve only the truck. They don't have to involve
[01:56:18.380 --> 01:56:22.300]   They don't have to improve the entire pipeline to get to your tv
[01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:27.580]   Um, and that gives them a huge advantage and that's why apple like mls is going to make a ton of sense for apple
[01:56:27.580 --> 01:56:31.260]   As the headset comes in because they're gonna be able to integrate it and they don't have to argue with any
[01:56:31.260 --> 01:56:37.740]   Broadcasters are oh we need to have tenety i and well and but mls was a much weaker league than nfl
[01:56:37.740 --> 01:56:43.500]   Uh nfl has a lot of it was i got only got one yeah, but amazon only got one night apple got all the
[01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:46.220]   All the nights
[01:56:46.220 --> 01:56:50.220]   So and as an innovation performance here's some numbers
[01:56:50.220 --> 01:56:55.420]   2022 season 46 drop in viewership
[01:56:55.420 --> 01:57:01.580]   Uh, but amazon was of the opinion that was because they were crappy games
[01:57:01.580 --> 01:57:07.740]   So they demanded better games starting this year teams are not required to have a thursday game
[01:57:07.740 --> 01:57:13.420]   Following a sunday while teams can play up to two thursday games following a sunday game per season
[01:57:13.980 --> 01:57:21.100]   They in other words they got more flexible and they probably logby bana fell for better a better schedule so amazon also
[01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:30.300]   Raised according to rumors anyway advertising rates 20 percent higher than previous cbs was the previous and fox with previous broadcaster
[01:57:30.300 --> 01:57:32.460]   uh
[01:57:32.460 --> 01:57:34.460]   But amazon will not allow
[01:57:34.460 --> 01:57:37.820]   Advertising that encourages glamorizes or depicts
[01:57:37.820 --> 01:57:41.740]   Excessive consumption of alcohol so there's no beer ads
[01:57:41.740 --> 01:57:52.620]   Well excessive amount of no no there's no beer ads i noticed there's no there's no client's deals marching through thursday night football
[01:57:52.620 --> 01:57:59.580]   Um, the league can apparently sell some slots so maybe the the league will and local broadcasters too
[01:57:59.580 --> 01:58:05.900]   So it's very it's interesting. I mean I obviously this is what the other that landscapes that's changed
[01:58:05.900 --> 01:58:10.460]   Previously broadcasters who were bidding for things like this expensive things like this
[01:58:11.180 --> 01:58:13.180]   Had to make it make sense financially
[01:58:13.180 --> 01:58:15.980]   Amazon
[01:58:15.980 --> 01:58:18.540]   It's a little more fungible. Well, this is the flexible
[01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:21.900]   Right both both amazon and apple have the advantage and to some degree youtube
[01:58:21.900 --> 01:58:24.940]   Have the advantage of what what I would call the kaiser so say model
[01:58:24.940 --> 01:58:28.700]   Which is that they they can make money and like, you know you always get paid more than the job is worth
[01:58:28.700 --> 01:58:30.620]   You know and they can all you they can do a bunch of things
[01:58:30.620 --> 01:58:37.980]   That are you know that they they can make money in so many different ways with the same product or even just the association with the product
[01:58:38.460 --> 01:58:41.180]   Or just you know, there's so many places for them to carve up and yeah
[01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:48.140]   Hard for the other media companies promotions or you know the rings of power and amazon prime day
[01:58:48.140 --> 01:58:49.900]   And i'm sure that's what we'll see again this season
[01:58:49.900 --> 01:58:57.020]   Have you seen how many ads around amazon today 40 40 billion dollars worth like they're an ad
[01:58:57.020 --> 01:59:03.420]   This is something I think a lot of people don't realize I didn't realize it's that I read your book amazon is an ad business as much as anything else
[01:59:04.700 --> 01:59:09.980]   I mean increasingly so and walmart for better or worse looks at that and says
[01:59:09.980 --> 01:59:18.300]   We can be an ad business too. Yeah, and uh went ahead and actually hired a for long time former amazon
[01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:20.620]   ad leader
[01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:25.260]   Who between stops went to insta cart and red ran revenue there and now is
[01:59:25.260 --> 01:59:34.300]   Running their loyalty program walmart plus and the ad business and I mean the question is right is at least on the product search
[01:59:34.460 --> 01:59:39.260]   You know on the shopping side of amazon is it you know, they'll make an argument. It's somehow
[01:59:39.260 --> 01:59:44.220]   Help small brands be noticed and can improve the experience
[01:59:44.220 --> 01:59:51.580]   But uh to some some sellers it just seems like an extra attack another amazon tax because they can
[01:59:51.580 --> 01:59:57.020]   But yes, they are an abbess. They're a tremendous tremendous ad business and increasingly so in video too
[01:59:57.020 --> 02:00:03.900]   And of course cori doctor wrote about this in his fame now world famous in shinification article
[02:00:04.380 --> 02:00:09.260]   That uh, you know, this is this is when amazon starts to screw everybody in order to
[02:00:09.260 --> 02:00:13.980]   Increase profits did you when you read that did that that ring a bell for you?
[02:00:13.980 --> 02:00:17.900]   Jason or did you feel like that was an inaccurate representation of amazon strategy
[02:00:17.900 --> 02:00:21.820]   Listen, I think um
[02:00:21.820 --> 02:00:27.820]   This this feels like an inflection point at the company or at least has the s you have the jassy transition
[02:00:27.820 --> 02:00:33.420]   You have the layoffs you have the cost cutting and investment areas like previous investment areas like alexa
[02:00:33.980 --> 02:00:38.940]   Um, I think it's I think it's unclear to me how far they'll go down this path
[02:00:38.940 --> 02:00:43.980]   But but you know, I was talking talking about this recently with a former executive amazon executive and uh
[02:00:43.980 --> 02:00:49.980]   He was described, you know, he was saying people go people a lot of most people go to that site
[02:00:49.980 --> 02:00:53.580]   They're in and out and uh the experience actually
[02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:59.660]   For a lot of people is they're still finding exactly what they want because they're not browsing they're going in and out
[02:00:59.660 --> 02:01:02.860]   Um, but yeah, you look at that site today
[02:01:03.820 --> 02:01:05.820]   and
[02:01:05.820 --> 02:01:11.020]   Not pleasant, right? And so so I think there's an argument to me bay that
[02:01:11.020 --> 02:01:17.820]   That there there's some stuff they're doing including the ad business because they can and um
[02:01:17.820 --> 02:01:25.900]   You know, we'll see I you know, I'm very interested to see what the next year under Andy jassy is like because he's gone through
[02:01:25.900 --> 02:01:28.220]   This cost cutting exercise over the past year
[02:01:28.780 --> 02:01:35.260]   And now he has a chance to show what what amazon under Andy jassy looks like and uh beyond cost cutting
[02:01:35.260 --> 02:01:37.980]   If he doesn't want to just be remembered for that how much
[02:01:37.980 --> 02:01:41.900]   When tib cook took over in apple, you know, the
[02:01:41.900 --> 02:01:47.740]   Practically steve jobs dying breath is don't ask what I would do do what you would do
[02:01:47.740 --> 02:01:55.340]   How much of that happened did Andy jassy? Uh, did jeff bezo say to Andy jassy not with his dying breath, obviously because
[02:01:56.620 --> 02:01:58.620]   Fitter than ever obviously
[02:01:58.620 --> 02:02:01.260]   Yeah, you know
[02:02:01.260 --> 02:02:05.340]   It's very interesting because there was there was an article in the wall street journal
[02:02:05.340 --> 02:02:12.300]   Maybe six or nine months ago about jassy cutting costs and really examining overspending and lack of discipline
[02:02:12.300 --> 02:02:18.300]   And there was an amazon board member quoted in the piece, you know saying like and this is you know
[02:02:18.300 --> 02:02:23.420]   We're behind dandy and it just felt very um stage managed
[02:02:24.380 --> 02:02:25.740]   Yes
[02:02:25.740 --> 02:02:30.220]   Yes, and that perhaps you know perhaps the easy man to blame
[02:02:30.220 --> 02:02:34.780]   You know with the undisciplined spending and the over expansion of
[02:02:34.780 --> 02:02:37.580]   Of you know the warehouse network
[02:02:37.580 --> 02:02:39.420]   uh was
[02:02:39.420 --> 02:02:45.420]   Was the ceo is no longer in charge and uh, you know, it doesn't seem like something like that could could
[02:02:45.420 --> 02:02:51.420]   Make bezo's unhappy these days when he's all fun a uh 500 million dollar yacht and
[02:02:52.300 --> 02:02:56.700]   And doing all the other things he's doing in his life. So, um, I think jassy had
[02:02:56.700 --> 02:03:02.380]   You know he came in and some executives left because he went into the weeds on businesses where
[02:03:02.380 --> 02:03:08.620]   Uh, bezo said long just let uh these who tenants do what they want. Yeah, and um
[02:03:08.620 --> 02:03:15.740]   So I do believe this is this he is not you know, this is not you know, he's not a puppet
[02:03:15.740 --> 02:03:20.300]   You know, this is this is his company now and so we'll see how long that lasts
[02:03:20.380 --> 02:03:25.660]   But uh, that's what it feels like to me right now and what best as I can tell that all that said like morale is
[02:03:25.660 --> 02:03:32.540]   Not good inside the company. Really? Um, no, I mean layoffs are one thing but uh has it ever been
[02:03:32.540 --> 02:03:40.140]   Uh, I would are you know, I heard the stories about executives crying at their desks, but that is sure
[02:03:40.140 --> 02:03:45.900]   No, sure like it's a cold it absolutely is a tough culture, but you you would talk to i've talked to
[02:03:46.540 --> 02:03:53.580]   tons of people over the years who do well there and they take the pros and the cons of the work culture, you know, sort of in stride and
[02:03:53.580 --> 02:03:54.620]   and
[02:03:54.620 --> 02:03:58.940]   I would say yeah during during years where um early years of
[02:03:58.940 --> 02:04:01.660]   Alexa or um
[02:04:01.660 --> 02:04:08.540]   Early years of prime there were people really excited about their job every day. They try to avoid jeff bezos
[02:04:08.540 --> 02:04:11.420]   um and his question mark emails, but um
[02:04:11.420 --> 02:04:14.700]   I'd say in in large swats of the company
[02:04:15.260 --> 02:04:21.260]   I don't know that morale has been worse and I think beyond the layoffs. I think that's not any worse. There we go
[02:04:21.260 --> 02:04:25.900]   I mean, I think the communic the communication what what I talk
[02:04:25.900 --> 02:04:30.940]   I talk to some people there and there are people who like working there and I talk to some folks when the layoffs happen
[02:04:30.940 --> 02:04:37.020]   And they said it's not even that we had layoffs like we weren't going to grow forever unchecked, but
[02:04:37.020 --> 02:04:42.860]   just the terrible communication a lack of communication just the execution of it was
[02:04:43.740 --> 02:04:46.460]   just atrocious and just uh so
[02:04:46.460 --> 02:04:51.820]   I don't know it always sounds like when I talked to I have a bunch of friends that work at amazon
[02:04:51.820 --> 02:04:55.980]   Yeah, it always sounds like such a grind and it always just seems like they're just tired
[02:04:55.980 --> 02:05:00.220]   like, you know and they and they um, you know, they don't there's not a lot of for my friends
[02:05:00.220 --> 02:05:03.420]   There's not a lot of other places to go that they what they are there is pretty specialized
[02:05:03.420 --> 02:05:07.180]   And so they you know like they don't have that skill set doesn't necessarily copy
[02:05:07.180 --> 02:05:13.580]   But there's this kind of steady flow of them into other companies when they can find something else and and it's always the the fact that
[02:05:13.580 --> 02:05:18.060]   It's just so it feels so micromanaged. I think is what a lot of people feel like, you know
[02:05:18.060 --> 02:05:24.620]   You're always grinding up against the the margin and the process and how much everything costs and everything's penny pitching and it's fine
[02:05:24.620 --> 02:05:26.700]   It's just that it's just like no one that I know of
[02:05:26.700 --> 02:05:33.340]   Was bought by amazon. Mm-hmm and thought life got better like, you know, like nobody says I got bought
[02:05:33.340 --> 02:05:38.780]   We had a great company culture and then we were bought by amazon and then it got even better. That's no
[02:05:39.660 --> 02:05:45.500]   Said never no one ever, you know, like they're like we got into amazon and we got ground into a little, you know, pulp
[02:05:45.500 --> 02:05:50.540]   You know and now they take amazon's got this thing where they they rotate your side, you know, I work with vote
[02:05:50.540 --> 02:05:55.740]   They rotate your salespeople all the time like they just so you never know you're like you'll get
[02:05:55.740 --> 02:05:59.900]   Embedded and someone understands how your business works and you're talking to them every week
[02:05:59.900 --> 02:06:03.820]   And then like six months into it. They're like, oh, there's a new salesperson and it's like some
[02:06:03.820 --> 02:06:09.020]   I'm like what happened and and it and it just and then I just stopped having meetings with them because I was like i'm tired of that
[02:06:09.020 --> 02:06:12.620]   Like I don't want to why talk to a salesperson if I if you're gonna keep on changing
[02:06:12.620 --> 02:06:18.060]   Like I'll just tell you when I need something, you know, it just and we have the same exact experience with the
[02:06:18.060 --> 02:06:21.420]   Ad agencies, but that's another story for another day
[02:06:21.420 --> 02:06:25.980]   Let me take a break great panel again
[02:06:25.980 --> 02:06:28.460]   Too good the conversation
[02:06:28.460 --> 02:06:35.020]   Which has allowed me to get way behind so i'm gonna get a couple ads in here and we will have more with Alex lindsey
[02:06:35.100 --> 02:06:39.420]   It's great to have you on the big show on the at the grown-up table
[02:06:39.420 --> 02:06:42.380]   It's good to have a wider, you know, like we're always on my
[02:06:42.380 --> 02:06:45.260]   We always have to talk about a little bong. This is much more. Yeah, exactly
[02:06:45.260 --> 02:06:51.020]   Jason del Rey expert on amazon am walmart. How's this more out at walmart? I mean are people happy to be there?
[02:06:51.020 --> 02:07:00.220]   I think it's it's better than it's been if you care about the future of the company outside of the walls of a store
[02:07:00.940 --> 02:07:05.500]   You care about digital. I think I think it probably hasn't been better
[02:07:05.500 --> 02:07:10.860]   Now is that saying a lot when you look at their history and e-commerce? Maybe not, but I think
[02:07:10.860 --> 02:07:16.860]   They're bullish about the future though. I think I think so. I think so a lot of people I talked to
[02:07:16.860 --> 02:07:21.340]   That's really interesting the book winner sells all just came out
[02:07:21.340 --> 02:07:25.820]   Available in all platforms including audible. Did you read the audible version?
[02:07:27.660 --> 02:07:31.500]   Thank goodness for everyone who listens to that. I did not
[02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:39.180]   But I have there's a fabulous narrator who he I realize looking through his portfolio beyond some great business books
[02:07:39.180 --> 02:07:40.620]   um
[02:07:40.620 --> 02:07:44.220]   Some romance novels as well. So you get a really different kind of
[02:07:44.220 --> 02:07:48.860]   reading roger way and i was able to put the lust back into
[02:07:48.860 --> 02:07:55.580]   Walmart and amazon all right. I mean, I highly recommend all the version roger
[02:07:56.220 --> 02:07:59.260]   The levers coral version with two questions of his own
[02:07:59.260 --> 02:08:05.100]   Did you just ask me what I was wearing he deadpan? Oh, it sounds like a romance novel
[02:08:05.100 --> 02:08:07.020]   Can't wait
[02:08:07.020 --> 02:08:14.940]   Uh winner sells all at finder book stories everywhere and the wonderful denise hall. Did you just ask me what I was wearing?
[02:08:14.940 --> 02:08:17.900]   Uh, I'm wearing no, I did not
[02:08:17.900 --> 02:08:23.820]   That was me and chev that was me and jeff bezo spot the way but we can everyone can listen to that
[02:08:24.860 --> 02:08:29.980]   That's the sample and audible actually you should because this was a former sponsor tailor store designed this so
[02:08:29.980 --> 02:08:33.420]   Ooh, yeah, I still have all my scott e best stuff. Yes
[02:08:33.420 --> 02:08:36.460]   Basically sponsors dress us

[02:09:13.820 --> 02:09:17.660]   7,000 hours and counting of on-demand

[02:09:21.660 --> 02:09:25.260]   Information but also entertaining and engaging which is great
[02:09:25.260 --> 02:09:28.540]   You know 30 percent of aci learners are msp's
[02:09:28.540 --> 02:09:36.380]   Did you know that managed service providers aci learning is dedicated to supporting your msp team through any challenge
[02:09:36.380 --> 02:09:45.500]   Msp's love aci learning practice labs because you can actually try out configurations experiment with tools before deploying new apps or updates
[02:09:45.500 --> 02:09:47.820]   And they don't compromise your live system
[02:09:47.820 --> 02:09:53.660]   In fact, if you screw up which I often do you just close the tab in your browser and all is forgiven
[02:09:53.660 --> 02:09:58.220]   That's a great way to try stuff out before you do you can also test out your skills
[02:09:58.220 --> 02:10:05.660]   On their virtual machine labs with multiple instances of windows server and desktop clients and it runs anywhere os 10 linux
[02:10:05.660 --> 02:10:10.700]   iOS windows even on chrome books because any html5 browser works fine
[02:10:10.700 --> 02:10:14.700]   You can prepare for challenging certification exams with practice questions
[02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:20.540]   I love the idea of taking the test before you take the test so you know when you're ready to sit for the exam
[02:10:20.540 --> 02:10:29.260]   One happy msp team leader said quote. I had 110 engineers in the field. We had dozens of it pro accounts last year alone
[02:10:29.260 --> 02:10:38.460]   They passed over 40 certs. Keep your team sharp learning expanding. They love it. You'll love it your customers will love it
[02:10:39.100 --> 02:10:45.100]   If your it training isn't raising your team to the level you aspire you need aci learning
[02:10:45.100 --> 02:10:49.820]   Aci learning makes great videos by the way, I just want I like to throw this stat in because it's great
[02:10:49.820 --> 02:10:53.580]   The training industry average completion rate on videos is 30
[02:10:53.580 --> 02:10:59.260]   That means one that's 70 percent just bail out before it's over because they're not fun. They're boring
[02:10:59.260 --> 02:11:05.980]   With aci learning 80 completion rate because it's informative, but it's also entertaining engaging
[02:11:06.380 --> 02:11:09.980]   These people are your friends. It's a wonderful way to learn
[02:11:09.980 --> 02:11:19.100]   Don't settle for subpar training your team your your your your it team wants this you want this if you're trying to get into it
[02:11:19.100 --> 02:11:20.860]   You can uh
[02:11:20.860 --> 02:11:26.460]   By the way the pro portal is great if you have a team that you want to get training for gives you all the information
[02:11:26.460 --> 02:11:33.260]   Metrics like logins viewing times courses viewed tracks completed really great way to manage your team and to prove
[02:11:33.740 --> 02:11:37.500]   Return on investment too. They get great visual reports if you are

[02:11:42.940 --> 02:11:49.660]   Uh other training companies may not comply with regulatory requirements, but aci learning holds an ISO certification

[02:13:05.100 --> 02:13:07.100]   Uh
[02:13:07.100 --> 02:13:12.460]   Don't know what this means gannett the publishers of usa today are suing google
[02:13:12.460 --> 02:13:17.100]   This is you know google's in trouble with the EU with the ftc and now
[02:13:17.100 --> 02:13:20.380]   you you like the idea of
[02:13:21.100 --> 02:13:21.980]   suing
[02:13:21.980 --> 02:13:25.340]   Alex Lindsay the publisher of usa today says google
[02:13:25.340 --> 02:13:28.700]   Legally monopolizes the advertising technology
[02:13:28.700 --> 02:13:33.260]   Market, this is kind of similar with the doj is already saying
[02:13:33.260 --> 02:13:39.740]   They're right the right to a day in court. I don't know how you fix the but I don't know how you fix the problem
[02:13:39.740 --> 02:13:42.460]   but I definitely think they have the right to
[02:13:42.460 --> 02:13:44.940]   Figure it out which is to hash it out with them
[02:13:45.340 --> 02:13:51.420]   Um, I'd rather see it done in court than necessarily than trying to have the ftc or the EU try to figure out how to fix it
[02:13:51.420 --> 02:13:54.300]   I think that um, I think that chances of winning are pretty low
[02:13:54.300 --> 02:13:59.580]   Um, but I think that that it uh, it's interesting. I just don't know how to unwrap
[02:13:59.580 --> 02:14:02.940]   The the media industry is so entwined
[02:14:02.940 --> 02:14:08.620]   With the advert google advertising that I get that they don't like it and they're frustrated by it
[02:14:08.620 --> 02:14:11.100]   But if google stops linking to them
[02:14:11.740 --> 02:14:15.980]   Like you know that facebook is what facebook can possibly google is talking about in canada
[02:14:15.980 --> 02:14:17.980]   They'll die
[02:14:17.980 --> 02:14:21.500]   Like that'll be the end like it's not you know, they say hey, we're not gonna pay for this
[02:14:21.500 --> 02:14:22.620]   We're just gonna cut you off
[02:14:22.620 --> 02:14:27.260]   They'll just they'll all you know the governments will have to come in and pay for everything because there there won't be any more money
[02:14:27.260 --> 02:14:30.380]   So so I think that it's it's complicated. It's a really
[02:14:30.380 --> 02:14:34.780]   Complicated thing. I will say that the ad at I don't know how to unwrap what's going on
[02:14:34.780 --> 02:14:36.940]   But you know, I've been in a lot of meetings
[02:14:36.940 --> 02:14:39.260]   Around advertising with google and facebook and
[02:14:39.740 --> 02:14:44.700]   Understanding how their algorithm works is like looking into the sun like it is an incredible
[02:14:44.700 --> 02:14:50.460]   Amount of i power like it's just any other complaints that they own both sides of the equation, right?
[02:14:50.460 --> 02:14:53.980]   They said they run the market. They also are a buyer. They're also a seller
[02:14:53.980 --> 02:14:59.420]   I mean, right it's it's as entwined and messed up as possible and I think anybody looks at it says yeah
[02:14:59.420 --> 02:15:03.820]   This is not a competitive situation, but you're right. I don't know how you unwind it
[02:15:03.820 --> 02:15:06.620]   um, you mentioned canada canada
[02:15:07.500 --> 02:15:10.700]   Past a link text. This is this is one of jeff javis's
[02:15:10.700 --> 02:15:16.220]   You know hated like some jeep correct or whatever he calls it the link tax
[02:15:16.220 --> 02:15:18.060]   um
[02:15:18.060 --> 02:15:20.780]   Canada has passed c18
[02:15:20.780 --> 02:15:23.820]   And as a result
[02:15:23.820 --> 02:15:26.860]   Facebook is saying okay fine
[02:15:26.860 --> 02:15:30.860]   You don't want you don't want to news. We'll see you later
[02:15:30.860 --> 02:15:34.620]   Uh, that's one that's one way to do it
[02:15:34.620 --> 02:15:36.140]   uh
[02:15:36.140 --> 02:15:41.660]   The the premise needed that in australia too. Yeah, the premise is how it started. Oh geez meta
[02:15:41.660 --> 02:15:43.740]   You're making money off of our content
[02:15:43.740 --> 02:15:47.740]   Metas. I think quite reasonable responses. Well, if that's how you feel about it
[02:15:47.740 --> 02:15:54.700]   We don't have to send you any more traffic and what in there inevitably happens is these news media suffer as a result, right?
[02:15:54.700 --> 02:15:59.820]   So this is another one where I don't know what the answer is but clearly c18 was not
[02:15:59.820 --> 02:16:02.860]   uh, the answer
[02:16:03.340 --> 02:16:08.700]   Yeah in a world where people don't have print publications delivered to their doors anymore
[02:16:08.700 --> 02:16:11.820]   um except books
[02:16:11.820 --> 02:16:12.940]   except books
[02:16:12.940 --> 02:16:14.940]   Yes in the wonderful book, uh
[02:16:14.940 --> 02:16:17.740]   Yes
[02:16:17.740 --> 02:16:18.780]   Denny's go ahead
[02:16:18.780 --> 02:16:20.940]   Yeah, no and actually um
[02:16:20.940 --> 02:16:24.940]   Some people do have print publications delivered to their doors. Some people really
[02:16:24.940 --> 02:16:26.540]   Enjoy that
[02:16:26.540 --> 02:16:31.180]   You know feeling of the newspaper in their hand, but I love holding a hardcover
[02:16:31.500 --> 02:16:35.260]   Book of something like uh winter sells all in my hands
[02:16:35.260 --> 02:16:37.660]   And reading it
[02:16:37.660 --> 02:16:42.140]   Oxy I got the kindle as you can see I got the kindle version of it because I was in a hurry
[02:16:42.140 --> 02:16:46.700]   Uh, I will listen to the audio uh book version. That's easier for me
[02:16:46.700 --> 02:16:51.820]   I think I tend to do do the audibles and that narrator sounded intriguing stuff
[02:16:51.820 --> 02:16:55.820]   I love that line they use that was great. Yeah, what are you wearing?
[02:16:55.820 --> 02:16:59.020]   Right, but I'm saying, you know the way the way I find that
[02:16:59.660 --> 02:17:07.500]   The New York Times or the Washington Post or the Boston Herald has done a story on something that I'm interested in is because someone has linked
[02:17:07.500 --> 02:17:08.700]   That's right
[02:17:08.700 --> 02:17:12.860]   Yeah, and that's what everybody learned. That's what they learned in spain when google pulled in the news
[02:17:12.860 --> 02:17:16.940]   Uh, it's what i'm sure they'll learn in australia and i'm sure canada is going to be next
[02:17:16.940 --> 02:17:20.780]   In australia, they worked it. I mean I think they worked it out where they they turned it off
[02:17:20.780 --> 02:17:23.980]   And then they went back and negotiated with heaven. Yeah, they don't quite fit into that
[02:17:23.980 --> 02:17:26.300]   You know, so it took a couple weeks of a little bit of a
[02:17:26.700 --> 02:17:30.540]   Thing we're willing to talk to you, but we're you're not going to make any money until you know until you went
[02:17:30.540 --> 02:17:35.900]   Do we figure this out? So I think it I think that they were able to kind of find a middle ground that the government couldn't find
[02:17:35.900 --> 02:17:40.700]   Um, you know in that in that area. So I think that that maybe the government forced that forward
[02:17:40.700 --> 02:17:45.100]   I don't know who got the better in the case of australia. It was ruper mordock
[02:17:45.100 --> 02:17:48.780]   You know, he he didn't he wanted money a little money at a google
[02:17:48.780 --> 02:17:51.340]   and google
[02:17:51.340 --> 02:17:56.140]   Bristled and I think that he got a little money out of google is what I think the final result was
[02:17:56.620 --> 02:17:58.620]   Maybe not as much as he was hoping for
[02:17:58.620 --> 02:18:04.540]   Uh, I think that one of the things that the that the publishers really missed the boat on this one
[02:18:04.540 --> 02:18:07.660]   I mean there were I did a talk in 20 in 2002
[02:18:07.660 --> 02:18:12.620]   Of like you should move all your subscribers all your current subscribers online
[02:18:12.620 --> 02:18:16.780]   And literally was laughed at by hundreds of publishers
[02:18:16.780 --> 02:18:22.860]   Like you could hear them chuckling about you know talking about this little thing and the only company that came up to me after
[02:18:22.860 --> 02:18:26.540]   My talk was new york times like, you know, like they and they were way ahead of me
[02:18:26.540 --> 02:18:28.540]   They were they they had been thinking about this for a while
[02:18:28.540 --> 02:18:30.540]   They were it's not like I told them something they didn't know
[02:18:30.540 --> 02:18:33.100]   They and they you know, they're making a lot of money
[02:18:33.100 --> 02:18:38.220]   They're you know, this isn't a and and the publishers really, you know, this I think it's an incredible
[02:18:38.220 --> 02:18:44.220]   Lesson in taking your current situation and making sure that you're leveraging it into your into your future
[02:18:44.220 --> 02:18:48.300]   And most of these publishers did not do it at all or did not do it very effectively
[02:18:48.300 --> 02:18:50.940]   And didn't really care about it until it was already too late
[02:18:51.900 --> 02:18:54.620]   one of the things that happened when we
[02:18:54.620 --> 02:19:00.540]   First checked into disney land. We showed our barcode, which was on our disney app
[02:19:00.540 --> 02:19:03.180]   Which I have immediately deleted as soon as I left
[02:19:03.180 --> 02:19:07.900]   I did not buy the magic genie ban which apparently does gps tracking
[02:19:07.900 --> 02:19:10.620]   Of your position in the park
[02:19:10.620 --> 02:19:18.300]   Of course my phone was doing that while I had the app on but I scanned my ticket and then they said okay smile and they took a picture of me
[02:19:19.420 --> 02:19:25.420]   Turns out disney's been using face recognition at disney land and disney world and other disney parks
[02:19:25.420 --> 02:19:31.660]   Uh, not sure exactly they say it's to understand the guest behavior
[02:19:31.660 --> 02:19:38.140]   There are also cameras all over the park now that they know what you look like they know exactly where you are and what you're doing
[02:19:38.140 --> 02:19:40.700]   And whether you're smiling
[02:19:40.700 --> 02:19:43.500]   A lot of that also has to do with
[02:19:43.500 --> 02:19:45.900]   predator deflection
[02:19:45.900 --> 02:19:47.020]   You know, they
[02:19:47.020 --> 02:19:50.060]   I agree, you know, I remember you walk in I remember Taylor swift
[02:19:50.060 --> 02:19:54.300]   Turning away a stalker because she uses
[02:19:54.300 --> 02:20:01.500]   Face recognition under concerts. I thought that wasn't a bad thing and then I remember the owner of a madison square garden
[02:20:01.500 --> 02:20:03.420]   Oof
[02:20:03.420 --> 02:20:05.660]   Sorry a long time suffering nix fan here
[02:20:05.660 --> 02:20:11.340]   Just the words make you feel bad, but the uh, that was the dorans own it right
[02:20:11.660 --> 02:20:21.100]   Dolan dolan says it james dolan, uh, who was mad that m s g was being sued by some attorneys
[02:20:21.100 --> 02:20:24.140]   uh decided to
[02:20:24.140 --> 02:20:27.900]   Turn away an attorney that they recognized
[02:20:27.900 --> 02:20:30.540]   Uh from a nix game
[02:20:30.540 --> 02:20:34.300]   He's known for being petty says vandy fair
[02:20:34.300 --> 02:20:39.100]   So there's that is the nicest thing anyone has ever said about james dolan
[02:20:40.620 --> 02:20:45.420]   There was not he will ban me. I have like a small ticket package. So I better no
[02:20:45.420 --> 02:20:48.940]   He's a wonderful fella and uh, and you love your nix
[02:20:48.940 --> 02:20:54.860]   tickets, uh man, uh according to rolling stone uh tomarello and zak de la russia
[02:20:54.860 --> 02:20:57.820]   and boots riley
[02:20:57.820 --> 02:21:02.300]   Three, uh, apparently performing artists. I don't know but uh, they i'm told
[02:21:02.300 --> 02:21:06.380]   Are among a hundred other performers calling for ban
[02:21:07.020 --> 02:21:09.980]   A ban on face recognition at live events
[02:21:09.980 --> 02:21:15.020]   Morello de la russia and boots rally say we're not going to perform at venues
[02:21:15.020 --> 02:21:21.820]   Rage against the machine is tomarello's band, uh, and zak de la russia boots rally speedy or tease
[02:21:21.820 --> 02:21:24.700]   Uh say they will not perform
[02:21:24.700 --> 02:21:27.580]   Uh at those venues, which is going to really I think
[02:21:27.580 --> 02:21:32.380]   Limit their you know billy joles not leave in madness and square garden i'm just going to say
[02:21:32.380 --> 02:21:36.620]   Uh, but there are smaller independent concert venues
[02:21:37.580 --> 02:21:40.540]   Who have pledged not to use face recognition
[02:21:40.540 --> 02:21:45.500]   And at the same time though, I feel like you know that was a boon for taylor swift
[02:21:45.500 --> 02:21:47.980]   so
[02:21:47.980 --> 02:21:50.140]   I'm I have mixed feelings again about this one
[02:21:50.140 --> 02:21:56.380]   I have mixed feelings about it too. Obviously, you know the more privacy the better and the more that we can
[02:21:56.380 --> 02:22:02.060]   Hold this off the longer we can hold this off probably the better, but I do think it's inevitable
[02:22:02.060 --> 02:22:05.900]   Where we're going to go through the world and you know
[02:22:06.460 --> 02:22:10.380]   You got to regulate it though. I mean james dolan shouldn't be able to ban
[02:22:10.380 --> 02:22:16.620]   An attorney from brandy carlile concert because her firm was suing msg
[02:22:16.620 --> 02:22:19.420]   So that's clearly
[02:22:19.420 --> 02:22:26.380]   Over the top, but if it's a security thing at disney or to taylor swift concert to prevent stalking and harassment
[02:22:26.380 --> 02:22:31.580]   That seems like a good usage. I guess there's also the issue of false positives
[02:22:33.740 --> 02:22:35.740]   There are I mean I
[02:22:35.740 --> 02:22:39.340]   Large venues are really dangerous place like just so you know from a security perspective
[02:22:39.340 --> 02:22:44.220]   I was thrilled like so in order to get close to disney land not even enter it
[02:22:44.220 --> 02:22:50.140]   But in order to go to downtown disney you have to go through metal detector and they search your banks and you know what?
[02:22:50.140 --> 02:22:52.540]   I was thrilled
[02:22:52.540 --> 02:22:55.580]   I don't like that big public disney anymore
[02:22:55.580 --> 02:23:00.700]   I I you know I was talking to someone that I where I was doing an event disney land and um
[02:23:01.180 --> 02:23:04.380]   It's talking to someone there about it and they I said oh, I've never brought my kids here
[02:23:04.380 --> 02:23:09.820]   Like I've never gone to disney land and uh, I did after this after this conversation because he said why would you not not take
[02:23:09.820 --> 02:23:13.180]   Not only the happiest. It's the most secure place on earth
[02:23:13.180 --> 02:23:16.940]   Boy, he said I said i'm afraid i'm gonna lose them and he goes. Oh he goes
[02:23:16.940 --> 02:23:22.140]   They never get lost they just get misplaced for a little while and and and he said and and he said because it's a billion
[02:23:22.140 --> 02:23:25.020]   Dollar problem for disney. I mean like we think about this all the time. Oh, yeah
[02:23:25.020 --> 02:23:28.540]   And he said what you know and he said we usually we can reunite you with
[02:23:29.020 --> 02:23:33.500]   As soon as your child knows as soon as you know and sometimes before you know that you've been separated
[02:23:33.500 --> 02:23:36.460]   We've already found your child. There's people watching on this camera
[02:23:36.460 --> 02:23:41.340]   So basically yeah other than the bathrooms and in the eat some of the eatery places
[02:23:41.340 --> 02:23:46.140]   Everything's under camera and when they when they see when they see a child who is lost
[02:23:46.140 --> 02:23:52.300]   Um who's crying can't find them the every character there is trained
[02:23:52.300 --> 02:23:57.820]   Is no they're just all trained to to make it and their goal is to make it a better experience for the problem they got lost
[02:23:57.900 --> 02:23:59.420]   They're five mikki's
[02:23:59.420 --> 02:24:02.220]   I know and they have they have fun and they talk to them
[02:24:02.220 --> 02:24:05.820]   Yeah, but what they do in the video is they they they watch the kid go back
[02:24:05.820 --> 02:24:09.420]   They back up the video backwards until they're with their their parents
[02:24:09.420 --> 02:24:13.980]   And then they go forward with the parents until they until they know where their parents were and they close that gap
[02:24:13.980 --> 02:24:17.420]   And they do it and I said well how many this is like this is incredible
[02:24:17.420 --> 02:24:19.420]   I said how many times do you do that a day?
[02:24:19.420 --> 02:24:22.140]   You know he goes oh like 150 hundred thousand times a day
[02:24:22.140 --> 02:24:26.620]   Like you know like like you know like it's it's like it's not even like it's just like they're you know
[02:24:26.620 --> 02:24:29.340]   And but but he said this is the safest place in the world for kids
[02:24:29.340 --> 02:24:30.780]   I guess with
[02:24:30.780 --> 02:24:35.820]   Spatial recognition and the app they could let you know on your phone. Hey, we've got eventually
[02:24:35.820 --> 02:24:39.260]   And that would be an a non-threatening. We've got your kid
[02:24:39.260 --> 02:24:41.660]   We did
[02:24:41.660 --> 02:24:43.180]   We don't want to discuss facial recognition
[02:24:43.180 --> 02:24:47.340]   You know we did talk about facial recognition and and that was at least at the time
[02:24:47.340 --> 02:24:51.740]   It was all about child predators and so the thing is you don't make it
[02:24:51.740 --> 02:24:55.100]   You don't make it to the turnstiles like you know like like they will they're
[02:24:55.100 --> 02:24:57.820]   That's appropriate. That's why they ask you when you get to the turnstile
[02:24:57.820 --> 02:25:02.220]   That's why they ask you to take your hat off. Yeah, so that they're facial recognition. That's completely appropriate
[02:25:02.220 --> 02:25:03.020]   You know
[02:25:03.020 --> 02:25:07.980]   Yeah, and so but they're like that that's a big problem for us like we can't have that happen and we'll do anything frankly
[02:25:07.980 --> 02:25:13.980]   It's great to have metal detectors. I don't you know, let's not have handguns in the Disney world
[02:25:13.980 --> 02:25:16.700]   I don't think that's a bad thing
[02:25:16.700 --> 02:25:21.100]   So I think that and I'm usually not the security like the heavy like we should allow all the stuff as
[02:25:21.580 --> 02:25:28.460]   You've seen Mac break. I'm usually against most of those things. Yeah, but I will say that if you when you understand how porous these these large venues are
[02:25:28.460 --> 02:25:34.220]   And and how easy it would be to do horrible things there. Yeah, I have a hard time going to those things knowing
[02:25:34.220 --> 02:25:37.340]   I don't want to be where the crowd is I work in a lot of these events
[02:25:37.340 --> 02:25:45.020]   And I stay behind stage all the whole time and with the notion that and we have protocols of like what will happen if something happens
[02:25:45.020 --> 02:25:50.780]   And we have to talk through those on every single show. Yeah, you know and like where do we go? What's our egress? What's our you know
[02:25:51.580 --> 02:25:55.340]   Safe because I was waiting for I did not ride the matter horn
[02:25:55.340 --> 02:26:00.700]   So I'm standing there's one place where the people come down at the end of the matter. I was the one I rode that was it
[02:26:00.700 --> 02:26:07.020]   I was a matter horner. How do you feel now? Huh? Um, Lisa said her back still hurts
[02:26:07.020 --> 02:26:14.220]   My son was five. It was the I took him along and I didn't want him to jump off behind me
[02:26:14.220 --> 02:26:17.900]   So I said oh just go in front of me. They put him in the first car
[02:26:18.060 --> 02:26:24.140]   Oh, that's like five years old and all he just he loved it hung on to that thing and all I could hear is him yelling. I'm not scared
[02:26:24.140 --> 02:26:32.860]   With my camera because I want to get a picture of them coming down
[02:26:32.860 --> 02:26:39.740]   And I noticed within a less than a minute that a security guy is standing across from me
[02:26:39.740 --> 02:26:41.980]   Just not
[02:26:41.980 --> 02:26:43.820]   Hostily or anything just standing there
[02:26:44.860 --> 02:26:52.540]   Looking at me and I noticed that and then I I went and sat down and he went on with his way. They are very
[02:26:52.540 --> 02:26:56.220]   Good. I didn't that didn't bother me. I thought that's appropriate
[02:26:56.220 --> 02:26:58.780]   That's appropriate
[02:26:58.780 --> 02:27:03.660]   So this is why I'm torn on this. Hey, if your band's name is rage against the machine
[02:27:03.660 --> 02:27:08.140]   You probably should be against face recognition of venues. I understand
[02:27:08.140 --> 02:27:11.260]   But but I'm thinking
[02:27:11.260 --> 02:27:14.940]   If I'm Taylor Swift, I want that protection. I think that's a good sound
[02:27:14.940 --> 02:27:18.860]   And I think that we also underestimate how much facial recognition someone says oh
[02:27:18.860 --> 02:27:24.220]   They're doing facial recognition at the event as as if they're not doing facial recognition on all the streets that lead up
[02:27:24.220 --> 02:27:29.820]   And everywhere and all the other things that are happening. I mean, look, it's like not like they they found a lot when the
[02:27:29.820 --> 02:27:35.420]   Boston bombers, you know, Boston Marathon bombing they knew who they were pretty quickly
[02:27:35.420 --> 02:27:39.980]   Like you know, like it was it was they were they were able to suck that data out pretty pretty fast
[02:27:40.060 --> 02:27:43.020]   So it's you know, this there's a lot there already
[02:27:43.020 --> 02:27:45.420]   Yeah
[02:27:45.420 --> 02:27:49.420]   The Madison Square Garden thing always cracked me up because it evinced such
[02:27:49.420 --> 02:27:55.660]   Misunderstanding of how large law firms actually work. Yeah, I mean large law firms
[02:27:55.660 --> 02:28:02.300]   Don't know all the disputes that they are handling not not every member of the firm knows exactly all the litigation
[02:28:02.300 --> 02:28:08.060]   They're involved in and because one attorney can't go see brandy carlile or a nix game
[02:28:08.300 --> 02:28:13.020]   They're not gonna. Oh, well, we better drop the lawsuit against the dolons. That's not gonna happen either
[02:28:13.020 --> 02:28:16.940]   It's just petty. It petty's the right word for it. It's BS
[02:28:16.940 --> 02:28:22.300]   It I will say, you know with everything. It's not a matter of oh, we're gonna drop the lawsuit
[02:28:22.300 --> 02:28:26.860]   It does add a little friction to the this is why you shouldn't he shouldn't be allowed to do this
[02:28:26.860 --> 02:28:31.580]   It does add friction to the next case like the next case is like well, this better be good because you know
[02:28:31.580 --> 02:28:34.140]   It's your next games
[02:28:34.140 --> 02:28:37.980]   You know like like so so like like and it doesn't mean that they're not gonna take the case if it's a good case
[02:28:37.980 --> 02:28:40.460]   But it does mean that if it's not a really good case. They're like
[02:28:40.460 --> 02:28:42.940]   Really worth this, you know like I wish we just
[02:28:42.940 --> 02:28:47.260]   Are you when you go to medicine square garden Jason to see your your team?
[02:28:47.260 --> 02:28:51.660]   I'm I'm usually pretty distracted by some
[02:28:51.660 --> 02:28:55.180]   turmoil or
[02:28:55.180 --> 02:28:59.100]   A fist fight in the stands they've been they've been they've been placed on me
[02:28:59.100 --> 02:29:02.460]   I would have had a lot better more
[02:29:03.100 --> 02:29:09.500]   scene upbringing if my dad never took me to an extreme. I mean, and now I'm doing the same thing to my 10 year old son and
[02:29:09.500 --> 02:29:11.820]   seven year old daughter, so
[02:29:11.820 --> 02:29:19.020]   Alex I wanted to ask Alex you were talking about just we're talking about facial recognition. You're talking about whole foods earlier
[02:29:19.020 --> 02:29:21.820]   Are you do you pay with your palm? Are you letting them?
[02:29:21.820 --> 02:29:24.940]   Connect your credit card with your palm
[02:29:24.940 --> 02:29:27.260]   by metrics
[02:29:27.260 --> 02:29:30.700]   They what did they do they did something with that?
[02:29:31.260 --> 02:29:36.540]   No, I I use my my apple pay. Okay. I just use my watch, you know most of the time when I'm at Whole Foods
[02:29:36.540 --> 02:29:41.420]   That's a really good solution because apples protecting your privacy
[02:29:41.420 --> 02:29:47.340]   Uh is still very good. They do I mean the bottom line is is I use the little thing that potentially will save me
[02:29:47.340 --> 02:29:52.140]   20 cents like it never gets me any money for whatever I buy never gets me
[02:29:52.140 --> 02:29:56.540]   I never buy with things that are on sale evidently and so so it never gets many money
[02:29:56.540 --> 02:30:00.220]   But it knows like the one thing is if I go to if I want to buy food online
[02:30:00.220 --> 02:30:04.460]   It's like here's all the things you bought at Whole Foods for the last 10 years
[02:30:04.460 --> 02:30:09.420]   Is that a feature? No, I don't I use it as a fee
[02:30:09.420 --> 02:30:13.580]   I will say that it is a little bit of a feature if I'm trying if I'm trying to order some of these for Whole Foods
[02:30:13.580 --> 02:30:19.420]   Scan your Whole Foods code every time. Yeah, if you want to steal my hose foods code go ahead use it
[02:30:19.420 --> 02:30:21.420]   It changes it changes all the time
[02:30:21.420 --> 02:30:25.820]   It changes all the time. Yeah, so it's so the um because it'll be like oh, it's too old
[02:30:25.820 --> 02:30:29.100]   If I don't put it up after I turned it on whatever and oh look at that
[02:30:29.100 --> 02:30:31.100]   I don't you know, I I think that
[02:30:31.100 --> 02:30:33.340]   I used to
[02:30:33.340 --> 02:30:38.460]   I mean I was the kind of guy that was like I would burn like Colorado has this you have to give your thumbprints
[02:30:38.460 --> 02:30:43.420]   And I would literally put my thumb thumbs on a hot plate before I went there and just burn them off
[02:30:43.420 --> 02:30:49.260]   Just to be difficult, you know, and um so that's how much I was anti like do not follow me around
[02:30:49.260 --> 02:30:53.420]   I don't want to give you any information that I have to but at the same time and I would grow like a
[02:30:53.420 --> 02:30:57.420]   I would grow beard and I would do all kinds of weird things because I'll just angry that they were asking for that
[02:30:57.420 --> 02:31:01.660]   After you learn how deep it is you're kind of like you gave up
[02:31:01.660 --> 02:31:05.420]   They're gonna go you're gonna go to a cabin and use cash or you're gonna kind of
[02:31:05.420 --> 02:31:12.540]   Just know that that's the that's the nature of it because it's really give up. It's really hard to hard to avoid. Yeah
[02:31:12.540 --> 02:31:15.500]   So just statistically so you know
[02:31:16.060 --> 02:31:22.620]   Uh, there are 11 states right now considering and acting their own biometric privacy laws like Illinois has
[02:31:22.620 --> 02:31:26.940]   Yeah, Illinois has one and many other states bundle
[02:31:26.940 --> 02:31:34.380]   Biometric information including California is in this group as a form of sensitive information under their privacy laws
[02:31:34.380 --> 02:31:40.540]   So but it is all part of the patchwork that we live with every day and it doesn't
[02:31:41.100 --> 02:31:46.220]   You have to check in what state what law applies because we don't have a national standard on these things. Yeah
[02:31:46.220 --> 02:31:51.820]   Let me add the problem will be the problem will be is when there's a terrorist act in one of those states
[02:31:51.820 --> 02:31:57.340]   There the law enforcement and the FBI will blame the fact that we can't use this this data
[02:31:57.340 --> 02:32:00.460]   Like someone's gonna get thrown over the bus. That's why everyone's careful about it is because
[02:32:00.460 --> 02:32:05.100]   It I mean it it is we can decide whether we want it to happen or not, but it is effective
[02:32:05.100 --> 02:32:08.380]   You know, not as effective as metadata, which is the most effective thing
[02:32:09.020 --> 02:32:11.820]   But that's the problem. They've got all the metadata anyway, so
[02:32:11.820 --> 02:32:18.780]   I think I think this really the answer to this is these are powerful useful technologies in the right hands
[02:32:18.780 --> 02:32:22.300]   There needs to be limits and regulations on how they can be used
[02:32:22.300 --> 02:32:28.300]   and uh, unfortunately, uh, I don't feel like we can really count on our government for
[02:32:28.300 --> 02:32:34.940]   Uh doing any of that at least not in a timely fashion. Let me take a quick break. I want to talk about uh, our sponsor mirror
[02:32:34.940 --> 02:32:37.740]   We've been using mirror mirror is so cool
[02:32:38.860 --> 02:32:45.900]   Uh, we have an ask the tech guy board. I don't the problem really in doing an ad for mirror as I just don't know how
[02:32:45.900 --> 02:32:51.500]   To describe it. I you know, I don't want to say it's a whiteboard. It's but so much more than that
[02:32:51.500 --> 02:32:54.060]   go to mirror.com
[02:32:54.060 --> 02:33:01.260]   Actually go to mirror.com/podcast so we get credit for it and then look at you'll see on the left here the mirror verse because this is
[02:33:01.260 --> 02:33:05.020]   These are templates designed by actual mirror users
[02:33:05.820 --> 02:33:15.260]   To use mirror. So what's the idea here? Well, uh, if you've got a team, especially these days with teams that are distributed in different time zones different locations
[02:33:15.260 --> 02:33:19.260]   You know, it's very complicated to keep that team on the same page
[02:33:19.260 --> 02:33:26.060]   It's not just different places and time zones. It's different tools. You use a little bit of figma a little bit of
[02:33:26.060 --> 02:33:34.540]   Google's pages a little bit of zoom and pretty soon you've got all these tabs open you've got these and every time you context shift
[02:33:35.260 --> 02:33:41.180]   Trust me you're forgetting stuff you're losing stuff. It's like when you go through a door and you can't remember why you entered that room
[02:33:41.180 --> 02:33:45.900]   Miro solves this as a collaborative visual platform
[02:33:45.900 --> 02:33:51.260]   That brings all your great work together no matter where your team is no matter what tools your team uses
[02:33:51.260 --> 02:33:55.580]   It's all in one place. So you have a single source of truth
[02:33:55.580 --> 02:34:03.580]   You can zoom into the details if you want to know exactly how something works zoom out to the 30 000 foot level if you want to see an overview
[02:34:04.380 --> 02:34:10.380]   Miro is is is a great way to bring in the entire team get input from everyone
[02:34:10.380 --> 02:34:17.020]   democratize collaboration and still stay on the same page miro's infinite shared boards
[02:34:17.020 --> 02:34:22.940]   Give product teams a perpetual space. You can just drag and drop insights in great for mood boards
[02:34:22.940 --> 02:34:27.420]   But they have all sorts of tools like timers for your zoom meeting ice breakers
[02:34:27.420 --> 02:34:30.060]   Nothing is lost. Nothing is forgotten
[02:34:31.500 --> 02:34:35.660]   Miro is whatever you need it to be and that's why it's hard for me to describe it
[02:34:35.660 --> 02:34:41.340]   The good news is if you go to miro.com/podcast your first three boards are free forever
[02:34:41.340 --> 02:34:45.660]   So you can try it. You can start playing with it use your with your team
[02:34:45.660 --> 02:34:51.980]   You can build out your product vision on a mirror board by brainstorming with sticky notes or comments
[02:34:51.980 --> 02:34:57.500]   You can have live reactions. There's a voting tool a timer if you've got a time constraints
[02:34:57.900 --> 02:35:03.580]   You can express yourself in creative ways bring the whole group together around one idea it integrates with
[02:35:03.580 --> 02:35:09.260]   All the tools you're already using so it's very simple to move to miro and bring everything in
[02:35:09.260 --> 02:35:13.740]   You can use a wireframe draw with the pen tool put images and mockups
[02:35:13.740 --> 02:35:15.260]   I mean I can go on and on
[02:35:15.260 --> 02:35:18.940]   We use it with zappier to integrate a bunch of stuff in automatically
[02:35:18.940 --> 02:35:26.220]   Miro users say they save get this 80 hours per user per year. That's like two weeks of extra time
[02:35:27.260 --> 02:35:29.900]   Just by streamlining conversations and cutting down meetings
[02:35:29.900 --> 02:35:36.140]   Miro miro gives your team the chance to always stay connected to real time information
[02:35:36.140 --> 02:35:39.260]   gives product managers and product leads a
[02:35:39.260 --> 02:35:43.420]   A bird's eye view of the whole project to ensure nothing slips through the cracks
[02:35:43.420 --> 02:35:47.580]   I mean, I guess it's not a surprise when I tell you more than a million users
[02:35:47.580 --> 02:35:54.380]   1 million people use miro every month get your first three boards free start working better miro miro
[02:35:55.100 --> 02:35:57.100]   Dot com slash podcast miro
[02:35:57.100 --> 02:36:00.620]   Dot com slash podcast best way to
[02:36:00.620 --> 02:36:07.580]   Understand what it is is try it and you'll be blown away and do check the miroverse for a lot of great ideas
[02:36:07.580 --> 02:36:11.820]   On how you can use miro for for pretty much anything
[02:36:11.820 --> 02:36:17.420]   Uh, let's see back to the show we go
[02:36:17.420 --> 02:36:21.980]   Oh before I do that though, you know, I wasn't here for most of the week
[02:36:22.060 --> 02:36:24.620]   And so they've made a little briefing book for me
[02:36:24.620 --> 02:36:29.180]   I want to take it home with me and study it but for your benefit will play it right now
[02:36:29.180 --> 02:36:34.060]   Don't push too hard on the top of this thing because it will shoot off the dock
[02:36:34.060 --> 02:36:36.700]   Just it doesn't it doesn't take a lot of force to kind of
[02:36:36.700 --> 02:36:41.340]   Oh gosh
[02:36:41.340 --> 02:36:44.540]   Luckily didn't hit my drink. I have a gin and tonic on the table. It just slid
[02:36:44.540 --> 02:36:48.140]   Okay, it's not purpose previously on twit
[02:36:49.100 --> 02:36:53.260]   This week in space we're talking about our favorite space conspiracies
[02:36:53.260 --> 02:36:57.500]   I believe depending on the time period you're talking about and not all that recently
[02:36:57.500 --> 02:37:00.140]   something like 72 percent of the
[02:37:00.140 --> 02:37:02.140]   Russian public
[02:37:02.140 --> 02:37:04.540]   Does not believe that america landed on the moon
[02:37:04.540 --> 02:37:09.580]   Just look at the stuff that came out of the soviet union after the collapse in the early 90s
[02:37:09.580 --> 02:37:12.060]   They were tracking everything we did up there
[02:37:12.060 --> 02:37:18.540]   They had radar and were monitoring radio and you can monitor the dauper ship the radio get some idea where it's coming from
[02:37:18.780 --> 02:37:22.300]   Mac break weekly james toms and filling in for jason snell this week
[02:37:22.300 --> 02:37:24.460]   You know james is the author of p-calc
[02:37:24.460 --> 02:37:27.740]   It's always good when you can come out of a keynote and think
[02:37:27.740 --> 02:37:30.460]   I actually don't need to do it nothing
[02:37:30.460 --> 02:37:35.340]   That is the best feeling in the entire world of like if I do nothing
[02:37:35.340 --> 02:37:39.820]   Everything will still work and it's it's cool this week in google
[02:37:39.820 --> 02:37:42.220]   Oh, I got one. Yeah, I got one
[02:37:42.220 --> 02:37:45.100]   Do software engineers wash their underwear?
[02:37:45.500 --> 02:37:52.220]   The guardian did a trend story world is ridiculous trend stories of people who are deciding not to wash their underwear for a week
[02:37:52.220 --> 02:37:58.140]   And of who is the lead of the story? Of course, it's a software engineer
[02:37:58.140 --> 02:38:04.060]   I don't think that a reputation for not washing underwear is going to help that the reputation of engineers. That's all i'm saying
[02:38:04.060 --> 02:38:07.900]   Yeah, what a twist uh, well that's not the story. I thought you were gonna throw out there
[02:38:11.260 --> 02:38:16.860]   Yeah, you never know you never know jeff jarvis on this week in google

[02:38:59.660 --> 02:39:03.020]   Uh, okay time for some good news
[02:39:03.020 --> 02:39:06.940]   hacker responsible for the 2020 twitter breach
[02:39:07.820 --> 02:39:09.820]   Going to jail seven years
[02:39:09.820 --> 02:39:11.660]   Oh
[02:39:11.660 --> 02:39:16.380]   This is the guy remember this when all the famous people on twitter like joe biden tweeted
[02:39:16.380 --> 02:39:21.180]   I'm giving back to the community all bitcoin sent to the address below will be sent back doubled
[02:39:21.180 --> 02:39:28.460]   Uh, you know, honestly did this guy really deserve seven years. This was such a lame
[02:39:28.460 --> 02:39:30.620]   scam
[02:39:30.620 --> 02:39:33.260]   He didn't apparently make any money out of it
[02:39:33.900 --> 02:39:39.500]   Uh, although he agreed to forfeit seven hundred ninety four thousand dollars to the victims of his crime. So maybe
[02:39:39.500 --> 02:39:41.900]   Maybe he did
[02:39:41.900 --> 02:39:46.220]   He's a citizen of the uk was extradited from spain earlier this year
[02:39:46.220 --> 02:39:52.540]   Uh, he'll serve probably half of his sentence after spending more than two years in pretrial custody
[02:39:52.540 --> 02:39:57.020]   This has been a while right, uh, he faced up to 77 years. However
[02:39:57.020 --> 02:40:01.420]   So according to prosecutors, this is this is typical
[02:40:02.220 --> 02:40:06.940]   The hacker used his sophisticated technical abilities for malicious purposes
[02:40:06.940 --> 02:40:12.140]   Conducting a complex sim swap attack to steal large amounts of cryptocurrency
[02:40:12.140 --> 02:40:16.700]   Hacking twitter conducting computer intrusions to take over social media accounts
[02:40:16.700 --> 02:40:22.620]   Even cyber stalking two victims including a minor victim. Oh, maybe that's why i got seven years
[02:40:22.620 --> 02:40:25.740]   Uh, i'm not gonna, you know
[02:40:25.740 --> 02:40:27.580]   Anyway
[02:40:27.580 --> 02:40:29.340]   Was a dumb thing to do
[02:40:29.340 --> 02:40:32.460]   Let's put it that way. I'm not sure he really deserves seven years
[02:40:32.460 --> 02:40:35.900]   And twitter probably deserves a little
[02:40:35.900 --> 02:40:39.020]   Pain for how weak and lacks their security was
[02:40:39.020 --> 02:40:43.900]   YouTube is testing and online games offering playables
[02:40:43.900 --> 02:40:47.100]   We saw this at vidcon
[02:40:47.100 --> 02:40:50.220]   Um
[02:40:50.220 --> 02:40:54.860]   I don't know is this I don't know why they're doing this
[02:40:55.580 --> 02:41:00.700]   YouTube's doing just everybody's getting the games games are good, you know, turns out sports and games are good are good
[02:41:00.700 --> 02:41:04.540]   Content on the heels though of dumping stadia. It's like, okay
[02:41:04.540 --> 02:41:12.140]   Two different teams like the stadium and the youtube team are two different worlds and they they and I think google likes it that way
[02:41:12.140 --> 02:41:14.620]   I have to say uh
[02:41:14.620 --> 02:41:18.300]   It's really hard for me these days to take anything google does
[02:41:18.300 --> 02:41:21.260]   too seriously
[02:41:22.220 --> 02:41:28.460]   I will say that I would I would I would keep on really, you know, google is in mountain view and and youtube's in bruno san bruno
[02:41:28.460 --> 02:41:32.860]   And they really operate. I mean they they definitely have each other's value
[02:41:32.860 --> 02:41:38.060]   YouTube is a very different run than google itself. It's just it's
[02:41:38.060 --> 02:41:41.660]   It's a big machine. It takes a lot longer for it to do things
[02:41:41.660 --> 02:41:44.700]   You know, but it does them in this kind of methodical
[02:41:44.700 --> 02:41:50.140]   Mechanical way of just slowly rolling things out and slowly putting things out. It's not a new feature
[02:41:50.380 --> 02:41:54.940]   It's you know, it's adding these features. It rare. I rarely see youtube back up
[02:41:54.940 --> 02:41:59.500]   You know, like they just they're you know, they're they're just slowly making adjustments and
[02:41:59.500 --> 02:42:04.220]   They're in a lot of interaction with their users and and they're looking at a lot of data and trying to
[02:42:04.220 --> 02:42:07.740]   You know and dealing with a lot of really complicated things, but I don't see you
[02:42:07.740 --> 02:42:12.380]   I see I agree with you that google is like you never know what's gonna happen, you know, like anything's been really
[02:42:12.380 --> 02:42:16.220]   After they killed stadia and then killed google domains. I feel like
[02:42:16.220 --> 02:42:19.580]   You know, if they announce a new product not youtube, you're right
[02:42:20.060 --> 02:42:23.340]   If google and that's a new product, i'm gonna be slow to adopt let's put it that way
[02:42:23.340 --> 02:42:27.740]   And that's the problem that they had was that even back, you know, ten years ago
[02:42:27.740 --> 02:42:30.140]   The big problem was people wanted to see google
[02:42:30.140 --> 02:42:34.380]   Hang on to something for two years before they jumped into it
[02:42:34.380 --> 02:42:39.340]   And now when you talk to people, you're not sure if they'll ever trust that they should go down that path
[02:42:39.340 --> 02:42:43.980]   You know, and so that's the and that's really they've gone from I have to see it for a while and with apple
[02:42:43.980 --> 02:42:47.180]   That's why a lot of people jump on things pretty quickly with apple is because
[02:42:47.740 --> 02:42:51.260]   You know that apple took a long time to think about it and whether it's a good idea or not a good idea
[02:42:51.260 --> 02:42:53.020]   They're gonna do it for the next five to ten years
[02:42:53.020 --> 02:42:56.700]   They're not gonna they're not gonna bury you know once they start going down the path
[02:42:56.700 --> 02:42:59.580]   They're not gonna change direction whether you like it or not is the question
[02:42:59.580 --> 02:43:03.020]   We're just a few weeks off from meta launching its twitter clone
[02:43:03.020 --> 02:43:05.900]   um
[02:43:05.900 --> 02:43:10.060]   mid-july according to rumors this is from forbs
[02:43:10.060 --> 02:43:13.980]   uh, there is already on the meta on the uh
[02:43:13.980 --> 02:43:16.300]   fetaverse
[02:43:16.300 --> 02:43:19.100]   uh a whole petition saying if if uh
[02:43:19.100 --> 02:43:22.540]   If mena puts they call it uh threads
[02:43:22.540 --> 02:43:26.620]   Apparently if mena puts threads on the uh on the fetaverse
[02:43:26.620 --> 02:43:29.260]   We will block it from our instances
[02:43:29.260 --> 02:43:31.820]   Um
[02:43:31.820 --> 02:43:33.820]   I don't know. I think it could be a good thing
[02:43:33.820 --> 02:43:38.860]   That seems very unfet diversity. I know i'm not I didn't sign that petition
[02:43:38.860 --> 02:43:40.220]   Yeah
[02:43:40.220 --> 02:43:44.300]   Our twitter social which you are know are very active on Denise and I appreciate it
[02:43:44.780 --> 02:43:46.780]   Uh, we will wait and see
[02:43:46.780 --> 02:43:52.140]   I think there's there's a fear that there'll be an onslaught of meta users on the fetaverse. We'll find so what?
[02:43:52.140 --> 02:43:54.700]   Doesn't hurt anything
[02:43:54.700 --> 02:43:59.740]   It'll be see it'll be interesting to see how they innovate. I mean I think that they can
[02:43:59.740 --> 02:44:04.620]   Obviously twitter has its own issues and so they're trying to capitalize on that
[02:44:04.620 --> 02:44:08.460]   That's been a area that they've been outside of it'll be interesting to see what they do differently
[02:44:08.460 --> 02:44:11.100]   um that uh that the twitter hasn't
[02:44:11.500 --> 02:44:16.300]   They're apparently actively going after you know celebrities to get them on there
[02:44:16.300 --> 02:44:23.260]   Um, you know, they want they want to launch with some big names which makes sense in this in this uh, credit creator
[02:44:23.260 --> 02:44:26.300]   A universe creator driven universe
[02:44:26.300 --> 02:44:33.900]   Um, I yeah, I mean their timing's good people aren't liking their twitter experience. It's getting worse and worse, right?
[02:44:33.900 --> 02:44:37.100]   Yeah, I am I am curious whether they want to
[02:44:38.380 --> 02:44:43.100]   go after current twitter users and and heavy users versus
[02:44:43.100 --> 02:44:46.780]   Everyone else in my personal life who?
[02:44:46.780 --> 02:44:52.620]   Has tried twitter in the past and just never got it, you know outside of the media tech or
[02:44:52.620 --> 02:44:56.700]   politics set and um, I guess you start where
[02:44:56.700 --> 02:45:01.180]   You have people who who appreciate the type of platform?
[02:45:01.180 --> 02:45:07.900]   Um, but it just seems like a huge open opportunity for folks who just you know, never got twitter
[02:45:07.900 --> 02:45:12.540]   But maybe there's something a little more straightforward or I don't know what but I think
[02:45:12.540 --> 02:45:17.100]   Everybody that I know jumps on everything and puts the get make sure that they they get your name
[02:45:17.100 --> 02:45:19.660]   I'll do you guys always get your name
[02:45:19.660 --> 02:45:24.060]   And then we'll and then wait and see i'm on blue sky. I'm on noster
[02:45:24.060 --> 02:45:28.060]   I'm on t2. I'm on all of them. None of them has
[02:45:28.060 --> 02:45:31.340]   replaced twitter on fort which is sad
[02:45:31.340 --> 02:45:33.900]   It's hard. It's sad
[02:45:34.140 --> 02:45:37.980]   Uh meta has been reaching out according to the verge to unnamed big celebrities
[02:45:37.980 --> 02:45:43.900]   Were being pitched on threads as a quote sanely run and quote platform
[02:45:43.900 --> 02:45:47.900]   sanity
[02:45:47.900 --> 02:45:51.660]   Marketing point, you know, I realize I buried the number one story of the week
[02:45:51.660 --> 02:45:57.340]   Does this have anything to do with the proposed cage match between elon musk and mark zuckerberg
[02:45:59.340 --> 02:46:01.340]   So yes, yes it does
[02:46:01.340 --> 02:46:07.420]   Those twitter uh, the batons being advertised on twitter might
[02:46:07.420 --> 02:46:09.020]   Oh
[02:46:09.020 --> 02:46:15.020]   Have to bring it because honestly, I think mark zuckerberg is in a little bit better shape
[02:46:15.020 --> 02:46:20.140]   He's also about what ten years younger 15. He does a lot of training. I think he's doing marco
[02:46:20.140 --> 02:46:22.700]   Ju jitsu. Yeah
[02:46:22.700 --> 02:46:26.620]   I have a good friend who actually wrote an article today or yesterday for the wall street journal
[02:46:26.700 --> 02:46:32.220]   He he practices jujitsu. I don't know if that's what you say practice train do jujitsu
[02:46:32.220 --> 02:46:34.540]   Anyway, and he talked to some trainers and like
[02:46:34.540 --> 02:46:37.660]   I put my money on zuck. I'm no
[02:46:37.660 --> 02:46:40.060]   Iwan has the baton
[02:46:40.060 --> 02:46:44.780]   There was a good article go ahead
[02:46:44.780 --> 02:46:47.980]   Don't want to spend a lot of time in jujitsu. I think I probably still
[02:46:47.980 --> 02:46:49.500]   I
[02:46:49.500 --> 02:46:55.580]   You know give them the advantage. There was a good I first of all this cage match is never going to happen no matter what anybody
[02:46:55.900 --> 02:47:00.460]   Says you'd be insane to get in the cage with mark zuckerberg
[02:47:00.460 --> 02:47:03.580]   Uh, you want to just get his ass kicked?
[02:47:03.580 --> 02:47:05.980]   Um to be blunt
[02:47:05.980 --> 02:47:10.060]   But there's it's kind of funny how this all developed. Oh my gosh
[02:47:10.060 --> 02:47:16.620]   Where's bezos and his muscles in this not nowhere to be seen? Oh, yeah, he could you know what I that I'd like to see
[02:47:16.620 --> 02:47:19.260]   Jeff and zuck now that would be a good battle
[02:47:19.260 --> 02:47:24.620]   He just like he just like I'm I'm now i'm uh, just a shareholder now like he's yeah
[02:47:24.620 --> 02:47:26.620]   He's kind of tired right yeah, he doesn't care
[02:47:26.620 --> 02:47:30.220]   Um, I guess this I don't know where this all started
[02:47:30.220 --> 02:47:31.980]   Uh
[02:47:31.980 --> 02:47:35.580]   Did well, I think zuck was being sort of subtweeted
[02:47:35.580 --> 02:47:38.300]   in a thread
[02:47:38.300 --> 02:47:40.300]   on twitter and
[02:47:40.300 --> 02:47:43.580]   Uh at at some point
[02:47:43.580 --> 02:47:45.580]   Iwan said
[02:47:45.580 --> 02:47:49.660]   I'm up for a cage match if he is l o l
[02:47:50.620 --> 02:47:55.100]   Right and rather than engage on twitter because why would you if you're mark zuckerberg?
[02:47:55.100 --> 02:47:57.820]   He posts on his instagram
[02:47:57.820 --> 02:48:00.380]   to his stories
[02:48:00.380 --> 02:48:04.300]   Uh, send me the location or words to that effect so he's
[02:48:04.300 --> 02:48:10.300]   That's how he let people know he was in people at ufc who obviously have uh would love to see this happen
[02:48:10.300 --> 02:48:14.140]   At the octagon in vegas have said oh no, it's real
[02:48:14.140 --> 02:48:19.500]   It is not real excuse me pardon me. There's no way eat these two billion ares
[02:48:19.900 --> 02:48:21.580]   Are going to brutally
[02:48:21.580 --> 02:48:28.220]   Beat on each other. There's just nothing to be gained, but there was a good article that said this is all part of a larger
[02:48:28.220 --> 02:48:34.700]   effort by meta's marketing to position mark as a he-man
[02:48:34.700 --> 02:48:37.420]   not as
[02:48:37.420 --> 02:48:39.500]   some sort of weird robotic
[02:48:39.500 --> 02:48:41.660]   leader
[02:48:41.660 --> 02:48:44.220]   And that makes a lot of sense to me
[02:48:44.220 --> 02:48:47.580]   That there has been an effort
[02:48:47.580 --> 02:48:52.940]   We talked about this mark saying I just completed the murph's challenge or whatever it was which is running and
[02:48:52.940 --> 02:48:54.540]   and
[02:48:54.540 --> 02:48:57.740]   Lifting and pull like a thousand pull-ups and all this stuff
[02:48:57.740 --> 02:49:02.940]   Um, yeah, I think mark is in a lot better shape, but I also think this is part of a
[02:49:02.940 --> 02:49:06.940]   concerted plan to polish
[02:49:06.940 --> 02:49:13.020]   marks, um image and to make meta seem like something besides
[02:49:13.020 --> 02:49:16.380]   kind of a
[02:49:16.380 --> 02:49:20.860]   Tech weenies attempt to get into your personal cheese or something so
[02:49:20.860 --> 02:49:23.660]   not not that this is
[02:49:23.660 --> 02:49:32.380]   Probably passable under the applicable states right of publicity laws, but people are already selling t-shirts and oh my god
[02:49:32.380 --> 02:49:41.020]   My bucket if if elon is foolish enough to get in the octagon with mark succuburg. He deserves
[02:49:41.020 --> 02:49:44.460]   Whatever he gets
[02:49:45.100 --> 02:49:49.740]   Uh, anyway, I don't there's no there's just no way that's gonna happen
[02:49:49.740 --> 02:49:52.860]   uh, let's see
[02:49:52.860 --> 02:49:59.500]   Oh and finally and I ask you this alex lindsey because I know you're a massive midjourney fan
[02:49:59.500 --> 02:50:04.060]   Version 5.2 comes out which gives you abilities to zoom out
[02:50:04.060 --> 02:50:09.260]   It's amazing. It's amazing. Have you played with it? You know, oh, yeah, okay for hours
[02:50:09.260 --> 02:50:11.660]   Yeah, it's great
[02:50:11.660 --> 02:50:17.020]   So there's a couple things about it the just the overall quality of 5.2 is as much higher
[02:50:17.020 --> 02:50:21.180]   um, there is an ability so the zoom out is probably
[02:50:21.180 --> 02:50:24.140]   That's part of what's interesting about 5.2
[02:50:24.140 --> 02:50:27.740]   Um, so what you can do is you can say I want to close up and then you can
[02:50:27.740 --> 02:50:31.340]   Then you can have say build something that's got a wider shot to it
[02:50:31.340 --> 02:50:37.260]   And then build it to a wider shot. I mean what it's doing is reproducing that center part interestingly enough
[02:50:38.060 --> 02:50:43.660]   Not always verbatim like it'll match up, but it's it's still redoing something, but it looks almost identical
[02:50:43.660 --> 02:50:48.780]   Um, but zoomed out and so it'll you can do a zoom out and you can do a lot of zoom out or a little bit of zoom out
[02:50:48.780 --> 02:50:50.780]   Now one thing you'll notice is some of the shots
[02:50:50.780 --> 02:50:56.780]   The ways midjourney drew it was with a wide angle lens and so it looks really fisheye sometimes when you pull back out again
[02:50:56.780 --> 02:51:03.100]   Um, but overall it is um, it's a it's a really cool feature. Um, that has been something that a lot of us
[02:51:03.100 --> 02:51:05.740]   You know wanted for a while
[02:51:05.900 --> 02:51:10.060]   Um is to be able to build bigger shots with that with that in it. Um, and so it's
[02:51:10.060 --> 02:51:15.260]   It's pretty cool. The um, it gets a little creepy if you go out far enough
[02:51:15.260 --> 02:51:19.740]   Like it starts to hallucinate a certain cause it doesn't know what to yeah, it doesn't know what to do there
[02:51:19.740 --> 02:51:20.540]   I mean
[02:51:20.540 --> 02:51:23.500]   Midjourney hallucinates often. I mean that's kind of the nature of the business
[02:51:23.500 --> 02:51:24.940]   You know of what it's doing
[02:51:24.940 --> 02:51:29.180]   So you get these things like you'll get three really normal things and then you'll be like whoa what happened there?
[02:51:29.180 --> 02:51:33.340]   You know like it just you know flipped a bit and um, and so so the um
[02:51:33.980 --> 02:51:36.860]   But it also the other thing that's really interesting is the new
[02:51:36.860 --> 02:51:44.780]   Variables so a variance so when you when you do a variance where you say I want you to make I like this image
[02:51:44.780 --> 02:51:46.940]   I want to make two I want to make it four more
[02:51:46.940 --> 02:51:51.020]   You can do a lot or a little so you can say I just want to vary just a little bit
[02:51:51.020 --> 02:51:54.940]   Or I want to vary a lot and you can make those decisions as you start to hit that
[02:51:54.940 --> 02:51:57.260]   Um, you know as you go through that to make it and it's
[02:51:57.260 --> 02:52:03.420]   It's really useful. Yes. You are quite the midjourney master. Do you think this is better than anything else?
[02:52:03.580 --> 02:52:07.820]   But well, oh, yeah, it's the best image image generator quite amazing the uh, I mean they're
[02:52:07.820 --> 02:52:13.660]   You know if you're worried about people mistaking AI generated images for real images
[02:52:13.660 --> 02:52:15.660]   This is the place where you're gonna see that happen
[02:52:15.660 --> 02:52:22.700]   Um, oh I I make I'm my we talked about our Mac break. I make my lock screens all yeah, you know from uh
[02:52:22.700 --> 02:52:25.260]   From this and it looks so good
[02:52:25.260 --> 02:52:31.100]   Like it's like they just look like photos that I created about things that I'm interested in and um, yeah, so it's uh
[02:52:31.980 --> 02:52:34.940]   Um, and I use you know, this is really trippy. Wow
[02:52:34.940 --> 02:52:38.380]   Because the number one use that I have for it is making
[02:52:38.380 --> 02:52:45.660]   Um, funny images for my keynote documents when I do presentations like because the the the the the thing I asked for is
[02:52:45.660 --> 02:52:49.100]   Over a plain white background so I can remove the background and keynote
[02:52:49.100 --> 02:52:54.860]   And and and so I have all these funny characters and then the other thing is funny is go in the style of of pixar
[02:52:54.860 --> 02:52:59.980]   So I'll go. Okay. I want I want a guy who look I want a geeky guy with glasses that looks confused
[02:53:00.460 --> 02:53:06.220]   You know, and I also want a a woman that has got glasses on was confused and an african-american woman that has
[02:53:06.220 --> 02:53:11.340]   You know like in an anime and and I can set up all these things and ask for all these things if I want a little crowd
[02:53:11.340 --> 02:53:13.900]   That all looks confused. I say in the style of pixar
[02:53:13.900 --> 02:53:18.940]   And then I get all those cartoon characters over a plain white background and I can stack them all on top of each other
[02:53:18.940 --> 02:53:22.060]   and there's a um, uh, there is a
[02:53:22.060 --> 02:53:24.300]   new
[02:53:24.300 --> 02:53:28.140]   Thing that we just started we had a homemade journey thing on our office hours like on monday
[02:53:28.700 --> 02:53:32.460]   And one of the things that came up was another mid journey that now i'm gonna
[02:53:32.460 --> 02:53:35.260]   forget the name unless I look at it here, but
[02:53:35.260 --> 02:53:40.700]   Um that basically builds vector files. Oh trace journey trace journey is the is the one that will build
[02:53:40.700 --> 02:53:43.100]   Outlines so it'll take your mid journey image
[02:53:43.100 --> 02:53:49.980]   And then make turn it into an sveg image like it'll just and it looks a little posterized because it's you know now it's a vector
[02:53:49.980 --> 02:53:54.380]   But it um, but you can do that as well. So yeah, it's what 5.2 is a big jump
[02:53:54.540 --> 02:53:59.740]   We'll definitely be talking more about this on mac break weekly. We will see you on tuesday and you
[02:53:59.740 --> 02:54:06.540]   I know we'll be talking about this and everything else under the sun at office hours dot global
[02:54:06.540 --> 02:54:11.900]   You talk about so much. I love this accessibility Saturdays. You're doing now
[02:54:11.900 --> 02:54:15.660]   We're we're really excited about it. You know, we're basically going it's you know
[02:54:15.660 --> 02:54:19.740]   Every one of them the first two have come out and they're just eye-opening. You know, so we're talking to
[02:54:19.740 --> 02:54:22.300]   um, you know to
[02:54:22.780 --> 02:54:26.540]   Different aspects of success accessibility. So last Saturday we were talking about languages
[02:54:26.540 --> 02:54:33.580]   Well, what does it take to actually take an event and do all the different languages that are required and and all the technical things?
[02:54:33.580 --> 02:54:38.220]   But the other thing that's interesting is that it's not just that the show is talking about accessibility
[02:54:38.220 --> 02:54:41.900]   It's actually, you know, we have a we have a death panelist and we have
[02:54:41.900 --> 02:54:47.100]   ASL interpreters and the death panelists is interacting and talking to us and we have
[02:54:47.100 --> 02:54:49.420]   um, you know different different
[02:54:49.420 --> 02:54:54.700]   Accessibility issues and we have panelists that are talking about those things from life experience, which is is really
[02:54:54.700 --> 02:55:00.460]   It's really cool. So so I think that we're really excited about the Saturday. These are Saturdays that we're going to be talking about it all summer
[02:55:00.460 --> 02:55:05.180]   Um, and we're going to kind of cover the gamut of accessibility issues and each one of them has been a real
[02:55:05.180 --> 02:55:10.940]   You know, just really understanding what the needs are and us trying to figure out how do we solve those with what we're doing
