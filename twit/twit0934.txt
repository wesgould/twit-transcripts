[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   All in studio. I am so thrilled to get this panel assembled.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   And I don't know how long this show is going to go. If I were you, I'd grab lunch and a couple of stiff drinks before you start.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Ian Thomas is here.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   No mustache. I always think of you as the, you know, the...
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Yeah, no, I shaved off the COVID porn star. It just made me look too much lighter.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   From the register. Yeah. Yeah. Good to see you.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Well, it was a pleasure. Welcome. Thanks for coming up.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Also with us, ladies and gentlemen, all the way from Mazza, choose its...
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Brianna Wu. Hello, Brianna. Good to see you.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   In studio. In studio. I just want to say, abolish the monarchy and America is the best country on Earth.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   God, I'm laughing red for reasons.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   You'll be happy. Just want to celebrate our country.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Just remember you belong to me. Brianna's executive director, the rebellion pack.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Yeah, it's Fourth of July. It's two days from now. That's right.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   And we've got a Brit in here. You could be our whipping boy.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Well, okay. That costs extra.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   And we're to do the whipping, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   He's all the way from the Vatican in Rome. Father Robert Ballester is trying to scroll through all his Twitter.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   I just want to hit the limit. To get to the end.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Brianna, see the limit here.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   There used to be a joke. You'd get to a webpage and say, "You've reached the end of the Internet. Go back."
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   You can actually reach the end of Twitter now.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   You know, but again, no one has told me if it counts just the scrolling, or do I have to click 600 posts.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   So Elon on Saturday said to address extreme levels of data scraping and system manipulation.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   He apparently was worried as his Reddit and many others that AI was scraping Twitter data and using it for their large language models.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   We've applied the following temporary limits. Verified accounts. He shouldn't call them Verified accounts.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   People who pay me $8 are limited to reading 6,000 posts a day.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Unverified accounts. Everybody else. 600 posts a day. New unverified accounts.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   300 posts a day. And if you're not logged in zero.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Wow. Wow. Wow.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Almost as soon as he posted this, and this is 10 a.m. on Saturday, Twitter went down.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Pretty much.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   The users started seeing rate limit exceeded messages.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Every topic was about the collapse of Twitter.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   And the hashtag Twitter down. Thanks, Elon. Here's the trending topics.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Thanks, Elon. WTF Twitter. Blue Sky. Damn Twitter. And bankruptcy.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Those are the top six trending in the United States at that time.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   What's wild, and this came on Mastodon of course, because you couldn't post on Twitter, but a web developer named Sheldon Chang.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Notice that as he was trying to load Twitter, the scroll bar was jiggling.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   What does that mean, Father, when the scroll bar is jiggling.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Oh, it basically means that your browser is trying to refresh over and over again to follow the content.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Okay. He wrote on Mastodon. This is hilarious. It appears that Twitter is de-dossing itself.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Best kind of de-doss.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Best kind. Twitter home feed's been down for most this morning, even though nothing loads.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   The Twitter website never stops trying. And trying.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   The reason is Twitter's firing off, he says, and I think he's accurate.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   I don't think anybody said that's not true.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   He requests a second to itself to try and fetch content that never arrives because they've blocked people from Twitter without logging in.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   So I guess this was only if you hadn't logged into Twitter.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   This likely created, he continues on, some hellish conditions the engineers never envisioned.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   And so we get this comedy of errors resulting in the most epic of self-owns, the self-de-doss.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   And then he posts the developer page from his browser and you can see these are requests.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Each of these 20 byte requests saying, "Give me the data. Give me the data. Can you give me the data? Please give me the data.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Now, if you have a lot of people doing this, Sheldon said, "Of course, I'm a nice person, so I logged out except wait a minute.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Saturday, and evil Sheldon's in charge, so I just stayed there for a while."
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Just watching it happen.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Well, I think they also have some problems playing there, paying that cloud bill.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Right. Well, there was a lot of speculation, right?
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   I mean, obviously, there's many times I've been on a daily bonding.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   That was like the 200 IQ move to not pay your bills because then you get it for free.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Somebody pointed out...
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   It works for the office in seven-day market street.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Somebody pointed out that the contract with Google Cloud expired June 30th.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   And Elon had famously stopped paying Google Cloud, except that I saw a story this week that said they made some sort of deal.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Google's going to buy some, get some, I think, free ads.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   And then they had moved off of AWS, right?
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Right.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   So, I don't know.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Part of this was made worse by the fact that they made some changes since Elon took over to move more of the services onto Twitter servers.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Because Elon didn't want to pay any third parties for services that would normally be provided by third parties.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   The issue with that is that when you have an integrated page like the Twitter page, which is calling for 40 different elements at the same time,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   if you now serve out all 40 of those elements, every time a page loads, you are de-dossing yourself.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Right.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Right.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   And I mean, unfortunately, you could fix that, but there's only two coders left at Twitter, so it's going to take some time.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Well, this is it. You know, several...
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Oh, sorry.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   We've had this ratio of tank layoffs in Silicon Valley of light.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Because it's slightly bla...
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Enumbled by Elon Musk.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Well, not exactly.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Well, that is what you point call...
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   But they're just kind of like, well, Elon's done everything...
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   ...and everything we're looking for the moment.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   But, you know, it's not exactly...
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Yeah, although Silicon Valley, I don't know if this is... has anything to do with layoffs, but the stock market's been loving Silicon Valley this week.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Maybe they said, "Oh, it's good. You cut your costs and now we want to invest in."
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   And that's part of the problem because we bow to the stock price because that's what props up the value of the company.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Exactly.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   The stock price is not indicative of...
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Although...
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   ...of being doing something responsible.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Can I point out one company that didn't lay anybody off?
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Apple is now a three trillion-year-tolller company.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   It's stock jumped as well.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Before we move on, I just wanted to say a thing about the Twitter outage.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   You know, I was so frustrated with so much of the news coverage about this.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   I don't know if we have the New York Times article on this.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Sure.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   This is... I know Ryan Mack is an excellent reporter. He does really good work, but if you read...
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   ...it's not this one. It's the other one. It's announcing...
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Twitter is down a word, white outage.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   If you go to my Twitter, you can find it.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   There's quite a few stories from the New York Times about Twitter falling apart.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Sure. This is the one that came...
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   ...hard of playing the one you're talking about.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   This is the one from yesterday on the first...
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   If I can get on Twitter, I'll get it.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   And the problem with this is they're talking about it.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   And if you look at the first, I think it's the first five paragraphs, they repeatedly go and only cite Elon Musk...
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   ...giving his pretext for why this is bot scraping.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   That is not a credible thing.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   At this point, anyone that works in the tech industry and reports on the tech industry can see a pattern with Elon Musk...
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   ...to x.com, where he will talk about a problem that the company is having.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   He will kind of mislead the public about what the actual problem is...
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   ...and kind of obfuscate what is going on here.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   So this piece, go through and look at it.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   This is the main source.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   This has been a problem with the New York Times in every area...
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   100% for the last few years.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   But this is...
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   And the Wall Street Journal and mainstream media...
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Wall Street Journal does better than this.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   But in my estimation, you read this piece.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   You've got Yol Roth, who is a very credible insider.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Former Twitter trusted safety.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Who gave a very credible statement about why this was on Blue Sky.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   These reporters could have gone over there and looked at this.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   But they're using Musk and just presenting his face of this whole thing to the public unchallenged.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Well, that's why people listen to Twitter.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Let's hear this story.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   It's because they don't...
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   ...and I'm not the right article.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Their purpose is to gain access to Elon.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   And they know that forever blows the most smoke up his backside.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   That's right.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   But this is the problem with access journalism.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   This is why we don't do it.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   It's because you will only get the stories that they want to feed you.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   And it's like, "Yeah, it looks great.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Yeah, I got an interview with so-and-so."
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   But what did he give up for that?
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   I mean...
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Well, and I'm proud to say everybody in the tech industry hates me.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Apple won't ask me any of their events.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Oh, no!
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   It would be my episode of Apple for 12 years.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   I'm pretty much taking your...
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   ...your... your... your... your... your... your...
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   ...tech.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Is it theregister.com?
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Ah, yes.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Yes, yes.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   I just want to see what your coverage is of this...
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Oh, well, the Twitter one.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   It broke funny late in half our staff.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   We're off for a rebellious collage.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   We're about to get a new tweet.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Okay.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   So let's just...
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Yeah, let's just...
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   ...just point out.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   ...with that for a second.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   There are...
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   ...anyway.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   We have this in the work-life balance.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   It's really happening.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   I don't know how you do that.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   That's weird.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   So you... look, I also get a lot of heat from people saying, "You don't give Elon a...
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   ...you know, we personally don't give Elon any credit or a break."
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   I was in... I was a big Elon fan until...
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Yeah, sure.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   ...early recently.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   That is not true.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Because I remember when he did the first landing of...
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Oh, awesome.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   ...to Rocket at the same time.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   We...
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   We broadcast.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   You covered the tech.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   You gave them... of kudos.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   You gave them a clades.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   So it's... it's all about...
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Look, just because you did something nice in the past...
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Sure.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   ...doesn't mean that I'm gonna gloss over the horrible thing that you're doing now.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Right.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   That's what journalists are supposed to do.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Sure.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   But I do have to point out, all four of you... all three of you, you still use Twitter.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Two, yeah.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Right?
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   You guys have a left Twitter.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   I've told you.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   I'm on that thing.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   I'm on that thing.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   I'm on that thing.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Like Slim Pickens.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   That's what I'm...
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   ...blisking.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   But am I gonna ride it to the ground?
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   I'm gonna ride it to the ground.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.720]   One of the things that this is... I think a decade ago, you could defend a newsroom like
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:10.360]   The New York Times having a... not a deep amount of tech reporting.
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.360]   Right.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.360]   Not really knowing this.
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.680]   In an era where this stuff is shaping elections, right?
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.600]   I know Ryan Mack is a good reporter.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:21.520]   I know he knows the context around Elon.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.680]   So I think they owe it to their readers.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.240]   Look, I'm an Elon Musk critic.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.600]   I will completely own that.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.800]   You just put me in there, but give your readers that alternate point of view.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:37.920]   I'm gonna guess that The Times got that article out really, really fast within minutes of
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.560]   the event and all they could get was Elon.
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:45.120]   I'm gonna hope, let's look, that they found other signs to that story.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.600]   It was one morning when I looked.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.600]   There was nothing.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.400]   This morning, but that was like 10 o'clock.
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.680]   So all we heard from The New York Times was Musk's response.
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:55.680]   That's correct.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:57.920]   Well, that is disappointing.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.080]   And obviously, there was more to say than that.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.320]   One in the fact that you can't speculate and do you have a definite proof of what's going
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.320]   on?
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.320]   Sure.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.320]   Right.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.320]   So and that's true.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.320]   Sheldon's post notwithstanding.
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.320]   We don't know.
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.320]   Is that accurate?
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.320]   We don't know.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.320]   We don't know whether it's failing to pay contracts.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.320]   We don't know if they're trying any things.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.920]   We don't know if the software is full or over.
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.440]   And he's a very little to just bloke.
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.320]   And we have a duty to actually make sure we get it right as well.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.320]   And can I say one more thing?
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.320]   I don't think anybody cares about Twitter in the real world.
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.320]   There is that.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.320]   I don't know.
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.960]   I bet you have our audience says get on.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.960]   We don't care.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:32.960]   Used to be like that.
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:37.680]   Tech used to be a safe sector in that you could talk about tech any way you wanted to.
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.600]   And it didn't intersect with the normals.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.600]   Now it does.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.080]   Tech is now a political issue.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.080]   Tech is now an overall.
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.080]   Absolutely.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.080]   That's really changed quite a bit.
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.080]   I agree.
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.640]   Although, whether Twitch or not will remain that way is very much open for debate.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:55.040]   Twitter could totally go the way of Myspace and GOCD is 100%.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.920]   But this conversation is going to remain.
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.240]   There's still going to be access journalism.
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.960]   The instant take the hot take, which is the one that everyone wants because that starts
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.800]   the water cooler conversation is still going to be there.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.680]   And big journalists still shouldn't do it, but they're going to be tempted to.
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:09.680]   Sure.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.400]   I just think it's a problem for the industry when you have Casey Newton and the platformer
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:18.840]   is consistently going and getting these inside stories of what's going on in Silicon Valley.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.560]   And you have our big news.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:25.000]   Like I pay for the times I pay for Washington Post and I pay for Wall Street Journal.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.080]   Because I want to fund newsrooms with the resources to go get the story and to report
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.080]   it out.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:35.120]   It's consistently these smaller blogs that are going and doing the research.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.880]   And I think that's a real indictment of the big news.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.080]   Interestingly, the platformer doesn't have the story.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.720]   Either they don't have any story because they're probably doing what you suggested.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.720]   They have something.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.280]   They just find out what happened.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.280]   Something I saw.
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.280]   I thought I saw it.
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.760]   Yes, Elon Musk created a spec.
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:51.760]   No, no, no.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.760]   I mean, it's interesting in terms of how this develops.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:03.880]   But with some publications, Wall Street Journal, springs to mind, there's a very big access
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.040]   journalism element to that.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.040]   Always been a prominent.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.640]   So it's been a problem in the tech sector.
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:15.840]   Remember that in the car automotive journalists, it was always hard to trust the big car magazines
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.480]   because you knew that in order to do their job, they had to be friends with the word
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.080]   in GM and Toyota and everybody.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.320]   And it was always an issue with tech.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:28.720]   One of the reasons I started Twitter, and one of the reasons I worked at tech TV is because
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.240]   I wanted to do something different.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:34.360]   I wanted to really kind of, I thought people deserved honest coverage.
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.920]   It's one of the reasons I don't meet with PR people.
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.480]   I don't sign NDAs.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.480]   It's hurt us in some ways.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.760]   We don't get access.
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:42.920]   But it's in the long run.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.760]   I think it's more important that we speak as honestly as we can about this.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:46.760]   Sure.
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.440]   I agree totally, which is why I'm where I am as well.
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:54.300]   But talking about the gaming press, for example, everyone's so really good example.
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.480]   Let's really put integrity back into the gaming process.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.840]   You're assuming it was there in the fight.
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.960]   No, but to their credit, some of the big gaming sites like Kotaku and Polygon, I really
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:04.960]   I think try.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:05.960]   They cited me.
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:06.960]   They did.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:11.540]   But far too many are willing to accept giving a good review or taking a press release rewriting
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:12.540]   it.
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.540]   This is not just the gaming thing.
[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:17.440]   I mean, remember when Apple Maps came out and all the people that got advanced access
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.440]   to Apple.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.600]   Apple plays that game.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:26.040]   Nobody actually mentioned that Apple Maps was criminally bad.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.040]   We did.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.040]   Nobody.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.040]   But that's one of...
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.040]   Okay, no one...
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.040]   Yes, who's all these people?
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.040]   It's really...
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.040]   Apple knows this.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.040]   Who gets invited?
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.040]   Who gets to see the Vision Pro?
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.040]   Who gets to try it on?
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.040]   Yeah.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.040]   It's very much.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.880]   They're very aware of who's going to give them positive coverage and who's not.
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:41.880]   It's not necessarily who's...
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:42.880]   Don't get coverage anymore.
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:43.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:44.880]   We just don't get access.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.920]   I do feel like I just wanted to defend my friends very briefly.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:52.200]   Jason Schreier has done amazing labor work in the video game industry.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.960]   Worked to Kotaku, has talked about the labor abuses and...
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.960]   No, I agree.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:56.960]   Back in Valentine's.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:57.960]   No, I mean, I don't.
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:58.960]   I don't.
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.640]   Polygon has done amazing work on some of the sexual scandals in our industry.
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.640]   But I agree.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:08.560]   Overall, these have served as entertainment magazines that hype up the next big thing.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.560]   And we have a...
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.640]   And there's an audience for that, to be honest with you.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.120]   It's not just the industry.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:17.360]   I get email all the time for people who said, "You used to have fun and technology.
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.640]   You used to cover the fun stuff and talk about the new things and the fun things.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.000]   You don't do that anymore."
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.440]   And I think that perhaps we've changed, but I think even the industry has changed.
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.320]   And so there isn't...
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:32.560]   Like the newest phones are just incremental...
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.560]   There's nothing to get really excited about.
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.720]   Well, no one's creating anything anymore.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:44.800]   I mean, really, when you think about Apple, Google, a bunch of other tech firms, they've
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:50.000]   just either bought in technology from other people or they're at the rent seeking point
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.280]   of the technology cycle for stuff that they actually put in.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:57.200]   Well, it's also hard to innovate now because these are mature phones as an example, very
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.200]   mature.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.920]   I mean, if that's how you feel, then people should celebrate the Vision Pro because that
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.880]   is at least an attempt from Apple to do something new and different.
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:07.880]   We're a lot that.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.640]   I spent 13.3 billion dollars trying to get something new.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.840]   And we resoundingly said, "No."
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:14.840]   There are...
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:15.840]   There are...
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.480]   Like the M1 Mac, I think all of us who agree...
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:18.480]   Huge technology.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.760]   This was a huge step forward.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.120]   This made everyone happy.
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.240]   I didn't see any criticism of that across the industry.
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.200]   Generally, we celebrated that.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:31.560]   I do think that this is a tech industry that when praise is called for, we will certainly
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.560]   give it.
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:38.720]   I just think overall, I think as tech has moved from this kind of niche thing to something
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:43.480]   that's so central in our life and politics, I think it's appropriate for journalists to
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.680]   be more skeptical of these things because it's not toys.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:50.160]   This is the fabric of our social contract today.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.160]   That is the difference, right?
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.680]   It's not the toy store anymore.
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:53.680]   It's life.
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:54.680]   Yeah.
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:20:00.040]   But I mean, also, we're reaching a point where user growth is slowing down in the people
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:05.080]   who would be online in the first place are now already online.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.720]   So you can't rely on that growing user group to keep Wall Street happy.
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.720]   So what do you do?
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.520]   You start jacking around pretty prices and...
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.520]   Firing people.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.040]   Storra goes off that in some places.
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.840]   You go to the subscription model for everything.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:18.840]   Yeah.
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.480]   That's the move right now.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.480]   Everyone goes...
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.480]   Well, let's look at another...
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.800]   On our own particular app, wouldn't it?
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:27.400]   Another arena where a company wanted to make more money, Reddit.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.400]   Oh.
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.200]   Steve Hoffman, CEO of Reddit, was one of the founders, wrote the original code.
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:37.000]   Also, by the way, just for his PR team, they've got to get a better photo of you than that
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.440]   because it just looks like it's your worst high school photo.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.440]   Ever.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.440]   Wow.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:48.440]   It isn't a great picture, is it?
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:49.440]   Oh, hi.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.440]   Hi.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.440]   Hello.
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:54.840]   Are you going to eat those tats?
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:21:00.240]   He looks like he wants to go play Doom in the dorm in 1992.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.040]   I like it.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.040]   God, this is...
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.040]   Wouldn't be laughing if I had my numptucks.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.040]   I've got skills.
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.840]   I studied the play.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:13.200]   No, it's...
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.920]   This story is old as time.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:22.680]   Reddit, which just like Twitter is a platform which normal people like us put our content
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:23.880]   on.
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:28.240]   Normal unpaid people like us, moderate, spend many, many hours to moderate.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.840]   The real value of Twitter is just like Reddit is the content.
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.840]   Sure.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.640]   That we have put there, but they provide the platform.
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:39.800]   Hoffman, just like Twitter, just like Elon said, "Hey, we're getting scraped to death
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:40.800]   by AI."
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:45.040]   I think AI and large language models have been somewhat of a prod in this because those
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:50.800]   companies are suddenly getting all the attention based on content they've aggregated from
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.200]   sites like this.
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.600]   I don't hear Jimmy Wales at Wikipedia moaning.
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:58.040]   I'm sure he was also a victim of this.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:02.400]   In any event, Hoffman who wants to do an IPO, they announced an IPO several years ago, they've
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.240]   been really trying to get the public offering so they can get a big exit.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.440]   They've never made money.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.120]   Never shown a profit.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.520]   They were purchased by Conde Nast a few years ago.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.480]   Conde spun it out as a standalone company, but it's still majority.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:20.640]   Shareholder, I imagine Conde also putting pressure, "Hey, we'd like to make some money
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.800]   on this."
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.760]   If not through profit, then maybe through an IPO.
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.440]   Hoffman now has the burden of, "Well, let's got to figure out some way to get some money
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.440]   out of this."
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.080]   So he decides.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.320]   One of similar to Elon, we're going to charge for the API.
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:38.200]   I think really what the decision was very much like Elon, we're going to get rid of
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.040]   these third party clients that don't show our ads.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:46.380]   They are just a cost center to us because they're sucking our bandwidth without giving
[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.380]   us any revenue.
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:53.280]   But the only reason they existed was because Reddit's own system was so pathetic.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:58.880]   We interviewed, actually Jason and Micah interviewed Christian C. Link from Apollo, which is really
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.560]   kind of the poster tribe for all this.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:05.320]   He made a great app and app I use, probably most iOS people use for Twitter.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:08.040]   For Reddit, it was a much better app.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:13.520]   He had a call early on with Hoffman and Hoffman said, "Yeah, we're going to charge you 24 cents
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.360]   for a thousand queries."
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:20.640]   And Steve, Christian did some back of the envelope math and said, "Well, that's going
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:25.280]   to cost me $20 million a year based on the amount of usage I have.
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:29.560]   I cannot charge my users enough to make up for that."
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.880]   There was a few pretty well anyway.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.560]   Well, he had a couple of problems.
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:39.080]   One is I paid for it, but you don't keep paying for it.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:42.960]   A lot of people were grandfathered in at lower costs.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.880]   I pay for Twitter, too.
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.520]   There is, I'm not Twitter, Reddit, Gold or whatever it's called.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.360]   I pay for Reddit premium.
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.360]   I don't know.
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.360]   I pay for Reddit premium.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.360]   So, I mean, I want to support them.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.960]   I want them to do all right.
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:01.960]   But it sounded like really the plan from Reddit was to kill the third party clients entirely.
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:03.960]   Almost all of them are gone now.
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:11.320]   June 30th was the end of the line for Apollo, for Reddit is fun, RIF, for quite a few clients.
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:12.320]   A few still are around.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.400]   I don't know how they're doing it.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.960]   Maybe they raised their prices.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:15.960]   Maybe.
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:20.040]   I mean, the thing is these were admin tools which you needed if you were going to be a volunteer
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.040]   moderator.
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.040]   That's right.
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.040]   And Reddit's own tools were pathetically bad.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.640]   Now they've basically said, "We're going for IPO.
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:31.920]   We need all that lots of, you know, all that user data ourselves and we need all those
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.320]   moderator stuffs and the moderator's revolted."
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:40.120]   And I've got to say, I haven't posted with one exception anything on the site or submitted
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:46.360]   anything to the site since this broke out because they are to accuse volunteer moderators
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.640]   of being landed gentry.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.160]   That was just sick out.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:55.440]   Hoffman did a publicity tour that was very hand-added.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.440]   It was very awkward.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.600]   A lot of ad interviews.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.400]   And heard himself badly.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.640]   And I think the thing people weren't considering is these moderators.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:06.000]   We've been unpaid volunteers and worked really, really hard for a very long time.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.280]   Some moderators shut their subreddit down.
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:14.320]   The Synology subreddit is now NSFW, which takes away their ad revenue because most
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:18.720]   advertisers don't want to be on an NSFW subreddit.
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:24.000]   So moderators rebelling, a lot of them have left the people who ran the Ask Me Anything,
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   the AMAs on the wall left.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.640]   The former middle one subreddit, a bunch of their moderators got involuntary termination.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:37.360]   Well, the AMA people left said, "If you want to do AMAs, Steve, you should pay the moderators."
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:43.640]   And they're going, "So there's been a rebellion and now Reddit is kind of clamping down and
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.360]   firing moderators."
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.280]   For a while, Steve was saying, "We're going to make it so you can vote out."
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:55.080]   Because he was right, there are users of the F1 subreddit, let's say, who want the subreddit
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:58.880]   to continue, who say, "Well, you're just getting in our way moderators."
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:03.080]   And if there were a vote, "Yeah, get rid of the moderators because we want our subreddit
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.080]   to continue."
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.360]   iPhone subreddit moved off onto Discord.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:11.160]   There aren't any credible third-party, this is the real problem.
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.160]   There's no credible third-party replacements.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:17.960]   Reddit itself only got its start because Digmuck thinks that's so bad.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:22.720]   So there is an opportunity there for someone else to swoop in from the wing.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:27.440]   But is there the problem with Twitter, the problem with Reddit has been the same thing?
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.600]   They've got to scale too much.
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:33.640]   They scaled to the point where they never can never be profitable.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:37.320]   It's not possible for Reddit to ever make money.
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:41.240]   They took so much investment money that right now, either the investors are going to take
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:46.000]   a bath or Reddit is going to have to clamp down on the very people who are creating the
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.440]   content which they use for advertising.
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.440]   That's not possible.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.160]   They're in a no-win scenario right now.
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.320]   Now you can say, "I understand.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.320]   Businesses have to make money.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.320]   They have to keep the doors open.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.320]   I get it."
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:03.520]   But if you built your model on getting goodwill from the people who are using your service,
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:09.480]   and that's how you make your money, you cannot then turn around and say, "Well, we still
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:12.520]   want you to do the stuff that you did when we had the goodwill, but you're not going
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.920]   to get the goodwill anymore."
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.640]   I think that's well said.
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.840]   Just to add on to that, two things.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:23.120]   One, Huntman is very famously emulating Elon Musk in this case.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.920]   He's come forward, says he's a secret.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.920]   I think he admits it, right?
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:26.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:27.920]   Having calls with him.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:28.920]   He's been talking funboy in these interviews.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.520]   He's going to come forward slash costs until it's financially profitable.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.520]   Choose your idols carefully.
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:37.840]   So I'm not going to get down the Elon Musk criticism hole again.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:42.480]   I just wanted to say it, but the wider point to me is if you really look into this API
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:48.640]   funding scheme that they've got, I don't think this is a credible vision for the future,
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:54.200]   because what they want to do is basically use the Reddit training data for machine language
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.200]   learning.
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:01.200]   Now, there's a whole discussion to be had about bias built into your natural language
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.680]   sets and for a place like--
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.680]   I do not want my AI training.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:04.680]   --train done Reddit.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:08.360]   No, but I still don't know.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:13.640]   A lot of us have been modifying our Google searches with the word Reddit, because almost
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.040]   always it's a better result.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:20.480]   Google's starting to say, we're in trouble, because without Reddit, our search results
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.480]   aren't as good.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.480]   100%.
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.560]   Look, I use it for a reason.
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:28.560]   I'm just saying that there's going to, in my opinion, there's going to come a point very
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:32.000]   soon where they've gotten the juice for that lemon, right?
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.800]   So as far as it being a continuing thing to fund all of Reddit, I just-- I think you
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:37.800]   look at the numbers.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:38.880]   It doesn't feel credible.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:44.480]   This makes me sad, because Reddit and Twitter both were huge resources, very valuable to
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.760]   the community.
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:51.000]   Both owned by owners who apparently didn't value that, or maybe couldn't afford to keep
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   losing money.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.280]   I mean, that's-- I understand how that is.
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:54.600]   You can only lose so much money.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:58.760]   I think this is maybe more than so desperate to IPO, because Uber has been doing this stuff
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.760]   for years, but they've actually managed to make money.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:05.080]   And allowed people to cash out the initial investors to cash out their stake.
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:08.080]   And after that, they lost interest, and you can run it as a loss-making service.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.080]   Right.
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.080]   Right.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.080]   But with Reddit, I think you're right.
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:15.160]   I don't see a way for them to fund this.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.200]   You can't do that on Reddit gold purchases.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:23.160]   Either you pay for a premium service, or the money gets sold off.
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:28.600]   Maybe that's what Elon or Huffman should do, is you say, look, we're a paid service.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.600]   Get over it.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.600]   That's the way it's going to be.
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:31.600]   You're going to succeed.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:32.600]   I'd pay $5 a month.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:33.600]   And I would work with--
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.600]   Would enough people do that?
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.600]   That would work with a traditional publication.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:41.600]   But the problem is, both Reddit and Twitter rely on its users to provide the content.
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:42.600]   Right.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:47.280]   So you're saying, pay me money and then make my content.
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.280]   That doesn't work.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:51.360]   Do you know what I wonder is also a factor here?
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:55.520]   That they've engineered these apps, particularly Twitter, to be more and more addictive.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:59.880]   They bring scientists on to figure out how to keep you scrolling forever.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:03.120]   That has a cost that's associated with it.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:08.800]   So maybe-- yeah, maybe Elon is on to something with this rate limiting idea, limiting the
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:12.680]   number of things you can scroll until you have to pay for it.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:13.680]   Maybe something like that.
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:16.520]   There's a free tier where you can just do it a little bit.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:20.120]   But if you're completely addicted to the service, like I am, you have to put it in.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.800]   But the corollaries of that, as if you submit something, then you should get a discount
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:23.800]   or freebie on that.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:24.800]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:25.800]   There's a strategy.
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:31.480]   Because I've been already far too long, so I've got six digits and calmer and comments.
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.440]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:37.960]   You know, if they want my submissions, then they're going to have to pay for them.
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.960]   Yeah.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:39.960]   I'm happy to.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.960]   Let's pretend we don't work for free.
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:50.000]   It's just like-- I mean, just to annoy that many people who you're in, time business
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.120]   model depends on, I just don't see the rationale behind it.
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.760]   So here's a wider question.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:01.640]   Yeah, to a certain extent, Twitter and Reddit and services like this are the public comments
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:02.640]   in 2023.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:03.640]   Right?
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.760]   Like, when I was a teen in the '90s, it was the local coffee shop.
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.480]   We would all go hang out there.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.000]   Today, it's these digital comments.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.360]   And two, I think there's a question to be asked here.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.480]   Like, should these be for-profit companies?
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.560]   Because it seems to me there's a public stake.
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:23.040]   Like I have no idea how you get the government to fund something like this where it would
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:25.360]   be good or well-run.
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:30.160]   But it seems to me that there's a public stake in us having a healthy place to go have conversation.
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.960]   But the government's never going to run.
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:33.880]   Maybe it's tax credits.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.000]   Maybe it's just giving the money.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.680]   I think this is very valuable.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.680]   No, don't look for example.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.880]   That is run as sensibly as a non-profit, so that non-profits can use it.
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:45.720]   The problem is you don't know which of these is going to be winners, which of these is
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.720]   going to win the public.
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:47.720]   Yeah, in the number-cent.
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:51.160]   Reddit just came out of nowhere and took over from Dig.
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:54.000]   Twitter kind of came out of nowhere.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.360]   Did you ever done anything like it?
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.200]   I mean, what's the next one?
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.600]   No one knows.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.400]   And I can guarantee you it's not a government fund.
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.360]   It's even tax credit backed or even 501(c)(3).
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.360]   Sure thing.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:08.240]   I was so disappointed when Twitter first came out because I heard it.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.760]   It's like, this is brilliant.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.600]   140 countries.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.600]   People will craft Delica haikus.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:17.160]   That's not what I had a hand with.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.160]   That's not right.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.160]   Yeah.
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.160]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.160]   Moji, moji, moji.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:25.600]   All I'm saying here is I'm not arguing for anything.
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:29.520]   I'm saying that it's the same thing with local newspapers, right?
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:35.120]   Our democracy and our public commons are weaker with the demise of local news, which, again,
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.720]   this is a people have not found a business model that works.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:43.840]   And we see our public commons, like Reddit and Twitter having the same problem.
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:48.960]   It just seems to me this is all a common theme that's making our ability to just connect
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:49.960]   with each other.
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:55.160]   I mean, obviously, as a child of the BBC, I'm in favor of public service broadcasting.
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.280]   But yeah, I'm not sure that model particularly lines up.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:00.600]   Well, I mean, Canadians make it work, but other than that, it's...
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:06.760]   I think to some degree, this is a case of we had these high hopes when the internet began.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:07.760]   We saw it.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.320]   Have you read the Hacker Manifesto recently?
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.320]   It makes you weep well.
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:12.320]   It makes you weep well.
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:16.320]   We had John Perry Barlow on some years ago reading it out.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.080]   I remember it very well.
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.080]   Yeah.
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.880]   Hackers of the world, or what was it?
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:22.880]   We are not...
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:23.880]   Oh, gosh, I can't...
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:24.880]   Oh, so we'd have it...
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.560]   We saw the race and creed and death.
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:27.560]   Yeah.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.560]   Yeah.
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:29.560]   Not so much.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:35.480]   So I was part of the group that really had these kind of utopian dreams for the internet.
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.760]   And it really seemed like it was going to give everybody a voice.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:38.760]   Yeah.
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.200]   It's going to be all these things.
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:45.520]   I think what we're just seeing is in the natural evolution...
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:50.680]   I even wondered for... I've been wondering for decades how this continues without any
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:51.680]   revenue.
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.680]   Yeah.
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:54.200]   Because it all costs money, right?
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:57.920]   And it always seemed to me like it wasn't really sustainable.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:58.920]   Yeah.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:04.760]   I'm amazed we got 30 years down the road somehow with nobody making any money.
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:08.240]   And then of course Google figured it out and then that spread like a virus.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:11.640]   Oh, you could put ads on these things and you could make money.
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:13.080]   And then that's been up.
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.080]   Google's...
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.080]   Nightmare.
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.600]   That type of content is different though.
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.840]   And you think about the content you find on Reddit or Twitter.
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.080]   It's mostly one use content.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:26.560]   You will find it once, you will read it once and then that's it.
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:27.560]   Think of YouTube.
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.320]   YouTube, you submit that content.
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.440]   It will live forever on the surface and it can be watched millions and millions and
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:34.800]   times over and over even by the same people.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:39.520]   So when you've got content that is going to be reused over and over, you have a much more
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:44.600]   solid business plan than you do if it's a one use post.
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:46.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:47.600]   This is what John Perry Barlow wrote.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:51.320]   Gosh, it must be 25 years ago.
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:52.320]   Wow.
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.320]   Governments of the industrial world.
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.320]   You weary giants of flesh and steel.
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.640]   I come from cyberspace.
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.000]   The new home of mine.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.560]   On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone.
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.360]   You are not welcome among us.
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.800]   You have no sovereignty where we gathered.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.080]   Actually, that was really wrong.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:18.560]   I don't remember when we had John Perry on to read it.
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:23.400]   He was embarrassed even then he said, oh, I don't like to.
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.480]   We have no elected government nor are we likely to have one.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.480]   That didn't pay an hour.
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.480]   Yeah.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:32.240]   So I address you with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.240]   speaks.
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.480]   It is really this.
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:42.080]   I mean, I still cherish this vision of this utopian thing the internet could be.
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.960]   But in fact, it gave us the EFF.
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:45.960]   That's a hell of a big, you know.
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.480]   Yeah, the EFF is where I'm reading this from, by the way.
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.120]   He was one of the founders of the electronic front.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:53.840]   The downfall of all of this can be summed up with one sentence.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.840]   Some people suck.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:58.200]   But it's not just the people sucked.
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.960]   But it looks like it's free.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:01.960]   It isn't.
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.960]   It's in fact very expensive.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:09.080]   By the way, we're right now bearing our heads in the sand with AI, which is horrifically
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:13.880]   expensive to generate these large language models and everybody's betting on the come,
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:17.560]   just like they did with Uber saying, well, someday it's going to make some money.
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:18.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:19.560]   And it didn't.
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:22.120]   You can't have a pile of whatever this big and there was an opponent underneath.
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:23.120]   Yeah.
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:24.120]   There's no pony.
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.120]   I think that's what people are finally finding out.
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:26.120]   Yeah.
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.120]   That's what Elon has found out.
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:28.920]   It's what Steve Huffman is finding out.
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.080]   And it's very sad.
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.720]   But we had a good run.
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.360]   But I think it's over.
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:39.040]   Honestly, I mean, we grew up in the terms of putting it in the industry.
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:42.920]   But print journalism, where if you want to start a publication before desktop publishing
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:48.200]   really kicked off in the 80s and early 90s, you had to have access to a full six color
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:52.360]   printer and massive costs and massive distribution costs.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:56.160]   The internet kept desktop publishing came round and awful or easier to produce a magazine.
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.000]   You still got to print it out.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.640]   Internet lowered the cost of entry dramatically.
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:07.080]   What's now driving that cost to entry up is a matter of scale and deliberate policy.
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:11.000]   So it's gone sour somewhere along the line.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.400]   Well, that's what's happened to Twitter.
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:16.840]   And so people who are talking about you used to be all fun and all the cool things.
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:17.840]   It was.
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:22.600]   But now reality, I said to say, has sunk in for this internet generation.
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.200]   And I don't care where you look.
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.680]   You're seeing people saying we need to make money at this.
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:27.680]   We can't keep doing this for free.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.160]   You know, we're the Tocnerati.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:32.800]   And one of the things that we never say is it's okay for these things to die.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:33.800]   They have.
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:34.800]   They're going to die.
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:35.800]   They have to die.
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.640]   And then something else would come along as long as we keep holding on to what we're going
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.640]   to prop it up.
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:40.640]   We're going to prop it up.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:41.640]   We're going to keep investing.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:42.640]   We're going to find a new revenues.
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:46.840]   Then it will stagnate because all they're focusing on now is I need to keep the lights
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:47.840]   on.
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:49.840]   Do you think so?
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:53.320]   Like I was looking at something the other day just talking at the state of media, right?
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:58.400]   And there was such a change in that industry went from print to digital media that disrupted
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.400]   everything.
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.400]   You were very much on that forefront of it.
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.600]   Now that everyone is having trouble.
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.480]   That's exactly it.
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:11.280]   We're seeing digital go like it's becoming smaller and there's nothing to replace it.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.840]   But there's just less of it.
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:16.240]   Who's going to who would build another Reddit or another Twitter these days?
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:21.400]   Someone look over at the streaming space for Gen Z. So you have a competitor to Twitch,
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:25.160]   Twitch is in a lot of financial problems just by being on by Amazon.
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:30.960]   And you have kick kick has been like starting passing out $100 million contracts like they're
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:31.960]   canned.
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:32.960]   That is not sustainable.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:33.960]   Can I?
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:34.960]   They just paid Ninja.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:37.960]   That's like yourself thing, Ninja for big sure.
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:38.960]   Yeah.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.720]   I'm shutting you down six months later.
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:42.720]   But so now get me stops.
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:43.720]   No, get me 100 million.
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:48.080]   Excuse me, 100 million dollars, not it, but not even an exclusive.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.560]   That's right.
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.560]   So that's not sustainable.
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:57.240]   Well, no, to be to be fair, the thing with kick is it's tied into gambling.
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:59.240]   So it's a huge money.
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:05.720]   There's a lot of incentive there to kind of plug the user base into online gambling.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:09.600]   So that's where they make their money, which is probably a better business model than say
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.600]   Twitch.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.600]   Well, and so that's what happens.
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:16.600]   It's either gambling or Google spying on us all and selling advertising or meta doing
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:17.960]   the same.
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:18.960]   It's it's it's.
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:19.960]   No, I'm not these people.
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:20.960]   You know what I mean?
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:21.960]   It's not a word for it.
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:22.960]   That goes without saying.
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:27.960]   But well, porn's in trouble too, because of the digital environment, nobody pays for
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:30.560]   porn anymore, right?
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:35.560]   So you know, Leo, some people still care about production value.
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:37.040]   It's all about story, isn't it?
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:40.080]   You know, I think honestly, good soundtrack.
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:45.520]   Look at this and look at the streamers like Netflix, Amazon Prime, they're everybody is
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.480]   suffering.
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:49.840]   And it's not because the economy is going south anymore.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.160]   You can't say that anymore.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:53.800]   No, it's oversupply.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.920]   It's bad management decisions by some some companies.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.520]   I think it's because it was always unsustainable.
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.080]   Clearly kick.
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.160]   You can't pay people a hundred million dollars.
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:04.600]   Except for non-exclusive deals.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.840]   One of them is 700 million four.
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.640]   That is not a contract with a person.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:12.040]   That is that is an enticement for people to invest in kick.
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:13.680]   That is that is a announcement to say.
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:14.680]   I don't agree.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:18.840]   Well, I mean, when you pay out these big deals and you know that you're never going to get
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:23.640]   an ROI on that deal, it means that you want to move yourself up in the headlines.
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:24.640]   Sure.
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:27.120]   You want to make your business unsustainable.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.440]   This is a model we've seen this why Uber.
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:34.720]   It's what in the short term, it's get you know, users at any expense and we'll figure
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:37.400]   out how to monetize later.
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.760]   But I think we know now there is no later.
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:44.240]   But if they can make their IPO and get up.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.240]   Absolutely.
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:48.840]   How many suckers can you find Twitter was a success story.
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:50.920]   I the investors got paid.
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:57.800]   I feel I feel on our bound to defend train wrecks who is one of the people behind kick.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:02.240]   I mean, this is someone who if you listen to him talk about the business model for kick,
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:06.880]   he talks about the lifetime user value by bringing someone over there and gang them
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:09.400]   on the what they call the Gamba train.
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:10.400]   Can't call it gambling.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.400]   Got to be Gen Z.
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.400]   Of course.
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.960]   You know, and this is something.
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:14.960]   Great.
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:17.400]   So he's going to take the whole new generation to gambling.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:18.400]   I'm saying it's a rough name model.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.400]   I'm saying it's a rough name model.
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:20.400]   You got to find a sucker somewhere.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:24.400]   If it's not the stock market, it's the two lago readers just.
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:30.120]   But there's no sustainable business without screwing somebody.
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:34.040]   Yeah, no, between you used to be the only reason Twitter investors got their money out is
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.600]   because some idiot paid $44 billion for it.
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:38.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:43.040]   All successful businesses are built on vice every single one.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.560]   Says the priest.
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:47.760]   No, and he says the priest.
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:50.280]   What about you know, probably better than most.
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.720]   No, I'm dead serious.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:52.720]   Even nonprofits.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.320]   You know how we we raise money.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:55.560]   It's all based on three.
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:58.440]   We appeal to legacy lust.
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:59.520]   What about Legos?
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:02.000]   How are Legos built on vice?
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.440]   Legos are built on this idea of idealizing childhood, the simplicity of building something
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:08.640]   the greed of children.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:11.800]   That's very special to rule and out.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.040]   I got to have no.
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:15.320]   No, no, I'm not saying I'm not saying that.
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:16.880]   Oh my God, I have more lego.
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:17.880]   Get rid of it.
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:23.240]   You have to understand that every successful business in some way or form appeals to a
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.240]   vice.
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.240]   Sure.
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:26.240]   Yeah.
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.080]   Wait a minute, let me just look the seven deadly sins.
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:31.360]   I have to do a little refresher.
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:35.560]   We should do the seven deadly sins and then group the companies and those Zendalto Grims.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:37.320]   Gluttony lust greed.
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:38.320]   Despair.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:42.560]   I don't think anybody's making money on despair, but we'll have to.
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.360]   Yeah, we will.
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:45.360]   We will.
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:48.160]   And I think Netflix is making anger in the money.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.960]   Oh my gosh, yes.
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:50.960]   Sloth.
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:51.960]   Video games.
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.680]   No, no, sloth is door.
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:54.840]   Sloth is door.
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:55.840]   Dash.
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:56.840]   Yeah.
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:57.840]   Pride.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.440]   Just making money on pride.
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.440]   Lego.
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:01.440]   Lego.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.240]   No, Twitter is also pride.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.240]   Yeah.
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:06.840]   A lot of people want to get those likes.
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:10.640]   Nobody actually goes on Facebook and says, Oh, God, really bad PMS today.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:11.640]   And killing me.
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:14.160]   So like, had a lovely day today with the family.
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.160]   Here's some.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.160]   I just woke up.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.160]   My hair is perfect.
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.160]   My skin is flawless.
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.160]   That's Instagram.
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.160]   Yeah.
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:21.160]   That is sloth.
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:22.160]   That's wrath.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.960]   I think we got them all.
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:24.960]   Envy.
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:25.960]   Envy.
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:26.960]   Who's based on envy?
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:27.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:28.960]   Insta.
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:29.960]   No, no, no.
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.960]   What's the one with for Zillow?
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:32.960]   Zillow.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:33.960]   Zillow.
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:34.960]   Zillow.
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:35.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:36.960]   There you go.
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:37.960]   I use Zillow to actually get a house.
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:40.760]   Well, there's some people use it for real, but most people use it for real.
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:43.960]   You may actually be one of the virtuous people, which means you need to get out of here.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:47.560]   But you think of virtue, think of reality.
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:50.520]   Isn't it interesting?
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:54.320]   I think you've got a new, we're going to call it the balancer.
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:55.320]   I'm so going to do this.
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:56.480]   I'm going to be the poster.
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:00.320]   Companies are based on one of the seven deadly scenes.
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:01.920]   You should come off with some elements.
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:05.360]   So when you talk about Twitter, the, the, the, the, that's really thin comes from the
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.360]   other.
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:09.800]   Are there any vegans that I can do that maybe fortune is based on a crime?
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:11.800]   I'm damn difficult.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:12.800]   I'm probably someone British.
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:24.680]   I mean, the monarchy to get Brianna back in on this behind every great fortune is a flag.
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:26.680]   There is a crime.
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:27.680]   Balzac.
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:28.680]   Oh, okay.
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:30.680]   Don't blame the Brits for this one.
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:31.680]   He's a French.
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:32.680]   It was a good guess.
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:33.680]   It was a good guess.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:34.680]   French play with a very dodgy sounding name.
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:38.520]   I didn't know this role, but it was the epigraph of the godfather.
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:40.520]   Was the epigraph of the godfather.
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:41.520]   Yes.
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.520]   No, it's so.
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:45.920]   It was inspired by a sentence written by Balzac.
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:53.120]   Le secre d'grant, faltoons, sontcos et parant et dune creme ublier.
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:58.520]   The secret of grand fortunes without obvious cause is a forgotten crime.
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:00.320]   See, it's just sounds better in French.
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:02.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:03.320]   Some languages better of that.
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:08.880]   This is a reason there's been no German love poets, you know, just or finish.
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:09.880]   All right.
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:10.880]   It's been a minute.
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:11.880]   It's been a minute.
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:12.880]   It's been a minute.
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:16.200]   Actually, I have a gift for father Robins in the next section.
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.200]   Oh, boy.
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:18.200]   All right.
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.800]   It's so fun to have an all in studio.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.440]   I have so much more lively.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:22.440]   It's been a year.
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:25.040]   We're all going to dinner after this.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.040]   Yes, we are.
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.280]   So save some conversation for dinner.
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:30.360]   Brianna Wu is here all the way from these guys.
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.360]   What brings you out here?
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.760]   Ah, I am guest of honor at Beikon.
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:35.400]   Hey, fun.
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.400]   Yes.
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:39.840]   Is that the conference for people who are big fans of science, for Christmas?
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:40.840]   Science fiction.
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:41.840]   Yep.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:44.520]   Kat Valente, who's one of my favorite authors.
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:47.080]   She's out there headlining it along with me.
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:48.480]   Along with this guy.
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.960]   I'm sort of a fan of Frank Wu is the...
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:54.640]   So Frank, he's not only a writer, but he's a great illustrator.
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:59.480]   I saw his stuff at the Science Fiction Museum or actually the Museum of Popular or something
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:00.480]   or other in the Seattle.
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:02.280]   Are you letting Frank drive?
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.280]   No.
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:04.280]   No.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:05.280]   Do you drive a manual?
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.280]   No, no.
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:07.280]   I'm in a print.
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:08.280]   He's just a front page.
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:09.280]   I took that picture.
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.280]   It's a great picture of Frank.
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:12.920]   Look at that with the American Eagle.
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:13.920]   Right behind him.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:14.920]   We call him "Egli."
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:18.400]   We got that and put it here in front yard because we love America.
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.400]   I think he's great.
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:23.320]   You only take photos of Frank when he's doing that surprise face.
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:25.360]   It's like every photo is like Frank.
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:26.360]   He loves to perform.
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:27.360]   He's like you, Leo.
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:31.520]   He's on and he just casts that position in a set-quack.
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:32.760]   He's hosting mass fans.
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:33.760]   There we go.
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:37.400]   Also with this, it's so great to have Ian Thompson.
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.400]   I understand this.
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:45.440]   Who's the guy with the thin mustache that I always think you look like or used to look
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:46.440]   like when you had the mustache?
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:47.440]   Does he do right?
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:48.440]   No, no, no, no.
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:49.440]   The famous British.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:50.440]   Paul Roll.
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:51.440]   The gap in his teeth.
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:52.440]   Oh, Terry Thomas?
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:53.440]   Terry Thomas.
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:56.520]   That's why I keep calling you "I have been assumed."
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:57.520]   Yes.
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:00.360]   It has been pushed out to me when I get very, very drunk.
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:01.360]   Do you become a depreary?
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.160]   You were writing me a lot of Terry Thomas.
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:06.840]   And I seriously thought that's who you were for a long time.
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:10.080]   Wait, was he a master in Doctor Who?
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.080]   No.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:12.080]   He's long gone.
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:14.240]   But what a great British actor.
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:16.000]   And when you had the pencil mustache.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.880]   Oh, the 13th jerk of Wimbledon was my favorite.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:22.560]   It was by far the best cost you might have put on.
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:24.360]   Is that a real duke or just someone you might have?
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:27.040]   No, no, this is a guy from the far show called the 13th jeezer.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:29.000]   Me, the 13th jerk of Wimbledon.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.920]   Here, the ladies finishing school with my reputation.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:33.920]   Ding, dong.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:38.560]   Thank you, sir.
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:41.920]   He normally writes for the register, but he also does questions.
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:46.720]   And if you want to invite him to your next party, I'm sure he'll become as the 13th duke
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:47.720]   of Wimbledon.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:51.040]   You need a top hat and a monocle.
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:52.040]   Please.
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:53.840]   I have both in the other room.
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:54.840]   We'll get him.
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:55.840]   And a brandy sifter.
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:56.840]   We don't have a snifter.
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:01.440]   Mr. Robert, Father Robert Ballis, all the way from Vatican City.
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:02.520]   It's so good to see you.
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:05.120]   You are here for fun or profit?
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:06.960]   No, I am here.
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:13.560]   I made a deal with my boss to come home four times a year to take care of my father and
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:16.000]   take some of the pressure off my mom and my sister.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   It's good for you.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.240]   I'm so glad you are here.
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:19.240]   It's nice to be here.
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:20.240]   He loves seeing you.
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:21.680]   I missed you in Rome.
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:23.280]   By three hours, I think.
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:27.000]   Yeah, I could have come to that party, but we're flying out early the next morning and
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.960]   I thought, you know, I told you, I had so many special.
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:31.720]   I was going to take you down into the Necropolis.
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:33.720]   I was going to take you into the back of the Vatican.
[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:35.920]   Oh, man, you've gotten wicked.
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:41.040]   And remember, I told you, if you get a call from me, it's because we have another one
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.040]   of those after-hour tours.
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:44.760]   And I will be on a plane that night.
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:45.760]   That's a good call.
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:46.760]   Nobody but us.
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:47.760]   They just let us run.
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:48.760]   Oh, so much fun.
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:49.760]   I really enjoyed Rome.
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.760]   And it's funny because you do not appreciate it at all.
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:53.760]   I don't.
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:54.760]   I feel bad about that.
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:57.320]   The greatest city in the world.
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:58.320]   And he doesn't appreciate it.
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:00.080]   I mean, it's what?
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:03.200]   I could see why some people would like it.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:07.280]   But you know, when you've when you've lived in Las Vegas, Rome, it feels like a good
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:08.280]   guy.
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:11.120]   I look at the Coliseum and I go, you know, I could fix that.
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:15.640]   All right, we're going to have more in just a bit with what a wonderful panel would first
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:19.040]   a word from our sponsor, Zip Rachrotar.
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.400]   We use Zip recruiter.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:27.880]   And if you're hiring and you're currently dealing with interesting economic future, that's

[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:10.640]   Thank you, Zip recruiter, for supporting this week in tech.
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:12.960]   Father Robert, I thought you were here for DefConner.
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:13.960]   That is in August.
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:15.960]   In August, I am going to DefConner.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:16.960]   You want to meet someone?
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:17.960]   I have my ticket.
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:18.960]   I'm ready to go.
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:19.960]   Yep.
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:20.960]   Excellent.
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:21.960]   We'll see you there.
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:22.960]   Oh, you go every year too, don't you?
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:25.400]   This time, Ian and I were together to DefConner.
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:28.000]   He was sitting in front of me and I just started using sneak shelter.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.560]   Taking pictures of him and putting him on Twitter.
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:35.440]   Well, now I want you to take this to DefConner with you.
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:38.840]   This is, and by the way, this is a huge success.
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:41.280]   It's the Flipper Zero.
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:45.280]   Amazon refuses to sell it because it's, they call it a multi-tool for hackers.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:46.280]   It is a multi-tool.
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:48.160]   It's not a really shirty device.
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:49.800]   I mean, come on.
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:51.560]   It's not that dangerous.
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:55.880]   If you have no idea what you're doing, it will not make you an elite hacker.
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:59.720]   And if you know what you're doing, you can buy stuff that will do everything on here
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:01.960]   plus, but it's just kind of cool.
[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:03.720]   And it has a little snake game on it.
[00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:08.960]   So you can pretend when you're going through Italian customs, that's just my little snake
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:09.960]   game.
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:10.960]   You ain't going to buy another one.
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:13.160]   You're going to have to like three bucks now.
[00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:16.400]   $80 million worth of sales on the Flipper Zero.
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.400]   It's so funny.
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:18.400]   I'm teasing him.
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:19.400]   It's a flipper.
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:20.400]   I'm teasing him.
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:25.120]   I have updated the firmware, but I think you might have to do it again for a while.
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:26.320]   That's the Flipper Zero.
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:28.400]   Dear Defcon, I'm coming.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:33.400]   Now, just so you know, if that's a sin, you could just give that to me.
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:35.400]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:40.720]   This is going to be emblazoned with a Twitch sticker so everyone knows that they're being
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:41.720]   hacked by twins.
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:43.680]   Oh, please, no, no, no.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:46.960]   It's supposed to be plausible deniability.
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:48.760]   So we did add a little review of it.
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:55.440]   In fact, I used it to break into the studio by Claude Micah's fob and it's very easy.
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:57.800]   It's very transparent.
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.240]   You can open garage doors in theory.
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:02.040]   I was going to do this and I was warned against it.
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:07.520]   In theory, you could break into cars by duplicating the key fob on that little device.
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:13.520]   The problem is modern cars will sense it and lock you out and then it would have to get
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:14.520]   all the key fobs.
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:15.520]   I have a lot of way around that.
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:17.840]   Which is the, that's why it's in better hands.
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:21.800]   Do you ever worry that if there's an actual hacker that gets into the Vatican, like they're
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:22.800]   all going to blame you.
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:24.800]   They're going to be like, it's not a word.
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:25.800]   That has happened.
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:26.800]   Oh, really?
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:27.800]   Yeah, call me.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:28.800]   Really?
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:29.800]   Oh.
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:30.800]   Oh, okay.
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:31.800]   So they soon.
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:32.800]   He set up a honey pot.
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:37.080]   He said, you know, you were in the, all the newspapers a few years ago when you set up
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:40.760]   a Minecraft server, the Vatican's Minecraft server, but it turns out it was really more
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:41.760]   like a honey pot.
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:42.760]   It was a honey pot.
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:45.400]   But it worked so well.
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:46.400]   You cut all the way.
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:47.400]   So well.
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:48.400]   All the bad guys.
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:50.200]   My sister just bought a Tesla.
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:51.200]   So hey, Mel.
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:52.200]   Oh.
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:53.200]   Oh.
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:54.200]   Oh.
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:57.800]   This thing, what it really is, is a little inexpensive, relatively.
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:53:58.800]   I think it's 130 bucks.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:53:59.800]   I have a captain.
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:02.120]   Device that has a bunch of radios in it, right?
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:04.840]   And firmware that lets you access those radios and do so.
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:06.160]   They're all software defined radios.
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:09.200]   So you can make them do anything you want them to do.
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:13.120]   We've had setups like this for years and years, but it normally meant you had to have several
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:16.960]   different radio setups connected to your laptop and run specialized software.
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:20.240]   This is sort of hit the button and leave it in your pocket and see what comes up.
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:22.640]   You could open this to charging port with it.
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:24.440]   Just press a button and it could pop.
[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:28.800]   I mean, also, frankly, you could stick it in the bushes in front of a house and collect
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:29.800]   all kinds of user stuff.
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:30.800]   I was at a DEF CON.
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:34.520]   In fact, the last DEF CON I went to, there was a very interesting talk where they looked
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:36.760]   at Bluetooth locks.
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:41.920]   And there they looked at, I think it was a dozen locks and they found that 10 out of
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:45.240]   the 12 were broadcasting the codes in clear text.
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:46.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:49.840]   And you just throw one of those into the bridge, you know, to the edge and it would pick it
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:50.840]   up.
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:55.680]   And of the other two, one of them, which did encrypt its data, was so easy to open, you
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:56.680]   could do it with a screwdriver.
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:57.680]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:02.960]   If you go to St. Peter's and you're walking around the square, you will probably get a
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:05.080]   signal that says free Vatican Wi-Fi.
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:06.920]   Oh, that's me.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:11.520]   Oh, you have any idea how much information I've collected?
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:15.000]   Because I've got a Yagi on top of our roof pointing down into the square.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.480]   I'm thinking, this is a thing that there's free Wi-Fi.
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:19.480]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:22.480]   Maybe it's the church being nice.
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:23.480]   I know.
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:25.480]   I wish I was wrong with that.
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:26.480]   Thank you.
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:27.360]   St. St. St. St. St.
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:30.400]   It's three times slowly.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:33.920]   I just, I, I, I might have joined that come to think of it.
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:34.920]   I'm trying to remember.
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:38.680]   I mean, most of the traffic is encrypted, but you, you look as surprised how much time
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:39.840]   goes through your fear text.
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:40.840]   It's amazing.
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:41.840]   And this day and age, they're still clear.
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:45.840]   So show me, here's a picture of the Vatican city.
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:46.840]   I took this.
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:47.840]   Okay.
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:48.840]   Go back to that.
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:49.840]   Go back to that.
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:50.840]   We weren't sure where you lived.
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:51.840]   That's your studio.
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:53.840]   That's your studio.
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:54.840]   That's your studio right there.
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:56.440]   You're explaining about this.
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:57.440]   Look at this.
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:01.320]   He's overlooking the, see all these chairs.
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:03.480]   That's when the Pope does an audience.
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:04.480]   That's where all the people sit.
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:05.480]   He's right there.
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:06.480]   I just go up to the roof.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:07.480]   Just go to the roof.
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:11.800]   I understand that tourists drive up prices, but that's, that's still a pretty sweet
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:12.800]   grid.
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:13.800]   Oh, no, it's very nice.
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:14.800]   It's beautiful.
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:16.600]   It's, it's, it's, I mean, I can't complain about that.
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:17.600]   So jealous.
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:21.240]   But the city itself, I mean, I don't dislike it.
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:22.480]   It's just, I don't appreciate it.
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:23.600]   I know I don't appreciate it.
[00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:24.960]   I'm self-aware enough to know.
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:27.440]   I mean, there's something that's beautiful and I have no idea.
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:30.840]   Here's another view from St. Peter's Basilica, the church.
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:33.000]   And there's your, there's your little hut right there.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   Yep.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   Just look for those trees.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   Those trees, that's our property.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.600]   We call them lollipop trees, but there's actually another name for them.
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:41.600]   They're like Cypress.
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:42.600]   I love them.
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:44.600]   So I assume you saw a fast 10.
[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:46.600]   Did they get that accurate with the Vatican?
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:47.600]   They did.
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:48.600]   I see some people.
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:50.880]   Any car chase through, through any part of them.
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:51.880]   Doesn't go as the vaccine.
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:52.880]   Yes.
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:53.880]   You can't.
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:54.880]   You can't.
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:55.880]   That's what I mean.
[00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:56.880]   The wheels would fall off.
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:57:01.320]   I did a test drive for the, the 2015 Mustang.
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:02.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:03.320]   And figured, okay.
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:04.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.200]   I mean, San Francisco, let's do the bullet ride.
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:08.200]   It's like, yeah, you can't actually do that.
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:09.200]   It's fine.
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:11.000]   Well, you could, but they live that bit there.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   You would ruin the car.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   Two miles over to the city.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   Oh, that's true.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.920]   By the way, if any of you visit Rome, you can stay with us.
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:19.920]   We do have guest apartments.
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:22.800]   Yeah, I can't go on the Wi-Fi because I'll get out.
[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:24.400]   You don't get whatever you do.
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:25.400]   That's true.
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:26.400]   Don't do that.
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:29.000]   So this, so this is St. Peter's and you're just right over here.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.480]   You're right on the other side.
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:32.040]   So I'm on that side.
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:33.040]   That side.
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:34.040]   Yeah.
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:36.040]   That's very nice.
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:37.040]   iPhone 14.
[00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:38.040]   No way.
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:39.520]   I didn't bring a real camera.
[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:40.520]   Wow.
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:41.680]   Because I wanted to do a test.
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:44.400]   Like, can I take all the pictures that I want to take?
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:45.400]   You should not take.
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:46.840]   Should I give the audience a tip?
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:48.840]   Probably.
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:49.840]   Or just keep it for everyone else.
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:51.520]   Yeah, give them a tip.
[00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:53.000]   So the, okay, the tip is this.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:57.680]   If you are going to visit Rome, the best tour to take is the SCAVI.
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:57:58.680]   SCAVI.
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:57:59.680]   Oh, I didn't know this.
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:00.680]   That was true.
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:04.720]   It's only been recently opened in the last, so it is the excavation underneath.
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:05.720]   St. Peter's.
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:06.720]   It's the Necropolis.
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:07.720]   Wow.
[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:08.720]   Okay.
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:10.680]   Now the nice thing about it is it's relatively inexpensive.
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:12.240]   It's only like 13 euros for a ticket.
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:15.520]   They only take 120 people a day.
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:19.240]   So of the tens of thousands of people that go through, they only take 120.
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:20.240]   Oh, wow.
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:21.240]   So it's hard to get into it.
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:22.240]   It's hard.
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.800]   Well, no, you just have to, you have to, nobody knows about it.
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:26.760]   So you have to reserve it well in advance.
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:31.160]   But the nice thing is after you're done with the tour, they, it pops you up in St. Peter's.
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:33.280]   So you bypass all those lines.
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:35.840]   The hours and hours of lines, you don't have to deal with.
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:36.840]   Oh, there are lines.
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:39.080]   And they, and by the way, that you have to surrender tripods.
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:41.240]   You have to surrender a lot of stuff.
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:44.320]   Unless unless you know somebody who's a VFABRI.
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:45.320]   This is the case.
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:46.320]   VFABRI.
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:47.320]   This is the case.
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:50.600]   I'm trying to remember the cats and coons of the Paris who went down there and they.
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:51.920]   That's what this is.
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:52.920]   That's what that.
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:56.080]   I would love that was quite something to do this.
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:57.080]   Oh my gosh.
[00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:58.080]   I wish I'd known.
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:03.000]   Well, I just, I just recently found out that one of the tunnels on our property actually
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.800]   connects as adjacent to the tunnels there.
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:06.800]   Wow.
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:08.800]   So I just knocked through the wall a little bit.
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:09.800]   Yeah.
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:12.440]   I don't know why this is not a picture of the Pope.
[00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:13.440]   This is not.
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:15.440]   This is my top.
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:16.800]   This is my D.A.
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:17.800]   Bloek character.
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:19.640]   Is that one ugly brute?
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:20.640]   That's Francis.
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:21.640]   I think you could have done better.
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:23.440]   That's ugly, ugly brute.
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:24.840]   I like the hat.
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:25.840]   You should get the hat.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:26.840]   Are you in studio?
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:28.440]   Like deep into that game now.
[00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:29.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:30.440]   It's so dark.
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:31.440]   It is so a cruelty.
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:32.440]   It's a cruelty.
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:34.920]   Is it as good as people say it is?
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:35.920]   It's Diablo.
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:37.320]   If you played Diablo 3, it's just like that.
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:40.760]   Yeah, except I played like 15 minutes and got so tired of dying.
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:44.880]   I get tired of just mash, mash, mash, mash, mash, mash, mash, mash, mash, mash, mash.
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:46.520]   It really is a slot machine.
[00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:50.320]   I realized we were talking a couple of weeks ago with Ashley Sketh on the show.
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:51.560]   She's like World 3.
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:54.360]   She's a top tier, 60, whatever.
[00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:55.360]   She played a lot of it.
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:56.360]   I said, it's just a slot machine.
[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:59.720]   You keep pushing the button till you get loot and then you go somewhere else.
[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.920]   You push the button on once till you get loot.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:02.920]   Yeah.
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:03.920]   I think that's the mechanics.
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:04.920]   It's not a lot of strategy.
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:05.920]   No, no, no.
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.560]   I completely disagree with that.
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:13.120]   It's not optimizing your build at the highest levels for really high level content and then
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:15.480]   farming certain rare elements.
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:16.640]   By getting loot.
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:21.120]   But it's the fun is on how you do your build.
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.720]   That game is so dark.
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:23.960]   Like I love horror movies.
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:25.920]   It's grimer than it's ever been before.
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:26.920]   It is.
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:29.520]   Diablos are just cartoons.
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.720]   Like this is seriously a selling stuff.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:33.320]   Like horror movie type.
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:34.320]   It really is.
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:35.320]   It really is.
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:36.920]   See, I'm not big on that.
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:38.120]   Well, don't play this game.
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:40.520]   How can I like it?
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:41.520]   Ooh.
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:43.520]   Is it grimer than Elden Ring?
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:46.960]   Like, yes, sort of.
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:50.320]   Is it more grindy than lost souls or dark souls?
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:51.320]   Yes, definitely.
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:53.240]   Oh, it's just that's all.
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:54.240]   That's what Diablos is.
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:55.240]   He's grinding.
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:56.240]   Yeah.
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:00.120]   See, I'm not a fan of like it's fun grinding though because it's so grim.
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.120]   Ooh.
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:04.640]   I have to say there's a lot more story.
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:11.080]   They have used their time and probably AI to generate a lot of backstory, a lot of
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.440]   C's, a lot of stuff going on.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.680]   In fact, I realized, don't talk to anybody.
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:17.360]   They're going to give you a job.
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:19.640]   Then pretty soon you get all these quests.
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:24.960]   If you talk to anybody, you know, my father died in the plains a hundred years ago and
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:26.960]   we still try to get the keys to that house.
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.840]   Are all the quests procedurally generated?
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:32.840]   No, I think they're scripted, but they're also depressing because you show up.
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:36.200]   It's like, oh, your father died in a ritual suicide.
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.760]   Watch him just kill himself right in front of you.
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:39.760]   Yeah, it's pretty horrible.
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:40.760]   Yeah.
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:41.760]   That's pretty normal.
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:42.760]   That happens.
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:48.200]   Speaking of horrible, it looks like Canada is going to pass C18.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.200]   Ooh.
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:56.120]   And already Meta has said, well, if C18 passes, which is a link text, basically, this is the
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.120]   one where they did Australia.
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:00.440]   I don't like they did in Australia.
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:05.680]   So this came out of Rupert Murdoch who said, you know, hey, mate, you're linking to my
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.680]   content.
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:10.280]   You ought to give me some money for that to which Google says, we're driving all the
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:13.840]   traffic to your content and you want us to pay you?
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:18.640]   Anyway, legislators being legislatures get involved.
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:23.000]   And in the case of Canada, it's now a law.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:30.840]   The government says Google and other companies will have to pay for showing links to news
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:31.840]   sites.
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:33.400]   Lane Canada.
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:39.040]   Meta has already said, well, no more news for you, Canada, in any of our feeds.
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:45.880]   And Google has just announced that they are, in fact, going to remove links to Canadian
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:46.880]   news.
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:51.440]   Now, see, how is this good for your, if you're, you know, the Toronto Globe and Mail, they're
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:56.040]   going to remove links in search, news, and discover products.
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:59.560]   You'll no longer be able to operate the Google News Showcase in Canada.
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:01.360]   So that's gone.
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:02.800]   Google's basically said bye-bye.
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:03.800]   Yeah.
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:04.800]   Okay.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:08.240]   So someone on the cold face for this, it's not as bad as it sounds.
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:11.800]   It all depends on your readership model.
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:15.320]   So for example, so you get traffic that's not referred from the search engines.
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:20.440]   We get about less than double digit traffic from Facebook.
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:24.160]   We get less than a third of our traffic from Google.
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:26.720]   We get a bunch of direct people because they love the site.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.440]   They come directly to us.
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:31.520]   Now, yeah, if you're, I can't tell you how, if you're running a few times, I've seen
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.480]   registered the registered com.
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:34.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.400]   And tech meme will rather than a virgin in Manchester, but you know, I mean, it's just
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:42.760]   like the, I don't know anything about Manchester, but I'm guessing that's fairly rare.
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:46.680]   But I know, like I said, I went to the front page today because we were looking for Twitter
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:47.680]   story.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:48.680]   Yeah.
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:52.760]   But normally I just see links or that I follow and you're right, you're not on tech meme.
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:55.240]   You would be referred a lot by tech meme.
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.240]   Yeah.
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.240]   Now I mean, for some reason they've got it.
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:01.760]   They've got some believe in this, but I mean, it's like, it depends how you.
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:02.760]   But that hurts you.
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.360]   That hurts you if Google search doesn't show you.
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:06.840]   If men, it doesn't show you.
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:12.880]   If we actually got revenue from then taking our copy and publishing it, which it's kind
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:19.080]   of reasonable enough, then, you know, we wouldn't have a problem with it as we survive.
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:24.160]   What we do as we do, that's kind of what happened in Australia, which is yeah, Murdoch's publications
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:27.640]   and all the others got together with Google and negotiated a fee.
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:28.640]   Yeah.
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:30.960]   So exactly the same thing will happen in Canada.
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:31.960]   Okay.
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:32.960]   So we tried it in Spain.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:37.240]   Remember Spain that was running for eight years and Spanish publishers saying, oh, it's
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:38.240]   money.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:42.680]   They actually levied a mandated payment and then Google said, okay, we're going to stop.
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:44.040]   We're shutting down Google Spain.
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.040]   Yeah.
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:46.040]   And they did for two years.
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:49.960]   And then finally they came back that Spain changed a lot, no mandatory payments.
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:53.320]   And because they realized they're actually providing us a service.
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:54.480]   Same thing is going to happen in Canada.
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:57.280]   There's going to be some publishers who are going to stick to their guns because they
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:59.440]   are insistent that they were right.
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:02.760]   And the other publishers are going to look at the bottom line and say, wait a minute,
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:04.040]   is this really what you wanted?
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:08.280]   I think there's a difference in terms of market because Australia and Canada are much
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:11.760]   bigger markets than Spain will ever be.
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:17.400]   There is a very limited market for Spanish language new, well, for European Spanish language
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:20.560]   in Australia, let's put it that way.
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:23.360]   Whereas Canada, Australia, they've got a bit more clout.
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:27.480]   It all depends whether or not they hang together or hang separately.
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:33.240]   So I mean, look, I truly don't have strong policy positions on this, but just to play
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:39.800]   a little bit of a devil's advocate here, you know, the reality is Google is one of the
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:42.280]   largest companies in the entire world.
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:48.720]   And they have built a revenue model that is about value extraction from a lot of different
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:49.720]   parts of the industry.
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:55.320]   I can tell you someone who runs a ton of ads and will run literally hundreds of thousands,
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:06:02.240]   if not a million dollars in ads for 2024, you know, we give them and Facebook a lot of money
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:06.160]   because their ad tools are the very best in the business.
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:11.360]   They've built a essentially a monopoly or a duopoly, I think would be fair to say, that
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:15.520]   makes it very hard for smaller people in this face to thrive.
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:21.500]   So don't you think maybe this is not the answer, but Leo coming back to that hackers like
[01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:26.460]   Mono that you were putting up earlier, if you look at what went wrong with that vision,
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:30.960]   it was the big companies like Google and Facebook kind of interceding and extracting
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:33.060]   all the value possible out of the end.
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:37.940]   And balkanizing like certain parts of the nation say that word today, but you know what
[01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:42.140]   I mean, like segmenting off the internet and I can see that's historic.
[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:44.540]   It's supposed to be offensive in some way.
[01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:46.180]   To people in the Balkans.
[01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:47.580]   Apparently I don't want to connect you.
[01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:49.180]   I apologize to our friends in the Balkans.
[01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:52.180]   I thought you said vulcanizing, treating like that.
[01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:54.340]   Very offensive.
[01:06:54.340 --> 01:07:00.260]   So to me, this is so I just searched for the headline of your article about a Google,
[01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:01.260]   which we're going to get to.
[01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:02.260]   True Brian.
[01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:03.260]   Yeah.
[01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:05.020]   And I find the link to the register.
[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:06.700]   I see a snippet.
[01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:08.180]   The snippet is not long.
[01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:11.020]   It's not even a it's not even three sentences.
[01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:12.300]   It's two and a half.
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:14.260]   Google accused ripping off advertisers with video ads.
[01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:16.620]   No one saw now the expert view.
[01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:17.620]   That's it.
[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:19.940]   And if I want to read more, I'm going to click that link.
[01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:23.540]   I don't think they're stealing anything from you with that snippet.
[01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:28.620]   No, but they are taking advantage of content was that they had no input into.
[01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:29.620]   Right.
[01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:30.620]   How are they taking advantage?
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:35.260]   They're giving me searching for this story a little bit so I know what that article is
[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:36.260]   going to be.
[01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:39.940]   We're giving you a we're giving them a reason for them to look at your side.
[01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:42.140]   Yeah, but I'm going to click your link.
[01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:46.900]   I mean, the only reason this would be costly to you is if I read the snippet and then
[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:50.660]   it said, Oh, that's plenty and didn't go to your site.
[01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:52.260]   But this doesn't give me enough to do that.
[01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:54.860]   They have improved a lot on that.
[01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:58.740]   But at the same time, you know, it's well, we're not.
[01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:02.820]   I mean, they are driving traffic to you with an unlimited format.
[01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:03.820]   Yes.
[01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:06.100]   And they're also benefiting enormously from that traffic themselves.
[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:10.660]   Well, there's service is the search of their own heart doing a search engine and it
[01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:14.500]   leaves a search engine that's a good and collects data on the people that do the searches,
[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.380]   which pays for Google's bills.
[01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:17.380]   Yeah.
[01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:21.380]   You know, it's kind of like you can't build as you put it, the best advertising engine
[01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:24.420]   in the world, unless you've got a hell of a lot of user data.
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:25.420]   That's exactly right.
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:28.820]   And they get that user data from registered readers from people that go through their
[01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:30.740]   site to the register.
[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:37.380]   It's so specific that I use that information with list matching to like find out what
[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:39.740]   articles they've read, what they're interested in.
[01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:40.740]   Right.
[01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:42.220]   It is truly when you dig down into it.
[01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:44.780]   It's it's just terrible.
[01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:49.060]   So look, I'm not I truly don't have a strong opinion one way or the other.
[01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:54.860]   I just think at some point we're going to have to reckon with a tech industry that is
[01:08:54.860 --> 01:09:00.300]   built in a way that about three or four companies can really succeed and everyone else is fighting
[01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:01.300]   for their life.
[01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:02.300]   Yeah.
[01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:03.300]   It seems to me this is having.
[01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:04.300]   It's the American way.
[01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:09.500]   Do you think you think you think Bing should pay you for a link to the register?
[01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:12.940]   Being a kind of, you know, it's kind of like really one of them.
[01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:13.940]   They're doing the same thing.
[01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:15.340]   They're just not doing it as well.
[01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:16.340]   Yeah.
[01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:17.340]   They're not doing it as well.
[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:19.220]   But I mean, search engine.
[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:20.220]   We need search engines.
[01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:21.220]   Right.
[01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:22.780]   Of the internet is pretty much unusable.
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:27.020]   Well, I've got to say Google is pretty much unusable over the last.
[01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:30.020]   I say I agree that Google was becoming worse and we're searching.
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:33.020]   I mean, that's why I only use Bing or duck duck.
[01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:34.020]   Let's say you use that.
[01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:35.020]   I'm not even talking about that.
[01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:36.020]   Yeah.
[01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:37.020]   I like Bing.
[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:38.020]   I don't know if Bing is.
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:39.020]   I don't know.
[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:40.020]   Let's see.
[01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:44.260]   I just like dividing my information among different giants.
[01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:49.660]   I like the AI part of Bing is really, really impressive.
[01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:50.660]   I really enjoy it.
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:51.660]   Same with the knowledge.
[01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:52.660]   Well, this is funny.
[01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:53.660]   I mean, that's funny.
[01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:57.940]   Because Bing is actually taking your article and putting it under Bing.com/news.
[01:09:57.940 --> 01:10:00.300]   I presume they pay you for that or no.
[01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:01.980]   It used to me if they do.
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:02.980]   Yeah.
[01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:03.980]   Okay.
[01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:04.980]   The analytics report contends Google's true.
[01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:07.460]   If they give their snippet, it has a lot more information.
[01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:08.460]   Yeah.
[01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:14.860]   I mean, I guess we could sue Microsoft, but that tends to have a fact that you're half-life
[01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:17.540]   companies to buy for Bing.
[01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:21.020]   Well, I'm sure Google is an equal amount of clout.
[01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:23.620]   I am such engine that goes Bing.
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:24.620]   Yeah.
[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:26.980]   I feel like everybody likes to disbing.
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:28.980]   I mean, he has grown into a pretty--
[01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:29.980]   It's not bad.
[01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:30.980]   It's not a rounding error.
[01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:31.980]   I'll say that.
[01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:32.980]   Yeah.
[01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:35.420]   Well, I'm saying as far as being a profitable company.
[01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:39.500]   I mean, I've got 190,000 Bing points.
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:40.500]   Oh, good for you.
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:41.500]   I didn't know anyone would have used the--
[01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:42.500]   Do you have to get that thing?
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:43.500]   I'd be in T-shirt.
[01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:44.020]   It's a--
[01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:48.340]   No, I think I can get like a $5 gift certificate to Olive Garden.
[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:51.780]   The breadsticks are not free though for people using the certificates just so you know.
[01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:52.780]   That's true.
[01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:53.780]   That's true.
[01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:56.220]   I tried in Olive Garden once, never again.
[01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:57.220]   That and white cars--
[01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:58.220]   It's not that bad.
[01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:00.580]   No, Olive Garden, Taco Bell and white cars.
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:01.580]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:04.100]   We've got a reservation tonight for the Olive Garden.
[01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:05.100]   I thought we--
[01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:08.980]   I may have taken an Olive Garden sign back to Rome.
[01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:09.980]   What?
[01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:13.620]   And I put it in the cafe on the ground floor from poverty.
[01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:17.780]   And I had no idea what it was, but I was waiting for tourists to go by and go--
[01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:18.780]   Tourists would go by.
[01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:19.780]   What?
[01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:21.260]   Is it Olive Garden in Rome?
[01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:22.860]   Wow, that's so great.
[01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:25.220]   Hey, when you eat there, you're family.
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:34.940]   I do love though in Vienna when McDonald's opened their first McDonald's in the old town.
[01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:39.420]   For the one and only time ever, they had to avoid-- they had to stop the double arches
[01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:45.620]   because they put it on a main tourist street where the buildings are so locked down in
[01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:46.620]   design.
[01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:50.060]   There's just a tiny little McDonald's in one corner.
[01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:53.820]   The McDonald's in Rome-- there's quite a few in Rome, but the one near the Spanish
[01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:56.380]   steps is actually pretty cool.
[01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:57.380]   It's really nice.
[01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:58.380]   Really?
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:02.300]   Yes, because they had to make it fit in to the local architecture.
[01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:04.140]   The local architecture on all that.
[01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:05.140]   Little pig?
[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:06.140]   Let's see.
[01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:08.140]   The piazza, the spania.
[01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:11.540]   They sell beer at McDonald's in Italy.
[01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:12.540]   Yeah, they do.
[01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:14.540]   They sell beer at everywhere in Italy.
[01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:16.340]   Kind of looks like a McDonald's.
[01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:18.620]   It still looks like a McDonald's, doesn't it?
[01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:19.620]   Yeah.
[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:21.020]   I like the outdoor seating, though.
[01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:22.020]   That's kind of nice.
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:24.940]   The nuggets are actually better in Italy than they are in United States.
[01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:25.940]   Are they?
[01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:26.940]   I don't know what it is.
[01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:28.860]   Who would go to Italy and have a McCafe?
[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:31.980]   No, the coffee in McDonald's is terrible.
[01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:34.260]   - It is even here, it's terrible,
[01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:36.420]   but especially in Rome, don't do it.
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:38.940]   - Just write do dominoes actually try
[01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:41.020]   and set up franchises in Italy.
[01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:41.860]   - They do?
[01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:42.700]   - Oh god.
[01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:43.860]   - Oh no!
[01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:45.900]   - There's hubris for you coming in.
[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:49.480]   - In Termini Station, there is a pizza making robot.
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:51.340]   It makes horrible, horrible pizza.
[01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:53.060]   The only reason why people use it
[01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:55.680]   is 'cause they like to see it work, that's it.
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:57.040]   - Go micro this.
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:00.180]   - Yeah, we were talking about earlier,
[01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:03.500]   the Tazodoro, which is one of the oldest coffee shops
[01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:06.700]   in the world, kind of the home of espresso's in Rome.
[01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:09.140]   And the story is that Howard Schultz,
[01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:11.540]   the CEO of Starbucks, had a coffee there and said,
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:15.220]   you know what we need in America is we need coffee shops,
[01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:18.420]   but Rome has to this day famously forbid Starbucks
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:20.900]   from opening a store in Rome.
[01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:22.300]   - There is one in Milan.
[01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:24.820]   - No, there's one in Milan, there's one in Rome.
[01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:25.660]   - What?
[01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:26.500]   - It's at Termini Station.
[01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:28.380]   - Oh, it's at the train station.
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:29.220]   I don't know if that counts.
[01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:32.020]   - I'm still amazed at the first McDonald's
[01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:33.940]   Pathfinder salesman who wasn't shot in the minute,
[01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:35.540]   he sat foot in front of it.
[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:40.340]   Just like in Portugal, the McDonald's have
[01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:42.100]   Hamoni Barrico in the--
[01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:43.820]   - Yes, that sandwiches him.
[01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:44.660]   - Really?
[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:46.220]   - In the hamburger.
[01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:48.780]   - I had to fly through Spain a couple of weeks ago
[01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:52.060]   and they have Hamoni Barrico in the vending machines
[01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:55.140]   in the airport, I'm thinking, that's a bit much.
[01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:57.180]   - Yeah, listen, when you do something that good,
[01:13:57.180 --> 01:13:58.940]   you really want to spread it around.
[01:13:58.940 --> 01:14:00.060]   - Oh, it's--
[01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:02.580]   - I won, all three of you just do a travel show.
[01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:03.900]   (laughing)
[01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:05.500]   - In search of the perfect--
[01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:06.500]   - In the perfect--
[01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:07.980]   - It's fair, Padra gets--
[01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:09.580]   - Come on, I get Britain, it's like,
[01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:12.180]   ah, here's fish and chips, here's bangers and lags.
[01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:13.020]   - You know, it's like--
[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:16.420]   - When they have Hamoni Barrico at the Vatican market,
[01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:18.620]   it is ridiculously inexpensive.
[01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:20.780]   It's cheaper than McDonald's.
[01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:22.580]   - Why is the CBO?
[01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:23.780]   I don't know what that is.
[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:26.580]   - I remember going to Venice and the place of--
[01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:27.420]   - McPlant.
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:29.620]   - It's a wine there, which is ridiculously low.
[01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:30.460]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:32.660]   - If you bought your own bottle for Philip, you could,
[01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:34.060]   you know--
[01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:36.700]   - So the Vatican market, there's no tax,
[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:40.100]   and they get, so for example, if you buy,
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:41.340]   there was a really nice bottle of wine
[01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:42.660]   that someone wanted me to get.
[01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:45.940]   It was gonna be like 350 euros at the specialty market.
[01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:48.700]   I went to the Vatican market, it was 12 euro.
[01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:51.420]   I have no idea how that works, but--
[01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:53.100]   - You don't have to pay any duty crossing the board
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:55.060]   or anything like that, right, okay,
[01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:56.060]   Rome it is then.
[01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:58.620]   - How do they not have huge, I mean, particularly initially,
[01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:00.140]   how do they not have huge market tools
[01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:01.780]   stacked with cigarettes that go--
[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:05.700]   - They used to, so the market used to sell cigarettes,
[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:09.260]   and oddly enough, a place with a thousand people,
[01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:12.060]   population was buying enough cigarettes for like 100,000.
[01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:13.740]   (laughing)
[01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:15.860]   And Pope Francis was the one who came in and he says,
[01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:18.620]   look, we all know what's happening here, it has to stop.
[01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:19.460]   - Wow.
[01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:20.660]   - First, it's a vice, secondly,
[01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:22.820]   we're essentially supporting money laundering.
[01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:24.140]   - Oh, wow.
[01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:25.740]   - He killed it.
[01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:27.780]   - It is the kind of behavior that Jesus would have bitten
[01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:29.140]   beaten people out of the jungle with--
[01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:29.980]   - It is true, it is true.
[01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:32.020]   - It's one of the things though that Lisa doesn't like
[01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:35.180]   about Rome is the widespread smoke in one's house.
[01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:37.220]   They don't smoke inside, but they're all standing right
[01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:38.700]   at the outside, outside the door.
[01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:39.860]   - That's gross.
[01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:42.220]   - Google accused of ripping off advertisers
[01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:46.180]   as a register with video ads, no one sees.
[01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:52.060]   So this is a special Google thing called TrueView.
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:55.500]   - Basically, you farm these ads out to third party sites,
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:58.660]   and they're listed as being viewed and viewable.
[01:15:58.660 --> 01:15:59.700]   - But they're hidden.
[01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:01.660]   - It appears so in some cases,
[01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:06.220]   and Google wasn't too keen to make much of a fuss about this,
[01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:08.180]   but now other people are.
[01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:11.660]   - Some folks who've bought those TrueView ads
[01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:15.460]   want their money back for that.
[01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:19.180]   Normally in a skippable ad, you don't have to pay.
[01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:21.580]   If somebody skips the ad, you don't have to pay.
[01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:24.060]   The problem is, if somebody can skip the ad,
[01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:25.060]   they can't see it.
[01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:28.180]   So these ads are playing through in the background.
[01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:30.020]   - In the background, the demand of fraud
[01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:31.940]   in the ad industry is a worthy massive--
[01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:32.780]   - Oh, it's terrible.
[01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:34.740]   - I mean, Facebook beat Google to that.
[01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:35.580]   - Yeah.
[01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:37.540]   - They were playing multiple ads at the same time
[01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:40.540]   that you couldn't see, but counted a video as seen
[01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:43.220]   exactly for three seconds.
[01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:47.260]   - Google disputes this, and you have this in your article,
[01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:51.220]   saying they got it wrong, and 90% of the ads
[01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:54.060]   on these sites are visible to people across the web.
[01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:58.660]   Google has strict enforced policies for third party partners,
[01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:00.580]   and they support third party verification
[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:03.620]   from other companies like Moten, Double Verify.
[01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:06.620]   - To be fair to Google, they're a good percentage
[01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:08.260]   of this is probably--
[01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:09.100]   - Not their fault.
[01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:10.820]   - If extensions that are running on web browsers
[01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:13.980]   to block pop-ups and block videos and auto plays.
[01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:16.420]   - Well, get ready because YouTube--
[01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:18.420]   (laughing)
[01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:19.420]   - That's my segue.
[01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:24.020]   - Has decided that they want to start blocking ad blockers
[01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:26.660]   and they are testing right now,
[01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:29.100]   a number of people posted this on Reddit.
[01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:31.820]   Ad blocker users, they're saying,
[01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:34.260]   "You can only watch three videos and then it's out."
[01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:35.740]   - Good.
[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:37.620]   I know it's a unpopular opinion,
[01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:39.980]   but I think you've got to support the media.
[01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:40.820]   - I completely agree.
[01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:41.660]   I'm okay with this.
[01:17:41.660 --> 01:17:44.500]   - I have people who are hugely upset
[01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:47.420]   because Google is trying to block ad blockers,
[01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:48.660]   but they want Google for free.
[01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:49.500]   - 100%.
[01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:53.140]   - You're basically stealing YouTube, right?
[01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:55.900]   - There was a sign also that Google being smart about this
[01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:57.700]   because they didn't say, "Well, okay,
[01:17:57.700 --> 01:17:59.460]   "you should therefore subscribe to Premium."
[01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:01.540]   They said, "You should subscribe to YouTube Premium
[01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:03.420]   "so that some of the funds that you send in
[01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:04.580]   "will actually go to the ad."
[01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:07.180]   But that's a much, much more compelling argument.
[01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:08.180]   - It says, "Thank you for that."
[01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:10.580]   - You should go ad free with YouTube Premium
[01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:13.580]   and creators can still get paid from your subscription.
[01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:15.540]   - No, they do not get paid that much.
[01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:16.380]   - No.
[01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:17.220]   - Well, they get paid enough.
[01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:19.700]   MrBeast makes $40 million a year on YouTube.
[01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:21.540]   - Yeah, that's the aside deals.
[01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:23.620]   I mean, I was looking at the, I have a friend of mine
[01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:27.060]   that was sharing with me the analytics that he gets.
[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:29.580]   And you can have a video with a million views
[01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:32.420]   and get paid less than $2,000 for it.
[01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:33.780]   So it's--
[01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:35.820]   - I do, I run, I pay for YouTube Premium.
[01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:36.660]   - I do too.
[01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:37.900]   - I turned off YouTube Music once
[01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:40.340]   and my family came screaming to me saying,
[01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:42.540]   "What have you done?"
[01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:45.940]   And it wasn't the music, it was the videos.
[01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:48.340]   YouTube, I think, is almost unwatchable
[01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:51.380]   without either an ad blocker or premium.
[01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:52.940]   - I watch it without either and--
[01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:53.780]   - You don't mind the ads?
[01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:54.620]   - Really?
[01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:55.460]   - No.
[01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:58.980]   - Honestly, if it's a site where I'm trying to support the site,
[01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:01.540]   like this, when I watch called Adventures of an old C-dog
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:03.180]   about a pension who's sailing around the world.
[01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:04.020]   - So you know that I will--
[01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:05.380]   - I will go into the old C-dog.
[01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:07.580]   - I will cheerfully sit through
[01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:09.940]   and do something else while the advert is playing.
[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:10.940]   (laughing)
[01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:12.940]   You know, and can not actually watch in the ad.
[01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:13.860]   - Yeah, of course not.
[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:14.700]   - Okay.
[01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:15.900]   - I completely disagree.
[01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:19.540]   I think YouTube, like, look, my money I spend every month
[01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:22.620]   on Hulu, maybe that's a good deal, maybe it's not.
[01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:24.620]   But then YouTube-- - YouTube, the death way.
[01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:26.900]   - That is the highest value I get for any subscribers.
[01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:28.220]   - I just wish.
[01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:31.940]   Because if it's a content maker that I enjoy,
[01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:33.220]   I will sit through the ads.
[01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:34.060]   - Sure.
[01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:34.900]   - Yeah.
[01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:35.740]   - 100%.
[01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:37.820]   I wish there was a way to set up YouTube
[01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:40.060]   so that it would front load them.
[01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:43.220]   I would prefer that you give me six ads in a row.
[01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:44.060]   - And then let me watch the video.
[01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:44.900]   - And then let me watch the video.
[01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:45.740]   - Yeah.
[01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:46.580]   - I think rather than taking a break every three years.
[01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:47.420]   - Yes.
[01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:48.500]   - Now that is really annoying.
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:49.340]   - Yeah.
[01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:50.820]   - But that's why YouTube premium is worth it.
[01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:54.540]   So much information is in YouTube nowadays.
[01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:56.420]   It is truly the public commons.
[01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:57.260]   - I totally agree.
[01:19:57.260 --> 01:20:01.380]   - Everything from working on a Porsche restoration project
[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:03.860]   and trying to find some rare documentation.
[01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:05.180]   YouTube video, right?
[01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:08.460]   If you're studying for this show, YouTube video.
[01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:11.780]   Political coverage, YouTube video, rare music.
[01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:12.620]   YouTube.
[01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:13.460]   - You know what?
[01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:14.300]   - Yeah.
[01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:16.340]   - The pronunciation of companies that get cute
[01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:17.180]   with the spelling of the game.
[01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:18.020]   - Oh yeah, we do that all the time.
[01:20:18.020 --> 01:20:19.900]   - No, I have to go watch their video
[01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:20.740]   just to find out the same.
[01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:21.740]   - How do you pronounce your name?
[01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:22.580]   - Yeah.
[01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:24.580]   - But we're in a similar position
[01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:26.660]   where we offer a free product
[01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:29.060]   if you're willing to put up with ads.
[01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:30.500]   And for seven bucks a month,
[01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:32.300]   you don't have to have the ads in our clubs.
[01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:33.140]   - No.
[01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:36.900]   - Honestly, that's the only tenable way to survive.
[01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:37.740]   - Sure.
[01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:39.060]   - I'm always amazed by people who say,
[01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:41.940]   "Well, I don't want ads and I don't want to pay.
[01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:43.380]   I just want it for free."
[01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:44.780]   - But I'm a loyal fan.
[01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:46.180]   - I'm a loyal fan and I love you.
[01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:47.020]   - Oh, God.
[01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:49.620]   - I'm talking about, but just in general,
[01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:51.020]   that's why the internet doesn't work.
[01:20:51.020 --> 01:20:53.380]   That's why Rami's doing what it's doing
[01:20:53.380 --> 01:20:55.860]   is because people want free, free, free without ads.
[01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:59.180]   - After number of emails, I will get from dislike.
[01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:01.340]   I come to your site and I pay your wages.
[01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:02.500]   You should write this.
[01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:03.820]   And it was just like, "Really?
[01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:05.100]   You'll pay my wages." - I'm sorry about that,
[01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:05.940]   by the way.
[01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:08.300]   (laughing)
[01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:10.380]   - I knew the writing style was similar.
[01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:11.380]   - It was Frank.
[01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:13.140]   Frank was really the one who was serious.
[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:14.860]   - He doesn't know in caps.
[01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:15.940]   That's how you know, right?
[01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:16.980]   - That's the idea.
[01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:19.340]   - Okay, but just to be devil's advocate on this,
[01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:21.660]   you know, so look, I am on record.
[01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:24.860]   I think Jack Dorsey took a left turn somewhere.
[01:21:24.860 --> 01:21:25.780]   (laughing)
[01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:28.060]   Not maybe at the best of his thinking right now,
[01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:30.260]   but a lot of the stuff he's working on
[01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:33.060]   with some of his alternate things,
[01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:37.340]   it is this web 3.0 vision or whatever they're calling it,
[01:21:37.340 --> 01:21:40.780]   where it is microtransactions, Bitcoin,
[01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:43.660]   like thinking about paying as you go for content
[01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:45.700]   with these ultra microtransactions.
[01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:48.220]   So I don't believe-- - As it cryptobin poisoned
[01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:50.780]   at this point though. - Look, I'm not a crypto advocate,
[01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:54.700]   but I'm saying this is someone's thinking about that problem.
[01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:57.940]   Do you think there's any validity there in a model like that?
[01:21:57.940 --> 01:22:01.220]   Like I know intuitively it's wrong.
[01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:02.460]   - But we gotta do something, right?
[01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:04.860]   Because we want Reddit, we want Twitter,
[01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:06.300]   we want YouTube.
[01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:08.380]   Apparently people aren't satisfied
[01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:10.340]   with either watching ads or paying for it.
[01:22:10.340 --> 01:22:11.500]   So maybe there's some--
[01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:13.580]   - Do you know the weird thing I've noticed though
[01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:16.620]   in the last year is that micro payments are working
[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:19.660]   for a certain kind of, I want to use the, well,
[01:22:19.660 --> 01:22:21.900]   S-H-I-T poster.
[01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:24.660]   Someone who will go round and broadcast themselves
[01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:26.740]   and sell to people and will get tips from people
[01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:27.820]   as they do it.
[01:22:27.820 --> 01:22:29.140]   That's working really. - Wait a minute,
[01:22:29.140 --> 01:22:29.980]   that's a job?
[01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:30.820]   - Yeah.
[01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:32.460]   (laughing)
[01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:33.980]   - I missed my calling.
[01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:36.020]   (laughing)
[01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:38.540]   - Well, you know, the really big ones are the really
[01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:40.380]   racist and homophobic ones.
[01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:41.940]   - And people pay them to do that?
[01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:44.900]   - They'll pay tips on a show.
[01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:45.740]   - Oh well.
[01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:46.580]   - What?
[01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:49.940]   - Honestly, that's why so many weird--
[01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:51.500]   - It's kind of like the only five of them
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:53.940]   all right when broadcasts exist.
[01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:55.860]   AM Radio discovered this.
[01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:57.980]   The only way to make any money in AM Radio,
[01:22:57.980 --> 01:22:59.380]   which is a failing medium,
[01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:02.300]   is to have extreme right-wing content on it,
[01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:03.500]   starting with Rush Limbaugh,
[01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:05.540]   and then it's gotten worse and worse and worse.
[01:23:05.540 --> 01:23:08.380]   And people are so devoted to that content
[01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:10.020]   they will stick around, they will--
[01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:12.060]   - Well, I mean, there was a lovely quote from
[01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:13.820]   Biographer of Rupert Murdoch, where he said,
[01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:15.620]   "If you could do Fox News, but for the left,
[01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:16.460]   "would you do it?"
[01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:18.500]   And he goes, "If we could, but we can't."
[01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:21.100]   - There's cheap skates on the left, that's the problem.
[01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:24.540]   - So wait, hold on, you get paid for extremist posts,
[01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:26.740]   extremist tweets, you're telling me that
[01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:29.260]   I could get paid for the nine out of 10 tweets
[01:23:29.260 --> 01:23:30.940]   that I don't send because I look at it.
[01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:31.780]   (laughing)
[01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:32.620]   No, that's too much.
[01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:33.460]   - That's the money you're leaving on the table.
[01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:34.660]   - The problem is the money you're getting
[01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:35.580]   is from extremists.
[01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:36.500]   - I don't leave for that.
[01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:37.340]   - Yeah.
[01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:39.300]   - Well, I mean, I'll take their money.
[01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:41.620]   - I'm a Jesuit, I could figure out
[01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:43.020]   some sort of justification.
[01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:45.180]   - Life from the Vaskin, now we have swearing.
[01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:46.340]   - There's tourists, they're pudgering.
[01:23:46.340 --> 01:23:48.220]   - They're spiritual laundering as well.
[01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:49.060]   You know, I can--
[01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:50.620]   - Oh, it's a long history of that.
[01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:51.940]   - There's a long history of that.
[01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:54.020]   - So what about this as a revenue model?
[01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:57.620]   So, as I've been really, really researching for my job,
[01:23:57.620 --> 01:24:00.860]   you know, kick and twitch and rumble and all these platforms,
[01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:02.660]   one way they support their shows,
[01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:05.260]   this is really interesting to me.
[01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:06.660]   There's a major show--
[01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:07.500]   - Can I have a gambling?
[01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:08.820]   - Not, not gambling.
[01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:10.660]   - This is actually ethical, I think.
[01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:11.500]   - Okay.
[01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:14.740]   - So super chats are a non-trivial part
[01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:17.140]   of a lot of these large streamers.
[01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:20.940]   Revenue, so the way it works is you have a fan out there
[01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:22.660]   that's watching your show live,
[01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:25.860]   and they really, really, really wanna have their say on it.
[01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:30.580]   So they will spend, you know, $100, $200, $500
[01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:34.340]   to have you read a message from them in the middle of your show,
[01:24:34.340 --> 01:24:36.740]   and then it's pinned to the top of your live chat
[01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:37.860]   as you're going.
[01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:39.860]   - I think this is an interesting model
[01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:42.380]   because it's audience participation, you know,
[01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:43.700]   they have skin in the game.
[01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:46.820]   - I kinda don't like, well, I mean, I guess that's what we're doing
[01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:47.660]   with Club Twitter.
[01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:50.820]   I kinda don't like something that,
[01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:54.660]   I feel like everybody who consumes the content
[01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:55.900]   should support the content.
[01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:56.740]   - Sure.
[01:24:56.740 --> 01:24:58.100]   - And I'm not sure I like a system that says
[01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:00.620]   only the most extremist, you know,
[01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:02.620]   people who are so devoted, super fans,
[01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:04.940]   they have to pay for it, but I guess they're willing to.
[01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:05.780]   - Yeah.
[01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:06.620]   - So that's the advantage of it.
[01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:08.180]   - It tends to be thoughtful comments.
[01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:10.340]   - I mean, I would say that's what Club Twitter is,
[01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:11.820]   is for super fans, right?
[01:25:11.820 --> 01:25:13.820]   If you're a super fan.
[01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:15.460]   That's an interesting, yeah.
[01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:17.860]   - I've got to say also that it doesn't quite work as well
[01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:19.820]   with the Twitter verified tick,
[01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:22.820]   where it's just like, yeah, I'm gonna pay for that,
[01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:23.860]   that's gonna get promoted,
[01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:27.300]   and the quality of content has gone down drastically.
[01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:29.100]   But with something like Club Twitter,
[01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:31.020]   people care, they wanna pay, fair enough.
[01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:32.060]   - Yeah, sure.
[01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:33.260]   I guess there's nothing wrong with that.
[01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:34.700]   I mean, 'cause most, to be honest,
[01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:36.660]   we only 1% of our audience pays,
[01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:38.980]   99% get to benefit.
[01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:40.580]   - Well, let's see, we still have those ads,
[01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:42.620]   so that's, there's revenue in that.
[01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:44.940]   And speaking of which, let's take a break.
[01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:47.140]   I gotta do an ad.
[01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:49.700]   I'm never gonna get this in an hour and a half,
[01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:51.660]   we only have seven minutes left.
[01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:52.820]   Never gonna happen.
[01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:54.140]   You guys are too good.
[01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:58.540]   Your silver tongue devils in Thompson is here
[01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:00.700]   from the register.com.
[01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:05.620]   I'm Brianna Wu from the RebellionPak.com.
[01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:08.620]   I just was on the rise of the Rebellion ride at Disneyland.
[01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:09.980]   - Oh, it's so good.
[01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:11.860]   - It's the best ride it is to be performed.
[01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:13.380]   - And I thought the RebellionPak,
[01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:14.700]   the whole time, I don't know why.
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:16.260]   - We call sponsor them.
[01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:19.620]   - And from the Vatican,
[01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:20.980]   where there are some excellent rides,
[01:26:20.980 --> 01:26:23.100]   I might add Father Robert Ballis there.
[01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:25.180]   - Leo, are you driving in an Audi right now?
[01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:26.260]   - No, why?
[01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:27.100]   (laughs)
[01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:29.260]   Stop it, unlock, stop it.
[01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:30.420]   - Okay, just checking.
[01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:32.420]   (laughs)

[01:29:43.300 --> 01:29:47.100]   All right, you all got to go to get refreshments.
[01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:48.380]   I am stuck here.
[01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:50.380]   I got to meet your dog.
[01:29:50.380 --> 01:29:52.780]   Lily, it's a Birxdog.
[01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:55.780]   Actually, I owe Birx a big debt of gratitude,
[01:29:55.780 --> 01:29:58.700]   because we can do the story now.
[01:29:58.700 --> 01:30:03.340]   I got a call a few months ago
[01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:06.260]   from a guy I had worked with on MSNBC's The Site.
[01:30:06.260 --> 01:30:08.300]   He was an NBC Vice President.
[01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:11.100]   He produced, executive produced The Site.
[01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:13.980]   He actually was a legend in broadcasting.
[01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:19.300]   He produced Don Imus' TV show, Don famously used to call him
[01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:21.300]   "Most But Mormon."
[01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:23.380]   He was--
[01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:24.380]   An affectionately.
[01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:25.940]   An affectionately.
[01:30:25.940 --> 01:30:28.700]   He was an original staffer on Nightline,
[01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:31.460]   became executive producer at ABC,
[01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:36.460]   created world news now, which the Giz is a regular on.
[01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:40.500]   Probably you would know his work best at CNN.
[01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:44.900]   Do you remember the holographic correspondent
[01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:46.620]   on election night?
[01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:47.900]   He invented that.
[01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:49.860]   He was a very technical guy.
[01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:52.460]   He was a very, very smart fellow.
[01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:55.340]   He did News Night with Aaron Brown.
[01:30:55.340 --> 01:30:57.900]   He worked for Vice President Gore.
[01:30:57.900 --> 01:31:01.660]   He actually ran Gore's current TV.
[01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:05.580]   When he was at current TV, he created The Young Turks,
[01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:07.100]   which you might have heard of.
[01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:08.220]   I work with Cenk.
[01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:09.060]   Yeah.
[01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:10.260]   As a serial entrepreneur.
[01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:11.820]   Yeah.
[01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:15.580]   He had been working as a consultant for many years.
[01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:17.540]   He lived up a little ways in Hillsborough.
[01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:19.860]   I knew him because I worked with him at the site.
[01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:20.860]   He'd helped develop the site.
[01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:22.700]   I've told many stories about him.
[01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:24.180]   He was a really great guy.
[01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:26.100]   He called me a couple of months ago and said,
[01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:27.780]   "We're moving out of this beautiful house
[01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:30.260]   "in the wine country down to Palo Alto.
[01:31:30.260 --> 01:31:32.020]   "And I am getting rid of memorabilia.
[01:31:32.020 --> 01:31:36.460]   "And I have the original sign from The Site,"
[01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:41.300]   which was a show we did on MSNBC from 1994 to '96.
[01:31:41.300 --> 01:31:42.900]   Now what the hell is that?
[01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:45.580]   It was hanging up, but it had been broken.
[01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:46.940]   The lights didn't work anymore.
[01:31:46.940 --> 01:31:48.580]   It had kind of fallen apart.
[01:31:48.580 --> 01:31:49.500]   He said, "Do you want it?"
[01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:51.020]   He said, "When you're done with it,
[01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:53.060]   "I've promised it to the Computer History Museum.
[01:31:53.060 --> 01:31:54.260]   "They want to put it there."
[01:31:54.260 --> 01:31:55.660]   So this was a show for this.
[01:31:55.660 --> 01:31:58.500]   When MSNBC launched, it was a joint venture of NBC
[01:31:58.500 --> 01:31:59.740]   and Microsoft.
[01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:01.060]   They came to Ziff Davis and said,
[01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:03.340]   "We need a technology show for it to be."
[01:32:03.340 --> 01:32:06.980]   So I went out to 30 Rock and presented along with a bunch
[01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:09.820]   of other Ziff Davis people, a show that we wanted to do.
[01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:12.220]   I wrote the long 95 page treatment.
[01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:14.380]   And it got the site on the air.
[01:32:14.380 --> 01:32:15.660]   And I was there for the launching.
[01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:18.980]   I was, that's where I got Miami for the virtual character.
[01:32:18.980 --> 01:32:22.260]   I played Dev Noll with Soledetta Brian was the anchor.
[01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:25.220]   So I said, "Yes, we'll come up.
[01:32:25.220 --> 01:32:28.300]   "Jerry Waggley, who was our Chief Operations Officer,
[01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:30.460]   "had just got his Ford pickup,
[01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:32.660]   "his new electric Ford pickup, the Lightning."
[01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:36.500]   And so we drove up, we got it, brought it down here.
[01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:38.540]   And I gave it to Burke, saying,
[01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:40.660]   "I said, 'Birk, can you get this thing working?
[01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:41.620]   "It's not in great shape.
[01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:42.580]   "You open it up."
[01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:45.300]   It was custom made for the site.
[01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:48.780]   NBC probably spent $20,000 on this thing.
[01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:51.700]   Borman told me, he said, "We did the pilot
[01:32:51.700 --> 01:32:55.140]   "and Andy Lacks the head of NBC News,
[01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:57.140]   "call up and said, 'You need a sign.'
[01:32:57.140 --> 01:33:01.620]   "That thing, get a sign made for the show."
[01:33:01.620 --> 01:33:02.820]   So that was basically-
[01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:03.740]   - I was looking behind you at the moment.
[01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:05.140]   - Cart Blanche.
[01:33:05.140 --> 01:33:06.340]   Yeah, we have a big gear.
[01:33:06.340 --> 01:33:07.420]   We have a sign.
[01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:09.180]   See, Cart Blanche does do whatever he wants.
[01:33:09.180 --> 01:33:13.900]   So he built this sign, it was custom made fluorescent lighting
[01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:16.740]   all the way around, 'cause fluorescent was all we had in those days.
[01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:17.940]   When we got at the fluorescent bulbs-
[01:33:17.940 --> 01:33:19.140]   - Very mama voice.
[01:33:19.140 --> 01:33:20.740]   - Yeah, Burke took it apart.
[01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:24.180]   He has been spending many hours fixing this
[01:33:24.180 --> 01:33:28.300]   because sad to say, David Borman passed away
[01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:31.020]   at the age of 69 last Sunday.
[01:33:31.020 --> 01:33:33.340]   And yeah, it was very young.
[01:33:33.340 --> 01:33:36.700]   He was a really talented producer, a smart guy.
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:38.780]   I really enjoyed knowing him.
[01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:40.100]   And I'm very grateful.
[01:33:40.100 --> 01:33:42.980]   So Burke, I said Burke, I'd love to talk about David
[01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:44.340]   on Twitter this Sunday.
[01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:45.980]   Can you get the sign working?
[01:33:45.980 --> 01:33:48.540]   And John, you said he was up 'til midnight,
[01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:51.500]   every night for the last three nights.
[01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:52.740]   - I'm now at Shulens.
[01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:53.780]   - And there's the site sign.
[01:33:53.780 --> 01:33:54.620]   We haven't hung it.
[01:33:54.620 --> 01:33:58.260]   He said, I get it working, but hanging it is very heavy.
[01:33:58.260 --> 01:33:59.420]   And we wanna make sure it's safe.
[01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:00.900]   It doesn't fall on the inside.
[01:34:00.900 --> 01:34:02.220]   So-
[01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:03.820]   - I'm very thankful about that.
[01:34:03.820 --> 01:34:04.660]   Thank you.
[01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:06.420]   - So it's not yet hung, we will hang it.
[01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:08.300]   - What's the frame is made out of aluminum?
[01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:10.180]   - Yeah, go ahead and touch it.
[01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:11.900]   - I think you'll find that's aluminum.
[01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:13.220]   - Oh!
[01:34:13.220 --> 01:34:14.820]   - You just gave an open idea.
[01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:15.820]   - Oh!
[01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:18.260]   - It's, I don't know if it's aluminum or aluminum
[01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:19.100]   or the lead.
[01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:19.940]   - It's so nice.
[01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:20.780]   - I think it does look like it.
[01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:21.620]   - It's so nice.
[01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:22.780]   - It's several hundred pounds.
[01:34:22.780 --> 01:34:24.940]   - This is what I'm trying to think about
[01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:26.660]   for iconography perspective.
[01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:29.220]   What is this supposed to be like Jetsons?
[01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:31.340]   - Yeah, it was the future, right?
[01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:34.380]   The pitch I had made to them,
[01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:37.700]   which was early for its time, this is '94,
[01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:41.740]   was that there would be a website called The Sight.
[01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:46.340]   And the TV show, which would be a nightly TV show,
[01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:49.140]   would be on the air on MSNBC, but all through the day,
[01:34:49.140 --> 01:34:52.540]   you'd be able to tune in via streaming to watch
[01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:55.180]   these people living together in this Victorian house.
[01:34:55.180 --> 01:34:56.020]   - Well, yeah, was this again?
[01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:57.100]   - '94.
[01:34:57.100 --> 01:34:59.260]   That's Jenny Cam level of-
[01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:00.740]   - Yeah, it was very early days.
[01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:02.820]   I don't know if Big Brother had launched yet or not,
[01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:04.180]   but I thought you'll know.
[01:35:04.180 --> 01:35:07.100]   - Big Brother launched in 1998 and there was later.
[01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:08.340]   - So this is Big Brother?
[01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:10.500]   - I actually thought about applying to that.
[01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:11.620]   My girlfriend at the time said,
[01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:14.060]   "I will leave you instantly now on that show."
[01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:15.420]   - Well, you might have applied to this
[01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:17.500]   'cause you would be living in this Victorian.
[01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:20.100]   And I said, "We could have cameras on everybody."
[01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:22.260]   People would tune in during the day to watch them
[01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:24.700]   creating the show and then turning it night to watch the show.
[01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:26.140]   It's a big long pitch.
[01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:27.820]   And of course they cut out all that stuff
[01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:28.700]   and just did the show.
[01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:31.740]   - You realize this is just the equivalent of a high-pouse?
[01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:34.340]   You invented the TikTok high-pouse,
[01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:35.740]   but back in the day.
[01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:37.380]   - Back in the day.
[01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:38.220]   So-
[01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:40.020]   - It's amazing how many people have copied it as well
[01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:43.180]   'cause Sky News in the UK came up with the idea
[01:35:43.180 --> 01:35:46.180]   of putting live webcams in the news office,
[01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:48.100]   news meeting office.
[01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:50.540]   And that lasted one session, I believe,
[01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:55.020]   because everyone had been warned so repeatedly not to swear,
[01:35:55.020 --> 01:35:57.740]   not to swear, not to swear that somebody just came out
[01:35:57.740 --> 01:35:58.740]   and swore and it was just-
[01:35:58.740 --> 01:35:59.740]   - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:01.420]   I just, it was on my mind.
[01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:02.260]   - I'm British.
[01:36:02.260 --> 01:36:03.100]   - I can't help it.
[01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:05.540]   - That's what I loved about my set at the Brickhouse
[01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:08.500]   because I had the producers roll behind me.
[01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:09.340]   - Right.
[01:36:09.340 --> 01:36:11.580]   - So during the show, you'd be see them doing their regular thing.
[01:36:11.580 --> 01:36:12.420]   - That was kind of-
[01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:13.260]   - Yeah, I'm not sure.
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:15.900]   - The site was also an open studio in that respect.
[01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:17.340]   Soledad was the anchor.
[01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:20.980]   Yeah, and you see, this is the logo, it was definitely-
[01:36:20.980 --> 01:36:21.900]   - Look at that.
[01:36:21.900 --> 01:36:26.100]   - I was called out at Christmas 1994 to pitch them,
[01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:27.860]   or maybe it was Christmas '95, yeah,
[01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:32.060]   'cause it launched in July '96 to launch this.
[01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:36.140]   And of course, MSNBC changed format to be full news,
[01:36:36.140 --> 01:36:39.040]   about 18 months in, so the show was canceled.
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:41.500]   But we have the sign.
[01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:43.100]   Burke has done an amazing job.
[01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:45.100]   He's put LEDs all around the rim,
[01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:48.100]   'cause those letters light up because of peripheral-
[01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:49.900]   - Oh, right, okay, okay.
[01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:50.900]   - The light come behind them.
[01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:52.300]   - Look at that, look at that.
[01:36:52.300 --> 01:36:54.220]   - No, so it really is a remarkable thing.
[01:36:54.220 --> 01:36:56.620]   So Burke, I just wanna say your reward,
[01:36:56.620 --> 01:36:58.780]   free snacks for the rest of your life.
[01:36:58.780 --> 01:37:01.580]   And I've got the first installment right here,
[01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:03.980]   over here, come on and get it, there you go.
[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:06.620]   - Don't take that pepper and patty, though, that's mine.
[01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:07.780]   - You can't have that, that's mine.
[01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:09.820]   - We do not have anything like this in Rome.
[01:37:09.820 --> 01:37:11.460]   - They don't have a snack ball for you.
[01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:12.780]   - You know what our snacks are?
[01:37:12.780 --> 01:37:14.020]   - Wafers. - Bread.
[01:37:14.020 --> 01:37:15.340]   - Yeah.
[01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:18.540]   - I can't eat the communion wafers, that's illegal.
[01:37:18.540 --> 01:37:21.380]   - But it's alien bread.
[01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:22.220]   - I'm gonna-
[01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:25.020]   - You know, it's a little junkie get hit, you know.
[01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:26.420]   Anyway, David, thank you.
[01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:29.620]   That was a huge contribution to us.
[01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:32.300]   - I'm really grateful that David remembers me so fondly.
[01:37:32.300 --> 01:37:35.740]   And I remember him and David, we will miss you.
[01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:37.180]   Great television talent.
[01:37:37.180 --> 01:37:40.820]   His dad was a TV anchor in Los Angeles, quite famous.
[01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:42.820]   And so he got the bug from his dad.
[01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:45.340]   His dad was also a hippie.
[01:37:45.340 --> 01:37:50.620]   There's some great stories there, someday we'll delve into them.
[01:37:50.620 --> 01:37:52.940]   - Do you think there's much of a, you know,
[01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:54.620]   there's a trend I've been noticing,
[01:37:54.620 --> 01:37:57.460]   especially as a lot of Twitch and TikTok and kick
[01:37:57.460 --> 01:37:59.820]   and all that gets to be higher and higher production values
[01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:02.700]   that they're doing a lot of, they're very few people
[01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:05.100]   they're building actual studios nowadays.
[01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:08.260]   Like there's a lot of green screen and compositing
[01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:09.460]   and stuff like that.
[01:38:09.460 --> 01:38:11.500]   Do you think we're ever gonna get back to a point
[01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:14.900]   where people are building these sophisticated sets?
[01:38:14.900 --> 01:38:16.220]   - That's a great question.
[01:38:16.220 --> 01:38:20.100]   When we built this, even then people were already doing that.
[01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:23.220]   We had a tricaster that could do virtual sets.
[01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:26.340]   And I'm a big believer, and partly because of people
[01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:28.820]   like David Borman, that there's something about
[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:31.820]   a physical presence and a physical real space.
[01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:34.340]   Where you can tell there's something behind them.
[01:38:34.340 --> 01:38:37.140]   In fact, in our old studio, there were windows behind us.
[01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:38.180]   You'd see cars go by.
[01:38:38.180 --> 01:38:40.420]   I remember when we first built the brick house,
[01:38:40.420 --> 01:38:43.380]   a listener, a viewer said, "I hate this.
[01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:46.540]   I just saw somebody walk by with a spoon going to lunch."
[01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:50.220]   And I said, "Yes, because we wanna make this a real place
[01:38:50.220 --> 01:38:52.140]   that has a sense of place."
[01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:53.980]   And I think that that adds value to it.
[01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:54.820]   You know what?
[01:38:54.820 --> 01:38:56.300]   It would be a lot cheaper.
[01:38:56.300 --> 01:38:59.220]   If we just did green screens and everybody was at home,
[01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:01.820]   and we didn't have to have a sense of place,
[01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:03.620]   it'd be a lot cheaper if we didn't do video at all,
[01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:04.460]   to be honest.
[01:39:04.460 --> 01:39:05.820]   And if I were starting to it today,
[01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:06.980]   maybe I'd consider those.
[01:39:06.980 --> 01:39:11.980]   'Cause frankly, our financial, our business model is not great.
[01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:15.540]   (laughing)
[01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:17.580]   We, it's cost us a couple million dollars a year,
[01:39:17.580 --> 01:39:21.100]   at least to run the studio and the staff and all that.
[01:39:21.100 --> 01:39:22.820]   And we could do it a lot cheaper.
[01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:24.220]   I love what we've done.
[01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:25.380]   And I loved the site.
[01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:27.980]   Same thing, I loved having that physical presence.
[01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:28.820]   - Yeah.
[01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:31.540]   - I get special being here, like the lights and everything.
[01:39:31.540 --> 01:39:32.940]   It's definitely a different experience.
[01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:35.820]   - And it gives the panelists a sense of energy.
[01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:36.660]   - Right.
[01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:38.540]   - So I'm a big believer in this, but it's very expensive.
[01:39:38.540 --> 01:39:40.700]   It's a, you know, it's an old school.
[01:39:40.700 --> 01:39:41.740]   - I've seen a lot of tricks.
[01:39:41.740 --> 01:39:44.660]   Like one of your competitors in this space
[01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:46.420]   had a really interesting video the other day
[01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:50.220]   about basically a black magic box that's built for,
[01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:51.660]   you know, basically chroma king,
[01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:54.460]   or people with the camera moving.
[01:39:54.460 --> 01:39:55.300]   - That was amazing.
[01:39:55.300 --> 01:39:56.140]   - That was really, really cool.
[01:39:56.140 --> 01:39:58.900]   - It's kind of like what they do with the Mandalorian
[01:39:58.900 --> 01:40:01.180]   and the Andor, which is in the volume.
[01:40:01.180 --> 01:40:03.780]   They have big screens and the perspectives moves
[01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:06.020]   as the camera moves and you can do.
[01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:07.420]   Look at the Mandalorian.
[01:40:07.420 --> 01:40:08.460]   Look at the Andor.
[01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:10.500]   That's a fraction of the cost that it costs
[01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:14.260]   to make the original Star Wars moves because of that.
[01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:15.580]   - And I think it's everybody's good.
[01:40:15.580 --> 01:40:16.980]   In fact, it's better for the actors
[01:40:16.980 --> 01:40:19.340]   'cause the actors aren't acting against a green screen.
[01:40:19.340 --> 01:40:21.860]   They're at least in a space that looks like their in mountains.
[01:40:21.860 --> 01:40:23.780]   - But even with that, there's already a backlash.
[01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:25.700]   You've got the hardcore fans who are saying,
[01:40:25.700 --> 01:40:29.100]   "I'm tired of that eggshell green screen thing
[01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:31.540]   that they use for Mandalorian and all the new Star Wars films."
[01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:34.700]   I'm like, well, okay, it's amazing, is it not?
[01:40:34.700 --> 01:40:36.780]   How quickly you get jaded.
[01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:40.940]   - Okay, but counterpoints, Picard season three.
[01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:44.180]   When they went and actually built all those sets
[01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:46.580]   and Enterprise D actually flew again.
[01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:49.780]   I had, I swear a tear just went down my face just like that.
[01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:51.700]   - I thought that was one of the big strengths of Firefly
[01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:53.780]   is that they actually had the full set
[01:40:53.780 --> 01:40:57.220]   and everyone could get in and get like slightly
[01:40:57.220 --> 01:40:59.500]   claustrophobic feeling which works.
[01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:01.380]   - I was talking to David Hewitt,
[01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:04.820]   who was Dr. Rodney McKay in the Stargate franchise.
[01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:09.540]   And he was saying that when they canceled Stargate universe,
[01:41:09.540 --> 01:41:11.020]   they were just gonna toss everything.
[01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:11.860]   - Wow.
[01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:12.700]   - They junked everything.
[01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:15.900]   So he called the guy, he knew him from his Stargate
[01:41:15.900 --> 01:41:18.860]   Atlantis days, he said, "I'll be there in like three hours.
[01:41:18.860 --> 01:41:20.340]   I'll just take what I can."
[01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:21.420]   And by the time he had gotten there,
[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:24.100]   they had thrown away like 90% of the money.
[01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:26.580]   So he was able to get a couple of set pieces,
[01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:28.820]   some of the special lights and the sconces.
[01:41:28.820 --> 01:41:30.260]   But he said, "Yeah, this is normal."
[01:41:30.260 --> 01:41:31.660]   And it's by purpose.
[01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:33.660]   It's not that it would cost a lot to store it.
[01:41:33.660 --> 01:41:36.860]   It's the producers don't want anyone making any more content
[01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:37.700]   with the stuff that they want.
[01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:38.540]   - Yeah.
[01:41:38.540 --> 01:41:39.380]   - No.
[01:41:39.380 --> 01:41:40.460]   - It's sad.
[01:41:40.460 --> 01:41:42.260]   - Well, it kind of reminds me that I was watching
[01:41:42.260 --> 01:41:44.460]   the imitation game on the flight back from New York
[01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:45.900]   and it was just kinda like,
[01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:47.700]   it's kinda like the end of Bletchley Park,
[01:41:47.700 --> 01:41:48.900]   where it's just like, right,
[01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:50.780]   we need to stop anyone knowing about this,
[01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:52.580]   therefore we're going to destroy it all.
[01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:54.060]   Even the reputations of the people
[01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:56.700]   like Tommy Flowers and Alan Turing that made it.
[01:41:56.700 --> 01:41:57.540]   So.
[01:41:57.540 --> 01:41:59.380]   - That's what made the Empire so evil
[01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:03.260]   that they wanted to shut down all the copies.
[01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:04.620]   - Oh, actually, no, it was the rebellion
[01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:06.980]   where they couldn't, they had to let those people go in
[01:42:06.980 --> 01:42:09.100]   to die because if they told them,
[01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:12.580]   they knew the guy who was embedded in the Empire would be.
[01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:13.420]   - Never mind.
[01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:14.700]   (laughs)
[01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:17.020]   - So made the rebellion so evil, you know?
[01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:19.180]   There's a really good, I didn't,
[01:42:19.180 --> 01:42:21.620]   this is Jeremy Norman's history of information.com.
[01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:22.460]   - Look at this.
[01:42:22.460 --> 01:42:24.060]   - A really good piece.
[01:42:24.060 --> 01:42:25.380]   Yeah, we do have the death of our place.
[01:42:25.380 --> 01:42:27.020]   - Many, many bathrooms die for that,
[01:42:27.020 --> 01:42:28.460]   that's like a disc.
[01:42:28.460 --> 01:42:30.100]   - I did love the Rogue One review.
[01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:31.500]   I think it was "Cenemosens of the Ditto"
[01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:34.220]   just like, if you're really into file formats,
[01:42:34.220 --> 01:42:36.740]   they take the plans, they put them on a video deck,
[01:42:36.740 --> 01:42:37.820]   they put them on another thing,
[01:42:37.820 --> 01:42:38.940]   they've broadcast them again,
[01:42:38.940 --> 01:42:39.940]   and then they put them on a set.
[01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:42.820]   - I saw that, I'm like, that's really good info sack.
[01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:44.020]   That's a good policy.
[01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:44.860]   - Yeah, I'm sure.
[01:42:44.860 --> 01:42:46.260]   - I honestly, I still think Rogue One
[01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:47.460]   is one of the top three stars,
[01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:48.940]   one of the most valuable times.
[01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:50.420]   - Look, the way that it worked,
[01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:51.700]   where it had half of them on one,
[01:42:51.700 --> 01:42:53.700]   that's just good page table, I guess.
[01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:55.220]   (laughing)
[01:42:55.220 --> 01:42:56.380]   - Hey, speaking of good old days,
[01:42:56.380 --> 01:42:58.540]   Ethernet, 50 years old this week.
[01:42:58.540 --> 01:42:59.380]   - Woo hoo!
[01:42:59.380 --> 01:43:00.860]   - Yeah, why'd it feel old, you know?
[01:43:00.860 --> 01:43:02.180]   - Wow.
[01:43:02.180 --> 01:43:05.140]   You know, there's an entire generation of younger geeks
[01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:09.500]   who don't remember a time when it was almost impossible
[01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:10.980]   to properly connect two computers,
[01:43:10.980 --> 01:43:13.220]   even if they were equipped with network hardware.
[01:43:13.220 --> 01:43:15.020]   - Yeah, we're so spoiled in general.
[01:43:15.020 --> 01:43:15.940]   - Very spoiled.
[01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:16.780]   - Yeah.
[01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:18.540]   - It's exceptionally spoiled.
[01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:19.380]   - Well, I mean, come on,
[01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:20.900]   you remember Independence Day when that--
[01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:21.740]   - That's the answer.
[01:43:21.740 --> 01:43:23.900]   - As it's the weekend, but it's the only thing
[01:43:23.900 --> 01:43:26.300]   that that Matt could connect to is the mothership.
[01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:28.460]   And you were like, I can't do that with a PC
[01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:29.820]   and that model. - Right, right.
[01:43:29.820 --> 01:43:32.100]   - Well, the big conference that I used to do,
[01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:35.260]   Interop, for years and years,
[01:43:35.260 --> 01:43:38.300]   it was based on a foundation of engineers,
[01:43:38.300 --> 01:43:39.580]   not the companies of the engineers,
[01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:41.380]   but the engineers, getting together
[01:43:41.380 --> 01:43:42.980]   at a cafe and Monterey,
[01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:44.460]   bringing their hardware and deciding,
[01:43:44.460 --> 01:43:46.860]   how do we make our boxes talk to one another one?
[01:43:46.860 --> 01:43:47.700]   - Right.
[01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:50.220]   - We just now assume that if you buy a switch from Cisco
[01:43:50.220 --> 01:43:51.740]   and a switch from Juniper,
[01:43:51.740 --> 01:43:53.740]   that they're gonna talk to each other, no problem.
[01:43:53.740 --> 01:43:56.980]   But back then, you actually had to write custom software.
[01:43:56.980 --> 01:44:00.180]   And it was that movement where that kind of led to,
[01:44:00.180 --> 01:44:01.860]   yeah, let's just do ethernet.
[01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:04.660]   - ethernet 50 years ago at the Xerox Park,
[01:44:04.660 --> 01:44:07.180]   the Palo Alto Research Center, Bob Metcalf.
[01:44:07.180 --> 01:44:08.580]   - Oh, look at this, that's the best word.
[01:44:08.580 --> 01:44:13.060]   - Author to Memo describing Xwire, a three megabit,
[01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:15.260]   by the way, three megabits in 1973
[01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:18.460]   was crazy, no one will ever need all that.
[01:44:18.460 --> 01:44:23.460]   Three megabit common bus office network system.
[01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:27.460]   - It's one of those great park inventions
[01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:29.620]   which we've all benefited from and zero
[01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:31.540]   single failed to do anything.
[01:44:31.540 --> 01:44:32.700]   - Yeah, no, yeah.
[01:44:32.700 --> 01:44:35.660]   - What is the Fweer now?
[01:44:35.660 --> 01:44:39.860]   I mean, if you have Cat 6, that's gigabit, thousand megabits,
[01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:41.340]   right? - Cat 6 can actually do 10 gig.
[01:44:41.340 --> 01:44:43.460]   - 10 gigabits.
[01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:44.620]   And is there anything fat?
[01:44:44.620 --> 01:44:47.300]   We have 10 gigabit connection here.
[01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:50.020]   - Anything above that, the typically do 100 gig,
[01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:53.380]   but there are copper like 20 gig and 40 gig.
[01:44:53.380 --> 01:44:54.220]   - Wow.
[01:44:54.220 --> 01:44:56.300]   - I think it's so frustrating that like,
[01:44:56.300 --> 01:44:57.980]   if you're shopping for house,
[01:44:57.980 --> 01:45:00.940]   there's so few houses have actually invested
[01:45:00.940 --> 01:45:02.300]   in like really good food.
[01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:03.620]   - We can buy our house.
[01:45:03.620 --> 01:45:04.900]   - I'm good.
[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:06.260]   I have one house in Boston.
[01:45:06.260 --> 01:45:07.420]   - We had a guy, yeah.
[01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:09.780]   - A couple of years, actually it was because of COVID
[01:45:09.780 --> 01:45:11.220]   and everybody was working from home
[01:45:11.220 --> 01:45:12.420]   and the kid was going to school from home.
[01:45:12.420 --> 01:45:14.860]   We had a guy crawl up in the attic and drop ethernet.
[01:45:14.860 --> 01:45:15.700]   - We did it, too.
[01:45:15.700 --> 01:45:16.860]   - We have ethernet at every desk.
[01:45:16.860 --> 01:45:17.700]   - Sure.
[01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:21.460]   - We have ubiquity and we have very high speed Wi-Fi gigabit.
[01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:22.700]   It's a nice setup.
[01:45:22.700 --> 01:45:25.140]   - It's just weird how few people,
[01:45:25.140 --> 01:45:28.100]   like it feels like ethernet is less and less relevant,
[01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:28.940]   right?
[01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:29.780]   It's harder to get--
[01:45:29.780 --> 01:45:30.620]   - I can't hear that.
[01:45:30.620 --> 01:45:32.300]   - You can still buy a house with post-in-tube wiring.
[01:45:32.300 --> 01:45:33.140]   Let me tell you.
[01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:33.980]   - 100%.
[01:45:33.980 --> 01:45:35.180]   - So it takes a while.
[01:45:35.180 --> 01:45:37.260]   - Well, you say that, but my mentor in the UK
[01:45:37.260 --> 01:45:39.420]   from PC Magazine got Q&A.
[01:45:39.420 --> 01:45:43.620]   Got arrested, so it was one of the few individuals
[01:45:43.620 --> 01:45:45.300]   who actually managed to block a PBX
[01:45:45.300 --> 01:45:46.980]   setup and run it in his house.
[01:45:46.980 --> 01:45:50.500]   And he used it for ring phones to the toilet, to the office.
[01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:51.660]   - It was an assu-risker.
[01:45:51.660 --> 01:45:54.140]   - It was just an box.
[01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:55.820]   - It was basically the thing that--
[01:45:55.820 --> 01:45:56.820]   - 'Cause the one people did that.
[01:45:56.820 --> 01:45:57.660]   - It was tricksbox, yeah.
[01:45:57.660 --> 01:46:01.060]   - It's so funny because nobody does even tricksboxes anymore.
[01:46:01.060 --> 01:46:01.900]   - That was two.
[01:46:01.900 --> 01:46:03.820]   - That was the thing, right?
[01:46:03.820 --> 01:46:05.980]   - Why haven't you put enough for most people?
[01:46:05.980 --> 01:46:06.820]   - Yeah.
[01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:09.100]   - You know, for the 20th and 1 wide.
[01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:09.940]   - Yeah.
[01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:11.660]   - Am I the only one who looks funny at people
[01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:13.020]   who call themselves true geeks,
[01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:15.580]   but then they say, oh yeah, I've got Wi-Fi,
[01:46:15.580 --> 01:46:16.420]   so that's all me.
[01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:17.540]   - No, I'm totally judging them.
[01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:18.380]   - Yeah, right.
[01:46:18.380 --> 01:46:19.740]   - If you don't have a wired connection,
[01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:21.140]   I'll just assume you get that serious.
[01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:22.140]   - We don't know you.
[01:46:22.140 --> 01:46:23.700]   We don't know you.
[01:46:23.700 --> 01:46:25.540]   You can't sit with us.
[01:46:25.540 --> 01:46:27.020]   - This is a hard-core group.
[01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:28.820]   - No, no, but I know I'm with you.
[01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:30.980]   It's kind of like if you receive a press release
[01:46:30.980 --> 01:46:32.780]   from someone with a hotmail address.
[01:46:32.780 --> 01:46:34.380]   - Oh yeah, it's bad.
[01:46:34.380 --> 01:46:37.180]   - My husband has a hotmail address.
[01:46:37.180 --> 01:46:40.260]   - I've been trying to talk and we got married for 15 years.
[01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:42.260]   I cannot get ready to get rid of this.
[01:46:42.260 --> 01:46:43.180]   - That's hysterical.
[01:46:43.180 --> 01:46:45.180]   - I reopened my Juno address.
[01:46:45.180 --> 01:46:47.540]   - No, oh you know what that is?
[01:46:47.540 --> 01:46:49.220]   It's now Twee Retra.
[01:46:49.220 --> 01:46:50.220]   It's like, oh yeah.
[01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:53.140]   Juno, yeah.
[01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:54.500]   - I wonder if I could get my old comp,
[01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:56.140]   you serve handle back.
[01:46:56.140 --> 01:46:57.860]   - I'm pretty sure I could get my old--
[01:46:57.860 --> 01:46:59.100]   - I know you remember yours.
[01:46:59.100 --> 01:46:59.940]   I know you know you're new.
[01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:02.620]   - I do, so I'm 5'1" to 3" comma 5'1" 5'6".
[01:47:02.620 --> 01:47:04.660]   - We should have just stopped at comp, you serve.
[01:47:04.660 --> 01:47:07.420]   - We just, just, everybody.
[01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:09.660]   - I'm not a number, I'm a man.
[01:47:09.660 --> 01:47:14.660]   - UK is out of again, the UK regulator stopped
[01:47:14.660 --> 01:47:18.860]   the Microsoft acquisition of Activision Blizzard
[01:47:18.860 --> 01:47:22.500]   and now they're thinking maybe we should halt
[01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:24.900]   this Adobe acquisition of Figma.
[01:47:24.900 --> 01:47:25.820]   - Yeah.
[01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:29.940]   - $20 billion acquisition of a web-based design company.
[01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:32.860]   I don't know on what grounds,
[01:47:32.860 --> 01:47:35.460]   but they're just saying, well maybe we're gonna have to,
[01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:36.700]   they said this on Friday,
[01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:39.980]   we're gonna have to make a deeper investigation
[01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:42.900]   because it could quote, "reduce innovation".
[01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:43.900]   - Wow, I got crazy stuff.
[01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:46.940]   - Any success in technology reduces innovation.
[01:47:46.940 --> 01:47:49.460]   - Okay, but look, do you really think,
[01:47:49.460 --> 01:47:53.420]   like I spent what is it, $50, $70 a month
[01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:56.820]   on stupid cloud services for Adobe?
[01:47:56.820 --> 01:47:58.740]   Because I spent, you know, what was it,
[01:47:58.740 --> 01:48:01.620]   15 years developing my illustrator skills.
[01:48:01.620 --> 01:48:03.620]   I need access to that program.
[01:48:03.620 --> 01:48:06.140]   I think there's another multiverse out there
[01:48:06.140 --> 01:48:09.300]   where Adobe did not acquire Macromedia.
[01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:10.140]   - That's a good point.
[01:48:10.140 --> 01:48:13.860]   - And they were forced to like not have this monopoly
[01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:16.860]   in this space and we're not all hemorrhaging money,
[01:48:16.860 --> 01:48:18.860]   just to access the tools that we need to use.
[01:48:18.860 --> 01:48:19.780]   - Oh, the wish for the Adobe which was great.
[01:48:19.780 --> 01:48:21.660]   - This is just 'cause everybody hates Adobe though.
[01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:22.500]   - I love Adobe.
[01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:23.940]   - They make it so easy to hate.
[01:48:23.940 --> 01:48:25.740]   - I wanna be clear, I love Adobe.
[01:48:25.740 --> 01:48:29.540]   I think they have revolutionized mass cuts of the,
[01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:34.540]   I think I'm talking of very specific competition argument here.
[01:48:34.540 --> 01:48:37.860]   The fact that they bought Macromedia,
[01:48:37.860 --> 01:48:41.340]   what was that, 2000 something, 1998, somewhere around?
[01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:42.500]   - Around them, yeah.
[01:48:42.500 --> 01:48:44.300]   - The fact that they bought that,
[01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:48.620]   they bought out the competition and that left no one else
[01:48:48.620 --> 01:48:53.340]   in that space to really put forward a first-class quality model.
[01:48:53.340 --> 01:48:57.900]   Don't text me after the show is over talking about like,
[01:48:57.900 --> 01:49:00.100]   you know, Pixelmator, I love Pixelmator,
[01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:01.780]   but it's not Photoshop.
[01:49:01.780 --> 01:49:03.020]   And you know.
[01:49:03.020 --> 01:49:03.820]   - For what's benefits,
[01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:05.820]   GIMP has some serious weaknesses.
[01:49:05.820 --> 01:49:06.660]   - 100%.
[01:49:06.660 --> 01:49:09.980]   So you look at Figma here and here is a tool
[01:49:09.980 --> 01:49:12.460]   that has really become a,
[01:49:12.460 --> 01:49:14.940]   it's a staple of graphic design.
[01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:17.060]   - And you could make the case that Adobe bought it
[01:49:17.060 --> 01:49:19.380]   because it was gonna kill them.
[01:49:19.380 --> 01:49:20.740]   - Right, or limit competition.
[01:49:20.740 --> 01:49:23.420]   - And so they wanted to get Figma out of the game.
[01:49:23.420 --> 01:49:24.260]   - Right.
[01:49:24.260 --> 01:49:26.740]   - Because otherwise who would pay for a creative cloud license?
[01:49:26.740 --> 01:49:27.580]   - Right.
[01:49:27.580 --> 01:49:30.340]   - Well, it's just the same as, you know,
[01:49:30.340 --> 01:49:31.780]   Facebook buying up Instagram,
[01:49:31.780 --> 01:49:32.860]   we'll just go buying up.
[01:49:32.860 --> 01:49:33.700]   - Absolutely.
[01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:34.540]   - Absolutely everyone else.
[01:49:34.540 --> 01:49:36.380]   - Maybe the UK regulator has something here.
[01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:39.460]   - Yeah, honestly, if you actually had some decent market
[01:49:39.460 --> 01:49:40.540]   regulation in this country,
[01:49:40.540 --> 01:49:42.420]   things will be a lot cheaper.
[01:49:42.420 --> 01:49:46.260]   Telecoms, you know, internet provision,
[01:49:46.260 --> 01:49:48.220]   a whole bunch of health services.
[01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:50.300]   It's, ah.
[01:49:50.300 --> 01:49:52.460]   - I had to recuse myself from this discussion
[01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:56.100]   because the co-founder of Adobe was at Jesuit.
[01:49:56.100 --> 01:49:56.940]   - What?
[01:49:56.940 --> 01:49:58.060]   - Chuck Gechke.
[01:49:58.060 --> 01:49:59.100]   - No kidding.
[01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:00.220]   Was he a priest?
[01:50:00.220 --> 01:50:01.940]   - No, he didn't make it as a mother.
[01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:03.380]   - He was a brother.
[01:50:03.380 --> 01:50:04.300]   - A brother.
[01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:05.300]   - So he didn't make it a priest.
[01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:07.340]   - Yeah, he founded a multi-billion company.
[01:50:07.340 --> 01:50:08.660]   - It's like a cut-down price.
[01:50:08.660 --> 01:50:10.020]   - You really let yourself down on that one.
[01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:12.140]   - That's an interesting story.
[01:50:12.140 --> 01:50:15.180]   - Did you see what the base camp guy was talking at this week
[01:50:15.180 --> 01:50:16.940]   as far as the Figma deal talking about?
[01:50:16.940 --> 01:50:17.780]   - DHH.
[01:50:17.780 --> 01:50:19.100]   - Yes, David was talking about--
[01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:20.780]   - Hannah Meyer Hanson.
[01:50:20.780 --> 01:50:23.540]   - How, he was basically prohibiting anybody
[01:50:23.540 --> 01:50:24.940]   that works at base camp
[01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:26.780]   and they're pipeline from using Figma.
[01:50:26.780 --> 01:50:28.100]   - I was really stunned by that.
[01:50:28.100 --> 01:50:30.620]   I'm like, if you have professionals,
[01:50:30.620 --> 01:50:32.660]   I think you should be able to use the tools
[01:50:32.660 --> 01:50:34.260]   that are best for your workflow.
[01:50:34.260 --> 01:50:35.620]   I found that really surprising.
[01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:37.580]   He thought he could get the best work from people.
[01:50:37.580 --> 01:50:40.380]   - I have been trying to break more of our organizations
[01:50:40.380 --> 01:50:41.660]   away from Creative Cloud
[01:50:41.660 --> 01:50:43.700]   because a lot of them actually can't even afford
[01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:44.540]   Creative Cloud.
[01:50:44.540 --> 01:50:45.380]   - Right, yeah.
[01:50:45.380 --> 01:50:49.380]   - So like for video, finally DaVinci is decent.
[01:50:49.380 --> 01:50:53.060]   It's free and you can actually buy the more advanced
[01:50:53.060 --> 01:50:55.740]   version without having to pay a subscription.
[01:50:55.740 --> 01:50:57.820]   - For photo, it's still gimp.
[01:50:57.820 --> 01:51:00.340]   It's most accessible.
[01:51:00.340 --> 01:51:04.980]   But yeah, I look at how much money we pay for Creative Cloud
[01:51:04.980 --> 01:51:07.020]   even in our small communications shop in Rome.
[01:51:07.020 --> 01:51:08.780]   And it's ridiculous.
[01:51:08.780 --> 01:51:10.940]   - Yeah, I mean, and this comes out to what you were saying
[01:51:10.940 --> 01:51:14.220]   in that when Adobe shifted from being able to buy
[01:51:14.220 --> 01:51:16.660]   the software to having to rent it,
[01:51:16.660 --> 01:51:19.380]   it's that massive disparities.
[01:51:19.380 --> 01:51:21.460]   So at one point, it was actually,
[01:51:21.460 --> 01:51:23.660]   when they were still selling in Australia,
[01:51:23.660 --> 01:51:26.460]   it was cheaper to fly from Los Angeles.
[01:51:26.460 --> 01:51:28.860]   Sorry, to fly from Australia to Los Angeles,
[01:51:28.860 --> 01:51:31.980]   buy a copy of Adobe and then fly back to Australia.
[01:51:31.980 --> 01:51:33.500]   And then they jack that up further
[01:51:33.500 --> 01:51:34.860]   when they had system on-
[01:51:34.860 --> 01:51:37.420]   - How many licenses do we have?
[01:51:37.420 --> 01:51:38.860]   Benito, do you know?
[01:51:38.860 --> 01:51:41.380]   We probably have eight full Creative Cloud licenses.
[01:51:41.380 --> 01:51:42.780]   Every editor has a full license.
[01:51:42.780 --> 01:51:44.980]   - And so two seats per license.
[01:51:44.980 --> 01:51:46.420]   - Yeah, six to eight.
[01:51:46.420 --> 01:51:50.180]   - Oh, my favorite is the, so they do the introductory
[01:51:50.180 --> 01:51:52.940]   pricing, so it's $30 a month, but then you get to the year
[01:51:52.940 --> 01:51:54.860]   and it goes up to $59 a month.
[01:51:54.860 --> 01:51:55.700]   - Yeah.
[01:51:55.700 --> 01:51:58.020]   - So every year you have to, actually they've automated it.
[01:51:58.020 --> 01:52:00.340]   It used to be you had to call and threaten to quit
[01:52:00.340 --> 01:52:01.700]   and then they'd give you another year.
[01:52:01.700 --> 01:52:02.540]   - Right.
[01:52:02.540 --> 01:52:04.020]   - Now you threatened to quit on the website
[01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:06.060]   and then they forward you to another page saying,
[01:52:06.060 --> 01:52:07.220]   we'll give you another you at this,
[01:52:07.220 --> 01:52:09.180]   but if you don't do it, you forget it.
[01:52:09.180 --> 01:52:10.780]   - Well, so I'm actually gonna get Jack too.
[01:52:10.780 --> 01:52:13.300]   - But the old model, I don't know if y'all remember this,
[01:52:13.300 --> 01:52:16.260]   but like I remember when Illustrator eight came out, right?
[01:52:16.260 --> 01:52:19.020]   You would really go and look at the new feature set
[01:52:19.020 --> 01:52:22.500]   and be like, okay, we have gradient meshes this year.
[01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:23.980]   This looks like innovation.
[01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:27.460]   You would read the magazines like arguing whether it was
[01:52:27.460 --> 01:52:30.340]   a good enough upgrade and you would make a decision
[01:52:30.340 --> 01:52:33.740]   every year about which Adobe products were worth your money.
[01:52:33.740 --> 01:52:36.980]   I'm gonna do page maker this year, go live this year.
[01:52:36.980 --> 01:52:39.940]   You know, it was, I feel like that was an era
[01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:42.540]   where they really were forced to bring their A game
[01:52:42.540 --> 01:52:43.580]   every single time.
[01:52:43.580 --> 01:52:44.420]   - Yeah.
[01:52:44.420 --> 01:52:45.740]   - I don't think that's really the case
[01:52:45.740 --> 01:52:46.940]   for creative clowns today.
[01:52:46.940 --> 01:52:49.700]   - There at least two people in our IRC who are using
[01:52:49.700 --> 01:52:54.700]   old versions of Photoshop, Photoshop six and Photoshop seven,
[01:52:54.700 --> 01:52:56.740]   but they're not gonna be able to do that much longer.
[01:52:56.740 --> 01:53:01.020]   - I have about 30 copies of 5.5,
[01:53:01.020 --> 01:53:01.940]   which is the last version.
[01:53:01.940 --> 01:53:02.860]   - That was a good version.
[01:53:02.860 --> 01:53:04.300]   - It was a very good version.
[01:53:04.300 --> 01:53:06.820]   But the only thing that's missing is it doesn't handle
[01:53:06.820 --> 01:53:08.500]   some of the newer file formats,
[01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:09.340]   which is, it's a fun--
[01:53:09.340 --> 01:53:10.820]   - Large Photoshop file format.
[01:53:10.820 --> 01:53:15.300]   - And the other problem is to use my legally purchased copies,
[01:53:15.300 --> 01:53:16.580]   I actually have to hack them
[01:53:16.580 --> 01:53:18.700]   because they've deactivated the activation service.
[01:53:18.700 --> 01:53:19.860]   - Oh, great.
[01:53:19.860 --> 01:53:20.820]   - Oh my gosh.
[01:53:20.820 --> 01:53:23.020]   Leo, I mean, like you're a serious photographer,
[01:53:23.020 --> 01:53:26.820]   and you can't do like raw file format and stuff
[01:53:26.820 --> 01:53:27.700]   with that light room.
[01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:28.500]   Like you really do need that.
[01:53:28.500 --> 01:53:29.540]   - Oh, you totally can.
[01:53:29.540 --> 01:53:30.740]   But you have to have something else.
[01:53:30.740 --> 01:53:31.740]   - Well, what other alternative--
[01:53:31.740 --> 01:53:32.580]   - Oh, there's tons of them.
[01:53:32.580 --> 01:53:34.260]   What's the one I use?
[01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:35.700]   Oh, I can't even remember the name of it.
[01:53:35.700 --> 01:53:36.540]   - Do I have them?
[01:53:36.540 --> 01:53:37.380]   - Yeah.
[01:53:37.380 --> 01:53:39.140]   - Oh, absolutely, there are ways to do it.
[01:53:39.140 --> 01:53:42.020]   And more and more, what's really interesting
[01:53:42.020 --> 01:53:44.900]   on the Apple site is there are iPad apps
[01:53:44.900 --> 01:53:48.660]   like Affinity, the Serif companies, Affinity Photo,
[01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:52.700]   and others that are kind of, I think, eating Adobe's lunch.
[01:53:52.700 --> 01:53:53.540]   - Huh?
[01:53:53.540 --> 01:53:55.940]   - So I think a lot of, at least in the max side,
[01:53:55.940 --> 01:53:58.820]   a lot of people are abandoning Photoshop and Lightroom.
[01:53:58.820 --> 01:53:59.660]   - Yeah.
[01:53:59.660 --> 01:54:02.260]   - I had a $10 photography subscription,
[01:54:02.260 --> 01:54:03.940]   which was Lightroom and Photoshop,
[01:54:03.940 --> 01:54:05.700]   and I just checked it the other day,
[01:54:05.700 --> 01:54:07.340]   and it doesn't include Photoshop anymore.
[01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:08.180]   - Oh my gosh.
[01:54:08.180 --> 01:54:09.500]   - It's like, dudes.
[01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:10.340]   - Yeah.
[01:54:10.340 --> 01:54:12.020]   - I just, the hell with them.
[01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:14.540]   I'm sorry, I'm done with Adobe.
[01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:16.300]   There are solutions out there.
[01:54:16.300 --> 01:54:18.300]   I think it's camera one that I use.
[01:54:18.300 --> 01:54:19.500]   - I'd love to look into that.
[01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:21.980]   I mean, I got Lightroom through my job, but--
[01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:24.500]   - Camera one is not a subscription, you buy it,
[01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:26.820]   but it does all of the, no, that's not it.
[01:54:26.820 --> 01:54:28.780]   What is the name of it?
[01:54:28.780 --> 01:54:30.240]   Ant is God, isn't he?
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:34.060]   Somebody was gonna tell me what I use.
[01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:35.660]   (laughing)
[01:54:35.660 --> 01:54:36.900]   Capture one, thank you.
[01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:37.740]   - It exists.
[01:54:37.740 --> 01:54:40.220]   - Not camera one, capture one, thank you.
[01:54:40.220 --> 01:54:41.980]   Chatroom knows more about me than I know,
[01:54:41.980 --> 01:54:45.380]   'cause I forgot almost everything.
[01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:47.260]   Capture one is, let me see the pricing,
[01:54:47.260 --> 01:54:49.540]   'cause I think it's fairly expensive.
[01:54:49.540 --> 01:54:52.540]   Yeah, they do have a subscription, $18 a month.
[01:54:52.540 --> 01:54:53.380]   - I don't pay $300.
[01:54:53.380 --> 01:54:56.020]   - But you get a $300 perpetual license.
[01:54:56.020 --> 01:54:59.260]   And it handles all the raw file formats.
[01:54:59.260 --> 01:55:00.300]   So if you really want something
[01:55:00.300 --> 01:55:02.100]   that is kind of very similar to Lightroom.
[01:55:02.100 --> 01:55:05.460]   - Sure, to be fair, some of Lightroom's like AI tools
[01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:08.180]   are pretty good nowadays for like removing
[01:55:08.180 --> 01:55:09.940]   and stuff like that for masking.
[01:55:09.940 --> 01:55:11.540]   - There's some really good stuff out there,
[01:55:11.540 --> 01:55:13.820]   but then Adobe now has their--
[01:55:13.820 --> 01:55:14.660]   - They added AI to their eye.
[01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:16.580]   - Firefly and they have--
[01:55:16.580 --> 01:55:20.700]   - Outpainting and, you know, but they're in a struggle.
[01:55:20.700 --> 01:55:24.540]   That's why they spent $20 billion to buy a website, basically.
[01:55:24.540 --> 01:55:26.740]   To buy Figma, be interesting to see what happens.
[01:55:26.740 --> 01:55:28.340]   - So much easier to buy the competition
[01:55:28.340 --> 01:55:29.260]   than actually innovate.
[01:55:29.260 --> 01:55:31.460]   - They've got the money, they've got the money.
[01:55:31.460 --> 01:55:33.980]   - And that's, I think what the regulators are saying.
[01:55:33.980 --> 01:55:34.980]   - Well, yeah, exactly.
[01:55:34.980 --> 01:55:36.540]   And I mean, we've seen this where, you know,
[01:55:36.540 --> 01:55:40.500]   you get this oligopoly companies just running specific,
[01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:43.580]   you know, I mean, Microsoft funded Apple for years
[01:55:43.580 --> 01:55:45.820]   just to avoid this kind of antitrust stuff.
[01:55:45.820 --> 01:55:46.660]   - Yep.
[01:55:46.660 --> 01:55:48.780]   - You know, you've got three big telcos
[01:55:48.780 --> 01:55:50.340]   on the US controlling mobile phones,
[01:55:50.340 --> 01:55:53.180]   you've got four or five ISPs.
[01:55:53.180 --> 01:55:56.380]   If you include Sonic, which I usually do, you know,
[01:55:56.380 --> 01:56:00.780]   I mean, there's a very limited competition landscape here.
[01:56:00.780 --> 01:56:03.340]   And for years, it's been like, yeah, let it merge.
[01:56:03.340 --> 01:56:04.780]   I mean, look at the JetBlue merger
[01:56:04.780 --> 01:56:06.620]   that was just gonna go through.
[01:56:06.620 --> 01:56:07.460]   - Yeah.
[01:56:07.460 --> 01:56:09.500]   - No benefit whatsoever to consumers.
[01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:10.380]   So, yeah.
[01:56:10.380 --> 01:56:13.180]   - Doesn't it make y'all sound to a certain degree
[01:56:13.180 --> 01:56:16.220]   that like Apple used to really have their own tools
[01:56:16.220 --> 01:56:17.060]   in this space.
[01:56:17.060 --> 01:56:17.900]   - Oh.
[01:56:17.900 --> 01:56:19.260]   - Final cut was really, really--
[01:56:19.260 --> 01:56:21.500]   - Really get taken seriously as a production person
[01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:22.340]   as you were using it.
[01:56:22.340 --> 01:56:23.500]   - That's absolutely true.
[01:56:23.500 --> 01:56:27.540]   Like Final Cut motion, I understand, was never as popular.
[01:56:27.540 --> 01:56:31.420]   But Apple was really invested in bringing their own
[01:56:31.420 --> 01:56:34.860]   like pro sound and video editing tools for a while.
[01:56:34.860 --> 01:56:38.620]   And those are just not as important to the industry anymore.
[01:56:38.620 --> 01:56:41.420]   Like you've really gotten a near monopoly with, you know,
[01:56:41.420 --> 01:56:42.260]   premier.
[01:56:42.260 --> 01:56:43.700]   - I think that's really unfortunate.
[01:56:43.700 --> 01:56:44.700]   - Do you have an iPad?
[01:56:44.700 --> 01:56:45.620]   - Yeah.
[01:56:45.620 --> 01:56:48.260]   - I would look at, I mean, I think the iPad Pros especially
[01:56:48.260 --> 01:56:50.700]   are really becoming the choice for photo editing.
[01:56:50.700 --> 01:56:51.540]   - Really?
[01:56:51.540 --> 01:56:53.220]   - Because it's touch, it's kind of natural.
[01:56:53.220 --> 01:56:57.780]   The iPad Pro screens are spectacular.
[01:56:57.780 --> 01:56:59.700]   Better than most computer monitors.
[01:56:59.700 --> 01:57:04.700]   This is a very good photo editor for the iPad PhotoMator 3.05.
[01:57:04.700 --> 01:57:05.720]   Just came out.
[01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:10.420]   It is a 600 RAW file formats.
[01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:12.260]   And I think it's cheap.
[01:57:12.260 --> 01:57:14.900]   I can't remember how much, but the PixelMator folks
[01:57:14.900 --> 01:57:17.220]   really do stuff inexpensively.
[01:57:17.220 --> 01:57:18.060]   - Yeah.
[01:57:18.060 --> 01:57:20.020]   - So there are a lot of stuff out there.
[01:57:20.020 --> 01:57:21.220]   - I'll definitely look at that.
[01:57:21.220 --> 01:57:22.060]   - Yeah.
[01:57:22.060 --> 01:57:25.340]   I find that the alternative, the Mac and iPad alternatives
[01:57:25.340 --> 01:57:28.860]   are really as good as, as a Lightroom.
[01:57:28.860 --> 01:57:30.900]   The problem is you don't have the digital asset management,
[01:57:30.900 --> 01:57:32.100]   which is a big part of Lightroom.
[01:57:32.100 --> 01:57:32.940]   - That's really not.
[01:57:32.940 --> 01:57:35.300]   - I just use Apple's photos for that.
[01:57:35.300 --> 01:57:36.500]   And it actually works fine.
[01:57:36.500 --> 01:57:38.060]   - That should be a new Twitch show.
[01:57:38.060 --> 01:57:40.980]   Content creation with nothing but free software and services.
[01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:41.820]   - I love it.
[01:57:41.820 --> 01:57:42.820]   - Oh.
[01:57:42.820 --> 01:57:43.980]   - I love that idea.
[01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:44.820]   - Do tutorials on it.
[01:57:44.820 --> 01:57:45.660]   - Oh, yes.
[01:57:45.660 --> 01:57:46.740]   - We could do that on Floss Weekly.
[01:57:46.740 --> 01:57:47.580]   - Yeah.
[01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:48.420]   - 100%.
[01:57:48.420 --> 01:57:49.260]   - Yeah.
[01:57:49.260 --> 01:57:51.340]   - So there was a lot of attention to the US Supreme Court
[01:57:51.340 --> 01:57:52.260]   this week.
[01:57:52.260 --> 01:57:55.780]   One case though that affects tech people.
[01:57:55.780 --> 01:57:57.580]   The rest of it affects normal people.
[01:57:57.580 --> 01:57:59.180]   - There are people affected in tech.
[01:57:59.180 --> 01:58:00.020]   - Yes.
[01:58:00.020 --> 01:58:00.860]   Oh, believe me.
[01:58:00.860 --> 01:58:01.700]   Yes.
[01:58:01.700 --> 01:58:02.540]   Absolutely.
[01:58:02.540 --> 01:58:03.380]   But I won't get into those.
[01:58:03.380 --> 01:58:06.020]   I will talk about a couple of kind of surprising cases.
[01:58:06.020 --> 01:58:09.060]   It didn't get much coverage because of the big Supreme Court
[01:58:09.060 --> 01:58:09.900]   cases this week.
[01:58:09.900 --> 01:58:12.180]   But first, a word from our sponsor.
[01:58:12.180 --> 01:58:16.100]   Our show today brought to you by ExpressVPN.
[01:58:16.100 --> 01:58:17.900]   We were talking on Ask the Tech guys
[01:58:17.900 --> 01:58:20.340]   about why you would want to use a VPN.
[01:58:20.340 --> 01:58:23.340]   And even today, there are still some very good reasons
[01:58:23.340 --> 01:58:27.340]   for security, for privacy, to eliminate geographic restrictions.
[01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:29.380]   We all spend too much time on our phones these days
[01:58:29.380 --> 01:58:31.900]   buying groceries, sending pictures to friends,
[01:58:31.900 --> 01:58:34.980]   maybe ordering a car to the airport, Father.
[01:58:34.980 --> 01:58:38.460]   The scary part is your phone carrier sees it all.
[01:58:38.460 --> 01:58:40.900]   They collect data on whatever it is you're doing.
[01:58:40.900 --> 01:58:43.260]   Verizon admits to it.
[01:58:43.260 --> 01:58:46.740]   They say it so they can quote, "Better understand your interests."
[01:58:46.740 --> 01:58:48.820]   Well, they understand my interests.
[01:58:48.820 --> 01:58:51.540]   Really all they want to do is sell your activity to advertisers.
[01:58:51.540 --> 01:58:52.380]   And they can't.
[01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:53.580]   It's completely legal.
[01:58:53.580 --> 01:58:57.140]   Stuff like the sites you visited, what you've been on to online,
[01:58:57.140 --> 01:59:00.900]   the more they can get on you, the bigger their paycheck becomes.
[01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:03.860]   If you want to protect your privacy, your security online,
[01:59:03.860 --> 01:59:05.380]   you need a VPN.
[01:59:05.380 --> 01:59:08.460]   And I use ExpressVPN.
[01:59:08.460 --> 01:59:09.460]   It's easy to use.
[01:59:09.460 --> 01:59:15.660]   It's an app on iPhone, Android, Mac, Linux, Windows.
[01:59:15.660 --> 01:59:17.100]   It prevents your phone carrier from being
[01:59:17.100 --> 01:59:19.500]   able to see the sites you visit and sell it off
[01:59:19.500 --> 01:59:20.140]   to third parties.
[01:59:20.140 --> 01:59:22.020]   Same thing for your ISP.
[01:59:22.020 --> 01:59:24.580]   Comcast is not your friend.
[01:59:24.580 --> 01:59:26.140]   All it takes is one tap of a button.
[01:59:26.140 --> 01:59:29.180]   And all of your network data is encrypted and rerouted
[01:59:29.180 --> 01:59:31.860]   through ExpressVPN secure servers.
[01:59:31.860 --> 01:59:34.340]   I am so impressed with how ExpressVPN does this.
[01:59:34.340 --> 01:59:36.540]   In order to truly protect you, it's
[01:59:36.540 --> 01:59:40.060]   important that a VPN provider not log your activity.
[01:59:40.060 --> 01:59:41.060]   We know that.
[01:59:41.060 --> 01:59:43.380]   And of course, it's in the privacy policy.
[01:59:43.380 --> 01:59:46.140]   They've had it audited and independently by third parties.
[01:59:46.140 --> 01:59:48.580]   But I want to tell you, they go a step further.
[01:59:48.580 --> 01:59:51.900]   They use a custom Debian distribution on all their servers
[01:59:51.900 --> 01:59:54.060]   that wipes the drive every night.
[01:59:54.060 --> 01:59:56.260]   They start fresh every morning.
[01:59:56.260 --> 01:59:58.260]   So there's no trace of your visit.
[01:59:58.260 --> 01:59:59.900]   They run their server technology.
[01:59:59.900 --> 02:00:03.020]   They wrote it themselves called Trusted Server in RAM.
[02:00:03.020 --> 02:00:03.940]   And it's sandboxed.
[02:00:03.940 --> 02:00:07.460]   So even if it wanted to write to the hard drive, it couldn't.
[02:00:07.460 --> 02:00:10.340]   It starts up just for you when you press the button
[02:00:10.340 --> 02:00:11.980]   on your ExpressVPN app.
[02:00:11.980 --> 02:00:14.700]   And when you're done, it goes away forever.
[02:00:14.700 --> 02:00:18.380]   There is literally no way any trace
[02:00:18.380 --> 02:00:22.780]   of your use of ExpressVPN can show up on their servers.
[02:00:22.780 --> 02:00:25.540]   It protects all your network data, not just your web browsing.
[02:00:25.540 --> 02:00:28.380]   You stay private even when you're using your apps on your phone.
[02:00:28.380 --> 02:00:32.340]   Whether you're an iPhone, Android, tablet user, ExpressVPN,
[02:00:32.340 --> 02:00:34.700]   even works on your routers.
[02:00:34.700 --> 02:00:35.580]   They even sell routers.
[02:00:35.580 --> 02:00:37.100]   Very nice routers, as a matter of fact,
[02:00:37.100 --> 02:00:39.460]   are ExpressVPN.com/twit.
[02:00:39.460 --> 02:00:42.780]   And the best part is one subscription covers up to five devices
[02:00:42.780 --> 02:00:44.140]   at the same time.
[02:00:44.140 --> 02:00:47.100]   So your whole family can use ExpressVPN.
[02:00:47.100 --> 02:00:49.020]   It's the only VPN I use.
[02:00:49.020 --> 02:00:51.020]   When your phone carrier tracks you,
[02:00:51.020 --> 02:00:54.900]   that's a gross invasion of privacy, emphasize gross.
[02:00:54.900 --> 02:00:56.580]   You can keep letting them cash in on you
[02:00:56.580 --> 02:01:01.380]   or visit ExpressVPN.com/twit to get the same VPN I use.
[02:01:01.380 --> 02:01:03.540]   Take back your online privacy today.
[02:01:03.540 --> 02:01:05.860]   If you use our special link, you'll get three months free
[02:01:05.860 --> 02:01:07.700]   with a one year plan.
[02:01:07.700 --> 02:01:12.180]   eXPRESVPN.com/twit.
[02:01:12.180 --> 02:01:15.980]   ExpressVPN.com/twit.
[02:01:15.980 --> 02:01:17.380]   We thank them so much for their support
[02:01:17.380 --> 02:01:21.620]   and for making a really, really great product.
[02:01:21.620 --> 02:01:25.580]   So, yes, the Supreme Court said,
[02:01:25.580 --> 02:01:28.100]   "You can discriminate against anybody anytime.
[02:01:28.100 --> 02:01:30.700]   You don't have to make a website for them."
[02:01:30.700 --> 02:01:33.340]   That was a funny case because nobody had actually ever asked
[02:01:33.340 --> 02:01:34.340]   that person in a website.
[02:01:34.340 --> 02:01:35.500]   It was so radical.
[02:01:35.500 --> 02:01:38.780]   You thought, "I'm shocked to find out I'm married to a kid."
[02:01:38.780 --> 02:01:41.420]   And the other guy they said wanted to,
[02:01:41.420 --> 02:01:44.700]   anyway, stupid case, the Supreme Court made their,
[02:01:44.700 --> 02:01:46.180]   I think, clearly wrong decision
[02:01:46.180 --> 02:01:48.780]   because it opens the door for discrimination of any kind.
[02:01:48.780 --> 02:01:53.820]   And I think that protecting people against,
[02:01:53.820 --> 02:01:57.100]   protected classes against that kind of thing is absolutely vital.
[02:01:57.100 --> 02:02:01.820]   They also threw away affirmative action after 50 years.
[02:02:01.820 --> 02:02:05.220]   They threw and they overturned the debt relief.
[02:02:05.220 --> 02:02:06.580]   I don't know how you feel about all of that,
[02:02:06.580 --> 02:02:08.220]   but this one really got me mad.
[02:02:08.220 --> 02:02:11.740]   They, Supreme Court rebuffed Apple.
[02:02:11.740 --> 02:02:13.660]   - You would have kid about to go to college.
[02:02:13.660 --> 02:02:15.820]   - No, no, no, my kids have gone through college.
[02:02:15.820 --> 02:02:16.660]   - Oh, okay.
[02:02:16.660 --> 02:02:18.340]   - I got no more college.
[02:02:18.340 --> 02:02:19.900]   I am done.
[02:02:19.900 --> 02:02:21.580]   - Post grad.
[02:02:21.580 --> 02:02:23.700]   - Oh, no, Abby just got her master's last week.
[02:02:23.700 --> 02:02:25.300]   - Okay, I don't know. - Yes, she's done.
[02:02:25.300 --> 02:02:27.500]   - Although she is saying she wants to get a PhD.
[02:02:27.500 --> 02:02:29.060]   - No!
[02:02:29.060 --> 02:02:32.540]   - You know, I hear NYU has an excellent PhD program
[02:02:32.540 --> 02:02:33.500]   and I want to call. - PhD says her
[02:02:33.500 --> 02:02:34.700]   piled higher and deeper.
[02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:36.060]   - Yeah.
[02:02:36.060 --> 02:02:39.140]   - No, if she wants to be Dr. Abby, that's okay with me.
[02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:40.540]   - Okay.
[02:02:40.540 --> 02:02:42.580]   - Worked out well for Frank.
[02:02:42.580 --> 02:02:44.180]   - Does he have a PhD?
[02:02:44.180 --> 02:02:45.780]   - What's his doctorate? - He has a PhD in bacterial genetics.
[02:02:45.780 --> 02:02:47.340]   - Bacterial genetics.
[02:02:47.340 --> 02:02:48.780]   That's right, he worked on the MRI.
[02:02:48.780 --> 02:02:49.620]   - He did?
[02:02:49.620 --> 02:02:50.940]   - He did not virus.
[02:02:50.940 --> 02:02:52.620]   (laughing)
[02:02:52.620 --> 02:02:53.460]   - We're going to do it.
[02:02:53.460 --> 02:02:54.300]   - We're going to do it.
[02:02:54.300 --> 02:02:55.120]   - We're going to do it.
[02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:55.960]   - Antibis.
[02:02:55.960 --> 02:02:56.780]   - Antibis.
[02:02:56.780 --> 02:02:59.860]   - We're going to story now, right?
[02:02:59.860 --> 02:03:04.860]   - So, broad, this case goes back quite a few years.
[02:03:04.860 --> 02:03:06.140]   Caltech.
[02:03:06.140 --> 02:03:07.300]   - I've talked to you about this before on the show.
[02:03:07.300 --> 02:03:09.660]   - Yeah, I think we probably have 2016.
[02:03:09.660 --> 02:03:12.980]   Caltech, which is a private research university
[02:03:12.980 --> 02:03:15.660]   in Pasadena has patents on technologies
[02:03:15.660 --> 02:03:18.980]   that increase Wi-Fi speed and range in mobile devices.
[02:03:18.980 --> 02:03:21.940]   In 2016, they sued Apple and Broadcom
[02:03:21.940 --> 02:03:25.180]   saying that both the companies were using their patents
[02:03:25.180 --> 02:03:29.220]   without license, millions of iPhones, iPads,
[02:03:29.220 --> 02:03:31.860]   and other Apple devices using Broadcom Wi-Fi chips
[02:03:31.860 --> 02:03:33.260]   and fringe the patents.
[02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:37.260]   Apple and Broadcom did something we actually were thinking
[02:03:37.260 --> 02:03:41.020]   about doing back when there was a podcast patent role.
[02:03:41.020 --> 02:03:43.740]   Our attorneys, we talked with attorneys
[02:03:43.740 --> 02:03:47.140]   about doing something called an intrapartase appeal,
[02:03:47.140 --> 02:03:49.020]   which is you go to the patent and trademark office
[02:03:49.020 --> 02:03:51.900]   and say, "This patent's no good, you're overturn it."
[02:03:52.140 --> 02:03:54.580]   But our attorneys said there's a risk.
[02:03:54.580 --> 02:03:55.900]   If you do that and the patent office
[02:03:55.900 --> 02:03:57.500]   doesn't overturn it, you're screwed,
[02:03:57.500 --> 02:03:59.020]   'cause then the jury sees that and says,
[02:03:59.020 --> 02:04:00.780]   "You see, it was a good patent."
[02:04:00.780 --> 02:04:02.940]   So we didn't do it, thank goodness.
[02:04:02.940 --> 02:04:07.140]   Oh, Adam Corolla, yeah, I think it was Adam Corolla,
[02:04:07.140 --> 02:04:08.260]   it raised a lot of money.
[02:04:08.260 --> 02:04:10.220]   He did it, no, no, it was EFF.
[02:04:10.220 --> 02:04:11.820]   Adam Corolla and the fine-ended court,
[02:04:11.820 --> 02:04:14.620]   but the EFF went to the patent trademark organization
[02:04:14.620 --> 02:04:16.140]   and got the whole patent overturned.
[02:04:16.140 --> 02:04:18.300]   So that was a successful case.
[02:04:18.300 --> 02:04:21.700]   In this case, Apple and Broadcom went to the USPTO.
[02:04:22.660 --> 02:04:24.860]   And the patent office said, "No, no, that's a good,
[02:04:24.860 --> 02:04:27.500]   that's a good patent."
[02:04:27.500 --> 02:04:30.820]   Which is kind of bad news for Broadcom.
[02:04:30.820 --> 02:04:32.940]   A jury then, hearing that,
[02:04:32.940 --> 02:04:35.780]   sided with Caltech, this was in 2020,
[02:04:35.780 --> 02:04:40.780]   and gave a $1.1 billion award split by Apple and Broadcom.
[02:04:40.780 --> 02:04:44.820]   - Apple's was the lion's chair.
[02:04:44.820 --> 02:04:46.340]   I think it was almost like 800 million.
[02:04:46.340 --> 02:04:48.180]   - It's funny because it's only because Apple used
[02:04:48.180 --> 02:04:49.380]   Broadcom chips, right?
[02:04:49.380 --> 02:04:51.860]   - It wasn't even Apple directly infringing.
[02:04:51.860 --> 02:04:55.820]   So I really think Broadcom deserves.
[02:04:55.820 --> 02:04:59.500]   But anyway, both companies appealed the court of appeals
[02:04:59.500 --> 02:05:01.980]   for the federal circuit, which here's patent appeals,
[02:05:01.980 --> 02:05:04.460]   upheld the jury's findings.
[02:05:04.460 --> 02:05:07.420]   It did order a new trial on damages, that has not happened.
[02:05:07.420 --> 02:05:10.940]   So the $1.1 billion could be adjusted down.
[02:05:10.940 --> 02:05:11.780]   - Yeah.
[02:05:11.780 --> 02:05:15.980]   - In any event, Apple took it to the Supreme Court.
[02:05:15.980 --> 02:05:19.460]   In January, the Supreme Court asked the Biden administration
[02:05:19.460 --> 02:05:21.580]   whether the appeal should be heard.
[02:05:21.580 --> 02:05:24.900]   The solicitor general in May said, "No, please don't take
[02:05:24.900 --> 02:05:27.580]   the case, the federal circuit did it right."
[02:05:27.580 --> 02:05:31.060]   Supreme Court did not disagree, did not give them cert.
[02:05:31.060 --> 02:05:33.740]   So it's over in that regard.
[02:05:33.740 --> 02:05:36.980]   All we have left is a trial for how much the damages should be.
[02:05:36.980 --> 02:05:42.100]   - Yeah, Leo, my husband works in patent law biotech.
[02:05:42.100 --> 02:05:43.580]   And so-- - Oh, interesting.
[02:05:43.580 --> 02:05:44.740]   I didn't know that.
[02:05:44.740 --> 02:05:45.580]   - Okay.
[02:05:45.580 --> 02:05:47.820]   - Yeah, it's often frustrating for me
[02:05:47.820 --> 02:05:50.460]   because I hear people on my own side,
[02:05:50.460 --> 02:05:53.340]   the left saying stuff that's just wildly inaccurate
[02:05:53.340 --> 02:05:55.180]   about biotech patents, right?
[02:05:55.180 --> 02:05:57.460]   Like you'll hear people say, "Oh, why didn't we?
[02:05:57.460 --> 02:05:58.700]   "We funded all of this.
[02:05:58.700 --> 02:06:00.180]   "Why don't we just have the patents
[02:06:00.180 --> 02:06:01.660]   "and make them free for everyone?"
[02:06:01.660 --> 02:06:03.380]   And you're like, "I don't think you understand
[02:06:03.380 --> 02:06:06.580]   "the history of Moderna or how these things come to pass.
[02:06:06.580 --> 02:06:07.740]   "It's a lot more complicated."
[02:06:07.740 --> 02:06:11.740]   So I joined a pre-aprepidist by saying,
[02:06:11.740 --> 02:06:14.900]   the conversation around biotech patents,
[02:06:14.900 --> 02:06:17.100]   I think is frequently stupid.
[02:06:17.100 --> 02:06:21.820]   That said, I have personally never heard an argument
[02:06:21.820 --> 02:06:25.860]   for software patents that I have found compelling.
[02:06:25.860 --> 02:06:30.180]   I think these almost universally limit competition.
[02:06:30.180 --> 02:06:35.340]   And when I read the limits of what Frank does with his job,
[02:06:35.340 --> 02:06:37.940]   it's like a certain target protein.
[02:06:37.940 --> 02:06:41.020]   It's a certain formula that they're using.
[02:06:41.020 --> 02:06:42.420]   It's a chemical process.
[02:06:42.420 --> 02:06:44.780]   It's so precise and it's something
[02:06:44.780 --> 02:06:49.100]   that they've spent incredible amounts of money
[02:06:49.100 --> 02:06:53.300]   like eliminating others to find the one that works.
[02:06:53.300 --> 02:06:55.780]   So I think there's a valid economic argument
[02:06:55.780 --> 02:06:57.540]   for patenting that.
[02:06:57.540 --> 02:06:59.540]   I don't understand.
[02:06:59.540 --> 02:07:01.940]   I've never seen an argument for software patents.
[02:07:01.940 --> 02:07:03.620]   I think raises to that level.
[02:07:03.620 --> 02:07:04.620]   Am I alone here?
[02:07:04.620 --> 02:07:05.700]   - No, you're not alone in that.
[02:07:05.700 --> 02:07:09.180]   I mean, we're still getting letters
[02:07:09.180 --> 02:07:12.300]   from that bloke who claims the invented emails.
[02:07:12.300 --> 02:07:13.460]   - Oh my God.
[02:07:13.460 --> 02:07:14.500]   - He's still going after you.
[02:07:14.500 --> 02:07:16.540]   He's still going after you. - Is this the guy that ran
[02:07:16.540 --> 02:07:18.100]   for office in Massachusetts?
[02:07:18.100 --> 02:07:19.500]   - Yeah. - He's crazy.
[02:07:19.500 --> 02:07:20.820]   - Oh yeah. - No, no, no.
[02:07:20.820 --> 02:07:22.260]   - Don't you're gonna get us sued.
[02:07:22.260 --> 02:07:23.100]   - No, no, no, no, no, no. - He's not sued.
[02:07:23.100 --> 02:07:23.940]   - He's not sued. - The squirrel droppings.
[02:07:23.940 --> 02:07:26.100]   - It's not, I think you could say he's nutty
[02:07:26.100 --> 02:07:27.540]   or you're thing squirrel droppings.
[02:07:27.540 --> 02:07:29.820]   - Yeah, I was. - That's a matter of opinion.
[02:07:29.820 --> 02:07:31.860]   - Yes. - Crazy.
[02:07:31.860 --> 02:07:33.260]   Okay, yeah.
[02:07:33.260 --> 02:07:35.220]   - It's the sense of nutty or the squirrel droppings.
[02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:36.060]   - I'm going to use the squirrel droppings.
[02:07:36.060 --> 02:07:36.900]   - Yes.
[02:07:36.900 --> 02:07:39.460]   - Decades after the first emails was sent.
[02:07:39.460 --> 02:07:40.820]   You know, he might combine.
[02:07:40.820 --> 02:07:42.900]   - But he has the piece of paper, so therefore.
[02:07:42.900 --> 02:07:46.860]   He has a piece of paper from, just, it drives me nuts.
[02:07:46.860 --> 02:07:49.500]   - He has a bus, he drives through a Boston saying
[02:07:49.500 --> 02:07:51.220]   he's the inventor of the email.
[02:07:51.220 --> 02:07:53.940]   - He actually sued the detector because the detector
[02:07:53.940 --> 02:07:57.460]   claimed that he did not invent email.
[02:07:57.460 --> 02:08:00.780]   And back in 2017, a judge dismissed that lawsuit
[02:08:00.780 --> 02:08:02.340]   against the detector. - Oh my gosh.
[02:08:02.340 --> 02:08:05.620]   - But that hasn't stopped Shiva Ayadurai
[02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:07.620]   from continuing to assert.
[02:08:07.620 --> 02:08:08.940]   - I'm not a fan.
[02:08:08.940 --> 02:08:11.380]   - Okay, so from the tech side,
[02:08:11.380 --> 02:08:14.820]   the tricky thing about the Caltech patents is,
[02:08:14.820 --> 02:08:17.980]   it's an interesting idea. - Sure.
[02:08:17.980 --> 02:08:21.300]   - But it would have no real world application
[02:08:21.300 --> 02:08:24.620]   if Broadcom had not made their F-Bar filters.
[02:08:24.620 --> 02:08:27.980]   So the F-Bar filters are the actual device
[02:08:27.980 --> 02:08:31.540]   that takes the frequency filtering
[02:08:31.540 --> 02:08:33.980]   that the Caltech patents apply to
[02:08:33.980 --> 02:08:36.780]   and makes it something that you can actually use.
[02:08:36.780 --> 02:08:41.380]   - So yes, they did build upon Caltech's work,
[02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:44.220]   but it's not as if Caltech actually made the filters.
[02:08:44.220 --> 02:08:47.540]   - Right, and this is my argument that,
[02:08:47.540 --> 02:08:49.780]   for the biotech industry, those patents,
[02:08:49.780 --> 02:08:51.180]   they're going through, they're plugging
[02:08:51.180 --> 02:08:54.020]   like dozens of protein sequences in,
[02:08:54.020 --> 02:08:55.460]   they're doing experiments, they're seeing
[02:08:55.460 --> 02:08:57.500]   if it works, they're running assays, right?
[02:08:57.500 --> 02:09:00.060]   What you're talking about, you know, Broadcom doing
[02:09:00.060 --> 02:09:02.180]   is developing a technology,
[02:09:02.180 --> 02:09:04.780]   spending that money doing the R&D
[02:09:04.780 --> 02:09:07.100]   in a lockout process for a patent
[02:09:07.100 --> 02:09:11.020]   that in my view is essential across the industry.
[02:09:11.020 --> 02:09:14.740]   So I just, I don't see the value for this,
[02:09:14.740 --> 02:09:15.740]   and I think it's really just
[02:09:15.740 --> 02:09:18.140]   appointing the scatters as-- - And the apple part
[02:09:18.140 --> 02:09:19.940]   of the Dutchman is even more ridiculous
[02:09:19.940 --> 02:09:22.340]   because Apple didn't even develop the technology,
[02:09:22.340 --> 02:09:24.820]   they bought a chip from Broadcom.
[02:09:24.820 --> 02:09:25.660]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:09:25.660 --> 02:09:27.500]   - So I mean, how many times divorced?
[02:09:27.500 --> 02:09:30.380]   If I started a business using my iPhone,
[02:09:30.380 --> 02:09:31.820]   can Caltech claim that they should get
[02:09:31.820 --> 02:09:33.580]   a percentage of that business because it uses their--
[02:09:33.580 --> 02:09:34.420]   - There it is. - I mean,
[02:09:34.420 --> 02:09:36.420]   the American legal system is a weird thing,
[02:09:36.420 --> 02:09:39.060]   but wasn't that basically just doubling the basis?
[02:09:39.060 --> 02:09:40.620]   Apple has more money than-- - Correct.
[02:09:40.620 --> 02:09:41.900]   - I nearly said more money than God,
[02:09:41.900 --> 02:09:43.980]   but look what I'm talking to.
[02:09:43.980 --> 02:09:45.060]   - Three of them, it's pretty darn hard.
[02:09:45.060 --> 02:09:46.620]   - Apple has a lot of company.
[02:09:46.620 --> 02:09:48.940]   You know, and so chucking them in there,
[02:09:48.940 --> 02:09:51.380]   maybe just in the hope that Apple would pay them enough money
[02:09:51.380 --> 02:09:52.260]   for this to go away.
[02:09:52.260 --> 02:09:53.380]   - Well then, where does it stop?
[02:09:53.380 --> 02:09:54.700]   Apple was not the only company do you see?
[02:09:54.700 --> 02:09:56.380]   - No, no, absolutely. - No, absolutely.
[02:09:56.380 --> 02:09:58.700]   And in fact, if I was Caltech's lawyers,
[02:09:58.700 --> 02:10:00.780]   I'd be looking at this if they actually won it and going,
[02:10:00.780 --> 02:10:02.820]   "Hey, we've got a major pay there."
[02:10:02.820 --> 02:10:03.660]   - There's a long history. - There's a long history.
[02:10:03.660 --> 02:10:05.140]   - It's definitely an industry at all.
[02:10:05.140 --> 02:10:07.700]   - Because universities own the research
[02:10:07.700 --> 02:10:10.460]   that its graduate students and its professors do,
[02:10:10.460 --> 02:10:14.980]   in most cases, you know, Stanford benefits greatly from Google
[02:10:14.980 --> 02:10:17.380]   'cause Google was invented by Stanford graduate students
[02:10:17.380 --> 02:10:21.780]   and they pay Stanford every year, millions and millions
[02:10:21.780 --> 02:10:24.460]   of dollars for the right to do what they do.
[02:10:24.460 --> 02:10:26.620]   - Something which Aaron Schwartz was trying
[02:10:26.620 --> 02:10:28.020]   to stand up against.
[02:10:28.020 --> 02:10:29.500]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:10:29.500 --> 02:10:32.420]   - If we wiped out all software patents today,
[02:10:32.420 --> 02:10:35.620]   do we really think, is there anything in the tech industry
[02:10:35.620 --> 02:10:37.260]   that would be lost?
[02:10:37.260 --> 02:10:39.100]   - No, it's a silly idea.
[02:10:39.100 --> 02:10:39.940]   - Yeah.
[02:10:39.940 --> 02:10:41.740]   - Now how about DNA patents or--
[02:10:41.740 --> 02:10:42.580]   - Bashing patents.
[02:10:42.580 --> 02:10:43.420]   - Oh, that's--
[02:10:43.420 --> 02:10:44.260]   - Okay.
[02:10:44.260 --> 02:10:46.940]   - It's looking just like software.
[02:10:46.940 --> 02:10:48.420]   - 'Cause that's not all like software.
[02:10:48.420 --> 02:10:50.140]   It's our software.
[02:10:50.140 --> 02:10:51.740]   - I mean, I think the thing that would be lost
[02:10:51.740 --> 02:10:53.740]   if we go into software patents was all those lovely
[02:10:53.740 --> 02:10:55.420]   summer houses that lawyers had.
[02:10:55.420 --> 02:10:56.260]   (laughing)
[02:10:56.260 --> 02:10:58.220]   But other than that, I can't think of anything practical.
[02:10:58.220 --> 02:10:59.060]   - That would be great.
[02:10:59.060 --> 02:11:00.420]   - Then talking would go through a recession.
[02:11:00.420 --> 02:11:01.260]   - That would be very sad.
[02:11:01.260 --> 02:11:02.260]   - The world would be out of business.
[02:11:02.260 --> 02:11:03.340]   - It would be over.
[02:11:03.340 --> 02:11:06.620]   - FDC wants to put a ban on fake reviews.
[02:11:06.620 --> 02:11:07.460]   - Good.
[02:11:07.460 --> 02:11:09.820]   - Yeah, about how I would love this.
[02:11:09.820 --> 02:11:11.060]   I think it's great.
[02:11:11.060 --> 02:11:13.980]   I have no confidence that they'll be able to enforce this.
[02:11:13.980 --> 02:11:14.820]   - Yeah.
[02:11:14.820 --> 02:11:17.260]   - In terms of a new rule, it's proposed by the FDC.
[02:11:17.260 --> 02:11:20.060]   They have to go through a comment period and so forth.
[02:11:20.060 --> 02:11:23.740]   Businesses would face fines for buying fake reviews.
[02:11:23.740 --> 02:11:26.740]   $50,000, not for each review,
[02:11:26.740 --> 02:11:28.700]   but for each time a customer sees one.
[02:11:28.700 --> 02:11:29.540]   (laughing)
[02:11:29.540 --> 02:11:31.540]   - Oh, they could add a fast.
[02:11:31.540 --> 02:11:36.380]   - Lawyers be coming through the Amazon reviews.
[02:11:36.380 --> 02:11:38.620]   - They would not just punish the companies
[02:11:38.620 --> 02:11:39.660]   that use the fake reviews,
[02:11:39.660 --> 02:11:42.300]   but also the brokers that sell them,
[02:11:42.300 --> 02:11:43.860]   that falsify the feedback.
[02:11:43.860 --> 02:11:44.700]   There's a lot of companies.
[02:11:44.700 --> 02:11:46.900]   - The company influences that make them as well.
[02:11:46.900 --> 02:11:48.460]   - Well, but there are companies that buy
[02:11:48.460 --> 02:11:50.820]   and sell fake reviews,
[02:11:50.820 --> 02:11:52.980]   as well as those that buy or sell fake followers
[02:11:52.980 --> 02:11:54.220]   or views on social media.
[02:11:54.220 --> 02:11:55.140]   And yeah, there's plenty of influence.
[02:11:55.140 --> 02:11:57.220]   - No, I've had office in my Reddit account.
[02:11:57.220 --> 02:11:58.700]   All the time I get offers.
[02:11:58.700 --> 02:11:59.540]   - Yeah.
[02:11:59.540 --> 02:12:00.380]   - All the time.
[02:12:00.380 --> 02:12:03.980]   A ban on insider reviews and testimonials
[02:12:03.980 --> 02:12:05.980]   prohibiting a company from posting reviews
[02:12:05.980 --> 02:12:07.500]   from their employees.
[02:12:07.500 --> 02:12:08.340]   (laughing)
[02:12:08.340 --> 02:12:09.340]   - Managers.
[02:12:09.340 --> 02:12:12.500]   - Or relatives without proper disclosure.
[02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:15.220]   It also addresses review hijacking.
[02:12:15.220 --> 02:12:17.220]   This is new to me.
[02:12:17.220 --> 02:12:19.500]   The practice involves repurposing reviews
[02:12:19.500 --> 02:12:21.500]   from other products.
[02:12:21.500 --> 02:12:23.060]   Well, this happens on Amazon.
[02:12:23.060 --> 02:12:26.420]   You'll put out a product and then get good reviews for it
[02:12:26.420 --> 02:12:29.420]   and then lump that in with others of your products
[02:12:29.420 --> 02:12:31.340]   that don't get such good reviews.
[02:12:31.340 --> 02:12:33.060]   So you have to sometimes really pay attention.
[02:12:33.060 --> 02:12:34.100]   You'll see a review on Amazon
[02:12:34.100 --> 02:12:36.700]   that doesn't apply to the product you're looking at.
[02:12:36.700 --> 02:12:38.260]   That's review hijacking.
[02:12:38.260 --> 02:12:40.780]   Well, we'll see.
[02:12:40.780 --> 02:12:43.340]   There is going to be a comment period.
[02:12:43.340 --> 02:12:46.300]   I think Google, Facebook, Amazon,
[02:12:46.300 --> 02:12:48.620]   Yelp all hate fake reviews, right?
[02:12:48.620 --> 02:12:49.980]   - We all hate fake reviews.
[02:12:49.980 --> 02:12:52.660]   But again, how are you going to stop it?
[02:12:52.660 --> 02:12:55.220]   And the real issue is generative AI
[02:12:55.220 --> 02:12:57.820]   can create fake reviews at lightning speed.
[02:12:57.820 --> 02:12:58.660]   - Oh, no.
[02:12:58.660 --> 02:12:59.500]   This is the problem.
[02:12:59.500 --> 02:13:01.780]   I mean, you thought Google was bad now
[02:13:01.780 --> 02:13:04.780]   waiting till SEO featured AI written stuff
[02:13:04.780 --> 02:13:07.860]   is just spammed out across content farms.
[02:13:07.860 --> 02:13:10.300]   It's going to be a nightmare.
[02:13:10.300 --> 02:13:13.100]   - I will write you a fake review of this week in tech
[02:13:13.100 --> 02:13:14.860]   for only $5, Leo.
[02:13:14.860 --> 02:13:16.180]   - Thank you.
[02:13:16.180 --> 02:13:17.020]   (laughing)
[02:13:17.020 --> 02:13:17.860]   - But you're right.
[02:13:17.860 --> 02:13:18.860]   How do I get busted then?
[02:13:18.860 --> 02:13:20.340]   Well, fortunately she said it on the air.
[02:13:20.340 --> 02:13:21.180]   She said it on the air.
[02:13:21.180 --> 02:13:23.180]   But I mean, look, if someone is going to say,
[02:13:23.180 --> 02:13:24.740]   hey, you know what?
[02:13:24.740 --> 02:13:26.940]   I would love for you to post a review
[02:13:26.940 --> 02:13:28.780]   because I know you've had a good experience.
[02:13:28.780 --> 02:13:30.860]   And I-- - Is that a fake review?
[02:13:30.860 --> 02:13:31.700]   Is that a fake review?
[02:13:31.700 --> 02:13:32.540]   - No. - No.
[02:13:32.540 --> 02:13:33.380]   - No. - No.
[02:13:33.380 --> 02:13:35.620]   - Or they say no family or friends,
[02:13:35.620 --> 02:13:37.100]   but okay, how far out does that go?
[02:13:37.100 --> 02:13:38.540]   Is it an acquaintance?
[02:13:38.540 --> 02:13:41.060]   - I get emails all the time offering me like 50 bucks
[02:13:41.060 --> 02:13:43.100]   for a good review of this.
[02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:44.700]   - Oh, go. - Or a free product.
[02:13:44.700 --> 02:13:45.540]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:13:45.540 --> 02:13:47.940]   - I mean, I did a quick experiment.
[02:13:47.940 --> 02:13:50.300]   I've been away for about 10 days, whole of that.
[02:13:50.300 --> 02:13:53.060]   And did a quick experiment and started monitoring my inbox
[02:13:53.060 --> 02:13:54.900]   with the out-of-office things.
[02:13:54.900 --> 02:13:59.660]   I-- over a 10-day period, I got, I think, about 17 emails
[02:13:59.660 --> 02:14:02.900]   offering to pay for it to stick stuff on the side.
[02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:07.860]   I also got only one PO, who actually read my out-of-office email
[02:14:07.860 --> 02:14:09.460]   'cause I put a line in there saying,
[02:14:09.460 --> 02:14:11.700]   just to check if everyone's reading this,
[02:14:11.700 --> 02:14:13.820]   what is the SP velocity then unladen swallow?
[02:14:13.820 --> 02:14:14.660]   (laughing)
[02:14:14.660 --> 02:14:17.380]   And only one person actually replied
[02:14:17.380 --> 02:14:20.180]   with African or European five people replied
[02:14:20.180 --> 02:14:22.060]   with repeating pictures over the holiday thing.
[02:14:22.060 --> 02:14:24.300]   (laughing)
[02:14:24.300 --> 02:14:26.380]   - I forgot there's one other Supreme Court decision
[02:14:26.380 --> 02:14:29.860]   which actually is, I put this in 'cause of you Brianna,
[02:14:29.860 --> 02:14:31.060]   you've been cyber-stalked.
[02:14:31.060 --> 02:14:33.380]   - Little bit, little bit, little bit.
[02:14:33.380 --> 02:14:35.460]   - Actually, I have as well, who hasn't.
[02:14:35.460 --> 02:14:36.300]   - Your wife has.
[02:14:36.300 --> 02:14:38.940]   - Anybody in public, in the public eye these days,
[02:14:38.940 --> 02:14:43.060]   the Supreme Court in a seven to two decision
[02:14:43.060 --> 02:14:46.300]   ruled that if you're gonna accuse somebody of cyber-stalking,
[02:14:46.300 --> 02:14:48.940]   you have to consider whether they knew
[02:14:48.940 --> 02:14:50.860]   what they were saying was a threat.
[02:14:50.860 --> 02:14:52.260]   - Not what you just felt.
[02:14:52.260 --> 02:14:54.860]   - Horrible because crazy people don't know.
[02:14:54.860 --> 02:14:55.700]   - Yeah.
[02:14:55.700 --> 02:14:56.940]   - That's why that craze.
[02:14:56.940 --> 02:15:00.300]   - Yeah, the case was countermen versus Colorado.
[02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:03.540]   A guy who was convicted, Colorado has an anti-stalking law.
[02:15:03.540 --> 02:15:06.220]   After he sent a barrage of threatening Facebook messages
[02:15:06.220 --> 02:15:08.460]   to a woman on Facebook that he'd never met.
[02:15:08.460 --> 02:15:09.820]   - Yeah.
[02:15:09.820 --> 02:15:12.580]   - The Colorado law just said, hey,
[02:15:12.580 --> 02:15:17.100]   if the recipient of the messages is,
[02:15:17.100 --> 02:15:19.860]   or any reasonable person feels distressed,
[02:15:19.860 --> 02:15:22.660]   that's against the law, they convicted him,
[02:15:22.660 --> 02:15:25.580]   countermen appealed, arguing his statements
[02:15:25.580 --> 02:15:27.380]   were protected by the First Amendment
[02:15:27.380 --> 02:15:30.340]   and did not constitute true threats.
[02:15:30.340 --> 02:15:33.180]   So true threats are outside the First Amendment.
[02:15:33.180 --> 02:15:35.540]   So in fact, by the way, stalkers know this.
[02:15:35.540 --> 02:15:38.900]   If they said, I'm gonna strangle you tomorrow,
[02:15:38.900 --> 02:15:41.460]   I can go after them, that's a true threat
[02:15:41.460 --> 02:15:42.740]   of bodily harm, right?
[02:15:42.740 --> 02:15:44.020]   You know, there's some, sure you've talked
[02:15:44.020 --> 02:15:46.980]   to the police department, and then they'll go after them.
[02:15:46.980 --> 02:15:49.900]   But if you say, you should be strangled,
[02:15:49.900 --> 02:15:52.620]   or here's your home address,
[02:15:52.620 --> 02:15:55.540]   it'd be a shame if somebody were to cause some harm.
[02:15:55.540 --> 02:15:56.700]   - Yeah.
[02:15:56.700 --> 02:15:58.100]   - Is that a true threat?
[02:15:58.100 --> 02:16:01.580]   So countermen said that wasn't my intention
[02:16:01.580 --> 02:16:03.060]   to threaten the person.
[02:16:03.060 --> 02:16:04.460]   (laughing)
[02:16:04.460 --> 02:16:06.140]   Supreme Court agreed.
[02:16:06.140 --> 02:16:06.980]   - Yeah.
[02:16:06.980 --> 02:16:09.260]   - This is the majority opinion.
[02:16:09.260 --> 02:16:11.780]   Justice Elena Kagan wrote,
[02:16:11.780 --> 02:16:13.820]   "The state prosecuted countermen in accordance
[02:16:13.820 --> 02:16:15.380]   with an objective standard,
[02:16:15.380 --> 02:16:17.740]   and did not have to show any awareness
[02:16:17.740 --> 02:16:19.700]   on countermen's part of his statements,
[02:16:19.700 --> 02:16:21.540]   threatening character.
[02:16:21.540 --> 02:16:24.620]   That is a violation of the First Amendment."
[02:16:24.620 --> 02:16:27.380]   So if a nut job doesn't know
[02:16:27.380 --> 02:16:29.380]   that a chainsaw would dismember you,
[02:16:29.380 --> 02:16:31.780]   they're off the hook!
[02:16:31.780 --> 02:16:32.780]   - Yeah.
[02:16:32.780 --> 02:16:34.300]   - The problem is, how do you know?
[02:16:34.300 --> 02:16:36.020]   How can you prove the intent?
[02:16:36.020 --> 02:16:39.380]   - I've gotta say, I do find, I do wonder what would happen
[02:16:39.380 --> 02:16:41.020]   if this case involved somebody say,
[02:16:41.020 --> 02:16:42.980]   I don't know, doxing a Supreme Court member
[02:16:42.980 --> 02:16:44.020]   of members of their family.
[02:16:44.020 --> 02:16:44.860]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:16:44.860 --> 02:16:48.180]   - And actually, the only dissent came from Amy Comey Barrett
[02:16:48.180 --> 02:16:50.420]   and Clarence Thomas, both of whom I'm sure have
[02:16:50.420 --> 02:16:52.780]   but have had people at their front door,
[02:16:52.780 --> 02:16:57.140]   they agreed that the impact on victims of harassment
[02:16:57.140 --> 02:16:59.860]   and stalking could be severe.
[02:16:59.860 --> 02:17:02.180]   - The abuser in charge of the process,
[02:17:02.180 --> 02:17:03.020]   just like that.
[02:17:03.020 --> 02:17:05.540]   - I don't understand you and didn't believe the doing this.
[02:17:05.540 --> 02:17:07.220]   - This is the opposite of Stand Your Ground.
[02:17:07.220 --> 02:17:08.860]   All the Stand Your Ground laws are saying,
[02:17:08.860 --> 02:17:11.340]   "If you feel a threat, you feel a threat."
[02:17:11.340 --> 02:17:12.180]   - You kill someone.
[02:17:12.180 --> 02:17:14.380]   - This is now saying, it doesn't matter about you,
[02:17:14.380 --> 02:17:15.740]   it's what do they intend to do?
[02:17:15.740 --> 02:17:17.700]   So you should say, "Come to Florida and meet me."
[02:17:17.700 --> 02:17:18.780]   Right?
[02:17:18.780 --> 02:17:19.900]   We'll have a conversation.
[02:17:19.900 --> 02:17:21.220]   - You're both in the right now, great.
[02:17:21.220 --> 02:17:22.940]   - I would say, and I think you'll agree,
[02:17:22.940 --> 02:17:24.620]   but I won't put words in your mouth.
[02:17:24.620 --> 02:17:28.780]   Certainly, most of the threats I see are spreous.
[02:17:28.780 --> 02:17:30.820]   Like the person's trying to scare you.
[02:17:30.820 --> 02:17:32.380]   But isn't really intending.
[02:17:32.380 --> 02:17:35.460]   We have had those, somebody came to Lisa's front door.
[02:17:35.460 --> 02:17:36.300]   - Yeah.
[02:17:36.300 --> 02:17:39.100]   - I mean, person was obviously mentally ill,
[02:17:39.100 --> 02:17:41.700]   but that's who you're worried about, right?
[02:17:41.700 --> 02:17:43.020]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:17:43.020 --> 02:17:45.220]   - So, I think that was to anyone on the palate.
[02:17:45.220 --> 02:17:48.660]   - I think, look, this is a very nuanced, difficult thing.
[02:17:48.660 --> 02:17:51.260]   And let's not pretend it's not difficult to balance.
[02:17:51.260 --> 02:17:53.340]   Freedom of speech, which we all believe in,
[02:17:53.340 --> 02:17:58.260]   with the right to basically exist in America
[02:17:58.260 --> 02:18:01.020]   without these kinds of threats coming to your door.
[02:18:01.020 --> 02:18:05.460]   That said, you know, Mary Ann Franks is a good friend of mine.
[02:18:05.460 --> 02:18:07.300]   She's quoted in this piece.
[02:18:07.300 --> 02:18:09.060]   I really trust her judgment on that.
[02:18:09.060 --> 02:18:11.820]   She's worked in this space for a really long time.
[02:18:11.820 --> 02:18:13.620]   And something she talks about a lot
[02:18:13.620 --> 02:18:17.140]   is the people that do this have gotten very, very good
[02:18:17.140 --> 02:18:18.140]   at wrapping their comments up.
[02:18:18.140 --> 02:18:19.500]   - They know exactly how.
[02:18:19.500 --> 02:18:21.660]   - In that little layer of irony.
[02:18:21.660 --> 02:18:22.900]   So it makes you scared.
[02:18:22.900 --> 02:18:24.340]   It gets the message across,
[02:18:24.340 --> 02:18:28.100]   but it's just plausible enough for them to have deniability.
[02:18:28.100 --> 02:18:28.940]   - It's with them off.
[02:18:28.940 --> 02:18:29.780]   - She's done for years.
[02:18:29.780 --> 02:18:31.300]   It would be a shame.
[02:18:31.300 --> 02:18:34.100]   For some reason you're from window wood, it get broken.
[02:18:34.100 --> 02:18:34.940]   - Yeah.
[02:18:34.940 --> 02:18:37.060]   - The other thing I would say is,
[02:18:37.060 --> 02:18:39.340]   I'll just tell a very quick story.
[02:18:39.340 --> 02:18:41.500]   Back during the height of game arcade,
[02:18:41.500 --> 02:18:44.580]   I gave a talk at a college and this kid raises his hand
[02:18:44.580 --> 02:18:46.740]   and identifies himself as a gamer gator
[02:18:46.740 --> 02:18:51.460]   and makes an obnoxious comment to a room full of 300 people.
[02:18:51.460 --> 02:18:52.740]   Whatever, I handled him.
[02:18:52.740 --> 02:18:53.580]   I'm a pro.
[02:18:53.580 --> 02:18:54.420]   It doesn't bother me.
[02:18:54.420 --> 02:18:57.140]   This is why this is important.
[02:18:57.140 --> 02:19:01.580]   After this, it was like 11 o'clock at night.
[02:19:01.580 --> 02:19:04.780]   And I'm there with a female member of the faculty
[02:19:04.780 --> 02:19:08.180]   that invited me to speak at this college.
[02:19:08.180 --> 02:19:11.820]   And this kid who is, you know, like,
[02:19:11.820 --> 02:19:14.940]   he's following us to our car.
[02:19:14.940 --> 02:19:15.780]   - Oh my gosh.
[02:19:15.780 --> 02:19:17.140]   - Just going and being like,
[02:19:17.140 --> 02:19:18.980]   gamer get this, gamer get that.
[02:19:18.980 --> 02:19:21.340]   Y'all don't understand and being so aggressive.
[02:19:21.340 --> 02:19:24.020]   And this kid, I don't think he was a bad person.
[02:19:24.020 --> 02:19:28.940]   My point is he had no understanding
[02:19:28.940 --> 02:19:33.740]   that following two women to their car at 11 o'clock at night
[02:19:33.740 --> 02:19:36.900]   was something that made us extremely uncomfortable.
[02:19:36.900 --> 02:19:38.060]   - It was just free speech.
[02:19:38.060 --> 02:19:41.540]   It was him trying to get his opinion out there.
[02:19:41.540 --> 02:19:43.420]   So by that standard, you know,
[02:19:43.420 --> 02:19:46.300]   he didn't know that what he was doing was threatening.
[02:19:46.300 --> 02:19:48.540]   And I think that's a lot of these people
[02:19:48.540 --> 02:19:49.940]   that are a little bit unhinged.
[02:19:49.940 --> 02:19:52.420]   I think they are truly tuned out
[02:19:52.420 --> 02:19:53.980]   from what the consequences are
[02:19:53.980 --> 02:19:56.460]   of how their behavior affects others.
[02:19:56.460 --> 02:19:57.300]   - Difficult.
[02:19:57.300 --> 02:19:58.140]   It's very difficult.
[02:19:58.140 --> 02:19:59.380]   - It is difficult.
[02:19:59.380 --> 02:20:03.260]   And of course, in this case, probably
[02:20:03.260 --> 02:20:05.500]   there wasn't cause for prosecution.
[02:20:05.500 --> 02:20:07.180]   - Exactly. - Exactly.
[02:20:07.180 --> 02:20:09.740]   - Even though it is absolutely threatening and terrifying.
[02:20:09.740 --> 02:20:11.220]   - It was uncomfortable.
[02:20:11.220 --> 02:20:13.700]   But if you're looking in intent,
[02:20:13.700 --> 02:20:15.980]   that's just, it's not a perfect way
[02:20:15.980 --> 02:20:17.780]   to look at this situation in my hands.
[02:20:17.780 --> 02:20:18.620]   - Would you do that?
[02:20:18.620 --> 02:20:21.020]   - Because there is no good way to look at intent.
[02:20:21.020 --> 02:20:21.860]   - Right, right.
[02:20:21.860 --> 02:20:23.540]   - You have no visibility into someone's
[02:20:23.540 --> 02:20:25.300]   stream of mind when they did what they did.
[02:20:25.300 --> 02:20:26.140]   - Yeah, right.
[02:20:26.140 --> 02:20:28.900]   - Unfortunately, I mean, as it turns out,
[02:20:28.900 --> 02:20:31.340]   all too tragically in too many of these cases,
[02:20:31.340 --> 02:20:33.420]   the police only decide to act when somebody gets
[02:20:33.420 --> 02:20:38.220]   into the kill and it's how you balance that.
[02:20:38.220 --> 02:20:39.300]   I don't know, this is probably why
[02:20:39.300 --> 02:20:40.540]   we're not a Supreme Court judge.
[02:20:40.540 --> 02:20:42.780]   - Well, but that was the incentive.
[02:20:42.780 --> 02:20:43.700]   - I had to take the incentive right that up.
[02:20:43.700 --> 02:20:46.940]   This is problematic for restraining orders
[02:20:46.940 --> 02:20:49.740]   and domestic violence cases.
[02:20:49.740 --> 02:20:52.380]   But they're getting far too smart about it.
[02:20:52.380 --> 02:20:54.460]   - If my intent is just to scare you,
[02:20:54.460 --> 02:20:57.060]   is that sufficient to prosecute?
[02:20:57.060 --> 02:20:57.980]   - I don't know.
[02:20:57.980 --> 02:20:59.820]   - It shouldn't be allowed.
[02:20:59.820 --> 02:21:01.380]   - It's kind of like if you deliberately
[02:21:01.380 --> 02:21:03.900]   set out to scare someone walking down the street,
[02:21:03.900 --> 02:21:06.180]   you think, right, I'm gonna jump out
[02:21:06.180 --> 02:21:07.460]   with a mask on the scatheme,
[02:21:07.460 --> 02:21:09.220]   or I'm gonna jump out with a carving knife
[02:21:09.220 --> 02:21:10.580]   and I may or may not start to die.
[02:21:10.580 --> 02:21:11.620]   - That's the problem.
[02:21:11.620 --> 02:21:12.780]   - And then it's too late.
[02:21:12.780 --> 02:21:15.340]   - Once you find out what you really did is,
[02:21:15.340 --> 02:21:17.660]   unfortunately we found out and it's too late.
[02:21:17.660 --> 02:21:19.220]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:21:19.220 --> 02:21:20.940]   - Final Supreme Court stories,
[02:21:20.940 --> 02:21:23.380]   Supreme Court gave Google a victory.
[02:21:23.380 --> 02:21:25.500]   You may remember Rap Genius, the website,
[02:21:25.500 --> 02:21:29.340]   the lyric website, Genius did a clever thing
[02:21:29.340 --> 02:21:32.740]   with its lyrics, they buried an Easter egg in there, right?
[02:21:32.740 --> 02:21:34.260]   And they found the Google search results
[02:21:34.260 --> 02:21:36.580]   reproduce these three exactly.
[02:21:36.580 --> 02:21:37.400]   I can't, wasn't it?
[02:21:37.400 --> 02:21:39.740]   It was kind of funny, like you stole this lyric
[02:21:39.740 --> 02:21:40.580]   or something like that.
[02:21:40.580 --> 02:21:41.900]   - It's like what the Academy Awards does
[02:21:41.900 --> 02:21:43.140]   with their screeners.
[02:21:43.140 --> 02:21:46.420]   Just put something that identifies where it came from
[02:21:46.420 --> 02:21:47.620]   and who took it.
[02:21:47.620 --> 02:21:51.180]   - Basically they use different Unicode prefixes
[02:21:51.180 --> 02:21:55.060]   for different apostropies, but it was a beautiful case
[02:21:55.060 --> 02:21:58.860]   in that regard, but it fell down on one simple fact.
[02:21:58.860 --> 02:22:00.620]   The lyric company didn't have the rights
[02:22:00.620 --> 02:22:02.060]   to the lyrics in the first place.
[02:22:02.060 --> 02:22:03.540]   - Exactly. - Yeah.
[02:22:03.540 --> 02:22:06.260]   - You cannot be upset if someone steals something
[02:22:06.260 --> 02:22:07.500]   that you stole. - Yeah.
[02:22:07.500 --> 02:22:09.580]   - Well, look at Apple and Steve Jobs,
[02:22:09.580 --> 02:22:12.060]   but no, it came to Gooey, but yes.
[02:22:12.060 --> 02:22:14.020]   - I think that's the theme
[02:22:14.020 --> 02:22:15.860]   of the new Indiana Jones movie I would say.
[02:22:15.860 --> 02:22:17.540]   (laughing)
[02:22:17.540 --> 02:22:20.500]   - So here's the, here's the watermark.
[02:22:20.500 --> 02:22:24.580]   It was in the punctuation.
[02:22:24.580 --> 02:22:25.420]   - I love this one.
[02:22:25.420 --> 02:22:30.060]   - Of the lyrics from a song by Alessia Cara, not today.
[02:22:30.060 --> 02:22:34.500]   Google has been secretly watermarking lyrics
[02:22:34.500 --> 02:22:37.060]   on its website with patterns of apostropies.
[02:22:37.060 --> 02:22:40.780]   Oh, okay, which can alternate between straight
[02:22:40.780 --> 02:22:42.980]   and curly single quote marks.
[02:22:42.980 --> 02:22:44.500]   The watermark lyrics surfaced
[02:22:44.500 --> 02:22:47.660]   on Google's information patterns, panels.
[02:22:47.660 --> 02:22:52.340]   So, which often appears the first result
[02:22:52.340 --> 02:22:53.180]   when you look up a song.
[02:22:53.180 --> 02:22:54.980]   Google even, or genius even went so far
[02:22:54.980 --> 02:22:58.740]   as to make the punctuation marks spell the word
[02:22:58.740 --> 02:23:01.140]   red-handed in Morse code.
[02:23:01.140 --> 02:23:02.620]   - Oh my goodness. - Let me see.
[02:23:02.620 --> 02:23:03.820]   - Okay, that's just kinda cute.
[02:23:03.820 --> 02:23:06.460]   - That's just cute. - I mean, it was a beautiful case.
[02:23:06.460 --> 02:23:08.020]   - This is smart, the smart apostrophe
[02:23:08.020 --> 02:23:10.900]   versus the straight apostrophe, right?
[02:23:10.900 --> 02:23:15.220]   And by alternating straight and smart
[02:23:15.220 --> 02:23:19.220]   to spell Morse in the Morse code dots and dashes,
[02:23:19.220 --> 02:23:22.220]   Google did the same exact alternation
[02:23:22.220 --> 02:23:25.500]   of the straight and curly quotes.
[02:23:25.500 --> 02:23:28.500]   So, yeah, Google copied it, like cut and pasted it.
[02:23:28.500 --> 02:23:32.580]   - Yeah. - And it spelled out red-handed.
[02:23:32.580 --> 02:23:34.780]   - Well, - It was a righteous bust.
[02:23:34.780 --> 02:23:38.180]   - The other shoe dropped, and yes, turns out,
[02:23:38.180 --> 02:23:40.180]   the actual copyright holders are the publishers
[02:23:40.180 --> 02:23:41.460]   and the authors of the music,
[02:23:41.460 --> 02:23:43.380]   and rap genius didn't pay them either.
[02:23:43.380 --> 02:23:45.120]   - Yeah. - Whoops.
[02:23:45.120 --> 02:23:48.980]   - Wow. - Wow, wow.
[02:23:48.980 --> 02:23:51.100]   - Yeah, they-- - It's a little more settled
[02:23:51.100 --> 02:23:52.540]   than this, but we don't have to worry about settling.
[02:23:52.540 --> 02:23:54.220]   This is not the place for settling.
[02:23:54.220 --> 02:23:55.580]   Let's take a little break,
[02:23:55.580 --> 02:23:58.540]   and when we come back, final thoughts, final stories,
[02:23:58.540 --> 02:24:01.060]   we'll try to wrap this up in under three hours.
[02:24:01.060 --> 02:24:03.940]   'Cause we got-- - That ship has sailed.
[02:24:03.940 --> 02:24:09.300]   - See, the non-twit premium-- - Oh, yeah, that one's already.
[02:24:09.300 --> 02:24:10.860]   - They don't realize that this show
[02:24:10.860 --> 02:24:12.660]   actually started an hour before it started.
[02:24:12.660 --> 02:24:14.900]   - That's, yeah. - It did, actually, literally.
[02:24:14.900 --> 02:24:15.740]   - Honestly, part of the way,
[02:24:15.740 --> 02:24:17.700]   I thought the lap dancing class was a bit much.
[02:24:17.700 --> 02:24:19.380]   - But, you know, it was a prompt too.
[02:24:19.380 --> 02:24:22.420]   - You put a pole just for you, I mean.
[02:24:22.420 --> 02:24:25.180]   - Yeah, you know, I do smell like cocoa butter now.
[02:24:25.180 --> 02:24:26.460]   (laughing)
[02:24:26.460 --> 02:24:28.460]   And you still have, wait a minute, a little glitter on--
[02:24:28.460 --> 02:24:30.860]   - Cocoa butter. - Cocoa butter and brasso.
[02:24:30.860 --> 02:24:33.540]   - Look, I'm sorry I could only get fives, not fives.
[02:24:33.540 --> 02:24:34.980]   (laughing)
[02:24:34.980 --> 02:24:37.340]   - No, you know, your coins, those are so uncomfortable.
[02:24:37.340 --> 02:24:39.260]   - Oh. - Oh.
[02:24:39.260 --> 02:24:41.820]   - Yes, reach the places other coins can't accept.
[02:24:41.820 --> 02:24:42.660]   (laughing)
[02:24:42.660 --> 02:24:43.820]   - I'm just gonna drink this.
[02:24:43.820 --> 02:24:45.060]   (laughing)
[02:24:45.060 --> 02:24:46.860]   - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.
[02:24:46.860 --> 02:24:48.380]   - It's like they prepared this.
[02:24:48.380 --> 02:24:51.780]   It's like, well too well oiled this machine, so to speak.
[02:24:51.780 --> 02:24:54.220]   - Pund definitely attended this. - Oh no.
[02:24:54.220 --> 02:24:56.620]   - Our show that they brought to you by,
[02:24:56.620 --> 02:24:59.460]   collide, K-O-L-I-D, collide.
[02:24:59.460 --> 02:25:02.620]   I love these guys, it's a device trust solution
[02:25:02.620 --> 02:25:05.580]   for companies with Octa that ensures
[02:25:05.580 --> 02:25:08.460]   that if a device is not trusted, it's not secure,
[02:25:08.460 --> 02:25:10.980]   it can't log into your cloud apps.
[02:25:10.980 --> 02:25:13.260]   If you work in security or IT and your company
[02:25:13.260 --> 02:25:15.900]   has Octa, this message is for you.
[02:25:15.900 --> 02:25:17.820]   Have you noticed that for the past few years,
[02:25:17.820 --> 02:25:21.060]   the majority of data breaches and hacks you read about
[02:25:21.060 --> 02:25:24.500]   have one thing in common, it's the employees.
[02:25:24.500 --> 02:25:25.980]   That's the weak spot.
[02:25:25.980 --> 02:25:29.620]   Sometimes an employee's device gets hacked,
[02:25:29.620 --> 02:25:33.060]   maybe unpached software, a copy of,
[02:25:33.060 --> 02:25:34.820]   oh I don't know, Plex that hasn't been patched
[02:25:34.820 --> 02:25:36.060]   in a few years.
[02:25:36.060 --> 02:25:38.540]   Sometimes an employee leaves sensitive data
[02:25:38.540 --> 02:25:41.740]   in an insecure place, like the downloads folder.
[02:25:41.740 --> 02:25:44.020]   And it seems like every day a hacker breaks in using
[02:25:44.020 --> 02:25:47.260]   credentials, they fished from an employee.
[02:25:47.260 --> 02:25:50.700]   The problem here isn't though, it's not your end users.
[02:25:50.700 --> 02:25:54.060]   It's the solutions you use to prevent those breaches,
[02:25:54.060 --> 02:25:56.020]   but it doesn't have to be this way.
[02:25:56.020 --> 02:25:58.180]   Imagine a world where only secure devices
[02:25:58.180 --> 02:26:01.700]   can access your cloud apps, devices where the software
[02:26:01.700 --> 02:26:03.980]   has been patched, the credentials aren't sitting
[02:26:03.980 --> 02:26:06.060]   in an insecure place.
[02:26:06.060 --> 02:26:09.340]   In this world, fished credentials useless to hackers,
[02:26:09.340 --> 02:26:11.460]   and you can manage every operating system,
[02:26:11.460 --> 02:26:14.300]   including Linux, all from one dashboard.
[02:26:14.300 --> 02:26:17.460]   Best of all, you get your employees to fix
[02:26:17.460 --> 02:26:20.260]   their own device security issues, which means
[02:26:20.260 --> 02:26:21.980]   less work for your IT team.
[02:26:21.980 --> 02:26:24.820]   The good news is you don't have to imagine this world.
[02:26:24.820 --> 02:26:27.300]   You could just start using Collide.
[02:26:27.300 --> 02:26:32.220]   Visit kolide.com/twit to book an on demand demo.
[02:26:32.220 --> 02:26:34.420]   Today's the how it works for yourself.
[02:26:34.420 --> 02:26:38.860]   That's Collide, kolide.com/twit.
[02:26:38.860 --> 02:26:41.340]   We thank you so much for their support.
[02:26:41.340 --> 02:26:44.900]   Of our show, what a fun week it was this week on Twit.
[02:26:44.900 --> 02:26:49.420]   We have prepared this small video for your enjoyment watch.
[02:26:49.420 --> 02:26:52.260]   - I just wanna make it clear, every Mac break weekly
[02:26:52.260 --> 02:26:54.940]   is recorded on Taco Tuesday.
[02:26:54.940 --> 02:26:56.020]   - Be careful. - Thank you for every time.
[02:26:56.020 --> 02:26:57.540]   - When you use the phrase, "Taco Tuesday,"
[02:26:57.540 --> 02:26:59.420]   somebody owns that.
[02:26:59.420 --> 02:27:01.820]   Taco Bell filed a petition with a USPTO
[02:27:01.820 --> 02:27:06.820]   to cancel the trademark owned by Taco Johns for 34 years.
[02:27:06.820 --> 02:27:07.660]   - Good for them.
[02:27:07.660 --> 02:27:10.100]   - Because Taco Bell claims that commonly used phrase
[02:27:10.100 --> 02:27:12.820]   should be freely available to all who make,
[02:27:12.820 --> 02:27:15.300]   sell, eat, and celebrate tacos.
[02:27:15.300 --> 02:27:20.220]   The Defense of Tacos Act, sponsored by Taco Bell
[02:27:20.220 --> 02:27:21.060]   and Doritos.
[02:27:21.060 --> 02:27:22.900]   - That's the marketing plan here.
[02:27:22.900 --> 02:27:26.420]   - Previously on Twit, Club Twit exclusive.
[02:27:26.420 --> 02:27:29.260]   - I'm gonna do my best and try not to fan board today
[02:27:29.260 --> 02:27:33.500]   because I'm joined by New York Times best-selling author,
[02:27:33.500 --> 02:27:34.740]   Mr. Hugh Howie.
[02:27:34.740 --> 02:27:36.940]   You may have heard of him here recently
[02:27:36.940 --> 02:27:40.380]   because there's been a TV show that's been just,
[02:27:40.380 --> 02:27:42.900]   you know, getting a little bit of a silo.
[02:27:42.900 --> 02:27:44.740]   - The funny thing is, you're talking about all these changes,
[02:27:44.740 --> 02:27:47.340]   I was in the room coming up with wild ideas
[02:27:47.340 --> 02:27:50.060]   and Graham was always like ripping me back in.
[02:27:50.060 --> 02:27:52.380]   He was like, "Yeah, let's stick to the books."
[02:27:52.380 --> 02:27:53.380]   - Hands on tech.
[02:27:53.380 --> 02:27:54.540]   - Yes, we're back, baby.
[02:27:54.540 --> 02:27:55.860]   And we're gonna start with the review
[02:27:55.860 --> 02:27:59.220]   of the new Pixel tablets from Google.
[02:27:59.220 --> 02:28:00.660]   - Windows Weekly.
[02:28:00.660 --> 02:28:01.500]   - Yeah. - I'll tell you,
[02:28:01.500 --> 02:28:02.860]   whatever comes out of this,
[02:28:02.860 --> 02:28:05.420]   like if the FTC wins or the FTC loses,
[02:28:05.420 --> 02:28:08.060]   Microsoft buys Activision Blizzard and it doesn't,
[02:28:08.060 --> 02:28:09.620]   I don't think anyone's going after Sony.
[02:28:09.620 --> 02:28:11.140]   - That's one of the conclusions I drew
[02:28:11.140 --> 02:28:13.300]   from the four days of testimony so far.
[02:28:13.300 --> 02:28:15.300]   - But is he in Sony as first?
[02:28:15.300 --> 02:28:16.980]   - Yeah, they're first.
[02:28:16.980 --> 02:28:17.820]   Twit.
[02:28:17.820 --> 02:28:21.180]   And why isn't anyone going after them for this behavior?
[02:28:21.180 --> 02:28:22.020]   - Yeah.
[02:28:22.020 --> 02:28:25.460]   - This would be a good time to plug.
[02:28:25.460 --> 02:28:26.620]   - Club Twit, by the way.
[02:28:26.620 --> 02:28:27.620]   - We should do it. - We should do it.
[02:28:27.620 --> 02:28:29.020]   - Club for all you members.
[02:28:29.020 --> 02:28:29.860]   Seven of us. - I've been on that
[02:28:29.860 --> 02:28:30.980]   during the quote.
[02:28:30.980 --> 02:28:31.820]   - Pardon me?
[02:28:31.820 --> 02:28:33.100]   - I've been on that during the show.
[02:28:33.100 --> 02:28:34.260]   - You have? - Yeah.
[02:28:34.260 --> 02:28:35.180]   - I've been in there.
[02:28:35.180 --> 02:28:37.660]   - Yeah, that's the discord they're talking about.
[02:28:37.660 --> 02:28:38.580]   That's one of the benefits.
[02:28:38.580 --> 02:28:41.260]   You get to add free versions of all the shows.
[02:28:41.260 --> 02:28:43.620]   You get the discord, which is wonderful.
[02:28:43.620 --> 02:28:46.460]   You get shows we don't put out in public,
[02:28:46.460 --> 02:28:48.780]   including, we did some events on Thursday.
[02:28:48.780 --> 02:28:49.620]   They were amazing.
[02:28:49.620 --> 02:28:52.860]   Stacy's book club, she did the new Annalene Newitz novel,
[02:28:52.860 --> 02:28:53.700]   The Terra Formers.
[02:28:53.700 --> 02:28:54.540]   Have you read that yet?
[02:28:54.540 --> 02:28:55.380]   - Not yet.
[02:28:55.380 --> 02:28:56.620]   - I hear very good things.
[02:28:56.620 --> 02:29:00.700]   She also got, and I know you know this,
[02:29:00.700 --> 02:29:02.340]   Hugh Howey, the author of Wool.
[02:29:02.340 --> 02:29:03.380]   - Oh, yes. - Okay.
[02:29:03.380 --> 02:29:04.220]   - Yeah. - Oh, wow.
[02:29:04.220 --> 02:29:05.300]   - Yes. - That's a good photo.
[02:29:05.300 --> 02:29:08.540]   - Which the silo series is based on.
[02:29:08.540 --> 02:29:10.100]   The aunt did that at one o'clock.
[02:29:10.100 --> 02:29:12.860]   Now that's available on our Twipless Feed,
[02:29:12.860 --> 02:29:14.860]   plus hands on Macintosh with Michael Sargent,
[02:29:14.860 --> 02:29:17.060]   hands on Windows with Paul Therat,
[02:29:17.060 --> 02:29:19.100]   the entitled Linux Show,
[02:29:19.100 --> 02:29:21.180]   Scott Wilkinson's Home Theater Geeks.
[02:29:21.180 --> 02:29:22.660]   We launch shows in the club
[02:29:22.660 --> 02:29:24.860]   because the club members pay for the club,
[02:29:24.860 --> 02:29:28.180]   and they pay for those shows, the show production.
[02:29:28.180 --> 02:29:31.660]   And then with any luck, the show builds an audience,
[02:29:31.660 --> 02:29:33.020]   and like this week in space,
[02:29:33.020 --> 02:29:36.340]   we can release it to the public space.
[02:29:36.340 --> 02:29:38.340]   It's actually been a huge success.
[02:29:38.340 --> 02:29:39.940]   So what are you doing?
[02:29:39.940 --> 02:29:41.900]   You're supporting Twi.
[02:29:41.900 --> 02:29:43.580]   You're helping us do what we do best,
[02:29:43.580 --> 02:29:45.620]   which is create new shows.
[02:29:45.620 --> 02:29:47.340]   You're helping keeping shows on the air
[02:29:47.340 --> 02:29:50.820]   that aren't necessarily getting the advertiser dollars.
[02:29:50.820 --> 02:29:53.020]   I think it's a great way to show your support,
[02:29:53.020 --> 02:29:54.380]   and it's only seven bucks a month.
[02:29:54.380 --> 02:29:56.100]   There's an annual plan, there's a family plan,
[02:29:56.100 --> 02:29:57.860]   there's a corporate plan,
[02:29:57.860 --> 02:29:59.420]   and yet the discord's a lot of fun.
[02:29:59.420 --> 02:30:00.260]   - Yes, it is.
[02:30:00.260 --> 02:30:02.940]   - It's, I think discord is like the future of social.
[02:30:02.940 --> 02:30:03.780]   - Oh, I love Discord.
[02:30:03.780 --> 02:30:06.900]   - It's a smaller communities that people you actually know
[02:30:06.900 --> 02:30:10.700]   who actually understand that if they misbehave, they are gone.
[02:30:10.700 --> 02:30:11.540]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:30:11.540 --> 02:30:14.260]   - Well, if you pay seven bucks to be in a social network,
[02:30:14.260 --> 02:30:16.660]   I think you're gonna be nicer in there, right?
[02:30:16.660 --> 02:30:17.500]   - 100%, 100%.
[02:30:17.500 --> 02:30:19.780]   - And anyway, Twitter people are great people.
[02:30:19.780 --> 02:30:21.020]   Like they're smart.
[02:30:21.020 --> 02:30:22.900]   - Look, just being real with you,
[02:30:22.900 --> 02:30:25.460]   when Twitter people message me in club Twitter,
[02:30:25.460 --> 02:30:27.420]   I will get back to you every single time.
[02:30:27.420 --> 02:30:30.540]   If you're not there, and you're on Discord,
[02:30:30.540 --> 02:30:32.780]   maybe you got the bottom of the pile.
[02:30:32.780 --> 02:30:34.300]   (laughing)
[02:30:34.300 --> 02:30:37.300]   - So anyway, I appreciate all our members.
[02:30:37.300 --> 02:30:39.540]   We love you, we thank you for that,
[02:30:39.540 --> 02:30:42.860]   and I especially thank you new members.
[02:30:42.860 --> 02:30:47.380]   We're all now going to twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:30:47.380 --> 02:30:50.340]   It's a little tough in the podcast world right now.
[02:30:50.340 --> 02:30:53.620]   Stitcher has just shut down.
[02:30:53.620 --> 02:30:55.700]   It's kind of a shock.
[02:30:55.700 --> 02:30:57.980]   We won a Stitcher award some years ago,
[02:30:57.980 --> 02:31:00.740]   I remember for, I can't remember what the category was
[02:31:00.740 --> 02:31:02.460]   by TechPikecast. - TechPikecast.
[02:31:02.460 --> 02:31:04.740]   - Serious exam bottom, and they said,
[02:31:04.740 --> 02:31:08.620]   well, we don't want to run two apps, so bye bye Stitcher.
[02:31:08.620 --> 02:31:09.540]   - Oh my goodness.
[02:31:09.540 --> 02:31:11.420]   - Bye, the competition, shut it down.
[02:31:11.420 --> 02:31:12.620]   - Yeah.
[02:31:12.620 --> 02:31:14.180]   - Yeah, I guess that is kind of like--
[02:31:14.180 --> 02:31:16.140]   - That is kind of like the Bill Gates Simpsons,
[02:31:16.140 --> 02:31:17.460]   buy 'em out, boys.
[02:31:17.460 --> 02:31:20.140]   (laughing)
[02:31:20.140 --> 02:31:23.700]   - Pokemon Go has just laved off 230 employees.
[02:31:23.700 --> 02:31:27.060]   Boy, if there was a game that should be a money maker,
[02:31:27.060 --> 02:31:30.460]   I look at how much money Lisa spends on Pokemon Go.
[02:31:30.460 --> 02:31:32.980]   It even exceeds my Simpsons tapped out.
[02:31:32.980 --> 02:31:33.820]   - Really?
[02:31:33.820 --> 02:31:35.980]   - I think you're still playing that stupid game.
[02:31:35.980 --> 02:31:38.380]   - Since 2016, that's not that stupid.
[02:31:38.380 --> 02:31:40.620]   She asked, you know what's good?
[02:31:40.620 --> 02:31:43.180]   She just looked, it keeps track of your mileage
[02:31:43.180 --> 02:31:45.220]   'cause you have to go out and play the game.
[02:31:45.220 --> 02:31:47.940]   She has literally walked across the country twice.
[02:31:47.940 --> 02:31:52.940]   She has like 11,000 miles of walking since 2016,
[02:31:52.940 --> 02:31:54.180]   and that's not even the total
[02:31:54.180 --> 02:31:56.380]   'cause it only started recently recording it.
[02:31:56.380 --> 02:31:57.900]   - So that's a good benefit.
[02:31:57.900 --> 02:31:59.900]   - I had to stop playing Pokemon Go because my--
[02:31:59.900 --> 02:32:00.740]   - Yeah, you're a big fan.
[02:32:00.740 --> 02:32:02.660]   - So old that keeps crashing it.
[02:32:02.660 --> 02:32:03.740]   - Oh no.
[02:32:03.740 --> 02:32:05.540]   I had an article back.
[02:32:05.540 --> 02:32:08.100]   This is before I got into politics where,
[02:32:08.100 --> 02:32:09.380]   I think it was for Daily Dot,
[02:32:09.380 --> 02:32:12.420]   where I paid someone to show for me around.
[02:32:12.420 --> 02:32:16.740]   So I could play Pokemon Go in Boston
[02:32:16.740 --> 02:32:20.820]   and get the 1% experience, like catching.
[02:32:20.820 --> 02:32:23.580]   Keep you, my specialist, Safari,
[02:32:23.580 --> 02:32:26.860]   and Guide drove me around to all the places.
[02:32:26.860 --> 02:32:27.700]   - That's spherical.
[02:32:27.700 --> 02:32:28.540]   - With the various Pokemon.
[02:32:28.540 --> 02:32:29.380]   It was a great one.
[02:32:29.380 --> 02:32:30.740]   - I'm not gonna get 11,000 miles that way.
[02:32:30.740 --> 02:32:33.500]   - Yeah, you should have been playing it in Rome
[02:32:33.500 --> 02:32:34.340]   because--
[02:32:34.340 --> 02:32:35.180]   - I did actually.
[02:32:35.180 --> 02:32:37.140]   - People are telling me that the portals at St. Peter's
[02:32:37.140 --> 02:32:38.180]   'cause there's like four of them.
[02:32:38.180 --> 02:32:39.020]   - Oh.
[02:32:39.020 --> 02:32:41.300]   - They do, there's a very high percentage
[02:32:41.300 --> 02:32:42.580]   of like legendary spawn.
[02:32:42.580 --> 02:32:43.900]   They send you to heaven.
[02:32:43.900 --> 02:32:45.460]   - This is something like that.
[02:32:45.460 --> 02:32:46.620]   (laughing)
[02:32:46.620 --> 02:32:48.420]   - They added all the new Pokemon,
[02:32:48.420 --> 02:32:50.260]   so I don't even know how many they are now.
[02:32:50.260 --> 02:32:51.100]   - Oh, I have to ask.
[02:32:51.100 --> 02:32:52.900]   - What is the battle like to take over the gym
[02:32:52.900 --> 02:32:53.740]   at the Vatican?
[02:32:53.740 --> 02:32:55.220]   - It's actually-- - That's kind of really--
[02:32:55.220 --> 02:32:58.220]   - The problem is all 1,000 of us who live there
[02:32:58.220 --> 02:32:59.660]   are within range.
[02:32:59.660 --> 02:33:00.500]   So we have all-- - Oh my God,
[02:33:00.500 --> 02:33:01.820]   so you keep immediately in.
[02:33:01.820 --> 02:33:02.660]   - Wow.
[02:33:02.660 --> 02:33:03.500]   - It's a conspiracy.
[02:33:03.500 --> 02:33:06.460]   - What is the-- - So the obelisk?
[02:33:06.460 --> 02:33:08.660]   - The obelisk, the two fountains.
[02:33:08.660 --> 02:33:10.060]   And the front of St. Peter's.
[02:33:10.060 --> 02:33:10.900]   Those are all-- - Wow.
[02:33:10.900 --> 02:33:12.660]   - And then also-- - Who made the font
[02:33:12.660 --> 02:33:13.820]   at St. Peter's?
[02:33:13.820 --> 02:33:15.540]   A Pokemon Go gym. - I know.
[02:33:15.540 --> 02:33:18.140]   Well, for a while, the apartment
[02:33:18.140 --> 02:33:20.700]   that Pope Francis lived was a portal.
[02:33:20.700 --> 02:33:21.540]   - Oh, dear.
[02:33:21.540 --> 02:33:23.380]   - And then it was removed for security.
[02:33:23.380 --> 02:33:24.220]   - They had to discourage that.
[02:33:24.220 --> 02:33:25.220]   - I was gonna say, they don't really want people
[02:33:25.220 --> 02:33:26.220]   going up to this front door.
[02:33:26.220 --> 02:33:27.220]   - Right.
[02:33:27.220 --> 02:33:29.220]   - And it's just-- - Hey, only father!
[02:33:29.220 --> 02:33:31.660]   It's just going after Pikachu.
[02:33:31.660 --> 02:33:32.980]   - Nice to see you. - I'm being fucking--
[02:33:32.980 --> 02:33:35.460]   - I think I'm still the only person on the panel
[02:33:35.460 --> 02:33:38.060]   who has actually played it for more than five minutes.
[02:33:38.060 --> 02:33:39.260]   - You said that in the great, like,
[02:33:39.260 --> 02:33:41.180]   the Pope is walking by behind you.
[02:33:41.180 --> 02:33:42.020]   - Yeah.
[02:33:42.020 --> 02:33:44.700]   - And they're in a battle trying to get your edges down.
[02:33:44.700 --> 02:33:46.620]   - Hey, I'm trying to--
[02:33:46.620 --> 02:33:48.140]   - He's a little bit of a gamer.
[02:33:48.140 --> 02:33:49.140]   - He's a little bit of a gamer.
[02:33:49.140 --> 02:33:49.980]   - Yeah.
[02:33:49.980 --> 02:33:51.700]   - So the very first time he came over to the house,
[02:33:51.700 --> 02:33:53.940]   I didn't know he was coming over to the house.
[02:33:53.940 --> 02:33:55.620]   And so it was little, I was just walking down,
[02:33:55.620 --> 02:33:57.380]   I was early morning and I was tired,
[02:33:57.380 --> 02:33:59.980]   I was getting my coffee and I walked past the group and--
[02:33:59.980 --> 02:34:02.620]   (laughing)
[02:34:02.620 --> 02:34:04.020]   - Oh, okay.
[02:34:04.020 --> 02:34:04.860]   - Okay.
[02:34:04.860 --> 02:34:07.500]   - You think he could get the Pope to play Call of Duty with you?
[02:34:07.500 --> 02:34:09.140]   - No, I don't think he'd shoot us.
[02:34:09.140 --> 02:34:09.980]   - He would destroy you in Call of Duty.
[02:34:09.980 --> 02:34:10.820]   - Do you think so?
[02:34:10.820 --> 02:34:11.660]   (laughing)
[02:34:11.660 --> 02:34:12.580]   - Oh my gosh.
[02:34:12.580 --> 02:34:13.420]   - I don't know.
[02:34:13.420 --> 02:34:15.300]   - Dude, he would go on a killing spree
[02:34:15.300 --> 02:34:17.420]   and wouldn't be able to kill Tacula.
[02:34:17.420 --> 02:34:18.260]   - I'm pretty good.
[02:34:18.260 --> 02:34:20.780]   - The Pope gets the nuke and then it's just a--
[02:34:20.780 --> 02:34:22.700]   - You know what, I think he's more like a sniper.
[02:34:22.700 --> 02:34:24.660]   - He only uses his knife, he sits back.
[02:34:24.660 --> 02:34:25.820]   He only uses his knife.
[02:34:25.820 --> 02:34:27.620]   - He sneaks up behind you every time.
[02:34:27.620 --> 02:34:29.020]   - That's how you stealth, like ninja.
[02:34:29.020 --> 02:34:29.940]   - He's sneaky.
[02:34:29.940 --> 02:34:31.940]   - I would watch that straight.
[02:34:31.940 --> 02:34:33.660]   - Yeah, I've got to say, I would as well.
[02:34:33.660 --> 02:34:34.500]   - Wow.
[02:34:34.500 --> 02:34:35.340]   - Let's see how it's found.
[02:34:35.340 --> 02:34:36.180]   - He can get some money from out.
[02:34:36.180 --> 02:34:37.020]   - It already is.
[02:34:37.020 --> 02:34:39.220]   - I had to kick my give him 100 million just to--
[02:34:39.220 --> 02:34:41.940]   - When you get teabag by the Pope, that's it, it's over.
[02:34:41.940 --> 02:34:43.420]   - Oh, no, don't.
[02:34:43.420 --> 02:34:45.900]   - Oh my God, you're going straight to hell.
[02:34:45.900 --> 02:34:46.740]   Oh my God.
[02:34:46.740 --> 02:34:49.460]   - He's talking about the traditional victory day.
[02:34:49.460 --> 02:34:51.260]   - Oh, exactly, oh, okay.
[02:34:51.260 --> 02:34:52.260]   - No other contacts.
[02:34:52.260 --> 02:34:53.660]   - Don't take this out of context.
[02:34:53.660 --> 02:34:54.900]   - This is my victory day.
[02:34:54.900 --> 02:34:56.140]   - He likes the Earl Grey.
[02:34:56.140 --> 02:34:58.780]   - He does, yes, he prefers Earl Grey.
[02:34:58.780 --> 02:34:59.940]   - Oh, that's victory day.
[02:34:59.940 --> 02:35:01.500]   - All right, go over a little longer or something like that.
[02:35:01.500 --> 02:35:02.340]   He likes a little--
[02:35:02.340 --> 02:35:05.900]   - I think the Pope would be more of an animal crossing type fan.
[02:35:05.900 --> 02:35:06.740]   - Yeah, I think that's more--
[02:35:06.740 --> 02:35:07.580]   - No, no, no.
[02:35:07.580 --> 02:35:08.420]   - That's more speaking.
[02:35:08.420 --> 02:35:10.420]   - He goes straight from the GTA on the line.
[02:35:10.420 --> 02:35:11.420]   - All day.
[02:35:11.420 --> 02:35:14.180]   - He's four, so actually, oh, I could see him doing fours there.
[02:35:14.180 --> 02:35:15.180]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:35:15.180 --> 02:35:16.180]   - Like, does he like to drive?
[02:35:16.180 --> 02:35:17.620]   - He probably doesn't get to drive for a second.
[02:35:17.620 --> 02:35:18.980]   - He does the Pope won't be able to switch cars.
[02:35:18.980 --> 02:35:20.740]   - Yeah, but he doesn't get to drive it.
[02:35:20.740 --> 02:35:21.580]   - Oh, yes.
[02:35:21.580 --> 02:35:22.900]   - That would be pretty funny if he drove it.
[02:35:22.900 --> 02:35:25.660]   - I think you get to drive whatever you are.
[02:35:25.660 --> 02:35:27.380]   - I'm in the drive, and then I'm in the pop, I'm in the drive.
[02:35:27.380 --> 02:35:28.220]   - Oh, yes, dude.
[02:35:28.220 --> 02:35:29.060]   - I'm not even Catholic.
[02:35:29.060 --> 02:35:32.020]   The Pope's like, Brianna, give me your Cayman case.
[02:35:32.020 --> 02:35:33.060]   I've been a guest, sir.
[02:35:33.060 --> 02:35:34.380]   - Oh, yeah.
[02:35:34.380 --> 02:35:35.220]   - Here you go.
[02:35:35.220 --> 02:35:36.220]   - Oh, man.
[02:35:36.220 --> 02:35:38.580]   - Is that your hot car right now that Cayman?
[02:35:38.580 --> 02:35:40.900]   - It's still my favorite car, but it's my fastest car.
[02:35:40.900 --> 02:35:42.340]   - You like the boxers, I thought.
[02:35:42.340 --> 02:35:45.940]   - I like, I've got a boxer, Cayman, a 2-9-11, seven.
[02:35:45.940 --> 02:35:47.340]   - She's kind of a Porsche guy.
[02:35:47.340 --> 02:35:49.140]   - Did you have three 9-11s?
[02:35:49.140 --> 02:35:50.260]   - I'm only a two right now.
[02:35:50.260 --> 02:35:51.100]   - Okay.
[02:35:51.100 --> 02:35:52.140]   - So, sad times.
[02:35:52.140 --> 02:35:53.900]   - Ain't nobody needs three 9-11s.
[02:35:53.900 --> 02:35:56.740]   - Every time I see a Porsche coming up for sale,
[02:35:56.740 --> 02:35:59.140]   I always, do you let a post about how
[02:35:59.140 --> 02:36:01.500]   that will be the most expensive 9-11 you've ever bought
[02:36:01.500 --> 02:36:04.420]   because of the X, Y, I mean, yeah, I can see that.
[02:36:04.420 --> 02:36:07.820]   - I've done a really good job at making my brand hashtags
[02:36:07.820 --> 02:36:09.700]   and not on the soap Porsche.
[02:36:09.700 --> 02:36:11.300]   - It's good, maybe someday they'll notice.
[02:36:11.300 --> 02:36:12.140]   - Yeah.
[02:36:12.140 --> 02:36:14.100]   - So, not a huge fan of Top Gear,
[02:36:14.100 --> 02:36:16.180]   but when they did get the budget pourshers,
[02:36:16.180 --> 02:36:19.100]   I tried to do the road trip that was really rough.
[02:36:19.100 --> 02:36:21.940]   - Can I tell you I met the original Stig on the cruise?
[02:36:21.940 --> 02:36:22.780]   - Really?
[02:36:22.780 --> 02:36:24.660]   - Yeah, it was kind of cool.
[02:36:24.660 --> 02:36:25.500]   - Okay.
[02:36:25.500 --> 02:36:27.740]   - Wait, is this the one who was no longer the Stig
[02:36:27.740 --> 02:36:29.860]   because he told people he was a Stig?
[02:36:29.860 --> 02:36:30.700]   - Yeah, I think so.
[02:36:30.700 --> 02:36:31.900]   - Okay, yeah.
[02:36:31.900 --> 02:36:34.220]   - He was the first Stig, he was the white Stig.
[02:36:34.220 --> 02:36:36.740]   - Yeah, they fired him off the Bridgeman aircraft carrier
[02:36:36.740 --> 02:36:37.580]   from every station.
[02:36:37.580 --> 02:36:40.100]   - They did, he drove a car off an aircraft,
[02:36:40.100 --> 02:36:41.660]   Perry McCarthy.
[02:36:41.660 --> 02:36:43.940]   No, I'm sorry, he was the black suited Stig.
[02:36:43.940 --> 02:36:47.820]   Really nice guy, he drove a little bit in F1
[02:36:47.820 --> 02:36:49.700]   and like the worst car in history in F1,
[02:36:49.700 --> 02:36:50.900]   so what is the Stig?
[02:36:50.900 --> 02:36:52.300]   - Was it a Will?
[02:36:52.300 --> 02:36:54.420]   - No, it was terrible.
[02:36:54.420 --> 02:36:56.420]   - You know what his personal car is?
[02:36:56.420 --> 02:36:58.180]   Porsche 997 turbo.
[02:36:58.180 --> 02:36:59.260]   - You know that, too.
[02:36:59.260 --> 02:37:00.260]   - It's something not too turbo.
[02:37:00.260 --> 02:37:01.580]   - We should have been on the cruise with us
[02:37:01.580 --> 02:37:02.580]   'cause you could have talked to his language.
[02:37:02.580 --> 02:37:03.740]   - Oh, I wanna totally geeked out,
[02:37:03.740 --> 02:37:04.580]   like help me go.
[02:37:04.580 --> 02:37:05.820]   - He was great, he gave three lectures,
[02:37:05.820 --> 02:37:07.340]   I really enjoyed it, it was a lot of fun.
[02:37:07.340 --> 02:37:08.180]   - He was a good guy.
[02:37:08.180 --> 02:37:13.180]   - Anyway, you would think if you got the rights
[02:37:13.180 --> 02:37:17.900]   to run the Apple Card program,
[02:37:17.900 --> 02:37:20.500]   that'd be a license to print money.
[02:37:20.500 --> 02:37:21.340]   - Yeah.
[02:37:21.340 --> 02:37:22.180]   - No.
[02:37:22.180 --> 02:37:24.820]   - Goldman, Goldman Sachs,
[02:37:24.820 --> 02:37:26.780]   who does run the Apple Card program
[02:37:26.780 --> 02:37:28.620]   is trying to get out of it.
[02:37:28.620 --> 02:37:32.140]   They've lost billions of dollars.
[02:37:32.140 --> 02:37:33.980]   - World's smallest violin.
[02:37:33.980 --> 02:37:35.540]   - Aww.
[02:37:35.540 --> 02:37:36.380]   - So sorry.
[02:37:36.380 --> 02:37:37.420]   - Billions of dollars.
[02:37:37.420 --> 02:37:39.940]   - Goldman Sachs, Goldman Sachs get a break.
[02:37:39.940 --> 02:37:40.780]   - Yeah.
[02:37:40.780 --> 02:37:43.660]   - Yeah, guys, go on.
[02:37:43.660 --> 02:37:46.540]   - They lost about $3 billion on their consumer lending push
[02:37:46.540 --> 02:37:49.100]   over the last three years.
[02:37:49.100 --> 02:37:51.620]   A lot of it because of their relationship with Apple,
[02:37:51.620 --> 02:37:53.900]   they're trying to sell it off or offload it,
[02:37:53.900 --> 02:37:57.160]   as they call it, to American Express.
[02:37:57.160 --> 02:38:00.660]   Who knows how to do consumer credit cards?
[02:38:00.660 --> 02:38:03.060]   And that's the problem is this is a new business for Goldman.
[02:38:03.060 --> 02:38:03.900]   - Right.
[02:38:03.900 --> 02:38:05.020]   - And they just, I guess,
[02:38:05.020 --> 02:38:07.340]   I don't know how you lose $3 billion
[02:38:07.340 --> 02:38:09.420]   taking 12% interest from people.
[02:38:09.420 --> 02:38:10.740]   - I was gonna say that.
[02:38:10.740 --> 02:38:12.900]   - They do have a record for shafting people
[02:38:12.900 --> 02:38:14.420]   and being very successful at it.
[02:38:14.420 --> 02:38:15.780]   - The bank is already--
[02:38:15.780 --> 02:38:18.700]   - The benefits are good on the Apple Card too.
[02:38:18.700 --> 02:38:20.140]   - I mean, it's pure interest, right?
[02:38:20.140 --> 02:38:21.300]   Not bad, but--
[02:38:21.300 --> 02:38:22.140]   - But the card--
[02:38:22.140 --> 02:38:26.140]   - Maybe Apple Card owners don't run up big balances.
[02:38:26.140 --> 02:38:26.980]   I don't know.
[02:38:26.980 --> 02:38:28.980]   - I applied for one.
[02:38:28.980 --> 02:38:31.420]   I make really good money and I couldn't get it.
[02:38:31.420 --> 02:38:33.140]   They said I didn't qualify.
[02:38:33.140 --> 02:38:33.980]   - Wow.
[02:38:33.980 --> 02:38:36.220]   Yeah, it's very hard to get it.
[02:38:36.220 --> 02:38:37.660]   You have to have perfect credit.
[02:38:37.660 --> 02:38:40.340]   - I just don't, I've never had a credit card before.
[02:38:40.340 --> 02:38:41.180]   - That's why.
[02:38:41.180 --> 02:38:43.180]   - Yeah, no history, no traffic.
[02:38:43.180 --> 02:38:44.180]   - I'd love to see the numbers.
[02:38:44.180 --> 02:38:46.660]   It could just be that the Apple people don't revolve--
[02:38:46.660 --> 02:38:47.780]   - I bet you that's what it is.
[02:38:47.780 --> 02:38:49.420]   That they don't carry balances.
[02:38:49.420 --> 02:38:51.820]   - Well, though, on the trip last week to New York,
[02:38:51.820 --> 02:38:54.700]   I did see an Apple bank in Brooklyn.
[02:38:54.700 --> 02:38:56.220]   That's not related.
[02:38:56.220 --> 02:38:57.060]   - It's not.
[02:38:57.060 --> 02:38:57.900]   - No, okay.
[02:38:57.900 --> 02:38:58.860]   - It's like the big Apple.
[02:38:58.860 --> 02:39:00.100]   It's that kind of Apple.
[02:39:00.100 --> 02:39:02.100]   - Ah, this is kind of like--
[02:39:02.100 --> 02:39:04.020]   - This is where trademark disputes begin, right?
[02:39:04.020 --> 02:39:05.940]   - Yeah, it's kind of like, it seems very weird.
[02:39:05.940 --> 02:39:07.620]   - No, it's a physical pack.
[02:39:07.620 --> 02:39:09.340]   - It's predates Apple computer.
[02:39:09.340 --> 02:39:11.060]   Predates Apple music has been around forever,
[02:39:11.060 --> 02:39:12.380]   Apple bank.
[02:39:12.380 --> 02:39:15.300]   I used Apple Pay all the time on my watch now,
[02:39:15.300 --> 02:39:19.140]   and in fact, all over Europe, everybody took Apple Pay.
[02:39:19.140 --> 02:39:20.860]   It was the easy way to pay.
[02:39:20.860 --> 02:39:23.660]   The bank has already stopped issuing personal loans.
[02:39:23.660 --> 02:39:27.260]   They have a home improvement lender they bought last year.
[02:39:27.260 --> 02:39:29.300]   They're trying to unload that as well.
[02:39:29.300 --> 02:39:31.780]   So there it goes, Goldman,
[02:39:31.780 --> 02:39:33.540]   which wanted to be a full service bank
[02:39:33.540 --> 02:39:35.340]   is saying, "Man, whoever's ticked with that."
[02:39:35.340 --> 02:39:37.460]   Eric Dufan is saying that there's been actually
[02:39:37.460 --> 02:39:39.660]   a lot of defaults on Apple car.
[02:39:39.660 --> 02:39:41.820]   - That's the other side.
[02:39:41.820 --> 02:39:42.660]   - That could cost you.
[02:39:42.660 --> 02:39:44.020]   - You keep putting too much Apple product.
[02:39:44.020 --> 02:39:45.380]   - Yeah.
[02:39:45.380 --> 02:39:46.220]   - That's really interesting.
[02:39:46.220 --> 02:39:48.700]   - You just have to have that now, bro.
[02:39:48.700 --> 02:39:50.740]   - But the Goldman's been making a lot of moves.
[02:39:50.740 --> 02:39:52.940]   The Marcus has been doing quite well.
[02:39:52.940 --> 02:39:53.820]   They still have Marcus,
[02:39:53.820 --> 02:39:55.540]   and they say they're not gonna get rid of Marcus,
[02:39:55.540 --> 02:39:57.340]   but that's mostly a high interest savings.
[02:39:57.340 --> 02:39:59.260]   - But I mean, their interest right now is what?
[02:39:59.260 --> 02:40:01.620]   Five point one, if you've been--
[02:40:01.620 --> 02:40:02.820]   - That's a good way to lose money.
[02:40:02.820 --> 02:40:04.380]   I don't know, geez.
[02:40:04.380 --> 02:40:05.980]   I don't know how they do that.
[02:40:05.980 --> 02:40:06.820]   - If you're in charge of that,
[02:40:06.820 --> 02:40:08.300]   I will make you some money.
[02:40:08.300 --> 02:40:12.700]   - Did you get face recognized when you came into the US?
[02:40:12.700 --> 02:40:13.540]   - I did.
[02:40:13.540 --> 02:40:15.220]   I don't even have to take my passport out anymore.
[02:40:15.220 --> 02:40:16.060]   - Yeah.
[02:40:16.060 --> 02:40:17.420]   - Are you have global entry?
[02:40:17.420 --> 02:40:18.260]   - I do.
[02:40:18.260 --> 02:40:19.100]   - Yeah.
[02:40:19.100 --> 02:40:21.980]   So the TSA is expanding its face recognition program
[02:40:21.980 --> 02:40:25.540]   to almost every airport in the US now.
[02:40:25.540 --> 02:40:28.420]   - And they get really RC, if you ask to, opt out.
[02:40:28.420 --> 02:40:29.340]   - You can opt out.
[02:40:29.340 --> 02:40:31.060]   It is opt out, but they don't like that.
[02:40:31.060 --> 02:40:32.460]   The idea is that they--
[02:40:32.460 --> 02:40:33.300]   - Yeah, no, no, no, no.
[02:40:33.300 --> 02:40:35.500]   - A couple of months ago, and he was asked to stand right
[02:40:35.500 --> 02:40:36.900]   at the back of a very long queue.
[02:40:36.900 --> 02:40:37.740]   - Yeah.
[02:40:37.740 --> 02:40:38.580]   - Okay, buddy.
[02:40:38.580 --> 02:40:39.420]   - They laid it out.
[02:40:39.420 --> 02:40:40.420]   - Yeah, it's like you were wasting a bunch of time.
[02:40:40.420 --> 02:40:42.340]   - You want us to, yeah.
[02:40:42.340 --> 02:40:45.700]   The pilot program currently at 25 airports,
[02:40:45.700 --> 02:40:48.460]   the agency has determined its face matching algorithms
[02:40:48.460 --> 02:40:50.820]   are 97% effective.
[02:40:50.820 --> 02:40:54.620]   Quote, "Across demographics including dark skin tones,
[02:40:54.620 --> 02:40:57.420]   but they would not publicly release the results
[02:40:57.420 --> 02:40:58.420]   of their tests."
[02:40:58.420 --> 02:41:00.260]   - Amazingly enough.
[02:41:00.260 --> 02:41:01.660]   - Oh, it works, really.
[02:41:01.660 --> 02:41:02.900]   No, you can't see the results.
[02:41:02.900 --> 02:41:05.020]   - They'll look behind the curtain, yeah.
[02:41:05.020 --> 02:41:06.620]   - That's of course one of the big problems
[02:41:06.620 --> 02:41:09.220]   with face recognition is how poorly it does
[02:41:09.220 --> 02:41:10.180]   with people of color.
[02:41:10.180 --> 02:41:14.980]   The pilot program is technically voluntary.
[02:41:14.980 --> 02:41:18.220]   It uses what's known as a one-to-one face matching technology
[02:41:18.220 --> 02:41:21.300]   to verify that the traveler standing at the checkpoint
[02:41:21.300 --> 02:41:24.460]   matches the photo on their physical ID.
[02:41:24.460 --> 02:41:27.740]   - It's not voluntary if you want to make your connection.
[02:41:27.740 --> 02:41:28.860]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:41:28.860 --> 02:41:30.060]   - Well, and that's not as bad,
[02:41:30.060 --> 02:41:31.860]   but they're also trying out something called,
[02:41:31.860 --> 02:41:34.980]   that's one-to-one, this is also one-to-an,
[02:41:34.980 --> 02:41:39.740]   which has a database of face images from a government records.
[02:41:39.740 --> 02:41:43.140]   And then, that's kind of what you use with global entry.
[02:41:43.140 --> 02:41:44.300]   They've got the database.
[02:41:44.300 --> 02:41:46.140]   - Exactly, I had to be scanned at the beginning
[02:41:46.140 --> 02:41:47.860]   and then compared to that.
[02:41:47.860 --> 02:41:50.340]   But that's just because, you know,
[02:41:50.340 --> 02:41:53.740]   my information is in so many government databases already.
[02:41:53.740 --> 02:41:56.540]   Just not from the hacking side, but from the pre-side.
[02:41:56.540 --> 02:42:00.660]   Every state I've ever been in, because of all the laws,
[02:42:00.660 --> 02:42:01.500]   you have to file.
[02:42:01.500 --> 02:42:02.340]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[02:42:02.340 --> 02:42:03.180]   - Because that's interesting.
[02:42:03.180 --> 02:42:04.820]   - So that's really interesting.
[02:42:04.820 --> 02:42:05.660]   - Oh, that's really interesting.
[02:42:05.660 --> 02:42:06.500]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:42:06.500 --> 02:42:07.740]   - No, and I'm scanning on the UK system
[02:42:07.740 --> 02:42:09.860]   for getting into and out of Heathrow.
[02:42:09.860 --> 02:42:11.700]   I've just done the pre-thing,
[02:42:11.700 --> 02:42:13.300]   and the woman looked at me like an idiot,
[02:42:13.300 --> 02:42:17.260]   'cause I didn't know what my social security number was,
[02:42:17.260 --> 02:42:19.340]   but I'm not as good at rattling out numbers as much.
[02:42:19.340 --> 02:42:21.300]   - I'm scanned into the Disney Lancers.
[02:42:21.300 --> 02:42:22.780]   (laughing)
[02:42:22.780 --> 02:42:24.140]   - Do you get the, what do they call it?
[02:42:24.140 --> 02:42:26.340]   The FastPass or the Lightning Pass?
[02:42:26.340 --> 02:42:28.180]   - Yeah, yeah, we got a Lightning Pass.
[02:42:28.180 --> 02:42:29.340]   - It's so convoluted now and today.
[02:42:29.340 --> 02:42:31.020]   - And so expensive!
[02:42:31.020 --> 02:42:31.860]   - Yeah.
[02:42:31.860 --> 02:42:34.780]   - But so I'm showing my, I have the ticket on my phone,
[02:42:34.780 --> 02:42:36.820]   so it's got a barcode, so I show it to them.
[02:42:36.820 --> 02:42:37.820]   And then they go, "Smile."
[02:42:37.820 --> 02:42:38.660]   I said, "What?"
[02:42:38.660 --> 02:42:39.580]   (laughing)
[02:42:39.580 --> 02:42:41.740]   They take a picture of you with their phone.
[02:42:41.740 --> 02:42:42.580]   - Yeah.
[02:42:42.580 --> 02:42:45.940]   - And they don't make an idea out of it or anything,
[02:42:45.940 --> 02:42:47.980]   so I'm presuming they're saving that forever.
[02:42:47.980 --> 02:42:49.140]   - A corollary.
[02:42:49.140 --> 02:42:52.260]   Does the panel think that the real ID requirement
[02:42:52.260 --> 02:42:54.380]   for airports is ever gonna go into effect?
[02:42:54.380 --> 02:42:55.220]   (laughing)
[02:42:55.220 --> 02:42:57.700]   - 'Cause when he's pushing it back.
[02:42:57.700 --> 02:43:00.500]   - Yeah, I have a real idea of my driver's license.
[02:43:00.500 --> 02:43:01.900]   I have my passport.
[02:43:01.900 --> 02:43:03.380]   - Yeah, passports are a real idea.
[02:43:03.380 --> 02:43:05.460]   - But to come back to this, you know,
[02:43:05.460 --> 02:43:08.020]   so I am, yeah, I'm one of these Democrats.
[02:43:08.020 --> 02:43:11.380]   I do think national security is a very big deal, right?
[02:43:11.380 --> 02:43:13.220]   Like we do have America as a country,
[02:43:13.220 --> 02:43:15.100]   we have enemies out there.
[02:43:15.100 --> 02:43:18.380]   And there have been people that have smuggled,
[02:43:18.380 --> 02:43:19.740]   even in the Bush administration,
[02:43:19.740 --> 02:43:22.780]   they found somebody trying to smuggle radiological material.
[02:43:22.780 --> 02:43:23.860]   - Yikes.
[02:43:23.860 --> 02:43:25.060]   - Into the United States.
[02:43:25.060 --> 02:43:25.900]   - That's terrifying.
[02:43:25.900 --> 02:43:26.820]   - And they managed to stop it.
[02:43:26.820 --> 02:43:30.140]   So I'm not, I am not an extremist
[02:43:30.140 --> 02:43:32.540]   with trying to keep our airports safe.
[02:43:32.540 --> 02:43:37.540]   I think what makes this a concerning story for me
[02:43:37.540 --> 02:43:42.460]   is it's such a quick leap from here
[02:43:42.460 --> 02:43:44.060]   to police departments,
[02:43:44.060 --> 02:43:47.180]   having all this information out there,
[02:43:47.180 --> 02:43:49.220]   particularly when they've got these contracts
[02:43:49.220 --> 02:43:50.460]   with companies like--
[02:43:50.460 --> 02:43:52.340]   - Clear AI, yeah, clear you AI.
[02:43:52.340 --> 02:43:53.740]   - Right, how they're doing that.
[02:43:53.740 --> 02:43:56.380]   Something I learned when I ran for Congress
[02:43:56.380 --> 02:44:00.980]   is there's a kind of asymmetrical information
[02:44:00.980 --> 02:44:04.060]   that the government has when they're pursuing cases
[02:44:04.060 --> 02:44:07.100]   because they have the resources to go do discovery
[02:44:07.100 --> 02:44:09.020]   and to go into Google and to say,
[02:44:09.020 --> 02:44:11.780]   look, we have a geolocation fence of you here.
[02:44:11.780 --> 02:44:14.780]   We have this over here that looks kind of like you
[02:44:14.780 --> 02:44:17.820]   and they can just run that, run that, run that, run that.
[02:44:17.820 --> 02:44:19.140]   Whereas if you're innocent,
[02:44:19.140 --> 02:44:20.900]   you're at such a disadvantage
[02:44:20.900 --> 02:44:23.180]   versus all these various programs that they have.
[02:44:23.180 --> 02:44:27.900]   So I think if they were able to sandbox this off
[02:44:27.900 --> 02:44:30.020]   and say to the public, we're gonna use this
[02:44:30.020 --> 02:44:33.340]   for national security and it's not gonna filter out,
[02:44:33.340 --> 02:44:34.980]   I would feel more comfortable with it,
[02:44:34.980 --> 02:44:37.420]   but they're not saying things like that.
[02:44:37.420 --> 02:44:40.380]   - And if they do, there's a long history
[02:44:40.380 --> 02:44:41.860]   of this stuff getting exfiltrated
[02:44:41.860 --> 02:44:43.540]   even from government databases.
[02:44:43.540 --> 02:44:45.220]   So you can't have that much--
[02:44:45.220 --> 02:44:46.940]   - Remember the OPM hack?
[02:44:46.940 --> 02:44:48.380]   We were taking sort of finger-picking--
[02:44:48.380 --> 02:44:49.980]   - That was the government's details
[02:44:49.980 --> 02:44:52.740]   for the government's own security screening processes.
[02:44:52.740 --> 02:44:53.580]   - Exactly.
[02:44:53.580 --> 02:44:54.860]   - So you know, it's--
[02:44:54.860 --> 02:44:57.220]   - The problem is anytime this stuff is stored,
[02:44:57.220 --> 02:44:58.060]   it gets out.
[02:44:58.060 --> 02:44:58.900]   - Yeah.
[02:44:58.900 --> 02:45:01.780]   - My biggest concern, and I'm gonna piggyback
[02:45:01.780 --> 02:45:05.540]   on Brianna's point here, is the government
[02:45:05.540 --> 02:45:07.380]   is deliberately bypassing a lot
[02:45:07.380 --> 02:45:10.140]   of the Fifth Amendment protections that were afforded
[02:45:10.140 --> 02:45:11.540]   because they're using a third party.
[02:45:11.540 --> 02:45:13.860]   Since the government doesn't own the database,
[02:45:13.860 --> 02:45:15.540]   since the government doesn't own the cameras,
[02:45:15.540 --> 02:45:17.620]   since the government isn't doing any of the screening
[02:45:17.620 --> 02:45:18.860]   or running the software,
[02:45:18.860 --> 02:45:20.180]   they're not violating your rights,
[02:45:20.180 --> 02:45:21.580]   they're just getting a name at the end.
[02:45:21.580 --> 02:45:22.420]   - Exactly.
[02:45:22.420 --> 02:45:24.260]   - For me, that's the biggest concern
[02:45:24.260 --> 02:45:26.380]   because we've seen that happening.
[02:45:26.380 --> 02:45:28.220]   That's what Palantir was all about.
[02:45:28.220 --> 02:45:29.060]   - Exactly.
[02:45:29.060 --> 02:45:31.380]   - Give me threat assessment in a way
[02:45:31.380 --> 02:45:33.220]   that is violating people's privacy,
[02:45:33.220 --> 02:45:34.620]   but because you bought the data
[02:45:34.620 --> 02:45:35.980]   in your third party company,
[02:45:35.980 --> 02:45:38.740]   I don't have to run any civil rights concerns.
[02:45:38.740 --> 02:45:41.060]   - Well, I mean, on a sort of slightly more obscene schedule,
[02:45:41.060 --> 02:45:45.220]   this was entirely the reason for the Wagner group in Russia.
[02:45:45.220 --> 02:45:46.060]   - Yep, yep.
[02:45:46.060 --> 02:45:48.620]   - Because they're pretty good outsources, fighters, too.
[02:45:48.620 --> 02:45:50.340]   - You know what I saw the other day,
[02:45:50.340 --> 02:45:52.060]   where I thought was very interesting?
[02:45:52.060 --> 02:45:54.980]   Progosion, who ran the Wagner group,
[02:45:54.980 --> 02:45:56.260]   also seems to be ex-preserving.
[02:45:56.260 --> 02:45:57.580]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:45:57.580 --> 02:45:59.060]   The man who will soon fall out of a window
[02:45:59.060 --> 02:46:00.100]   for no accountable reasons.
[02:46:00.100 --> 02:46:02.580]   - Accidentally cut his head off while she meets the stay away
[02:46:02.580 --> 02:46:03.780]   from umbrellas.
[02:46:03.780 --> 02:46:05.620]   (laughing)
[02:46:05.620 --> 02:46:08.620]   Isn't that how they got Trotsky with a poison umbrella?
[02:46:08.620 --> 02:46:09.900]   - Oh, no, no, it was the ice axe,
[02:46:09.900 --> 02:46:11.180]   it was the Bulgarian--
[02:46:11.180 --> 02:46:13.220]   - No, yeah, it was a polonium, a poisoning, right?
[02:46:13.220 --> 02:46:14.740]   - Yeah, well, yeah, that was--
[02:46:14.740 --> 02:46:16.900]   - Polonium in your tea, that's how they do the Valmy.
[02:46:16.900 --> 02:46:18.660]   - Yeah, yep.
[02:46:18.660 --> 02:46:20.620]   In any event, I don't know what's gonna have the Progosion,
[02:46:20.620 --> 02:46:23.660]   but he owned a media holding group,
[02:46:23.660 --> 02:46:26.700]   which is now being shut down.
[02:46:26.700 --> 02:46:30.700]   The media holding group ran the internet--
[02:46:30.700 --> 02:46:31.700]   - Research, yeah.
[02:46:31.700 --> 02:46:32.860]   - The same as-- - Yeah, yeah.
[02:46:32.860 --> 02:46:34.900]   - Research agency, the troll factory.
[02:46:34.900 --> 02:46:35.740]   - No, same blow.
[02:46:35.740 --> 02:46:37.300]   - It was really weird how on that day,
[02:46:37.300 --> 02:46:39.260]   suddenly the troll volume on Twitter
[02:46:39.260 --> 02:46:41.100]   just dropped to the floor.
[02:46:41.100 --> 02:46:42.020]   It was amazing.
[02:46:42.020 --> 02:46:44.100]   - I mean, bear 'em on the NSA has admitted
[02:46:44.100 --> 02:46:46.540]   that they deliberately trashed the IRAs,
[02:46:46.540 --> 02:46:48.220]   computers a couple of years ago,
[02:46:48.220 --> 02:46:51.500]   but yeah, this guy's had his finger on the, you know--
[02:46:51.500 --> 02:46:53.620]   - It was called Patriot Media.
[02:46:53.620 --> 02:46:54.540]   (laughing)
[02:46:54.540 --> 02:46:55.940]   - Yeah, 'cause no one else of course,
[02:46:55.940 --> 02:46:58.540]   no one calls it what it should be called, I mean.
[02:46:58.540 --> 02:47:01.340]   But this was the weird thing about the attempted coup,
[02:47:01.340 --> 02:47:05.740]   it's like, you'd think he either must have assumed
[02:47:05.740 --> 02:47:07.180]   that everyone would come to his side--
[02:47:07.180 --> 02:47:08.500]   - I think that's what he thought.
[02:47:08.500 --> 02:47:10.380]   - That he would march triumphantly
[02:47:10.380 --> 02:47:11.940]   through the Russian countryside,
[02:47:11.940 --> 02:47:14.620]   amassing people on sort of Mussolini marching rooms.
[02:47:14.620 --> 02:47:16.460]   - There were a lot of videos of people
[02:47:16.460 --> 02:47:18.620]   out there supporting, like, I mean--
[02:47:18.620 --> 02:47:19.540]   - But not enough.
[02:47:19.540 --> 02:47:21.900]   I mean, he did the math and he knew,
[02:47:21.900 --> 02:47:24.660]   look, he's got about a week's worth of logistical support here.
[02:47:24.660 --> 02:47:25.500]   - I agree.
[02:47:25.500 --> 02:47:26.820]   - And if you can't rally everyone, that's it, it's over.
[02:47:26.820 --> 02:47:28.660]   - Yeah, I think that's what happened so quickly.
[02:47:28.660 --> 02:47:30.780]   What, so what was the internet research agency?
[02:47:30.780 --> 02:47:31.780]   What did it do?
[02:47:31.780 --> 02:47:36.340]   - They did amplification of pro-Putin, pro-Russia,
[02:47:36.340 --> 02:47:39.460]   and pro-Trump, I mean, so that was their big target.
[02:47:39.460 --> 02:47:41.700]   - I know some formation as well, yeah.
[02:47:41.700 --> 02:47:42.860]   - Oh yeah, they were in Brexit.
[02:47:42.860 --> 02:47:45.460]   - Yeah, really good at disinformation.
[02:47:45.460 --> 02:47:47.220]   They ran hundreds of thousands of accounts
[02:47:47.220 --> 02:47:50.340]   across multiple social media platforms.
[02:47:50.340 --> 02:47:53.700]   They could push anything at any time.
[02:47:53.700 --> 02:47:55.860]   You know, there was that joke on Twitter of,
[02:47:55.860 --> 02:47:58.260]   oh, it's 3 a.m. in the morning, it's funny how
[02:47:58.260 --> 02:48:01.220]   suddenly everything is live for pro-Putin, yeah.
[02:48:01.220 --> 02:48:04.060]   It's because people clocked into their nine to five.
[02:48:04.060 --> 02:48:05.380]   - Yeah.
[02:48:05.380 --> 02:48:07.340]   It's kind of amazing.
[02:48:07.340 --> 02:48:10.420]   I had no idea that that was run by Pergosian.
[02:48:11.260 --> 02:48:13.380]   - Maybe they're gone, maybe not.
[02:48:13.380 --> 02:48:14.380]   That's the problem.
[02:48:14.380 --> 02:48:15.420]   They're never fully gone.
[02:48:15.420 --> 02:48:17.460]   I mean, someone else is gonna absorb the assets.
[02:48:17.460 --> 02:48:18.300]   - Yeah.
[02:48:18.300 --> 02:48:19.460]   - It's a business model now.
[02:48:19.460 --> 02:48:22.140]   It's not just a patriotic thing.
[02:48:22.140 --> 02:48:23.900]   There are dictators all around the world
[02:48:23.900 --> 02:48:25.380]   that would love to do some influence
[02:48:25.380 --> 02:48:28.860]   paneling and disinformation campaigns on the cheap.
[02:48:28.860 --> 02:48:29.700]   - Yeah.
[02:48:29.700 --> 02:48:33.300]   - I mean, it's cheaper to run a troll farm
[02:48:33.300 --> 02:48:35.700]   to undermine your enemy's resolve
[02:48:35.700 --> 02:48:37.300]   than just to run an army.
[02:48:37.300 --> 02:48:39.900]   I got to say, I was so disappointed
[02:48:39.900 --> 02:48:41.660]   by some people on my own side
[02:48:41.660 --> 02:48:44.260]   that are with the Russian coup going on
[02:48:44.260 --> 02:48:46.980]   and they're like, oh, Wagner, talk about him.
[02:48:46.980 --> 02:48:50.860]   Like, he's a good person or this is gonna be beneficial
[02:48:50.860 --> 02:48:51.700]   for Russians.
[02:48:51.700 --> 02:48:54.260]   I'm like, I think y'all should read a little bit more
[02:48:54.260 --> 02:48:55.620]   about this subject.
[02:48:55.620 --> 02:48:57.900]   - It was only gonna go get worse.
[02:48:57.900 --> 02:48:59.100]   It was never gonna get better.
[02:48:59.100 --> 02:49:00.100]   - Exactly.
[02:49:00.100 --> 02:49:02.260]   Though, arguably better for Ukraine,
[02:49:02.260 --> 02:49:04.060]   but that's all different discussion.
[02:49:04.060 --> 02:49:07.900]   - So I guess RIP, the internet research.
[02:49:07.900 --> 02:49:09.380]   - It will get another name.
[02:49:09.380 --> 02:49:11.140]   - Yeah, it'll be called a poll there.
[02:49:11.140 --> 02:49:12.380]   - It's two but an idea to give up
[02:49:12.380 --> 02:49:13.380]   for some kind of people.
[02:49:13.380 --> 02:49:14.820]   - It's good for a 4.9.
[02:49:14.820 --> 02:49:16.660]   - Good for a 4.0.
[02:49:16.660 --> 02:49:21.060]   - Yeah, the final word, the passing of man
[02:49:21.060 --> 02:49:23.380]   whose name you may not know, John Goodenough,
[02:49:23.380 --> 02:49:27.380]   but you should know he invented the lithium ion battery.
[02:49:27.380 --> 02:49:28.220]   - It's the phone, yeah.
[02:49:28.220 --> 02:49:31.500]   - And in all of our stuff, he was a Nobel Prize recipient.
[02:49:31.500 --> 02:49:34.180]   As a result, John Goodenough, a professor at University
[02:49:34.180 --> 02:49:36.900]   of Texas at Austin passed last week
[02:49:36.900 --> 02:49:38.740]   at the age of 100.
[02:49:38.740 --> 02:49:43.660]   He won the Nobel Prize for chemistry just a few years ago,
[02:49:43.660 --> 02:49:44.780]   the age of 97.
[02:49:44.780 --> 02:49:45.820]   - Oldest winner, yeah.
[02:49:45.820 --> 02:49:48.260]   - Yeah, for his battery work.
[02:49:48.260 --> 02:49:53.820]   If we had not, if the lithium ion battery had not existed,
[02:49:53.820 --> 02:49:54.980]   we would have had to invent it.
[02:49:54.980 --> 02:49:55.820]   Oh, we did.
[02:49:55.820 --> 02:49:59.860]   His discovery led the development
[02:49:59.860 --> 02:50:01.220]   of carbon-based materials to allow
[02:50:01.220 --> 02:50:03.740]   for the use of stable and manageable negative electrodes
[02:50:03.740 --> 02:50:05.940]   in lithium ion batteries.
[02:50:05.940 --> 02:50:08.140]   That was back in 1979.
[02:50:08.140 --> 02:50:09.060]   - Oh my goodness.
[02:50:09.060 --> 02:50:11.460]   - Took a while to develop it into a usable oxygen.
[02:50:11.460 --> 02:50:14.900]   - It was originally lithium cobalt oxide as the cathode.
[02:50:14.900 --> 02:50:15.740]   - Yeah, when they do that.
[02:50:15.740 --> 02:50:17.420]   - Don't you think it's so interesting
[02:50:17.420 --> 02:50:20.220]   that for all of our advances in technology,
[02:50:20.220 --> 02:50:22.020]   like when it comes to battery tech,
[02:50:22.020 --> 02:50:24.940]   I mean, it's gotten marginally better, but--
[02:50:24.940 --> 02:50:26.820]   - Only marginally, yeah.
[02:50:26.820 --> 02:50:27.660]   Really surprising.
[02:50:27.660 --> 02:50:29.660]   - Is there anything out there that you've seen?
[02:50:29.660 --> 02:50:32.260]   - So the thing that's not pieing the sky
[02:50:32.260 --> 02:50:35.740]   that you can actually get now would be graphene-enabled.
[02:50:35.740 --> 02:50:39.340]   - We were talking at that like a lot, like six years ago.
[02:50:39.340 --> 02:50:42.140]   And I know it's had industrial applications, but--
[02:50:42.140 --> 02:50:43.820]   - We might be getting closer to it,
[02:50:43.820 --> 02:50:45.780]   not because people are willing to pay more,
[02:50:45.780 --> 02:50:48.740]   but because lithium is becoming increasingly difficult to get.
[02:50:48.740 --> 02:50:50.420]   It's in more conflict areas now.
[02:50:50.420 --> 02:50:54.980]   And graphene actually does offer some amazing benefits.
[02:50:54.980 --> 02:50:58.460]   Like the charge time on a graphene-enabled lithium battery
[02:50:58.460 --> 02:51:02.020]   is, I mean, you can go from zero to a percent to a hundred percent
[02:51:02.020 --> 02:51:02.940]   in like five minutes.
[02:51:02.940 --> 02:51:07.940]   It's exceptionally good for large current applications,
[02:51:07.940 --> 02:51:10.020]   which means vehicles.
[02:51:10.020 --> 02:51:13.300]   So yeah, you're probably gonna see them in--
[02:51:13.300 --> 02:51:15.140]   - I was gonna say the cost of production is still fairly high.
[02:51:15.140 --> 02:51:16.060]   - It's still very high.
[02:51:16.060 --> 02:51:17.740]   - So this is, we've been talking about this
[02:51:17.740 --> 02:51:19.380]   as supercapacitor for a while.
[02:51:19.380 --> 02:51:20.940]   This is related to that.
[02:51:20.940 --> 02:51:22.940]   - Yeah, well, I mean, so supercapacitor,
[02:51:22.940 --> 02:51:25.100]   it operates on a different principle.
[02:51:25.100 --> 02:51:27.900]   You're basically storing up charge between plates
[02:51:27.900 --> 02:51:30.660]   versus a typical battery chemistry,
[02:51:30.660 --> 02:51:33.140]   which is you're storing charge in a chemical composition.
[02:51:33.140 --> 02:51:34.780]   - Right, a chemical reaction,
[02:51:34.780 --> 02:51:36.100]   which then is reversed generally.
[02:51:36.100 --> 02:51:37.620]   - Correct, correct.
[02:51:37.620 --> 02:51:41.980]   - So, but I mean, lithium got rid of some of the worst effects
[02:51:41.980 --> 02:51:44.420]   that we saw with earlier battery chemistry,
[02:51:44.420 --> 02:51:46.900]   where you were literally destroying the chemistry
[02:51:46.900 --> 02:51:48.500]   every single time you charged it.
[02:51:48.500 --> 02:51:49.340]   - Yeah.
[02:51:49.340 --> 02:51:50.900]   - Which is why it's kind of stagnated,
[02:51:50.900 --> 02:51:51.860]   because it's stable.
[02:51:51.860 --> 02:51:54.100]   Right now it suits most of our needs.
[02:51:54.100 --> 02:51:56.060]   It's relatively inexpensive.
[02:51:56.060 --> 02:51:59.860]   It's safe-ish to handle.
[02:51:59.860 --> 02:52:01.780]   This has actually been one of the biggest holdbacks
[02:52:01.780 --> 02:52:04.300]   on battery technology, because we're starting to realize
[02:52:04.300 --> 02:52:06.500]   if you were able to put all the charge up
[02:52:06.500 --> 02:52:07.740]   when you wanted into a battery,
[02:52:07.740 --> 02:52:09.780]   it would be an exceptionally dangerous device.
[02:52:09.780 --> 02:52:10.900]   - Oh, 100%.
[02:52:10.900 --> 02:52:12.700]   Don't, yeah, thermal runaway.
[02:52:12.700 --> 02:52:13.540]   - Oh gosh, yes.
[02:52:13.540 --> 02:52:14.620]   - Dangerous phenomena.
[02:52:14.620 --> 02:52:15.940]   - We demonstrated that on Twitch.
[02:52:15.940 --> 02:52:16.860]   - You know,
[02:52:16.860 --> 02:52:18.460]   - Intentionally you're on it.
[02:52:18.460 --> 02:52:19.300]   - Intentionally, yes.
[02:52:19.300 --> 02:52:20.140]   - No, okay.
[02:52:20.140 --> 02:52:22.860]   - Attarous, arguably very bad for the environment,
[02:52:22.860 --> 02:52:24.620]   like us, the aggregate,
[02:52:24.620 --> 02:52:29.620]   the political issues of mining these materials,
[02:52:30.460 --> 02:52:31.860]   you know, there's a good argument
[02:52:31.860 --> 02:52:34.580]   that the Afghanistan war was in some support.
[02:52:34.580 --> 02:52:35.420]   - It's over with you.
[02:52:35.420 --> 02:52:37.340]   - Some part of us getting these resources.
[02:52:37.340 --> 02:52:38.540]   - Wow, Olivia's new conflict.
[02:52:38.540 --> 02:52:39.940]   They've got a huge lithium.
[02:52:39.940 --> 02:52:40.780]   - 100%.
[02:52:40.780 --> 02:52:41.620]   - The deposit.
[02:52:41.620 --> 02:52:42.460]   - I've got to say also,
[02:52:42.460 --> 02:52:44.340]   I mean, in front of mine is a commercial cargo pilot,
[02:52:44.340 --> 02:52:47.260]   and it's his nightmare upon nightmare
[02:52:47.260 --> 02:52:48.980]   is being midway across the Atlantic
[02:52:48.980 --> 02:52:50.540]   and the lithium battery and the cargo hull,
[02:52:50.540 --> 02:52:51.660]   boosts and flame.
[02:52:51.660 --> 02:52:52.500]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:52:52.500 --> 02:52:54.300]   - Because you're not getting out of that one.
[02:52:54.300 --> 02:52:55.220]   - Right.
[02:52:55.220 --> 02:52:56.700]   - It's a little toxic.
[02:52:56.700 --> 02:52:58.580]   - I'm happy driving my electric vehicle.
[02:52:58.580 --> 02:52:59.780]   Don't make me scared.
[02:52:59.780 --> 02:53:01.180]   - What are you driving now?
[02:53:01.180 --> 02:53:02.020]   Mustang Mach.
[02:53:02.020 --> 02:53:03.820]   - I was hoping I'd get to see that today.
[02:53:03.820 --> 02:53:04.660]   - Ooh, that's right out here.
[02:53:04.660 --> 02:53:06.700]   You can take a ride right after that.
[02:53:06.700 --> 02:53:08.140]   Five minutes we're going to dinner.
[02:53:08.140 --> 02:53:08.980]   - It's outside.
[02:53:08.980 --> 02:53:09.820]   - Yeah.
[02:53:09.820 --> 02:53:10.660]   - Let's stop it.
[02:53:10.660 --> 02:53:11.500]   Go away.
[02:53:11.500 --> 02:53:12.580]   - That's why he wanted to know.
[02:53:12.580 --> 02:53:13.900]   He's got that flipper.
[02:53:13.900 --> 02:53:15.500]   - Gosh, yeah, you still stupid.
[02:53:15.500 --> 02:53:16.340]   - I'm thinking again.
[02:53:16.340 --> 02:53:18.020]   - This is on you.
[02:53:18.020 --> 02:53:18.860]   - That leaves her in time.
[02:53:18.860 --> 02:53:21.540]   - This is like if you gave your kid a toy horn
[02:53:21.540 --> 02:53:22.380]   and they're going,
[02:53:22.380 --> 02:53:24.020]   this kid's making a lot of noise.
[02:53:24.020 --> 02:53:26.540]   - Why are you making so much noise, kid?
[02:53:26.540 --> 02:53:29.020]   - That's Father Robert Ballastare, the digital Jesuit,
[02:53:29.020 --> 02:53:31.020]   now is flipper zero enhanced.
[02:53:31.020 --> 02:53:32.900]   Watch out Vatican.
[02:53:32.900 --> 02:53:34.340]   - Hi Def Con.
[02:53:34.340 --> 02:53:36.560]   - Padre SJ on the Twitter,
[02:53:36.560 --> 02:53:39.380]   or on our Mastodon, Twit.Social.
[02:53:39.380 --> 02:53:40.580]   - And actually I did announce
[02:53:40.580 --> 02:53:42.140]   I'm taking a little vacation from Twitter.
[02:53:42.140 --> 02:53:43.780]   I just do it, it's a mental health thing.
[02:53:43.780 --> 02:53:44.620]   - It's horrible.
[02:53:44.620 --> 02:53:45.460]   - You know what?
[02:53:45.460 --> 02:53:49.700]   Mastodon is ready, waiting, and willing to accept you.
[02:53:49.700 --> 02:53:50.540]   If you don't know,
[02:53:50.540 --> 02:53:53.500]   we run a really great Mastodon instance, Twit.Social.
[02:53:53.500 --> 02:53:55.900]   You have to be a Twit listener to get in.
[02:53:55.900 --> 02:53:59.460]   So many people apply saying,
[02:53:59.460 --> 02:54:02.700]   I just want to help promote my business.
[02:54:02.700 --> 02:54:04.460]   And I, nope.
[02:54:04.460 --> 02:54:07.380]   But if you say, I just heard Leo talk about it on Twit,
[02:54:07.380 --> 02:54:09.060]   I will let you in.
[02:54:09.060 --> 02:54:13.180]   It's actually, despite all of people saying,
[02:54:13.180 --> 02:54:15.140]   oh, Mastodon's over, it's dead.
[02:54:15.140 --> 02:54:15.980]   - No, that's great.
[02:54:15.980 --> 02:54:18.780]   - 58,000 interactions this month.
[02:54:18.780 --> 02:54:19.620]   - It's really, I agree.
[02:54:19.620 --> 02:54:21.060]   - Which is up 23%.
[02:54:21.060 --> 02:54:23.660]   We have 3,000 active users.
[02:54:23.660 --> 02:54:27.500]   So it's small, but all of them are Twit fans.
[02:54:27.500 --> 02:54:28.700]   I did not get an influx.
[02:54:28.700 --> 02:54:31.580]   I thought I might after the Twitter meltdown yesterday,
[02:54:31.580 --> 02:54:32.420]   but.
[02:54:32.420 --> 02:54:34.100]   - I think Blue Sky got most of that.
[02:54:34.100 --> 02:54:36.380]   - And Blue Sky in fact has had to shut down
[02:54:36.380 --> 02:54:39.100]   its invite system because so many people going in.
[02:54:39.100 --> 02:54:41.940]   But Blue Sky's not serious people.
[02:54:41.940 --> 02:54:44.780]   I'm just saying that for the next month or so.
[02:54:44.780 --> 02:54:48.500]   - They're all about butts and mouth.
[02:54:48.500 --> 02:54:50.780]   - It's going to be helpful.
[02:54:50.780 --> 02:54:53.220]   - They're doing health memes on Blue Sky?
[02:54:53.220 --> 02:54:54.700]   - Our big, our teams.
[02:54:54.700 --> 02:54:57.060]   - Like the 80s out of control.
[02:54:57.060 --> 02:54:58.140]   - How of this, God.
[02:54:58.140 --> 02:54:58.980]   Like metaphor.
[02:54:58.980 --> 02:55:00.420]   - Okay, stay away from Blue Sky.
[02:55:00.420 --> 02:55:01.580]   It's not good for you.
[02:55:01.580 --> 02:55:02.820]   - Blue Sky is great.
[02:55:02.820 --> 02:55:03.660]   (laughing)
[02:55:03.660 --> 02:55:04.500]   - I'm not Blue Sky.
[02:55:04.500 --> 02:55:05.740]   - I've just received my invitation,
[02:55:05.740 --> 02:55:07.060]   but I heard that we're having some problems.
[02:55:07.060 --> 02:55:09.980]   - We can party over Blue Sky, yes.
[02:55:09.980 --> 02:55:12.020]   - Can you, if you have an invitation,
[02:55:12.020 --> 02:55:14.700]   can you use it or is it?
[02:55:14.700 --> 02:55:15.780]   - I think it's on hold right now.
[02:55:15.780 --> 02:55:17.260]   - I think all of it's on hold, yes.
[02:55:17.260 --> 02:55:19.340]   - I lost, I had invite codes, another all gone.
[02:55:19.340 --> 02:55:22.220]   - Yeah, I have three invite codes, but I'm not gonna.
[02:55:22.220 --> 02:55:23.780]   - You know, don't show that.
[02:55:23.780 --> 02:55:25.260]   - Oh!
[02:55:25.260 --> 02:55:27.740]   - Don't show that, that was in my invite codes.
[02:55:27.740 --> 02:55:29.540]   - You know what's sad?
[02:55:29.540 --> 02:55:31.620]   Google circles actually would have done really well
[02:55:31.620 --> 02:55:32.460]   in this environment.
[02:55:32.460 --> 02:55:35.180]   - Can you imagine if Google+ has still been around?
[02:55:35.180 --> 02:55:36.100]   - Yeah.
[02:55:36.100 --> 02:55:36.940]   - Yeah.
[02:55:36.940 --> 02:55:38.980]   - I actually, I actually really liked that.
[02:55:38.980 --> 02:55:39.820]   (laughing)
[02:55:39.820 --> 02:55:41.380]   - It required a lot of moderation
[02:55:41.380 --> 02:55:43.580]   'cause you had to block almost everybody.
[02:55:43.580 --> 02:55:45.580]   But once you got it down to your community,
[02:55:45.580 --> 02:55:46.940]   it was a fantastic place.
[02:55:46.940 --> 02:55:51.060]   - I know it's not hip or with it to say,
[02:55:51.060 --> 02:55:53.060]   I like Mastodon, I like Mastodon.
[02:55:53.060 --> 02:55:53.900]   - I love Mastodon.
[02:55:53.900 --> 02:55:54.740]   - I like our community.
[02:55:54.740 --> 02:55:57.060]   - I love Mastodon because it's like,
[02:55:57.060 --> 02:55:59.860]   I can take a post and, you know,
[02:55:59.860 --> 02:56:03.380]   I've only got like, what is the 17,000 followers over there?
[02:56:03.380 --> 02:56:05.500]   And it is more engagement, I guess,
[02:56:05.500 --> 02:56:07.900]   with the 150,000 followers.
[02:56:07.900 --> 02:56:08.820]   - And more thoughtful.
[02:56:08.820 --> 02:56:10.860]   I think that the content is,
[02:56:10.860 --> 02:56:12.660]   the people who respond to you, the conversation,
[02:56:12.660 --> 02:56:13.660]   it's just fantastic.
[02:56:13.660 --> 02:56:14.860]   - I agree, it's great.
[02:56:14.860 --> 02:56:16.180]   - Yeah.
[02:56:16.180 --> 02:56:17.900]   - And that's where I'll be putting all the vadicates
[02:56:17.900 --> 02:56:18.780]   for the next month or so.
[02:56:18.780 --> 02:56:19.700]   - Really good.
[02:56:19.700 --> 02:56:21.220]   We'll look forward to that.
[02:56:21.220 --> 02:56:22.780]   If you're not a member, twit.social.
[02:56:22.780 --> 02:56:24.100]   We also have forums.
[02:56:24.100 --> 02:56:26.980]   People still like the good old days of forums.
[02:56:26.980 --> 02:56:30.020]   Our twit community is at twit.community.
[02:56:30.020 --> 02:56:32.620]   And I welcome you there too.

[02:56:36.260 --> 02:56:38.620]   - We need to read to scroll past Alex Jones thing,
[02:56:38.620 --> 02:56:40.140]   it's freaking me out of the room.
[02:56:40.140 --> 02:56:40.980]   - On the discord?
[02:56:40.980 --> 02:56:41.820]   - Yeah, please.
[02:56:41.820 --> 02:56:42.660]   - He's wearing a tin fella.
[02:56:42.660 --> 02:56:43.820]   - Some percent discord, please.
[02:56:43.820 --> 02:56:44.820]   - Tin, tin foil hat.
[02:56:44.820 --> 02:56:45.660]   - Thank you.
[02:56:45.660 --> 02:56:46.780]   (laughing)
[02:56:46.780 --> 02:56:49.060]   - Or just spam it with more Alex Jones.
[02:56:49.060 --> 02:56:51.220]   Either way, you don't have to.
[02:56:51.220 --> 02:56:54.540]   - Good, put some stuff in there and it's all right.
[02:56:54.540 --> 02:56:57.020]   Ants our community manager in the discord.
[02:56:57.020 --> 02:56:57.860]   - I love you.
[02:56:57.860 --> 02:56:58.700]   - You're such a great guy.
[02:56:58.700 --> 02:56:59.540]   - You're such a great guy.
[02:56:59.540 --> 02:57:00.940]   - Isn't he wonderful?
[02:57:00.940 --> 02:57:02.820]   Thank you, Brianna.
[02:57:02.820 --> 02:57:05.420]   Woo, I hope you have a great time at the conference
[02:57:05.420 --> 02:57:06.260]   with Frank.
[02:57:06.260 --> 02:57:07.100]   - I will.
[02:57:07.100 --> 02:57:08.060]   I was helping to plug something.
[02:57:08.060 --> 02:57:09.460]   - Please.
[02:57:09.460 --> 02:57:11.860]   - So if you go to Twitter, you can see IDM,
[02:57:11.860 --> 02:57:13.500]   Jew, and article.
[02:57:13.500 --> 02:57:14.980]   I'm working on something right now
[02:57:14.980 --> 02:57:17.140]   that's one of the things I'm most proud of
[02:57:17.140 --> 02:57:18.540]   in my entire career.
[02:57:18.540 --> 02:57:22.540]   So about a week ago in the New York Times,
[02:57:22.540 --> 02:57:25.460]   this story ran above the fold,
[02:57:25.460 --> 02:57:28.020]   the battle for contraception.
[02:57:28.020 --> 02:57:29.900]   I've been in the New York Times quite a few times,
[02:57:29.900 --> 02:57:32.340]   but this was front page above the fold,
[02:57:32.340 --> 02:57:34.660]   this project that I'm working on.
[02:57:34.660 --> 02:57:38.420]   This is a bipartisan push across this country
[02:57:38.420 --> 02:57:41.460]   in the aftermath of the Dom's decision
[02:57:41.460 --> 02:57:44.900]   to basically guarantee the right to contraception
[02:57:44.900 --> 02:57:46.100]   at a state level.
[02:57:46.100 --> 02:57:48.220]   We are going state by state.
[02:57:48.220 --> 02:57:50.460]   We are pushing on legislators
[02:57:50.460 --> 02:57:54.300]   to basically codify these rights at a state level.
[02:57:54.300 --> 02:57:57.020]   What I really love about this is most of the stuff
[02:57:57.020 --> 02:57:58.660]   I work on in my career, Leo,
[02:57:58.660 --> 02:58:01.340]   it tends to be pretty partisan, right?
[02:58:01.340 --> 02:58:03.180]   This is completely--
[02:58:03.180 --> 02:58:06.420]   - Everybody agrees access to contraception is important.
[02:58:06.420 --> 02:58:08.660]   - 90% of people believe in this.
[02:58:08.660 --> 02:58:10.420]   - Except for Father Robert, I'm wrong.
[02:58:10.420 --> 02:58:11.260]   - Sorry, no offense.
[02:58:11.260 --> 02:58:12.940]   - I'm not saying anything, I would be late here.
[02:58:12.940 --> 02:58:15.260]   - Well, first of all, I cannot be snarky on this.
[02:58:15.260 --> 02:58:17.860]   - Seriously, the best way to cut abortion
[02:58:17.860 --> 02:58:21.660]   is early contraception, so they need to pay a risk.
[02:58:21.660 --> 02:58:24.140]   - 100%, so I am really, really, really--
[02:58:24.140 --> 02:58:27.100]   - So we could say 75% of this panel is pro-conscious.
[02:58:27.100 --> 02:58:29.060]   - 100%, I mean, don't, don't,
[02:58:29.060 --> 02:58:31.820]   die not gonna support any urge in your mouth.
[02:58:31.820 --> 02:58:33.900]   You can't say anything one way or the other.
[02:58:33.900 --> 02:58:34.740]   - That's it, exactly.
[02:58:34.740 --> 02:58:37.940]   - But in all seriousness, you know,
[02:58:37.940 --> 02:58:40.180]   something that I find really rewarding
[02:58:40.180 --> 02:58:42.140]   is working with other smart people.
[02:58:42.140 --> 02:58:45.220]   They're really plugged into the local legislature.
[02:58:45.220 --> 02:58:47.780]   This is not us trying to get someone elected.
[02:58:47.780 --> 02:58:50.900]   This is a very, very set set of policies
[02:58:50.900 --> 02:58:52.780]   that we're doing in Nevada,
[02:58:52.780 --> 02:58:56.420]   and, you know, just Arizona is on the slate,
[02:58:56.420 --> 02:58:58.100]   and we're just going state by state
[02:58:58.100 --> 02:59:00.260]   and it's gonna continue through the 2024--
[02:59:00.260 --> 02:59:01.900]   - Is this rebellion PAC doing this?
[02:59:01.900 --> 02:59:05.060]   - This is, I'm working with Progress Victory.
[02:59:05.060 --> 02:59:06.260]   - Progress Victory, okay.
[02:59:06.260 --> 02:59:08.180]   - And one of the really interesting projects
[02:59:08.180 --> 02:59:10.220]   that I'm working on, Leah, you probably noticed today
[02:59:10.220 --> 02:59:12.100]   that I've been talking more about streaming
[02:59:12.100 --> 02:59:13.540]   and things like that.
[02:59:13.540 --> 02:59:16.740]   So this group organized, realizes,
[02:59:16.740 --> 02:59:18.340]   unlike the Democratic Party,
[02:59:18.340 --> 02:59:21.500]   that if you're serious about winning in 2024,
[02:59:21.500 --> 02:59:23.020]   you've gotta get younger people involved.
[02:59:23.020 --> 02:59:25.140]   - AOC realizes that, but she's the one--
[02:59:25.140 --> 02:59:25.980]   - She's the one, she's the one.
[02:59:25.980 --> 02:59:26.900]   - 100%.
[02:59:26.900 --> 02:59:30.020]   So we are working with streamers and influencers.
[02:59:30.020 --> 02:59:35.020]   There's a study that came out that 75% of people under 30
[02:59:35.020 --> 02:59:38.340]   get all of their news from influencers.
[02:59:38.340 --> 02:59:39.980]   They don't read the times,
[02:59:39.980 --> 02:59:42.060]   they get their news from influencers.
[02:59:42.060 --> 02:59:43.340]   - That's impressive.
[02:59:43.340 --> 02:59:46.100]   - It is depressing, but it is realistic.
[02:59:46.100 --> 02:59:48.660]   So we're trying to develop a playbook
[02:59:48.660 --> 02:59:50.860]   to basically get that message out there
[02:59:50.860 --> 02:59:53.220]   and work with them to promote messages
[02:59:53.220 --> 02:59:55.460]   that they believe in, 'cause this is their health.
[02:59:55.460 --> 02:59:57.820]   - I wanna support you, where do I go to help?
[02:59:57.820 --> 03:00:00.220]   - You can go to Americans for contraception
[03:00:00.220 --> 03:00:02.020]   and support us there.
[03:00:02.020 --> 03:00:04.060]   - Americansforcontraception.com.
[03:00:04.060 --> 03:00:04.900]   - I think so.
[03:00:04.900 --> 03:00:06.620]   I've never plugged the Sun Show before,
[03:00:06.620 --> 03:00:07.940]   but that's the group we are.
[03:00:07.940 --> 03:00:10.540]   - Let's see if Google, yeah, it's .org.
[03:00:10.540 --> 03:00:11.620]   - Get my dog.
[03:00:11.620 --> 03:00:14.060]   - 'Cause it's an on-profit.
[03:00:14.060 --> 03:00:16.180]   And you can donate right there.
[03:00:16.180 --> 03:00:19.980]   You know, I donate 100 bucks a month to Planned Parenthood,
[03:00:19.980 --> 03:00:22.660]   'cause I'm a big believer in reproductive health
[03:00:22.660 --> 03:00:25.860]   and health rights, and I wanna support that,
[03:00:25.860 --> 03:00:27.500]   but I think this sounds like a very good--
[03:00:27.500 --> 03:00:29.540]   - It's so rumored, but it's never been confirmed
[03:00:29.540 --> 03:00:31.980]   that Bill Gates sponsored the contraception amendment
[03:00:31.980 --> 03:00:33.740]   in Colorado, do you know anything about it?
[03:00:33.740 --> 03:00:34.580]   - I don't know.
[03:00:34.580 --> 03:00:35.420]   - Okay, that was--
[03:00:35.420 --> 03:00:37.660]   - But yeah, something I was gonna say is
[03:00:37.660 --> 03:00:40.260]   we have an event coming up where we actually have
[03:00:40.260 --> 03:00:42.900]   a bunch of Christians that are gonna be arguing
[03:00:42.900 --> 03:00:45.660]   in a debate format actually talking about
[03:00:45.660 --> 03:00:48.020]   how they believe in contraception.
[03:00:48.020 --> 03:00:50.220]   They think it's a right for the same reason
[03:00:50.220 --> 03:00:51.580]   she support Planned Parenthood,
[03:00:51.580 --> 03:00:54.500]   that planned families are a good thing.
[03:00:54.500 --> 03:00:55.340]   - It's a good thing.
[03:00:55.340 --> 03:00:56.180]   - They give the kid what they need.
[03:00:56.180 --> 03:00:58.340]   - People should have families when they wanna have families,
[03:00:58.340 --> 03:01:01.380]   not because biology has decreed--
[03:01:01.380 --> 03:01:02.220]   - 100%.
[03:01:02.220 --> 03:01:05.420]   Americansforcontraception.org, good for you.
[03:01:05.420 --> 03:01:06.940]   - Really proud of this.
[03:01:06.940 --> 03:01:08.940]   - I love all the work you're doing, that's great.
[03:01:08.940 --> 03:01:09.780]   - Thank you, thank you.
[03:01:09.780 --> 03:01:11.260]   - And of course rebellionpack.com.
[03:01:11.260 --> 03:01:12.220]   - Always support us.
[03:01:12.220 --> 03:01:15.060]   - And Brianna Wu on the Twitter,
[03:01:15.060 --> 03:01:17.100]   what's your mastodon handle?
[03:01:17.100 --> 03:01:18.260]   - Oh gosh, I don't even know,
[03:01:18.260 --> 03:01:20.260]   it's pretty funny, look at it.
[03:01:20.260 --> 03:01:22.020]   - Are you in mastodon.social?
[03:01:22.020 --> 03:01:22.940]   Probably not, right?
[03:01:22.940 --> 03:01:23.940]   - I don't know.
[03:01:23.940 --> 03:01:25.540]   - How look it up, look at this.
[03:01:25.540 --> 03:01:26.380]   I can find it.
[03:01:26.380 --> 03:01:27.660]   - I love my mastodon, I really do,
[03:01:27.660 --> 03:01:29.020]   it's a great social network,
[03:01:29.020 --> 03:01:29.860]   and I record my--
[03:01:29.860 --> 03:01:31.100]   - Well I wanna get you more followers.
[03:01:31.100 --> 03:01:31.940]   - Involved on the--
[03:01:31.940 --> 03:01:34.620]   - You're at MSTDN.social.
[03:01:34.620 --> 03:01:35.460]   - Is that a good one?
[03:01:35.460 --> 03:01:36.300]   I really wanna move over.
[03:01:36.300 --> 03:01:37.140]   - It's a good one.
[03:01:37.140 --> 03:01:37.980]   - You can?
[03:01:37.980 --> 03:01:38.820]   - I don't know how to.
[03:01:38.820 --> 03:01:40.900]   - So if you go to your settings,
[03:01:40.900 --> 03:01:44.980]   there's a way to export your followers and following.
[03:01:44.980 --> 03:01:45.820]   - Okay.
[03:01:45.820 --> 03:01:47.740]   - You can't save your toots.
[03:01:47.740 --> 03:01:48.580]   - Oh.
[03:01:48.580 --> 03:01:51.860]   - So that's sad, your toots live on that site
[03:01:51.860 --> 03:01:53.620]   and you can't just take them,
[03:01:53.620 --> 03:01:56.500]   except by manually kind of exporting them.
[03:01:56.500 --> 03:01:58.060]   There's an RSS feed for your toots,
[03:01:58.060 --> 03:01:58.900]   so you could probably--
[03:01:58.900 --> 03:02:00.620]   - Look at all my drone photos.
[03:02:00.620 --> 03:02:02.180]   - Nice, nice.
[03:02:02.180 --> 03:02:04.540]   - And the cars and the cars, yup.
[03:02:04.540 --> 03:02:06.260]   - Wow, look at that, that's beautiful.
[03:02:06.260 --> 03:02:07.100]   Wow.
[03:02:07.100 --> 03:02:08.420]   - That's Massachusetts.
[03:02:08.420 --> 03:02:12.060]   - Yeah, Brianna Wu at MSTDN.social.
[03:02:12.060 --> 03:02:13.820]   There's no reason to move unless you,
[03:02:13.820 --> 03:02:15.420]   I mean I'd love to have you on Twitch social.
[03:02:15.420 --> 03:02:16.420]   - Hang on, hang on.
[03:02:16.420 --> 03:02:17.980]   - We can follow you on Twitch social,
[03:02:17.980 --> 03:02:19.460]   so it doesn't, you know, it doesn't--
[03:02:19.460 --> 03:02:22.540]   - I want to be part of a Mastodon instance
[03:02:22.540 --> 03:02:24.940]   that believes in the same things I do.
[03:02:24.940 --> 03:02:25.780]   - Right.
[03:02:25.780 --> 03:02:28.500]   - And you know, some of these battles that you've seen here,
[03:02:28.500 --> 03:02:32.500]   it just doesn't align with my paradigm of free speech.
[03:02:32.500 --> 03:02:35.020]   - I can't promise you that Twitch.social
[03:02:35.020 --> 03:02:36.940]   is progressive or liberal.
[03:02:36.940 --> 03:02:37.780]   - No, no, no.
[03:02:37.780 --> 03:02:39.780]   - It's just Twitch listeners of all stripes,
[03:02:39.780 --> 03:02:41.380]   of all points of view. - I want more people.
[03:02:41.380 --> 03:02:44.140]   - That's what I want. - Yeah, yeah.
[03:02:44.140 --> 03:02:45.500]   - That's my puppy.
[03:02:45.500 --> 03:02:47.860]   - Oh, what a cutie. - That's a little kaiju.
[03:02:47.860 --> 03:02:50.580]   - Kaiju, stop chewing on the power cables.
[03:02:50.580 --> 03:02:51.780]   - It's not okay.
[03:02:51.780 --> 03:02:53.780]   - Good luck, like any dog okay,
[03:02:53.780 --> 03:02:54.860]   I was gonna stop doing that.
[03:02:54.860 --> 03:02:56.660]   I love pugs, sockets.
[03:02:56.660 --> 03:02:58.580]   - Oh, I'm already following you on Mastodon.
[03:02:58.580 --> 03:03:00.220]   - Oh yeah. - Of course you are.
[03:03:00.220 --> 03:03:01.820]   - Wouldn't be.
[03:03:01.820 --> 03:03:06.820]   - Mr. Ian Thompson, the register.com.
[03:03:06.820 --> 03:03:12.620]   Ian Thompson is spelled weird, I-A-I-N-T-O-M-S-O-N.
[03:03:12.620 --> 03:03:13.860]   - Yes, indeed.
[03:03:13.860 --> 03:03:15.380]   It's spelled in a British way.
[03:03:15.380 --> 03:03:16.540]   - In the proper way.
[03:03:16.540 --> 03:03:17.380]   - Oh boy.
[03:03:17.380 --> 03:03:18.780]   - Proper way, gov.
[03:03:18.780 --> 03:03:22.620]   What's watching a movie the other night?
[03:03:22.620 --> 03:03:25.460]   The guy says, "None of you gov here, I'm sorry to you."
[03:03:25.460 --> 03:03:26.380]   - Oh, good.
[03:03:26.380 --> 03:03:27.940]   - Good grief.
[03:03:27.940 --> 03:03:29.420]   - At least on me it wasn't govritche.
[03:03:29.420 --> 03:03:30.940]   - It was called Deep End.
[03:03:30.940 --> 03:03:35.220]   It was a very weird 1970 movie featuring Jane Asher
[03:03:35.220 --> 03:03:36.580]   of all people.
[03:03:36.580 --> 03:03:38.620]   Working in a public bathhouse.
[03:03:38.620 --> 03:03:43.100]   In Britain they didn't have bathtubs until recently I think.
[03:03:43.100 --> 03:03:45.300]   So people would go to the public bathhouse.
[03:03:45.300 --> 03:03:46.140]   - It's so fun.
[03:03:46.140 --> 03:03:48.300]   - You know, it usually had a servant
[03:03:48.300 --> 03:03:49.220]   to actually fill them for.
[03:03:49.220 --> 03:03:50.380]   - Oh, well that's different.
[03:03:50.380 --> 03:03:51.220]   - Yes.
[03:03:51.220 --> 03:03:52.380]   - Well I don't know, I was watching Black Mirror
[03:03:52.380 --> 03:03:53.380]   or another holiday.
[03:03:53.380 --> 03:03:54.380]   - Oh, so.
[03:03:54.380 --> 03:03:55.220]   - So yeah.
[03:03:55.220 --> 03:03:56.060]   - What else?
[03:03:56.060 --> 03:03:56.900]   Anything else you want to plug?
[03:03:56.900 --> 03:03:58.460]   - Oh my God.
[03:03:58.460 --> 03:04:01.820]   The reds always around and always there.
[03:04:01.820 --> 03:04:03.260]   It's my second podcast of the week
[03:04:03.260 --> 03:04:04.900]   'cause we're now doing a regular weekly podcast.
[03:04:04.900 --> 03:04:06.260]   - Nice, that's right.
[03:04:06.260 --> 03:04:07.260]   Good for you.
[03:04:07.260 --> 03:04:09.060]   - Because as I discovered,
[03:04:09.060 --> 03:04:11.740]   the collection of noun for a bunch of vultures is a kettle.
[03:04:11.740 --> 03:04:13.820]   So it was seen to work.
[03:04:13.820 --> 03:04:15.620]   - So the pie gets called a kettle of--
[03:04:15.620 --> 03:04:16.460]   - The kettle of vultures, yes.
[03:04:16.460 --> 03:04:18.380]   - Vultures, wow.
[03:04:18.380 --> 03:04:20.300]   - I don't know why that started, but still.
[03:04:20.300 --> 03:04:21.140]   - So we'll put the kettle on,
[03:04:21.140 --> 03:04:23.180]   it's boil a bunch of vultures.
[03:04:23.180 --> 03:04:25.460]   - We like to keep things fairly bubbly, but.
[03:04:25.460 --> 03:04:26.300]   (laughing)
[03:04:26.300 --> 03:04:28.180]   - The real question is, can you keep them
[03:04:28.180 --> 03:04:30.180]   under an hour and a half?
[03:04:30.180 --> 03:04:31.540]   - Oh yeah, no, we limit it to,
[03:04:31.540 --> 03:04:33.540]   I think it's about 15, 20 minutes.
[03:04:33.540 --> 03:04:34.460]   - Oh my God.
[03:04:34.460 --> 03:04:35.900]   - Yeah, I don't know how to do that.
[03:04:35.900 --> 03:04:38.220]   - Well, we only discuss one story
[03:04:38.220 --> 03:04:41.140]   and we eliminate the swearing mostly.
[03:04:41.140 --> 03:04:44.060]   - Oh, that probably saves quite a bit of time.
[03:04:44.060 --> 03:04:45.740]   - That's a negative museum.
[03:04:45.740 --> 03:04:47.980]   - Yeah, no, I mean, some stuff's it.
[03:04:47.980 --> 03:04:49.540]   I mean, we discussed the,
[03:04:49.540 --> 03:04:52.420]   I was talking about this team's profanity ban
[03:04:52.420 --> 03:04:54.540]   with the other day and just like,
[03:04:54.540 --> 03:04:57.020]   I wonder how geographical it is.
[03:04:57.020 --> 03:04:59.580]   His wanker or cockwomble gonna be allowed in there
[03:04:59.580 --> 03:05:02.660]   and it's just like, I've got a feeling,
[03:05:02.660 --> 03:05:05.860]   you know, there's gonna be some intensive research going on
[03:05:05.860 --> 03:05:09.620]   and just what, you can slip past the team's team.
[03:05:09.620 --> 03:05:11.420]   - Look for Kettle of Vultures
[03:05:11.420 --> 03:05:14.180]   at a podcast player near you, indeed.
[03:05:14.180 --> 03:05:16.140]   Folks, that's it for this twit boy.
[03:05:16.140 --> 03:05:19.420]   I didn't wanna end it so soon, but after three hours.
[03:05:19.420 --> 03:05:20.260]   - It's time.
[03:05:20.260 --> 03:05:21.100]   - It's time, it's time.
[03:05:21.100 --> 03:05:21.940]   - Look how you do it.
[03:05:21.940 --> 03:05:24.020]   - Goodness, it really has been three hours, yeah.
[03:05:24.020 --> 03:05:27.660]   - Okay, I don't know how I keep trying, I try.
[03:05:27.660 --> 03:05:29.460]   - No, you're not trying to try it.
[03:05:29.460 --> 03:05:31.980]   - I'm doing it way too much, right, seriously.
[03:05:31.980 --> 03:05:33.740]   - No, you're not.
[03:05:33.740 --> 03:05:36.580]   - You know, my philosophy is if you want a 90 minute podcast,
[03:05:36.580 --> 03:05:39.940]   just stop it at 90 minutes and that's it, you're done.
[03:05:39.940 --> 03:05:43.940]   Or in this case, yeah, you get two 90 minute podcasts,
[03:05:43.940 --> 03:05:45.340]   but then you'll have next week,
[03:05:45.340 --> 03:05:47.140]   it's like a pile of net New Yorkers
[03:05:47.140 --> 03:05:49.540]   or national geographic just pile out of it.
[03:05:49.540 --> 03:05:50.780]   - I know, I know.
[03:05:50.780 --> 03:05:51.620]   - We're sorry.
[03:05:51.620 --> 03:05:53.700]   - You've had to do clean outs on those.
[03:05:53.700 --> 03:05:55.180]   - Oh, you don't have to do graphics
[03:05:55.180 --> 03:05:56.020]   faring all that stuff.
[03:05:56.020 --> 03:05:57.140]   - I did, I know.
[03:05:57.140 --> 03:05:59.140]   - Because they're owned by?
[03:05:59.140 --> 03:05:59.980]   - I don't know.
[03:05:59.980 --> 03:06:01.420]   - Oh, is it Disney?
[03:06:01.420 --> 03:06:02.620]   - It's Discovery.
[03:06:02.620 --> 03:06:03.980]   - Discovery.
[03:06:03.980 --> 03:06:05.180]   - Oh, for goodness sake.
[03:06:05.180 --> 03:06:07.660]   - So naturally they had to fire everybody.
[03:06:07.660 --> 03:06:09.500]   So sad.
[03:06:09.500 --> 03:06:11.780]   - Oh, actually, and Discovery is not owned by Disney.
[03:06:11.780 --> 03:06:12.780]   - It's by Disney, yeah.
[03:06:12.780 --> 03:06:13.860]   - Yeah, so.
[03:06:13.860 --> 03:06:15.460]   (laughing)
[03:06:15.460 --> 03:06:16.300]   - Yeah.
[03:06:16.300 --> 03:06:17.540]   - Just scraping for money.
[03:06:17.540 --> 03:06:18.380]   - Oh, I know.
[03:06:18.380 --> 03:06:19.220]   - Good poor.
[03:06:19.220 --> 03:06:23.180]   - So no more staff writers, but the magazine goes on.
[03:06:23.180 --> 03:06:25.620]   I'm presuming using putchy pictures
[03:06:25.620 --> 03:06:27.340]   and freelancers willing to work cheap,
[03:06:27.340 --> 03:06:30.020]   but the articles kind of made that magazine.
[03:06:30.020 --> 03:06:32.540]   It was like, and they said it was like playboy.
[03:06:32.540 --> 03:06:34.900]   - And if you ever needed more incentive
[03:06:34.900 --> 03:06:37.900]   to join Club Twit, they laid off 17 editorial positions,
[03:06:37.900 --> 03:06:39.340]   including all the staff writers,
[03:06:39.340 --> 03:06:41.580]   the entire podcast staff.
[03:06:41.580 --> 03:06:42.420]   - How good.
[03:06:42.420 --> 03:06:43.940]   - And a group of editors who'd been on staff,
[03:06:43.940 --> 03:06:47.140]   some of them for 40 years.
[03:06:47.140 --> 03:06:51.620]   - Didn't that geo or Discovery by revision three?
[03:06:51.620 --> 03:06:52.460]   - Discovery did.
[03:06:52.460 --> 03:06:53.300]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:06:53.300 --> 03:06:55.860]   - All right, we gotta be at dinner in nine minutes.
[03:06:55.860 --> 03:06:56.900]   - Let's go, kids.
[03:06:56.900 --> 03:06:57.900]   - Okay.
[03:06:57.900 --> 03:06:59.340]   - If you wanna watch the show live,
[03:06:59.340 --> 03:07:02.580]   you can every Sunday, two to five PM Eastern time.
[03:07:02.580 --> 03:07:05.820]   It is, that's, let's see.
[03:07:05.820 --> 03:07:07.980]   No, that's two to five Pacific time.
[03:07:07.980 --> 03:07:12.420]   That's five to eight PM Eastern time, 2100 UTC.
[03:07:12.420 --> 03:07:15.620]   Let me get my math straight at live.twit.tv.
[03:07:15.620 --> 03:07:17.980]   If you're watching live chat live in our IRC,
[03:07:17.980 --> 03:07:20.500]   open to all IRC.twit.tv.
[03:07:20.500 --> 03:07:22.140]   Club Twit members of course have access
[03:07:22.140 --> 03:07:25.380]   to the special club twit discord.
[03:07:25.380 --> 03:07:28.660]   You can also get the shows after the fact on demand
[03:07:28.660 --> 03:07:31.020]   at our website twit.tv.
[03:07:31.020 --> 03:07:34.260]   You can also, let's see get it on YouTube.
[03:07:34.260 --> 03:07:35.860]   There's a YouTube dedicated channel.
[03:07:35.860 --> 03:07:37.980]   I think the best thing to do is subscribe
[03:07:37.980 --> 03:07:39.740]   in your favorite podcast player.
[03:07:39.740 --> 03:07:41.300]   And that way you'll get it automatically
[03:07:41.300 --> 03:07:43.780]   just in time for your Monday morning commute.
[03:07:43.780 --> 03:07:44.620]   Thank you.
[03:07:44.620 --> 03:07:46.540]   It's so great to have everybody live in studio.
[03:07:46.540 --> 03:07:47.860]   So great to see you all.
[03:07:47.860 --> 03:07:49.060]   Thank you for joining us.
[03:07:49.060 --> 03:07:49.940]   We'll see you next time.
[03:07:49.940 --> 03:07:51.940]   Another twit is in the camera.
[03:07:51.940 --> 03:07:52.780]   It's so amazing.
[03:07:52.780 --> 03:07:55.360]   (upbeat music)
