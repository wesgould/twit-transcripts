[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.120]   We're gonna have some fun. We've got a little bit of Microsoft news. Fortunately. We've got Daniel Rabino here editor in chief of windows central
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.320]   Hello, Daniel
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.360]   Hello, thanks for having me. It's already confusing. We got two dans on the on the show and already the
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.400]   The control room is confused. It's great to have you Daniel. Thank you for joining us sitting next to Daniel is Dan
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:51.800]   I'll call me Dan and I'll call him Daniel. It's great to see you again Dan Patterson long-time friend of the show. Yeah
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:04:00.680]   contributor is eating it. Yeah, and yeah proud Papa. You're sitting right you're sitting above your child's bed right now
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.240]   No, usually I said above my child's bed, but it is child bed time my wife is
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:13.720]   Preachously and putting her bed. Usually I record on a platform above her head, but you know that tends to wake up the baby. I
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.920]   Can't believe she's almost one that's
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:24.760]   Cuses like she was just born yesterday. I know that's the way they go is she so she's is she walking?
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.640]   She must be yeah, oh well. She wants to walk and talk so I mean she's she's saying words just nobody else understands
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.600]   What she's saying I got my substrate. There's no close. I'm saying stuff. She's so close so close
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.960]   Well, if she's anything like my daughter enjoy these brief moments of quiet
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.860]   Knowing her parents she is going to have strong opinions about talk her talk her for a living
[00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:55.320]   Yep, that's what Abi inherited also with us from Cnet. It's great to see a bra all he'd he it's been a long time. Welcome back
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.280]   Thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to be back video host and producer at Cnet and
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.400]   Good friend too. So we have a really nice
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.360]   panel to discuss
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.760]   Well, let's see where should we start? I guess since you're here, Daniel
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:20.680]   We probably should talk about the fact that and already the appeals court the Ninth Circuit has upheld the decision saying go ahead Microsoft
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.320]   Just buy act division go ahead
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:31.080]   We watched with interest the trial in San Francisco with a lower court and testimony from Sacha Nadella and Phil Spencer
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.960]   everybody from Microsoft talking about how this acquisition of
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.400]   Activision wouldn't harm gaming and and all of that the judge said yeah
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.840]   FTC sorry you got no case
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.280]   FTC was looking for a an injunction a temporary
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:54.000]   restraining order to keep Microsoft from making the acquisition before the August hearing from an administrative judge
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.580]   FTC appealed and as expected lost like instantly
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.580]   It's over basically right
[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.220]   Yeah, I mean technically the appeal is still out there
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.780]   and it could go through
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:16.180]   Would they go to the Supreme Court with the FTC go to the Supreme isn't that what's next the nights are going to win it?
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.580]   They're not no yeah
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.140]   I mean they're not going to win it and even if you know Microsoft closes the deal at this point them
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.100]   Was it FTC going to try to break them apart?
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:31.760]   Find them, you know, it's just this was politically unpopular Linda Kahn went in front of Congress
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.500]   Congressional oversight committee this week
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:40.940]   Granted Republican controlled she's appointed by a Democrat such as the natural politics going on there
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:41.580]   but
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:47.100]   They brought up a couple legit questions like you you know got your butt handed to you in court
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:53.540]   Like flat out like why are you appealing this and wasting taxpayer money and you know she was asked
[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.660]   Kind of rhetorically, but you know should you know?
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:02.780]   Are you bringing court cases that you know we're going to lose and of course like no, you know, of course not but it's like
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.460]   that decision by the judge earlier on the
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.020]   injunction was
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:15.020]   You know flat out obvious it there was no like wiggle room for them. There was no like little
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:21.060]   Bit of light, you know saying that like well if you just showed this right I might have considered it
[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:27.620]   It was just completely shut down and so the only way appeals go through is if you can demonstrate that there were some kind of
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.340]   judiciary issue, you know
[00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.820]   the
[00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:36.180]   prosecution withheld something that defense didn't have something like you have to show something was wrong
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.100]   But there was nothing wrong in this case
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:44.020]   So it was even funny that they appealed and yeah, so now the injunction, you know is it not gonna happen
[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.740]   It looks like mark or something is going to close the deal
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.300]   They were supposed to close it well
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.300]   They're gonna be closing it this week in the next couple days
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:54.100]   And that's when we the FTC their behavior kind of like
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:08:00.180]   They knew they were trying to trip up the closing date because we're this to fail
[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:07.620]   Microsoft would be on the hook for three billion dollars were to not go through it the break out of the yeah, right
[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.260]   Yeah, yeah, and so
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.780]   It looks like they're gonna go through the only thing now is the UK
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:21.740]   The UK still an issue, but even that went from we made our decision. That's it too. Well, I
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:26.060]   Guess now will maybe take some concessions a few more
[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:32.380]   Negotiations here and there because those are the only two was the UK and the United States the rest of the world was like yep fine
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:38.100]   All right, you know and Microsoft was very proactive in making concessions and trying to say listen
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.980]   We're not going to keep calm duty off of like PlayStation
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.740]   You know, we're going to play fair with these
[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.700]   It was a weird case because
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:53.380]   Microsoft is like a distant third and I quit the Activision Blizzard. They may have a shot at number two
[00:08:53.380 --> 00:09:00.220]   May and every every country in the world had already approved including Japan Sony's home nation. Yeah, it said go ahead
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:07.220]   I mean, it's reasonable for anti trust regulators to look at it. It was a very big
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.420]   acquisition and it
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.020]   Microsoft was quick to say oh, we're still number three
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.700]   But it made them a lot bigger in gaming
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.860]   Sure, and I and you know and it
[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.740]   The argument that oh
[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.900]   Lena Khan keeps bringing cases and losing cases she lost against meta
[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:32.020]   Trying to keep them from buying that fitness app with from within
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.500]   I
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.580]   Think you could make the argument that even the threat of
[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:45.300]   This action is enough to keep companies a little bit careful, and I don't think that's a bad thing
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.140]   Yeah, I mean the last time a
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:54.820]   Vertical merger like this happened. I think a well-timed right it didn't go so well
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:58.260]   I definitely want regulators to at least keep their eye on
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:04.060]   Acquisitions like this. Yeah, it is also the case though that this is why they wanted the injunction
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:10.660]   Once the acquisition happens is a lot harder to unwind that then it is to stop it before it happens
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:16.620]   So what happens Daniel in the UK now if if Microsoft goes ahead and they're expected by Tuesday to
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:22.020]   Finalize the deal then what is the UK just say well?
[00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.380]   What have we told you to stop what do they do? I?
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:32.980]   Mean worst case scenario which won't happen is like Microsoft closes the deal this goes through and it just block UK
[00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:40.260]   We're not gonna sell it in the UK. So you win. Yeah, congratulations like you're cut off enjoy your your Libra office
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.720]   Yeah, yeah, they just carve them out that won't happen though
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:49.260]   Obviously the UK is feeling the pressure now because they're the only one Microsoft says I hope you like Linux
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:58.100]   Yeah, it seems like the deal that's might go through is that Microsoft might sell off some the cloud hosting
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:03.820]   Yeah, the UK's concern was weird. It was that they would be too dominant in cloud gaming
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:09.100]   Which is yeah, not a hybrid category it is not
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:15.140]   Stadium the companies that are doing it like Nvidia's GeForce now Microsoft's
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:22.060]   Game Xbox game pass or no, what do they call it? I can't even remember what they call it. Yeah. Yeah Xbox game pass
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:26.800]   There's now. They're struggling. They're not huge by any means. Yeah
[00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:32.180]   Yeah, and I was revealed during the core case right they showed that like it's very soft right now for
[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:37.780]   Cloud gaming there's a lot of potential there. We have a couple new handhelds out
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:43.420]   You know, but it's I could tell you even the handhelds are steamed at the a-son. Yeah, no
[00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:49.820]   Yeah, so it's like it's a weird argument, but yeah, they could you know let a local
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:57.340]   Company handle the cloud stuff in the UK and it rails will be happy just hopefully that
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.340]   Company can deliver the experience that Microsoft
[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:07.820]   expects Xbox cloud gaming to deliver the UK movie a date line the deadline back in time or forward in time
[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:13.980]   Indicating to I guess to experts. Oh, this means they're they're going to be negotiating some sort of
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:17.220]   Yeah, minor
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.300]   concession so that they can save face and back down
[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:24.700]   I think it's a thing has just been strange. Yeah, it's been strange
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:31.140]   I mean I understand like if you're Sony listen if you're Sony and you're you know CEO you have to fight this right?
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:37.700]   That's your obligation to the your your shareholders. You have to try to block this as much as possible even though
[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:46.300]   You're in it really didn't feel like Sony got the whole world all the regulators in every country to step up like
[00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:50.700]   You should do something about this, but it was more that they was it the rear
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.340]   I mean it ended up they were worried the call of duty
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:13:03.500]   Which is made by Activision and is a huge title on PlayStation would suddenly become exclusive to Microsoft's Xbox and they were worried about that but
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:09.980]   Microsoft said no, no, we'll we'll make a deal with you. They made a deal with Nintendo. They no no
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:14.620]   We're not this we're only Microsoft said is it credible Daniel Merbino that
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:21.940]   This is just to get into mobile gaming which we're not a part of and rights. That's the whole reason for this. Is that credible?
[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:27.500]   Yeah, I mean between the cloud gaming aspect which is geared towards mobile users
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:32.540]   You can basically get a console experience on your smartphone directly as well as the stores
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:36.700]   You know they can launch their own store because yeah blizzard
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:42.380]   Activision King you know King it has a lot of games that is candy crush right?
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.620]   Yeah
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.820]   Boomers and Gen Xers unite
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.900]   Yeah, we're favorite games still apparently
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:55.100]   But it's it's a huge business and it's still an amazingly popular game and allows Microsoft to yeah
[00:13:55.100 --> 00:14:02.340]   I get a foothold into mobile gaming. It's gotta be a good business. They're paying 69 billion dollars billion dollars
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:08.740]   Yeah, it's it's which goes to show you how much cash had laying around I believe they had a hundred and thirty billion laying around so
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:13.540]   Again as a corporation you can't sit on like 30 billion dollars for long
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:20.740]   You either got to give it back to the shareholders at some point or you make a big acquisition or multiple acquisitions that benefit the company
[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:24.100]   So that's what Microsoft is doing here, but the whole thing was just kind of strange
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.300]   I understand Sony was you know had to fight it legally, you know
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:33.540]   But the same time emails came out showing that even Sony wasn't like oh we know this won't really do anything to us
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:38.020]   Because and Nadella even came out said like listen we don't like exclusives
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:43.340]   You know if we could choose we would not have exclusives for gaming we think it's bad
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:49.460]   And that is kind of his thing lately, right? I mean ever since he came in he undid all the bomber stuff. Alma was very much
[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:56.540]   Exclusive to Windows. We're gonna form our own Apple like ecosystem. The Dela came in and said now we're doing that
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:02.340]   We're putting Linux every where we want we're gonna, you know put our apps wherever we can we're gonna support every platform
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:09.060]   So I really believe him that he doesn't want exclusives as much, but Sony is so into exclusive
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:16.300]   And that's the irony Sony's the bad guy when it comes to exclusives. They really do they nailed it
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:20.180]   Yeah, I mean they pay so much money, but they have so many like I
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.460]   You know it was halo and like years of war
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:29.980]   Forza still there for us. They're still doing more but like Microsoft and Xbox just does not have a flagship game anymore
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.060]   Where is Sony's got a couple that you know they have the
[00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:41.220]   Was that God of war the spider-man series like they have like a bunch of really really good titles and they run commercials all the time
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.860]   Hammering that so it's a it's a weird case, but
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:48.820]   Thankfully looks like Sony has signed the 10 year deal for Call of Duty
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:53.820]   I thought they'd already made that agreement, but I guess maybe they'd agreed to it in principle
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:58.300]   But they hadn't they hadn't signed it so now it is a binding agreement the Call of Duty will stay on PlayStation
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.980]   For at least 10 years according to Phil Spencer tweeting yesterday
[00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:05.860]   And it can be renegotiated in 2033
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:13.380]   Yeah, and why would Microsoft look Microsoft as they as we've learned doesn't make any money on Xbox. It's kind of a loser
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:17.780]   Why wouldn't they try to make some money selling on a PlayStation?
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:22.180]   Why would they do it makes a question right say say they did make all dude exclusive to Xbox?
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:27.260]   What would the return of value be like are they gonna really catch up now to Sony all of a sudden in console sales
[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.780]   Just because a Call of Duty and the revenue there
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:35.380]   No, of course not would they make more money keeping on PlayStation and still selling the game to them?
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:37.420]   Yes, they're gonna make way more money that way
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:41.820]   So it doesn't really make sense for them to even make it exclusive outside of just being bitter
[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.060]   Balmer might have done that they'll give me rock
[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:52.620]   Steve Balmer might have done Steve Jobs. Yeah, no such a such a changed Microsoft. He said what it used to be
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:58.740]   In fact the Microsoft mission statement was every computer on every desktop running
[00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:01.540]   Microsoft software and
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:07.140]   And Satya Nadella said we want to be wherever our customers are on any platform. They are and
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:15.460]   That was a huge shift and actually as as everybody who has Microsoft stock knows a very good a very good shift
[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:20.340]   Stock market likes what happened on Friday as well
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:27.420]   So I guess Phil Spencer had offered this agreement in January to Sony, but just on he said we're not January of last year
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:32.300]   But Sony said we're not gonna say we're not gonna sign that we're gonna we're gonna find it
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.300]   Why would we sign if we think we can beat you?
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:42.340]   Came close right, you know the FTC like I think through more sand into the gears of this and a lot of people anticipated
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:49.100]   They were really caught and it was just a strange thing and I'm all 40 FTC and you know watching tech companies
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:54.340]   And you know, but this just was not that case, you know, it's like social media sure
[00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:58.900]   Let's take a look at that advertising sure. Let's take a look at that one bug gaming
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.460]   Yeah, I don't know that was a weird stretch
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:05.220]   It's not that a big a bra and Dan. I feel like we're leaving you out
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:09.500]   Are you guys gamers at all do you care about do you care and the least about this a bra? I?
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:14.540]   I'm sitting back and letting Dan and Dan. I'll take this conversation because I am not a gamer
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:19.300]   Come on do you play any games anything?
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:23.260]   No, you know that that class a question of when a kid sits sits next to you
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:28.420]   And is like do you have any games on your phone my nephew's always asking me that and I don't like it's I'm incredibly boring
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.260]   What do you do with your life if you don't play times? Oh?
[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:42.100]   It needs a lot of time Dan Dan you play you play Diablo three you said before you got married
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.300]   I I became a gamer in my adulthood
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:50.780]   And kind of because I mean I like the systems in games. I like
[00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:56.780]   Figuring out it's like a puzzle right figure out the mechanics of a game and you figure out how things work
[00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:02.300]   It's kind of like tech right or or Linux or any type of a coding environment, right?
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:06.020]   You're trying to figure out systems and how they work. I was more look
[00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:06.740]   I agree
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.740]   I kind of want regulators to pay attention to different or maybe larger issues
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:14.860]   But I think that this was a good thing to pay attention to and I understand Sony's grievance
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.780]   Look, it sounds chilly to have an argument about Call of Duty
[00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:24.260]   Which is if you watched or read or listened to these hearings it really seemed to come down to Call of Duty
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:29.660]   But I can understand in ten years Microsoft and Daniel you rightly point out
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:36.740]   Microsoft has pivoted to services a long time ago and I can understand Sony saying hey look the hardware market might be shrinking
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:40.420]   And if Microsoft totally takes over cloud and services
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:44.260]   We could I mean exclusives only last as long as the next console
[00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:52.780]   We could shrink and there could be no competitors left for us to buy there could be no studios or very few studios that are capable of creating
[00:19:52.780 --> 00:20:01.900]   Triple-A quality games that we have as exclusive. So I understand Sony's fear Microsoft is a trillion-dollar company and them
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:09.700]   Making a vertical acquisition like this and integrating the service providers into the Xbox as the platform
[00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:13.860]   I would be scared and I think that consumers have a right to be
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:18.220]   Kind of wary of this acquisition because in the past
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:21.100]   Acquisitions like this have never gone well
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.100]   Having said that as a gamer
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:30.780]   I really would like Bobby Kotick the CEO of Activision blizzard king the guy who oversaw sexual harassment the guy who was
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:34.540]   Responsible for all kinds of union busting. I'd like that guy to leave
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:40.380]   I would like at least the studio to not be as noxious as it has been in the last
[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:44.700]   Decade or so well and as I say this was Bobby's way of getting out
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.980]   He's gonna clear billions of dollars in this answer
[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:53.740]   But I think he's still is any on the board still Daniel. I think he is he does still have like a role
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.340]   They haven't been as
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:56.540]   Yeah, I agree with Dan here
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:01.220]   They have not been is let's kick him out with the picture as much as I think a lot of us would like
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.780]   But he still does play a pretty big role in this
[00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:04.340]   Yeah
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:07.420]   And you know the company does have a lot to go through and Microsoft
[00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:11.180]   Yeah, you know their history of acquisitions is kind of mixed right like some of them
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:16.460]   But they're gaming history is not bad. Yeah, I mean overture was bet but but look what they did with Minecraft
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:22.620]   They were I think very good stewards great Minecraft. Yeah, they've they've improved this bill Spencer groan. Yeah
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:29.620]   The head of a trial Spencer's and lately GitHub that that we were all worried about the GitHub acquisition
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:35.900]   But that's been all right. I don't know I linked in I they certainly didn't change linked in I don't know
[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:40.580]   They're they're making a lot of money. Are they the membership of linked in is grown? Yeah, okay?
[00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:45.220]   So they've been a good story there. It's a prop. It's a new Twitter. Yeah. Yeah
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:48.660]   Whatever professionals, there's so many new Twitter's though. I don't know
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:56.220]   With social web is atomized and dead. Yeah, except it's not that's what's really we'll talk about that a little bit
[00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:59.300]   Yeah, get rid of Bobby Kotick for sure
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:05.420]   There's also I mean they talked about Call of Duty, but there's World of Warcraft
[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:12.740]   There's Diablo 4 just came out there. There's there's a lot of games. This is a big portfolio and
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:18.260]   You know don't forget we talk about gaming here, but that IP is important in other ways, right?
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:24.660]   What's the big thing we've been seeing lately is converting those kind of video games into blockbuster movies or TV series?
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:29.000]   Yeah, Microsoft controls at IP that said Microsoft hasn't had good luck yet
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.340]   In this into you know looking what they did the Halo series. Yeah mediocre reviews
[00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:41.100]   But up chair is compared to like the last of us right yeah, Sony and nailed right so Sony is actually really good at this stuff
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:46.340]   So I would love to see the Diablo series convert to a movie. We're all hoping for Gears of War
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:52.060]   That's been in the works forever. We've bought Dave Bautista like literally stepped up and said let me play the lead
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:57.820]   Well, he is well, so you're gonna guess he's perfect. Yeah, you know, so it's like they could do all this
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:03.040]   But it does have a lot of value besides yeah, just gave me right they the long-form TV series
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:09.920]   Premiere, you know prestige TV has a lot of potential. That's where the 70 billion comes into play. It's not gaming
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:16.600]   It's not mobile. It's IP. It's like the Marvel Cinematic Universe or Star Wars. It's yep
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:21.400]   And by the way Star Wars was a lot cheaper than this that was a hell of a deal for Disney
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.520]   Wow, 70 billion dollars. All right, so
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:31.660]   The next step before Windows weekly on Wednesday, it's probably likely that they will announce the acquisition has gone through. It's done
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:36.640]   The UK is gonna be left holding kind of a limp hand, but I guess maybe they'll
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:44.280]   Get some re some concession some face-saving concession out of Microsoft and then and then it's over as
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.120]   a gamer
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:52.120]   It makes me a little nervous to see consolidation. I liked I think
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:56.960]   From the I have mixed feelings. We talked about this little on Windows weekly
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:02.320]   It is the case that these days it costs more to make a triple a game than it costs to make a major motion picture
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.680]   It's hundreds of millions dollars. So in development hell
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:13.800]   So it isn't likely that a small independent garage startup is gonna create the next big game anyway
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:23.040]   Yeah, I a little disagree with that. We've seen quite a lot of studios come up over the recent years granted to get snatched up kind of quickly now
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:26.200]   You know, so there is that but you know, I think it like vampire survivors
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:30.240]   It's a three dollars and nine nine cent game that you now know where and it's just like now
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.840]   That's not called duty level, right? But there is still potential
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:37.640]   And that's what I want to make sure that we there's still a place for innovation
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:44.600]   And and it's not it does, you know, look what happened in the movie industry. It's it's blockbuster after blockbuster
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.920]   Nobody's making the little you know
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:54.760]   Movie anymore indie films right now indie gaming is a thing. I mean and there is still steam
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.920]   Which is the you know nine million
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:02.160]   Real, right? Yeah, it is the iTunes of gaming. It's the distribution platform
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.320]   And and to this point they've been pretty laissez-faire
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:13.600]   I a bro, I'm curious like what is your take on all this as a non game or like what are the implications of this outside the gaming nerd world?
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:17.120]   Yeah, I'm kind of observing this very much on the outside
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:23.760]   But yeah, I think it's it's fascinating to see discussions about monopolies kind of it within in the gaming sphere and in all the parallels
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:29.800]   I mean, I just even observing big tech in general and and and the ways that it's you know
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:33.440]   The ways that there's a lot of scrutiny and and to see it extend into the gaming world
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.720]   I think I don't know enough to say how I feel personally about it
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.360]   but
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:43.200]   it is it is curious to see these companies just kind of in all these in all these parallels and and and what they
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:49.080]   want to acquire and and all those all those sectors, but yeah, I'm learning a lot just listening to you guys
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.320]   Do you share my concern?
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:57.680]   I'm rather though that on the one hand you do need to be you know, there would be no vision pro without Apple having just
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.960]   Billions a dollar to throw away, right?
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:04.680]   So on the one hand you do need these big tech companies to do kind of these big
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:11.560]   Things but but I also worry that you'd lose some innovation if you don't and you know one of the problems of gaming
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:17.360]   And this is where big problem in Activision pleasure was it it was for a long time just a bunch of bros
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:22.880]   And so the games weren't representative. They were really violent. They they were the kind of things
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:27.760]   You know the John Carmex of the world and the and the Romero's of the world wanted to play
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.840]   I think diversity and
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:36.920]   Small Indies are important to any creative outlet. Yes
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.600]   Yeah, and I think we
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:44.920]   Go ahead. Sorry. Go ahead. Well, I was just gonna say I think you know that what you're saying reflects a lot of what we've seen with these
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:48.440]   You know smaller startups that are acquired by companies like meta for example, right?
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:53.840]   So you see all these those two sides of the argument where it's like okay that platform could grow because it was acquired by meta or Google
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:59.840]   But then you see a lot of people leave because the objective of the company changes and the culture changes
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:05.520]   Sometimes for better sometimes for worse. So yeah, it is interesting to see that kind of in the gaming realm as well. Yeah
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.920]   Meta did eventually get
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:14.680]   Supernatural they were able to acquire within even though the FTC wanted to stop that that was another one of the losses that
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:18.000]   They talk about with when you know to your green that do oh
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:25.640]   Sorry, well to your point about the the very broish and misogynistic nature of gaming
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:28.400]   We have to look no further than Brianna Wu. I mean she was a
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:36.960]   Yeah, gamer gate. She was totally yeah, totally abused in game again still is by the way. It hasn't stopped. Yeah. Oh
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.780]   No, it has not yeah gamers are still
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.400]   Talk to take a deep breath. Yeah
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:47.280]   Yeah, it's not the hope of the world is mobile gaming. Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead Daniel finish your thought
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.600]   I didn't mean to change
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:53.320]   Yeah, no, I was gonna say about the indie gaming like I was kind of agreeing with Dan there with you know steam is just like
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:59.280]   I love steam steams has so much you really have like talk about indie like you have games that are created
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:07.680]   So not by one or two individuals and they they get like business like they get great reviews and like all the PC gaming sites
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:12.000]   Do eventually pick it up and you know often I see a lot more coverage of them
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.360]   Then I do like the call of duties because everybody knows about those
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:22.280]   But like the indie stuff is really great because it's so much more like one reason I haven't bought Diablo 4 is it's like 70 bucks
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:28.880]   You know, but I can go get like other games for 10 $15 and have just as much fun
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:32.440]   Now my job does do a really good job my opinion of highlighting indies
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:39.320]   So they end up offering like often going and taking a lot of the stuff on steam and getting it on Xbox and even putting it into
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:43.640]   Their game pass and people can just play all these really cool games. I've been a big fan of it
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:47.720]   It was one reason I got into Nintendo switch initially. I didn't care about any of Nintendo's IP
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:52.160]   They had a lot of steam IP though a lot of steam indie games were appearing on it
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:56.360]   And that's what I wanted to play and my husband they have their ID at Xbox program
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:00.160]   They support any developers a lot because I think there is a lot of
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.840]   We do focus law on the triple-a titles and they are big business
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:09.080]   But those small indie ones are also big business too or just on a different scale
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.360]   And I think it's a really interesting thing and I think it'll be fine
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:17.400]   I think those you know right now what we're seeing call boomer shooters. We did a whole like wrap up
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:22.960]   Our basically remakes of doom games from the 90s
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:29.640]   And people are just taking that same graphics and this pixel art kind of thing and making these first-person shooters
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.720]   They're really affordable. They're like ten dollars half the time
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:36.880]   They're a lot of fun to play they play on any low-end system and for people like my age
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.160]   We're like hell yeah, this is where it's you know
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:43.720]   The gaming is I think still very strong and will be strong regardless of this deal because I know myself
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:46.800]   I don't play Call of Duty. I don't play World of Warcraft
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:51.520]   I play a lot of like the sides the side scrollers and indie stuff from steam
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.680]   I thought I mean I'm waving my steam deck around here
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.920]   But this is I mean also I play Microsoft games on my steam deck
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:01.360]   It's the most interesting gadget released in years. It's a Linux. Absolutely
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.480]   You know this is if you want to hack on a Linux computer
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:09.640]   The Steam Deck is the best place to do it and it's open you can install whatever you want including Diablo 4
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:14.920]   Which I I've used us to play D4. Yes, we'll be talking about the steam deck in 20 years
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:21.640]   That'll be regarded as interesting one of the most innovative advice. Yeah, it seems just like a copy of the switch to me
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.880]   No, no switch that could play Linux games
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:29.840]   Yeah, I mean, it's like a handheld PC right it's a PC in a form factor. They just make something
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:36.080]   It scratches that like if you don't have time to really hack on Linux anymore because you're an adult
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:40.520]   And you just got stuff to do and your PC needs to get stuff done for you get a steam deck
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:45.840]   Then you can monkey around with Linux so you actually don't just play the games you actually drop into Linux on that thing
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:51.900]   Oh, yeah, absolutely. There's desktop mode you you click two buttons and you're in desktop mode. It'll plug right into your
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:59.000]   Monitor they sell a dock for it that props it up and plugs into your monitor and just runs all windows 11
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:05.920]   Allied the raw G. Ally from aces is a windows machine, which I thought was kind of rising. Yeah
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:11.720]   It's a really good device. It is not I played with the steam deck when we when it first came out
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:17.640]   I was pre-ordering all that I just it's like I the game I play which is actually interesting
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:23.600]   You should mention this is a $20 indie game at a sweet and 10 developers called Valheim
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.840]   But it's incredibly competitive compelling. Oh, yeah, and in fact, they've made hundreds of millions of dollars
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:32.360]   They haven't even come out of beta yet. They're just like raking it in
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:37.360]   And I played it on the steam deck and it I just wanted to go back to my big monitor
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.920]   I felt so
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:43.600]   But I guess you have a new baby. You don't get this sit down in your office
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:48.520]   What's going to say the benefit the handhelds is you can sit on the couch with your significant others
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:55.080]   Watching TV hanging out with your pets hanging out there by but still kind of game my day. Oh, I had
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:32:02.480]   I'm going into the next room
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:07.460]   Right, it's a very like the have the to play games like
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:15.160]   Pre-seam thick or pre-switch to play games seriously. It was a fairly anti-social activity. That's true. Yeah
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.680]   I love actually I'd like to switch a lot
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:21.120]   It saved me in the in the beginnings of the pandemic
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.800]   playing Animal Crossing New Horizons and
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:29.880]   And people love the Zelda games and you know, I mean yeah, the switch has been a great success
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:34.160]   Abra you play any game. I don't understand. I know it's you know
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:42.360]   It is really I mean growing up like my we had like my brother's old super Nintendo that I would like play on when I was
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:46.880]   Superborn so I've played like the classics like the Donkey Kongs and the Mario Kart's but it's literally been like
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:51.000]   15 years since I think I have like really flippant. I mean wait
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.880]   I had we had a wee growing up. Okay, so I guess we played like like rock band and like I don't know if that counts
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:33:00.760]   But like that's really no this is Microsoft's vision is they know they've got us
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:06.400]   They want you I know and and they and they're desperate. I mean really the future
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:13.680]   For they in their mind. I think is mobile and they really want to get all the people who don't yet play games to play
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.320]   casual mobile games
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.440]   And I think that's why they spent 70 billion dollars on this
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:24.800]   How do they get how do they get a brow? Oh, I'll eat it. That's the challenge. I think that's on there
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.520]   priorities on there
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:32.400]   if if you were gonna if you were so is it that just games like are waste of time and
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:37.200]   It's somehow I've just never felt compelled to do that
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.160]   I always I feel like social media has occupied my time
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.800]   So I'm like that's enough of a time waster and then if I'm not doing that
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.760]   I'm like let me be a decent human being and like read a book every now and then
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:50.080]   And so there's no room for like oh, let me get a gaming console
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.440]   But this is why I play Valheim because I can listen to a book
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.480]   While I'm playing Valheim. It's perfect
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.080]   I don't feel guilty because I'm powering through books
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:05.760]   And I'm gaming. It's great. You should try that. I'll take yeah, I'll take notes for me
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.920]   This will be my you know my way in
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:12.960]   My foot in the back. You totally understand that feeling I have um when it comes to gaming like I'll get
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.400]   I'm more fascinated almost with the hardware the ecosystem
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:22.080]   Watching the games because the amount of talent that goes into creating this stuff is just unbelievable
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:25.600]   You're like damn you're serving it from a from a little bit distance
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:26.960]   like
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.560]   the
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.200]   Yeah, so fast about that that I start playing I'm like, yeah, this is fun
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:34.720]   But I don't get that uh the dopamine rush that a lot of hardcore gamers do
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:37.760]   Yeah, like I don't like I'll put down a game and I won't play for like three weeks
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.880]   I'm like, oh, yeah, I forgot about that like that's not normal for gamers, right?
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:44.400]   Um, so I totally understand what a bra's talking about it's just like
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:48.160]   A part to brain even just not do you even wordle?
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:52.080]   I did I did in the beginning
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.040]   Um
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:57.920]   And it didn't last very long. I can we can't we'll count that right? Yeah, we're it was a game
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.920]   Weeks. Yeah. All right. All right. That's something. We'll add to the roster. Yeah
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:05.920]   All right, wait
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.920]   Anyway, the deal is done
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:10.320]   Microsoft wins
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.120]   The ftc loses. I think it's fair to say loses
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:19.920]   I for one don't want that feeling of oh, you know ftc. Why are you even trying to regulate?
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:23.600]   Why are you trying to fight trust just let it all?
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.720]   I don't want that I want the ftc to be active
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:31.840]   And slow down these big acquisitions is completely reasonable to say with 70 billion dollar acquisition
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.840]   What is this good or bad for?
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.640]   For consumers is this good or bad for innovation?
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.280]   Uh, and so I hope that
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:42.000]   There's not this sense of oh, they see they keep losing
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.560]   They're losers
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:47.840]   No, I think we need the ftc. We need anti trust
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:52.720]   Totally agree. Yeah, we might even need better anti trust regulations. I think
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:59.520]   It's very challenging to think of how do you what do you do about big tech because it becomes so dominant becomes too big to fail
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.480]   Too big to compete with
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:10.240]   Uh, and and too powerful in society. Look at google search for instance very hard to create a competitive search
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:12.480]   and
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.760]   frankly google search determines what the internet is
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.640]   If you can't find it on google it doesn't exist
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:25.840]   That's a lot of power in society. I don't know who and you can't count on google to regulate itself
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:29.360]   You need a little you know a little bit of a stick
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.320]   To hang over their heads. I don't know
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:37.840]   Uh, let's take a break. We've got a great panel and we have other things to talk about including shopping
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:40.640]   Coming up in just a little bit nai

[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:22.240]   Uh speaking of shopping it was prime day now tell me a bra that you at least
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:25.440]   Bought something on prime day
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   You're like please contribute something to this pen
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.120]   No, no, I just want to make sure you're human. That's all
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:40.640]   I am a human. I did buy okay. I tried to resist, but I did buy one thing from uh from prime day. I got a um like a
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.520]   Max a wallet for for the back of my phone
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:46.720]   Um and that felt like a practical thing to purchase
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:53.200]   Um, so that yeah, that was my contribution, but I I'm proud of myself. I didn't know no big purchases
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:56.960]   Uh, you know, we were very reasonable, which is good actually
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:59.760]   You should be proud of yourself if you don't
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:07.440]   Buy stuff on prime day. I read a very interesting expose of an ottoman as an example
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:12.880]   That was sold and uh fulfilled by amazon. It was an amazon choice
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:17.520]   You know what an ottoman is it's one of those things you put in front of a chair you put your feet on
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:21.760]   And uh, it was 37 percent off for prime day
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:27.520]   But people the the people writing the blog post used camel camel camel and they went back in time
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:31.120]   That's a really good tool to use before prime day to look at the price
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:35.920]   The price was for the longest time that the 30 percent off
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:40.400]   Just the week before prime day amazon raises it to 113 bucks
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:45.440]   So that they can lower it in prime day. You're not really getting a deal in many cases
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:49.280]   Right. Do people not know this?
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:52.960]   I think people don't know it. Yeah
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:42:00.880]   Well, it works me try to cover it like we had like how to guys i'm using camel camel camel telling people that and like
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:06.400]   Obviously with my job. We had to I like and do prime day like anybody else
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:11.280]   And so but we only focused on those deals where something was truly reduced
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:17.280]   So that you know, we weren't kind of like leading on customers like oh it's the lowest price ever when it's been that price for a while
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:19.280]   But it's true. I mean a lot of those prices
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:25.040]   weren't lower than they had been or they've already been at that price before or
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:30.480]   They're at the same price right now. You know the prime days. Oh, right. So yeah, it's a tricky thing
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:36.880]   This I wish I could find this article this article pointed out that if you are an amazon affiliate as almost everybody as we are not
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:43.920]   But if you are an amazon affiliate, you're not allowed to disparage amazon or you'll lose your affiliate status
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:46.720]   so publications
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:49.600]   Are kind of incited not to talk about this
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:53.600]   Secret this open secret that prime day deals are often not
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.520]   prime
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:56.880]   deals
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.200]   We could talk about it because they can't take away my affiliates
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.640]   I won't make any of you say anything
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:10.000]   But this I should have probably made bigger deal about this last week than than now after you've all bought your
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.280]   12 billion dollars
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:20.160]   On amazon prime day sales up 6.1 percent. They thought it'd be even bigger
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:23.920]   12.7 billion dollars in two days
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:30.000]   Uh, this is according to adobe which weirdly keeps track of this kind of stuff
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:36.080]   A big a big number and this worries me a little bit of customers used by now pay later
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:39.520]   Oof. Yeah, oof
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:42.240]   Why is that oof?
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:46.640]   I mean, I agree with you. I'm just gonna give you a chance to explain it. Yeah
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:51.600]   Historically americans have been bad with getting into debt over credits
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:54.720]   Yeah, now during the pandemic famously that went down
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.360]   So much people were worried
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:02.640]   Quote quote worried that you know, oh my god households now have reserved income and not
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.640]   What?
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:06.640]   Yeah, like we can't have that in america
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:12.960]   But luckily for the financial institutions at a sense reversed and now the numbers are going back up again
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:19.280]   Basically households are over stretching themselves on credit once again and these pay now
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:22.400]   Pay later things are very convenient
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:28.880]   So you don't need uh, you know to put on your credit card and you just click it and it kind of goes through and it's a little bit more
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:34.320]   Strict on you know, we have four payments. You got to make it but there is no interest usually right
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:40.400]   So you're not getting at least you're not paying an 18 19% interest as you would with a credit card and in that sense
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:46.640]   If you can pay it off in those installments, right? You're good, but
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:51.360]   It's tempting to buy more than you can afford if you don't have the money now to buy it
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:54.000]   Should you be buying it?
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.400]   You know in two months or whatever?
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:59.040]   Right. Yeah
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:01.040]   Nevertheless a huge success
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.720]   People apparently think it's a deal although I have to say
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:08.800]   I had to laugh at what what people are buying
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.360]   USA today had a list of the
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:12.960]   top
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.080]   Products
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:20.400]   Anybody want to take a guess if you didn't see if you saw this article don't but of the top products purchased on amazon prime day
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:23.040]   You know what the number one product was
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.560]   Anybody
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:25.760]   I have a tip
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.760]   cat treats
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:31.200]   That's practical. Okay. Number one makes sense temptation catries
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:33.600]   So I'm reading this article yesterday morning at breakfast
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:35.920]   and look up
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:41.120]   And I see exactly that same thing on the table. That's what we give our cats
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:45.840]   Said lisa. I hope you paid only 11 dollars and 12 cents at amazon
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:50.800]   For the temptation catred the none of all the things you could buy on prime day
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.360]   That was number one
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:55.360]   Gotta look out for the cats
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:57.920]   But you know, it's interesting too because that's the thing about
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:01.440]   You know what we talked about a lot with with prime day was
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.480]   It's not just the time to buy the big ticket item
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:08.400]   It's the time to stock up on toilet paper or batteries or whatever you know you're getting
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:13.920]   It's gonna be on sale that you know what the price is normally so you know that you're actually getting a deal
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:19.840]   Exactly. Don't buy automates on prime day in other words. Yeah, don't do that. That's what we learned today. Yes
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:24.480]   We don't do that cat treats. Okay. I bought you know what I bought razor blades because I know how much
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:29.680]   They cost and they were down like a buck 60 razor blade and I thought oh, that's a deal
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:32.640]   So I stocked up on those. I didn't buy like thousands
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:36.240]   I'm thinking I should grow a beard maybe but anyway
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:39.200]   But I bought a few months worth. Let's put it that way
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:44.160]   So I did I fell for it too and I don't know if lisa bought these correct. Yeah razor blades on ebay
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:47.200]   Oh, yeah, that's where you get that used. Yeah, they fall
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:52.160]   All the ones that fell off the truck you get really big discounts on
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:55.200]   Really? I'm telling you is that your secret?
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:47:03.360]   Yeah, any kind of cosmetic stuff if you go on ebay, I can guarantee you you can find it. Here's a razor blade sharpener
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:06.080]   I don't think that's a good idea
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:12.880]   But they have the jolettes on there and stuff and yeah, but are they really that's my question. Are they really? Yeah
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:20.320]   You know the worst thing i'll buy something on amazon. I won't pay close attention and it comes from some guy's house
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:25.920]   And you could tell like it's packaged like some guy went to costco
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:33.360]   Bought a bunch of it broke it up put it in packages and sent it and it's like I am a sucker. I fell for it again
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:37.040]   Sounds like a great business strategy though. Maybe I need to
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:38.000]   I think a lot of people
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:38.880]   I'm so
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:44.800]   No, I saw it on twitter drop shift drop shipping make millions in drop shipping. Yeah
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:48.800]   You don't even have to have them at your house. You could just have somebody else ship it just
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:54.480]   Be them. I went down to rabbit hole and found found some weird stuff. So there's I think I even forgot the name of it
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:48:01.520]   There's a cereal that I really like that only comes out in the fall. It's like a pumpkins. Oh, it's a pumpkin spice. Oh lord, not you
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:04.240]   Oh
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:07.520]   Yeah, now is that cheerios though they do too, but yeah
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:13.760]   I've got the brand but they it's only out for a couple weeks and everybody buys them up and then they're gone
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:18.640]   You I bet you drink like selling cocks. I bet you drink grimace shakes as well
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:27.280]   Is it try that? Yeah, I am careful. Yeah, so special king has a pumpkin spice crunch. Yeah, that's it. Yes special king
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:31.200]   Okay, well this is a little bit so the box like 20 bucks
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:38.160]   It's a collector's a it says limited edition. It's a special
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:40.800]   collector's item. I was like
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:45.680]   I was such a whack job. I bought like seven boxes at Target and I had the uh lord
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:50.080]   I ordered online to pick up in the store. So it's a kind of weird
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:54.800]   How many boxes is it a take to get really sick of pumpkin spice?
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:57.760]   None. I can't wait for this you
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.560]   I love fall. It's when
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:06.720]   Because there's a scent of bath and body works. That's only it's like a leaves
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:09.440]   It's called leaves, but it smells a lot better than leaves. I promise
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:12.720]   But it's only in the fall and then I restock through amazon or ebay
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:15.760]   I just got a shipment in and I don't know if it's real, but it smells like it
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:18.000]   So pumpkin spice baby
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:24.400]   Prime day was created not so long ago 2015
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:27.520]   To sell prime subscriptions
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:31.120]   And it has now turned into the I think the biggest shopping
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:34.480]   It's I think it's almost as big now as a black friday 12
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:37.280]   billion dollars in two days
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:41.760]   The biggest thing too is not it's prime day, but we end up covering
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:46.240]   You know since we cover pc singles day hp del lino bo
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:50.640]   Everybody's it's become a cultural thing, right? That was just the amazon sales
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:53.120]   Yeah, but everybody does prime day deals
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:58.000]   Last week that's why i was doing on yeah, yeah best by had the three day deals
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.120]   And and you know as a website we end up often getting better revenue through those guys the namas
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:09.040]   That's kind of everybody. Yeah, but yeah, it's uh, it's really interesting how much it's grown into like a shopping
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:15.360]   Black friday basically it's like another black friday, which of course fits into american consumers imperfectly. Yeah
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:23.360]   Yeah, that's right target everybody. Yeah, yeah online sales in general or up 6% in the first day not just on amazon
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:29.520]   But uh, but everywhere according to blunberg home goods and household essentials
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:37.040]   It was a good timing because inflation is finally dropping now even I noticed food prices are finally going back down
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:40.640]   I do wonder how much of these numbers were adjusted for inflation though
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:45.680]   Uh in terms of the money brought in so because some of these items are still I think
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:48.240]   Price tired than they might have been two years ago
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:54.240]   But I think consumers are feeling a little bit of economic relief now so they might have uh felt more comfortable spending stuff
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:51:01.040]   It's also interesting to think about the timing because for black friday at least people can get a head start on their holiday shopping
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:04.000]   So there's an incentive here. What are they buying this is for them and then now?
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:08.800]   It's just yeah, it's like what do I want? Let me just buy all this stuff from it. Let me treat myself and my cats apparently
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:12.960]   Jason howl said there were pumpkin spiced Oreos
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:20.880]   Yeah 2018 he said they he rated it a 2.5 out of a 10. I don't oh man
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:23.680]   Not sure. It's rough now. I have to try
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:31.680]   I had on my twitter. I was I was buying all the pumpkin spice like weird things like there's pumpkin spice butter pumpkin spice hummus
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:35.440]   Uh whiskey, that's like a fun site
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:38.480]   Yeah
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:41.520]   Is it can I ask a dumb question, but I don't
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:48.320]   There's no pumpkin and pumpkin spice right now. It's all spice. Yeah, it's all spice for pumpkin pie
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:51.920]   But there's no it's called, but there's no pumpkin involved
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:55.120]   No, that's first. I know
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:57.920]   So maybe i'll do it on the cinnamon out next time
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:03.680]   Back into pumpkin spice and there. Yeah. Yeah now we're now we're really talking
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:09.920]   Uh, all right. That's enough. That's enough of that
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:19.520]   Uh amazon though. I don't know if you know is a v-lop of a v very large online platform. This is according to the
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:22.080]   EU
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:24.640]   uh the EU named 17 companies
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:31.760]   to be uh regulated under the digital services act the anomaly these are
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:34.880]   uh any company that has that
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:37.920]   has is a social well
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:45.360]   a platform v-lop has according to the dsa has added responsibilities to protect their users from illegal content
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:48.160]   And products hate speech and so forth
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:51.920]   So amazon's response is your rata
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:53:00.960]   Why are you calling us a very large online platform? I love the registers headline obscure internet boutique amazon
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:04.160]   Suzy you for calling it a very large
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:07.760]   online platform amazon said but we're a retailer
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:10.720]   We're not a social network. Well
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:13.760]   Okay
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:19.600]   If you say so pretty close amazon's number one businesses advertising i think
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:22.800]   Uh an advertising is certainly covered
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:25.440]   by v-lops
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.440]   so
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:32.880]   In any event, I you know, this is one of those another one of those regulations where the companies fight fight fight and that
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:42.080]   The v-lops are ali bob is ali express. Yeah, they sell stuff amazon store apple's app store booking.com facebook
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:45.680]   google play google maps google shopping
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:50.160]   instagram linked in pinterest snapchat tiktok
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:56.640]   Abra your favorite twitter wikipedia youtube my addiction and zalando
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:54:01.440]   You still addicted twitter on there twitter's on here you bet why
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:09.280]   You know there there's some thought the twitter is doing so poorly that the producer they're gonna shrink beneath the the minimum
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:11.760]   revenue
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:13.440]   levels
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:16.640]   Elon announced or no i was always one of those go ahead
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:21.120]   That's like i say it was always one the smallest social network i don't think it's just it's uh
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:28.160]   It's just it has a lot of reach and media that's the difference, but it's actual usage is pretty small
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:36.000]   Elon says twitter is in its in negative cash flow because they lost 50 percent of their advertising
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.880]   Um, oh one of my yeah
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:42.080]   My fault
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:48.880]   So there's some question about why he announced this like why would you announce? Oh, yeah, we're failing
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:53.920]   There's some question that maybe he's planning to get out of this whole thing by declaring bankruptcy
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:55:00.880]   Uh, it's been wanting to get out since the beginning. I think he never wanted to buy it. Yeah. Yeah since before
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:03.440]   Yeah
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:07.200]   Well, it would be sad if twitter went away
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:12.720]   But more because of its history than the way it is now you y'all still use it
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:14.720]   No
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:19.200]   I have a i mean i'm on there i share things and you kind of have to follow
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:23.120]   Motion right i guess that's the yeah, I use it for that and if people
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:29.760]   Message me, you know or respond to something. I I took the courtesy to respond to them. I won't say though
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:32.000]   My usage
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:37.680]   Especially for personal stuff has gone way down, you know, and I don't check it as much nearly as much
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:40.560]   You know, I do appreciate threads a lot more
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:47.600]   Um, you know, I'm hoping that that's about a bra are you a twitter user or are you uh?
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:52.080]   I have been checking twitter a lot less frequently. I check it multiple times a day
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:55.120]   It was like my break from work was to just pop open twitter see what's going on
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:58.720]   But now threads has become the thing that I gravitate towards when I want to send something out
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:02.320]   Also for personal reasons if I have like some random random taylor swiftake
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:09.120]   I want us to send out it. I'll go to threads or if i'm trying to lean into that more with um promoting my content
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:11.440]   but um, but you know, obviously I have
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:18.160]   More followers on twitter right now, but obviously the the ability to import your followers from instagram has been a huge boost
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:20.960]   At least in the beginning. There's still room to add more people
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:26.560]   But I have been gravitating towards threads more even to the to the point where I got used to the like button being
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:32.160]   You know, because they're kind of swapped on on twitter. Yeah, and I'm used to already on on threads
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:36.720]   That's what I'm learning from custom to yeah, I thread is is like a nice twitter
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:42.160]   It's very twitter like yeah, it's clean. Yeah, I'm waiting for the following feed
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.280]   Yeah engagements higher
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:47.600]   I think the four u-page is kind of sometimes I get something where I'm like why did they think this was for me like
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:53.600]   Obviously the algorithm isn't as good as like tech talks, but it's um, I'm waiting for that following page to come out where I can just kind of choose
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:59.600]   The people I actually follow and just see their content because there's a they're pushing a lot of a lot of random accounts on us right now
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:07.440]   I don't know what I did, but now I only see people I follow I think I I think I followed somebody's instructions to go into threads
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:10.080]   going to notifications and
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:12.640]   Chase change the threads and replies
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:17.200]   To from everyone to for people you follow and now I don't see the good idea
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:22.560]   Algorithmic feed anymore. Oh, yeah, I should do that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, my feed's been really clean
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:24.720]   Um, I haven't has money issues
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:29.120]   I like the algorithmic first because it it told me who to follow right right?
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:34.080]   But now I followed everybody I followed on twitter. Yeah, so we're good
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:37.200]   I could just watch the I don't need a for you feed anymore
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:43.680]   They don't they say I guess at some point we'll have a for you and a following tab like twitter does and an edit button is apparently coming
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:51.200]   Wow. Yes, you won't have to pay for it, which is a really big deal. Yeah, we should have journalist maria resa on the program
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:55.760]   She is the CEO and founder of rapler.com, which is the Philippines
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:58:03.280]   Largest and predominant news organization. She also won the nobel peace prize last year. I can tell you about
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:05.360]   um
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:08.880]   Look, I'm or I am on all of the atomized
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:14.320]   Social platforms and I I've demoned the loss of the twitter that was I was in the beta for twitter
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:19.680]   And it was as a journalist a remarkably useful tool. However, I have a hard time forgetting
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:29.040]   Uh, what facebook has enabled and maria resa who is a journalist in a democratic country
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:36.160]   That was taken over by redrigo dutarte and she was in prison. She was attacked and she was
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.880]   so in she was
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:43.840]   enabled by facebook she was attacked by so many trolls and threatened
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:49.440]   So much by and enabled by the president by dutarte that her life was in danger
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:51.200]   this was
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:57.760]   Facebook as a platform enabling the attack on the fourth estate a democratic country
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:02.560]   Journalist in a democratic country who won the nobel peace prize
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:09.760]   enabled by facebook. Yep. Let's look at some of the other things that facebook has also enabled
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:13.200]   If we go back almost a decade
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:18.480]   And we we look even at our own elections here in the united states. We look at 2016
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:23.200]   I don't I mean I really don't want to get into politics. No, no, I agree with you and this
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:30.960]   Time and energy into facebook platforms. Yeah, it feels like we have all kind of pardon the pun lost the thread
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:34.160]   I'm sorry. I don't mean to be self-righteous or preachy. No, it's good
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:38.320]   That you brought the hard time using threads for that reason and that's one of the things
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:42.560]   It's interesting about threads is the people even I who refuse to use facebook
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:44.320]   uh
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:46.320]   Kind of kind of forgot
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:50.880]   And buried this facebook enabled genocide and me and mar. I mean
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:53.520]   Yeah
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:57.520]   Their their trust and safety has left something to be desired
[00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:03.760]   Uh, but this has been in some ways threads has been the great revival of mark zuckerberg
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:08.400]   Yeah, it kind of polished his brand it's polished his brand and and uh
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:15.440]   You know, even people who wouldn't have facebook often had instagram and if they didn't have instagram, they'd have what's app
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:18.480]   so
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.480]   Yeah, there's it's an interesting
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:21.680]   Uh
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:26.720]   Situation not many people are as principled as you dan unfortunately no I it's not principles
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:33.360]   Look, I covered conflict regions when I was a younger reporter. I saw people die and I saw how social media contributed to
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:40.160]   Uh, some really horrific things and I I just I'm a little triggered. I don't mean to to be
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:43.680]   Oh, I think the money is or preachy, but I I mean like
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:47.280]   Once you kind of see some of these things you can't unsee it
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:50.160]   I think maria reza is a very valuable voice
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:56.400]   And look if a democratic institution can be tanked by social media being exploited
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:00.960]   And we need to pay big attention to it and simply forgetting the last decade or so
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:05.520]   Because there's a shiny new social platform is dangerous
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:09.120]   Do you is it?
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:14.320]   So I guess I'd have to do more research and you've done it. So I'm gonna ask you dan
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.960]   um
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:21.200]   Certainly it's the case that social networks twit you got to include twitter in this
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:26.240]   Uh, have been have been used for queuing on we're huge. Yeah for good and ill
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:30.240]   Uh, you know and you could say you know the Arab spring
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:34.480]   Uh was also enabled by facebook and twitter among others
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:36.560]   um
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.560]   Are they evil?
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:41.280]   In intent or just in
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.760]   Um
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:46.400]   By omission or co-mission. I guess is the question
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:52.080]   Well, I can't call anyone evil. I I can't be that well, but that's in a way. That's the issue right because
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.440]   Yeah, so facebook is so big so vast
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:02:03.360]   It probably is impossible to police it. I would guess I think that they were pretty aware. I mean look everybody's talking
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:05.920]   Uh, look trident twitter had
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:13.200]   Remarkably capable people in their trust and safety, but they still overlooked the proliferation of qanon, which was a very harmful look
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.200]   I was docked by qanon sent
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:17.440]   countless death threats
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:19.040]   I I mean
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:23.440]   twitter helped enable this but do I think their trust and safety people helped enable it?
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:24.800]   No, I don't think that
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:28.560]   So I I don't know the answer to your question leo, but I think that you know and i'm sorry
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:33.600]   I always come on this program to talk politics and I don't mean to but I think tech intersects politics. No, no
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:37.280]   It's really important ways right now. It's important. I think it's important to be aware of it
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:42.240]   You know, uh, what is that new movie that is essentially a qanon?
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.880]   movie is being heavily promoted
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:47.760]   by the new york times
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:49.840]   um
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:52.160]   Right now the uh sound of freedom
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:58.080]   Which is well if you look into it, uh, the the origins story is not good
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:02.000]   and um, I I feel like
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:08.720]   It's so pervasive in our society that anything any social network that reflects our society
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:11.200]   Is going to reflect that kind of evil
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.360]   content
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:17.440]   And even newspapers where you would expect you know the new york times to know a little bit better than to
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   promote sound of freedom
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.320]   Make mistakes. I'm sure this was an editorial mistake on their part. I hope it was
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:30.400]   So the challenge I have with any social network is the vast sums of money and profit that has been
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.400]   uh, uh
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:37.680]   earned by not just the companies themselves but pocketed by the individuals there and I do think that there is
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:40.480]   a significant amount of responsibility by
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:47.760]   The the people who are responsible for these social platforms for enabling things like while we say the engagements up
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:52.080]   The engagements really high. Well, like that can do good things and it can do bad things
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:57.680]   And I think that you know to quote spider-man for the five millionth time with great power comes great responsibility
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:03.040]   And I would like the platform owners to take a little more responsibility and they have tremendous power
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:06.240]   Uh, but I think they've dodged a lot of responsibility
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:09.040]   So I take it you're not on threats
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:14.560]   I have like everybody. I mean like I made an accounts and like I posted a couple links
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:22.560]   Uh, I I but I don't engage and I don't have any social media on my phone. Um, I and that's in general
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:28.480]   You have zero social media. I have I don't think I have a youtube on my phone. Um, well, I
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:33.520]   Gurbaging garbage out. Oh, absolutely. I mean, yeah, definitely. Absolutely. I take
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:41.600]   With clean hands, but part of this is just the vast reach these services have it would be almost impossible. I mean
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:46.400]   It would be almost impossible for them to have completely clean hands. I think for sure
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:49.920]   Is an example of a company. I mean google and youtube want to
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:56.800]   Uh, do not want to promote terrorism or or or, um, you know genocide
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:02.160]   But sometimes are used that way they do their best not to but it's almost impossible for them to prevent it 100
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:09.520]   Right. And they certainly I mean there are voices of anti-Semitism and voices absolutely that certainly were amplified on youtube
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.800]   Yeah
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:12.800]   I mean the problem is us
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:18.640]   Uh and to the degree that social networks reflect us they're going to be problematic
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:23.920]   How what is there was how how how much can we expect them to?
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:29.280]   To filter this stuff and how effective are they going to be is a big question to me
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:36.800]   We can expect that an honest effort and we can expect that if you have made billions then then don't be disingenuous
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:42.880]   Yeah, I think maybe the formation of the for example facebook oversight committee was disingenuous
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:48.400]   Yes, it is not a supreme court. It did not do it. I mean and it really did a very
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:53.120]   Scary thing which was you know, they would get down to the very granular level and say well
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:57.120]   We we are examining this post this post this post this post which
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:00.960]   Marginalizes and makes the scale of the problem seem small
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:06.480]   It makes the scale of the problem seem like individual posts and that they're ruling an individual post when the problem is
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:13.440]   Large and at scale and let me tell you with artificial intelligence the 2024 election and disinformation
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:18.240]   Get ready. Media is going to be a big challenge. Yeah, if you hate politics in your tech now
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.240]   You're going to hate it a lot more in a year
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:23.600]   Yeah, actually this week a congressional report found that meta
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:28.320]   And tax prep companies recklessly shared taxpayers data
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:34.720]   Another reason to hate it dislike meta this comes from the markup the mark up dot org
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:36.480]   uh
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:39.200]   h&r block tax act and tax layer
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:45.120]   Had a tool called the meta pixel on their software transmitting
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:47.920]   data to facebook to meta
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:51.120]   As you filed your taxes using those
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:07:01.280]   Programs and those websites and it sent information like your first and last name your income your filing status and your refund amounts
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:09.040]   Yikes, um, but again, uh, you know you have to consider intent
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:14.240]   Was this just an accidental data leak or was this an intentional?
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:16.240]   uh
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.240]   data mining effort
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:22.640]   And I don't know and I don't know how I think we should investigate it
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:28.960]   Um h&r block meta and tax layer did not respond to the markups requests for comment
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:35.760]   Uh google analytics apparently does something similar a spokesperson for google said the company has strict policies and technical features
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:39.280]   To stop google analytics users from collecting sensitive data
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:43.520]   Um, and I think that that's the case we use google analytics
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:48.480]   And even though it's been banned in denmark and some other countries we continue to use it
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:51.840]   I've been trying to not use it, but our advertisers demand it
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:54.720]   um
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:59.440]   It's interesting how immune we've become to this idea that that you know privacy is
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:06.000]   Is really not existing at this point. Yeah bring up really good points about like about meta's track record and and um,
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.080]   And there was this really clear hesitation with a lot of people about whether they should join threads
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:16.640]   Because of all the reasons that you bring up, but it's also a testament to how desperate people are to find that twitter alternative
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:24.240]   And I think that's really the takeaway here is that people were so desperate that they had to essentially choose between the quote-unquote lesser of two evils
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:26.400]   And it's just our reality
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:29.280]   I don't think anybody at this point can question
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:38.640]   How horrible twitter has become and and I feel like being untruthable it was once it was once valuable, but but but I think you can't
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:42.800]   You must know if you use twitter today that you are kind of supporting
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:49.520]   Something that is that doesn't deserve your support and yet. I know so many people that are still on twitter
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:53.040]   As a company we still use twitter as much as i've tried to stop it
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.760]   um
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:57.760]   It's hard
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.840]   It's hard. It's it's all nice to be a dude.
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:03.440]   There's these weird moral choices all the time like you know
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:08.240]   Right now we have you know tom cruises new movie mission and possible outright and
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:14.880]   He's an incredible actor who does like amazing stuff in his films and they're really good movies and yet the Scientology thing
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:18.880]   So do you draw the line and say i'm boycotting?
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:26.160]   Tom cruise films and I again, you know like I respect people who do but the fact is most people aren't and it's a weird moral choice
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:29.600]   I don't even know whether it's no Michael Jackson's music anymore
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:32.560]   Right. Yeah
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:40.080]   Yeah, it really does become the use like weird like what do you support and we all just have to draw our draw our own lines where they are
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:43.600]   You know there's have to be a line, you know, you can just say like, you know
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:48.960]   I have certain things that I I believe but like, you know, I still posted on threads
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:56.160]   Like it doesn't have to be a hard line. It can just be like I have values at least be aware. I guess and thinking right in conscience
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:01.520]   Uh, I think the idea is like we use this power to push these companies into the right direction
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:04.640]   I would argue that you know facebook has been under a lot of scrutiny
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:08.720]   They have improved a lot of ways one thing that's interesting about threads
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:14.400]   You know people just say it's a twitter alternative, but their mission statements kind of different than uh twitter, you know
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:15.360]   They've
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:18.880]   Publicly said they don't want to focus on hard news and politics
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:23.920]   They want to focus on people's like hobbies and interests and form communities around them
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:28.080]   But how are they gonna stop thinking of block politics and news? I don't understand
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:33.200]   Well, one interesting thing is you don't if you go and post something
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:40.480]   Just because you post it. It doesn't get into people's feet. So it's algorithm. It's the algorithm. Yeah
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:44.880]   I mean the big thing with threads is the responses get the interests
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:50.480]   So if you look at your feed, it's all about responses to things. So that's one way that they change things
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:53.280]   Auto also you argue that facebook has a better
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:56.720]   Um, if I don't know if you try to block anyone on threads yet
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:02.640]   It's it's more interesting than twitter because when you block them it goes do you want to block all their further attempts
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:07.600]   Creating another account on our service kind of like that's that option. Yeah
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:11.920]   Yeah, and so that goes a lot further than just blocking that one account
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:15.200]   It's going to go and try to block any further creations
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:19.200]   They have a little bit better moderation, but facebook has also been famous for
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:26.000]   Having very good or better moderation in the united states than other countries because of the marketing here, right? You know, so
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:31.360]   I think we need to hold uh, you know threads there their feet to the fire on this
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:36.560]   But there are at least trying to create a nicer social network there
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:42.640]   They're you know, they just ban people right away, right? They they're not taking and there's a thing if you try to follow
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:48.560]   Was it uh, Donald Trump jr. It warns you he posts like false information people in the right or going, you know crazy about it
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.800]   like they are that network that
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:57.680]   Elon is trying not to be but a lot of people are like no, we want that network, right? And some people I think it's an interesting choice
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:00.400]   Yeah, do you think they are?
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:05.920]   Facebook meta, do you think they're looking at threads as a second chance
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:11.840]   I mean they yeah, wonder what you noted daniel under so much scrutiny with the blue app
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:17.040]   And I mean frances how again? I I mean there is so much scrutiny under the with the blue app
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:22.400]   She was the whistle the whistle blower. Yeah, the whistle blower who leaked the facebook papers in 2021
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:25.280]   Do you think threads is that are they like man?
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:30.400]   If we could do facebook again, would it be this? I think exactly that
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:36.480]   Yeah, and the people actually charge a threads are different, right? It's adam mo's serie and the instagram team
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:44.480]   Running it, but you got a very big transparent zuck has been like celebrating like they're over 150 million users in a week
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:47.920]   I mean it's yeah never seen him happier. He's very active
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:56.000]   Celebrating every little thing. He's just like thumb in his nose at elan and saying and I think he knows this is his
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.320]   Chance at rehab rehabilitation his reputation
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:06.400]   He can give that moral alternative that people are looking for not on twitter, right? We a lot of people want that
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:10.480]   It's like what I was mentioning, you know a couple times on the other times you had me on here with like I think
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:16.800]   You know verification should be offered to everyone where it's tied to your name and like your actual identity
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:24.160]   Uh, and like you should be able to sort by that that'll help filter out, you know a lot of trolls who rely on the uh
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:26.400]   Being anonymous on the internet
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:30.080]   Uh, and that you know they're starting to go down that route. They haven't offered yet
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:31.360]   Uh
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:35.840]   You know the whole verification to everyone, but it's kind of getting there. So it's about markets, right?
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:43.280]   I always tell people corporations aren't like evil per se capitalism is an evil. It's it's an amoral system
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:45.680]   It reflects whatever
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:51.920]   People are looking for so if you want to have like, you know back in the 60s when we had segregation and companies
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:55.920]   You know cater to that it was the market and that's what was reflected
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:03.360]   Now today it's the opposite corporation to like wait if we appeal to more people and different genders and identities and all that
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:09.120]   We increase our market share. We can make more money. So now it's the opposite and now the right wing is getting all of a sudden
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:13.920]   Really upset about capitalism and you know the free market. So it's really interesting how I know
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:16.560]   Is that a shift?
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:18.560]   That's hysterical. Yeah
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:23.120]   I saw the other day it was uh andrew tates tweet and he was going about the system and it's not like a
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:28.000]   Rage against the machine song like oh, I thought it was 12 years old. Yeah, and I was just like
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.480]   Like he basically made the marxist argument of alienation
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:37.120]   In today's but you wouldn't say that and like you're a closet marxist
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:39.680]   That's what's happening to the extreme right?
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:43.840]   They're basically turning to marxist, but they don't know that because they don't read marx
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:47.360]   So it's like and I don't mean that they think communism is the answer
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:51.760]   But this is again the misunderstanding with marxism, right? Like people just only know the second half
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:56.080]   They don't know the criticism part. So they're almost there. They've like connected the dots
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:58.320]   But they haven't seen the big picture yet. It's really hilarious
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:04.240]   You know, I'm reminded of that bumper sticker, you know, if you're not outraged you're not paying attention
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:10.400]   Uh and every time I see that I'm going well you can't live your life in outrage
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:12.720]   You'll have an ulcer and die at the age of 40
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:18.640]   So yeah, so the the question I think it's kind of an an ancient question
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:22.160]   Is how do you live in a world that doesn't live up to your?
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:25.360]   standards
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:30.880]   How do you survive in a world like that where you and you know, Dan, maybe you've got the right idea
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:35.120]   Which is you you push them in the right direction, but you can't be perfect
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:42.560]   I think religion has handled this, you know, the the christian religion tradition is we're all sinners
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:48.320]   But it's it's okay if you if you acknowledge it and repent will forgive you
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:53.040]   And I think that that's really was religions way of dealing with what must have been
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:57.760]   From time immemorial this conflict between I know what's right and good
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:00.880]   But I also have to live in a world that is not good
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:03.440]   How do you deal with that?
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:08.480]   And i'm not perhaps 100 percent good. How do you how do you survive that without being outraged?
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:11.040]   At all at all times
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:14.960]   It is an eternal question try to answer that question my entire life. Yeah
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:16.480]   Yeah
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:20.560]   And I know died not knowing you were right to be triggered by this whole conversation
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:27.040]   And that outrage came up and you're absolutely right, especially you because you've you've been in these war zones. You've been
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:29.040]   There's just too close to it for a long time. Yeah
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:30.800]   Um
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:36.400]   But but and we all kind of in the back of our minds know this stories. I don't think there's anybody who doesn't know
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:40.880]   You know, what happened or if this hasn't read what happened with meta
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:47.440]   But how do you live with it in the modern world? How do you survive without walking through life being outraged at all times?
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:53.200]   Maybe you believe maybe you have to believe in redemption and forgiveness. Maybe that's the the secret. I don't know
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:59.840]   And I think you know to segue maybe into ai a bit, you know ai has a potential big role in this
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:03.680]   Especially learning because well, there's no reason why
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:07.280]   AI machine learning specifically can't look at
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.440]   you know the stream of data going on to these social networks and
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:15.520]   Analyze it by they they really do this right by happiness scores
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:20.800]   Angry scores and stuff like that like you can oh, there's actually a service out there
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:26.240]   Daniel let's take a break because I do want to this is a good subject. Okay, go into the in then after the break
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:32.080]   Okay, I I have some thoughts, but I'll hold on
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:39.520]   We got a great panel. Daniel Rabino is here from eic of windows central great to have you on the show daniel
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:43.120]   It's great to have dan patterson back briefly you've flirted with the dark side
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:45.360]   But you're back in the news and I love it

[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:12.080]   And uh, doesn't play any games, which is weird. Oh, we're working on it by the next time i'm on
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:15.200]   I expected at least one to pick up a few games
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:17.840]   And just for you
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:25.840]   That's great to have you for are you so do they brought to you by duo duo from sisco protects against breaches

[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:17.680]   keeping the lights on
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:19.840]   at this weekend tech
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:24.160]   It's been a AI AI AI for the last couple of months. I mean really is the
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:27.200]   The topic of the hour so interesting to watch companies
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:31.520]   You know, metas says oh the metaverse forget that we're not interested in that or
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:38.240]   You know google and microsoft and all these guys. Yeah. Yeah, we were just kidding about that stuff. It's AI
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:43.200]   AI is the hot the hot ticket you think AI can solve this
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:51.680]   this social problem uh by being better and more proactive at protecting social networks
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:54.640]   See i worry about this daniel. I think that
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:21:01.120]   I don't want to trust the machine to do this work. I know humans should have to either. I understand
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:08.960]   Yeah, uh, so solve is doing a lot of heavy lifting. I wouldn't say solve but definitely aid in right so there's um
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:14.320]   There's already this stuff out there right twitter sentiment analysis has been known for a long time
[01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:23.200]   Right, so this looks at your word structure and the types of words you're using in science ratings to those words based on negative positive or neutral
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:26.320]   And like you can actually analyze your entire account
[01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:32.720]   It'll go through all your tweets and it'll give you like a rating like whether or not like on average you're a pretty angry person
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:36.240]   Or you're a pretty positive person or you write neutral stuff
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:41.760]   Um, there's no reason why then you couldn't have your own personalized algorithm based on
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:44.480]   Positive or neutral
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:50.640]   Uh information coming in well, that's I mean one of our sponsors grammarly does sentiment analysis on your writing
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:53.440]   Right and we'll even say i've seen it happen to my wife
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:56.080]   You know, you should really tone that
[01:21:56.080 --> 01:22:00.160]   Tom that down. Yep, you might want to put please and thank you in there that kind of thing
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:02.960]   She's busy. Yeah, so she doesn't have time to do
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:11.360]   That's one way for viewing information is to have it apply to your algorithm and just have that as an option to choose
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:14.160]   Or you know, uh
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:19.280]   Threads they want to implement this could basically try to block the most negative stuff and just say
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:25.840]   You know kind of like I don't like a lot of stuff that uh musk said, but uh, what was his phrase?
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:28.000]   Uh
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.560]   It was free speech without reach, you know, this idea that like if you post negative stuff
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:36.240]   Because they're real free to do it, but we're not going to like promote it, right?
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:41.920]   I actually agree with that and I think again sentiment analysis can play a part in analyzing those
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:47.280]   Uh messages and making sure that they don't get uh, they don't show up in people's timelines as much
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:52.720]   Uh, and then you can also have it on your end you mentioned grammarly, but and twitter kind of does this already, right?
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:56.480]   I don't know if you've ever tried. Yeah, if you see someone with a lot of swears
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:59.040]   Something mean it's like really mean or
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:00.880]   Obviously doesn't really like that, you know
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:06.000]   So they're already kind of using that already right so you can kind of do it on that and as well
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:08.080]   So that is
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:14.640]   One way, you know and we already have bot sentinel which is another twitter tool that goes through and analyzes
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:20.160]   Accounts based on whether they're trolling or not and it's a really interesting thing and you see i see people using it
[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:24.640]   They'll be like they'll see someone they'll do an analysis and they give the bot sentinel
[01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:28.720]   Score and it's like oh this person because you'll see it'll be like red hot, you know, they're trolling right?
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:31.440]   Um, and it just looks at their history. So that's where I think like
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:37.840]   Uh, AI machine learning sentiment sentiment analysis can play a role. I don't think it's going to solve problems
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:43.440]   Um, I still would like to get people just to stop posting and necessarily everything that they comes in their head
[01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:50.560]   I don't think they'll need to share an opinion on every single thing in their life. Um, but that's a separate issue. Oh my god
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:52.560]   I got to talk about that forever too. Yeah
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:53.520]   Yeah
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:55.040]   So I I think
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:59.600]   This stuff can at least start to play a role in moderation because you're right. You don't want humans doing it
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:05.440]   Capital intensive right it's super expensive. It's just hard on you do that. You get to all the countries. Yeah
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:08.000]   Yeah, especially with the image analysis, right?
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:14.400]   It's been famous articles written about that and the problems there, but first you have to train the AI from humans, you know
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:15.920]   To get to that level
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:21.200]   Um, so that's where I'm hoping you know, uh, especially stuff for violence and things that we don't want to see
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:25.200]   Really, you know, AI I think does have a potential there to filter all things
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:31.600]   The problem of course is there will be controversies, right? Some good stuff will get caught up in the bad and then there'll be you know charges
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:35.280]   And this is where transparency and algorithms. I think you know really does
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:38.000]   Uh, play a role in all things, right?
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.040]   Sometimes sometimes you sometimes you have to see the bad stuff
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:47.440]   Look blue sky is going through this controversy right now where they are making tools that allow you to not see things like
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:50.160]   racial slurs and in user and user
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:54.480]   Names that doesn't mean they're not being used and not being used to target people
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:58.880]   I mean, this that's one reason I never turn these the filters on because I
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:03.360]   You want to know it's there. Yeah. Yeah, I I think that like just pretending
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:07.120]   It's not there doesn't make the problem go away. It just puts you into a different filter bubble
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:10.960]   That was twitter's response for a long time when we were being abused. They said, well, just mute them
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:16.320]   Is it yeah, but still everybody else sees it. What is that? What does that help? How does that help me?
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:21.840]   Um, there's definitely some truth to you don't want to filter out everything necessarily
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:28.880]   But on the other hand, I think it's been proven over time and this is gets into the um, you know regulation stuff people like
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:33.520]   Uh moderated communities. Yeah, that's you know, this is always an issue on four
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:35.760]   You know like on forums
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:40.400]   You know when people go off topic or gets to politics the moderator comes in bands people
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:43.840]   Some people don't like that decision being made no you have to do it. Like no, it's good
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:49.200]   Otherwise you get fortunate. You know, it doesn't yeah, you have yeah, exactly. Yeah, right and a lot of people just don't want that
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:54.080]   So this idea of like having sort of a machine learning act as a moderation tool
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:58.800]   I think is you know something that and that's why again threads. It's kind of proving this point, right
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:03.200]   A lot of people say like well, why is thread so much better than twitter a lot of us are like it's not elan
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:08.800]   That's almost enough, you know, which is kind of sad, but the bar is pretty low for threads right now. Yeah
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:12.320]   This is interesting because
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:17.360]   When a when chat gbt came out actually dolly before it and then stable diffusion
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:20.240]   uh people were kind of
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:27.200]   Acting as if a guy could solve every problem and I think one of the things that's happened over the last few months, which is good
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:32.240]   Is people are starting to say well it can't but there are some
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:38.320]   Uses of ai in a kind of uh directed manner that do make sense
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:42.800]   you know using uh, I saw I saw a uh a farm
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:46.720]   machine that goes through the
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:50.400]   Fields and zaps weeds without because it recognizes weeds
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:55.040]   Without zapping the plants now they're doing that with pests as well because it's using ai
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:27:00.400]   To recognize that's a pest that's a plant zap the using lasers to zap the uh pests
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.880]   So there are some kind of more restrictive
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:08.160]   good uses of uh ai than just kind of generally just throwing ai
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:09.600]   uh
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:11.600]   everything
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:15.360]   I think that's a good
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:19.200]   Tenancy because we've been really over-selling. I feel like over-hyping
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:23.600]   Ai you agree a bar. What how do you come down on this one?
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:28.080]   Yeah, it's really all we've been talking about but I think you bring up a good point with any new technology
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:34.320]   With any platform and dirt. I do see a lot of parallels between you know, it's not it's not it's kind of comparing apples to oranges
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:36.160]   But there are a lot of parallels between
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:41.040]   You know social media existing and how we choose to use it and ai existing and how we choose to use it and I think
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:46.320]   Um, I think there is a combination of fear and hope when it comes to ai
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:51.280]   Um a little bit more fear probably it's not a 50-50 split here, but um, is the fear justified?
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:53.280]   Do you think I mean are you do you share the?
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:28:00.320]   The existential terror that ai is going to become skynet and we're going to have to fight the machines
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:06.000]   Every time I call myself down. I see an article where someone is like, oh my god. This looks really bad
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.920]   And I'm like, oh no, and so it's like an up and down for me. It's not a constant level of
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:16.800]   Um being at peace with it or being fearful of it. It's it's very much this this uh, there's spikes and then it it drops but
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:24.160]   Um, but you know, I think it's really really great to see people in in various sectors and professions speaking up about it
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:28.560]   And saying we need to figure this out now we need like before it's too late. We need to
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:32.000]   Um put up those guardrails. So I think it's great that people are
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:38.240]   Are terrified and outraged and speaking up about it because you know, it's it we could potentially reduce any harm
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:40.640]   That that will come out of it
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:45.680]   There is there seems to be two groups. There's the one group and and actually amelie bender had a great
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:48.560]   uh post on this uh last week
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:49.840]   Uh
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:56.000]   That the ai safety group that's saying oh my god. It's an existential threat to human kind
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.840]   Their machines are good and then there's the ai ethics group
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:06.160]   Uh of of which timna gebru and margaret mitchell with her stochastic parrots and others
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:11.760]   Who are I think a little bit more sensible or saying look don't ai's not gonna
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:17.840]   Eat humans, but we should be very concerned about the ethical problems with ai
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:20.560]   ai, you know face recognition
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:21.920]   Uh, uh
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:25.040]   Being less reliable with people of color things like that
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:28.320]   Those are the things we should be paying attention to do today
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:33.520]   You interviewed dan last month on your uh, uh, substac kathy backster who was
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:38.000]   the uh, uh in charge of ethical ai practice at sales force
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.880]   Tell me about that
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:44.800]   So this is actually what i've been doing for jason hiner at cd net. Um, I I
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:49.760]   Write a column about ai and it has become about ai ethics
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:54.560]   Uh once a week, although we took a little uh break in the early summer once a week i interview
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:57.920]   somebody like cat the backster, uh, uh, uh,
[01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:03.520]   In fact a couple of years ago i spoke with nick bostrom i just interviewed him ago. Oh, he's he's one of the uh,
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:08.480]   The ai is going to eat our faces. Yeah, although he told me several years ago
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:11.520]   I think I interviewed him for tech republic. I find it fascinating
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:15.040]   It is he wrote the book it is 10 years old now
[01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:21.440]   But if you haven't read it super intelligence past danger strategies great book super intelligence path danger strategies
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:24.480]   He told me i'm paraphrasing, but he told me the great
[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:31.920]   Danger of artificial intelligence is that we will we will anthropomorphize it and we will overestimate its capabilities
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:38.880]   Which puts us at risk of underestimating the potential problems and harms and I think that's exactly right
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:42.800]   That's exactly what I was saying, isn't it that we worry
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:49.680]   Yeah, being this kind of uh, you know iron giant gray goo and like great. Yeah, and he was a guy
[01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:55.520]   Right and that's great goo though. Wasn't he right? Yeah, bostrom came up with what's called the paper clip maximizer
[01:30:55.520 --> 01:31:01.840]   Which is that you know if we if we don't tune the values of artificial intelligence to be in line with human
[01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:05.520]   Values and we give it a problem to solve and we say like make paper clips
[01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:09.520]   We don't say make paper clips for 10 minutes and then stop
[01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:13.920]   Ais is going to make paper clips until the universe is going to be very good paper clips
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:17.920]   By the way, right if you're looking for a game. This is the game for you a bra
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:20.400]   It's called universal paper clips
[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:25.360]   You get to make paper clips and then you get into the AI involved and pretty soon
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:32.000]   At the the game ends when you consume the entire every bit of matter in the entire universe to make paper clips
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.080]   This sounds like a blast. I think I think you would like this
[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:41.600]   Um, this is one of those games. I keep coming back to it's a simple game. It's not graphical
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:46.640]   But it's based on the snicker nick bostrom thesis that yeah, you gotta give the
[01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:51.520]   Really the problem with AI is not the AI the problem of the AI is the humans
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:56.320]   You gotta give it the right rules. It's just gonna do what you tell it to do
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:32:02.240]   And so kathy is one of the smartest people in the business right now and she you know, she's connected to this whole
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:03.840]   um
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:08.800]   network of people who are academics and people like very smart people who are probably not like
[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:10.160]   a
[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:17.120]   Camera trained and not loud voices but very smart and really paying attention to the issues of AI ethics
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:24.000]   AI bias because you know like we've already noted here, you know, if you train AI on a corpus of data that happens to be bias
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.640]   Not that we're all racist, but you know if you take a corpus of data that is just from one source
[01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:31.760]   It is going to inherently be biased towards that source
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:37.360]   So you will have on the output you will have ends that aren't for the good of all humanity
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:40.560]   They will only serve that one particular group of people kathy
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:46.080]   Lists the potential real world harms that we could experience right now
[01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:52.080]   And I think that's really important to pay attention to so we don't get distracted by the existential potential problems
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:57.680]   Uh, there's one other challenge. I sometimes feel like no one's talking about. I sometimes climate change
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:01.040]   Hold on just a but I sometimes feel like yeah, sorry people like sam altman
[01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:10.640]   Uh have a vested interest in us. Yes, ignoring AI ethics and worrying about the existential threat to human kind
[01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:13.760]   They want us to worry about this pay no attention
[01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:17.280]   To the ethical concerns or the immediate concerns
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:21.600]   Let's really think about what AI is going to be like when it turns the world into a bunch of paper clips
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:27.200]   And I think that's a little self-serving. I've been wondering why these people who seem to be really
[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:33.120]   Nogible about AI are so worried about AI, you know taking over the world. I don't think that's the
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:35.440]   Problem
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:42.000]   In any near-term future. All right. Let's take a break before we talk about climate change, but but I that's no no that that's i'm all done
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:46.800]   Yeah, I think I will watch this because it sounds like kathy Baxter gets it she works at salesforce
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:55.040]   But sounds like that's exactly what she's saying. Right. Am I right? Am I paraphrasing her correctly? Yeah, that's it. You're exactly right. That's what she's saying
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:57.120]   Yeah, don't don't worry about these
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:00.000]   more
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.760]   approximate issues
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:06.240]   No, you don't have to worry about uh, you know the 23rd century in AI taken over
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:11.440]   Uh, let's break though. We got a great panel lots more to talk about. Let's get into AI in a second
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:15.200]   That's uh, that's our next topic of discussion
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:19.520]   Uh, but first a word from zip recruiter. I know
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:24.000]   I know all about how hard it is to hire people
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.800]   as the owner of a small business
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:33.760]   Uh plus as the owner of a small business. I know that you're not just dealing with hiring you're dealing with economic uncertainty
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:36.560]   An economy that's up and down
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:41.360]   We've all got the challenges, but at least when it comes to getting the right people
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:46.240]   You've got a hiring partner who's focused on you and your needs. It's the one we use
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:49.520]   And the one I highly recommend zip recruiter
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:52.560]   If you're hiring
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:57.040]   You got to hire the right people faster more efficiently. You got to keep costs down
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:02.720]   zip recruiter helps you do all that from pricing to technology everything that zip recruiter does
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:10.640]   Is to help you and to and what works best for you and I want you to try i'm free right now zip recruiter.com
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:15.920]   Slash to it. I can go on and on I have gone on I'm at all the things zip recruiter does for us
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:17.840]   But let me give you in a nutshell
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:20.800]   Some of the things zip recruiter does to make to take care of you
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:26.320]   The pricing completely straightforward. You're going to know exactly what it costs before you post your job
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:30.560]   No surprises. You can stick to your budget. You know, you're in charge of that
[01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:36.320]   You'll also reach more people than anywhere else because zip recruiter sends your job post to more than 100
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:39.600]   Job sites. You're casting the widest possible net
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:46.720]   One thing I've really learned is hiring is is what makes your company your company's made of people hiring the right person
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:50.240]   Makes a huge difference that you're company. Hiding the wrong person
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:53.200]   Also makes a huge difference the wrong kind of difference
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:58.320]   You'll want to hire the right person zip recruiter really helps with this because once you post your job
[01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:01.280]   Their smart technology will pinpoint
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:03.920]   candidates to qualify
[01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:07.680]   And send you their names. They'll find great candidates for you
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:13.600]   Give you the opportunity to invite them to apply for your job. So you look at the resume zip recruiter says
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:16.480]   And this you know when we post in zip recruiter
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:19.360]   You know, it's breakfast at least it says oh
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:21.760]   You know, we just got you know
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:25.760]   Ashley just gave us notice. We got to find somebody in the continuity apartment
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:31.520]   So she'll post it at breakfast right job opening now immediately that's going out to 100
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:34.160]   Job sites so it's going to a lot of people
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:38.000]   But then zip recruiter goes through the million resumes current resumes they have on file
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:43.440]   Because people come to zip recruiter looking for work and they say well, look here's five people that fit the qualifications
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:47.680]   You just posted at least it looks a dozen. Oh, that's good. Oh, that one's great
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:52.560]   No, I don't want that one and then invites the people she likes to the to apply to the next step
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:55.600]   I gotta tell you when you invite somebody to apply for your job
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:37:00.240]   They apply it's like it's very it's an honor. It's a they're thrilled right?
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:03.200]   So it's a great way to start your conversation with a candidate
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:10.240]   And then of course you're going to beat the other businesses to the punch because you're going to get those people they're going to apply
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:15.600]   You're going to hire them and by lunch we started breakfast by lunch. We always have two or three great candidates
[01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:17.200]   That's a nice feeling
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:22.960]   Especially when you're scrambling to fill a position hire the best people with the help of a partner who's all about you
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:30.320]   Making your life easier zip recruiter four out of five employers who post on zip recruiter get a quality candidate within the first

[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:48.240]   Dot com slash t w i t I can tell you for a fact zip recruiter. It's the smartest way to hire
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:51.840]   All right back to ai
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:53.840]   I
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:38:01.920]   Sarah Silverman is suing open ai. This isn't actually an interesting case and while i'm a huge fan
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:06.080]   I'm i'm not sure I agree with the case
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:09.840]   She says you can go to chat gpt
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:12.640]   She's suing open ai and meta
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:15.440]   Along with others
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:18.880]   She's a comedian of course author of a book called bed wetter
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:24.240]   She says you can go to chat gpt and say summarize bed wetter
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:27.600]   And chat gpt will summarize it
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:30.960]   Which she says proves
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:36.240]   That it's read my book that it's somewhere
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:40.320]   Seen my book and absorbed it into its corpus
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:47.440]   Uh, she says the reason is because even though her book is copyrighted
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:52.320]   There are a number of sites, uh, which will illicitly
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:56.160]   You know torrent sites and so forth put
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:59.600]   shadow libraries of copyrighted material online
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:06.080]   And that chat gpt would then has then scanned those and that's how it knows what her book is
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:16.960]   What does is there merit in this case? I love Sarah Silverman, but I don't think there's any merit to this case
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:19.760]   at all
[01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:22.960]   It also feels like there's no precedent yet
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:29.040]   So this could be the determinant here where what what becomes of copyright law with something like a yeah
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:33.920]   I don't know the answer to that either, but I think this will be really interesting in terms of of setting that precedent seeing
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:41.520]   What what happens from here? Uh, yeah, it's the same as the artists suing stable diffusion because
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:46.400]   Uh, you know, well you must have looked at my art to be able to draw something that looks like me or
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:50.160]   Getty saying we can see kind of a fragments of our
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:51.920]   uh
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:56.160]   Of our watermark on some of the images that you're putting up so that you must have
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:58.560]   looked at our stuff, but
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:02.720]   Here's why I think there's no merit in this at all if you ask me to summarize bedwetter
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:04.880]   I have read it and I can summarize it
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:08.880]   Is that violating Sarah Silverman's copyright? Absolutely not
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:14.880]   Isn't there a transformative? Yes, transforming it into something. It's not publishing her book
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:20.720]   It's summarizing it which I can do you can do completely legally
[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:27.280]   And I think the burden of proof here is gonna be difficult because you need to then prove that yes
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:32.000]   They did have access to illicit copies of the book. Maybe they bought a copy. I don't know
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.120]   Yeah
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:37.120]   library
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:39.920]   Or I mean they could have just summarized
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:45.520]   What the dozen two dozen reviews of the book. Yeah, which yeah
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:47.520]   What a reviews summarize right a lot of ash
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:50.400]   Suing
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:52.800]   Yeah
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:56.640]   I mean this is I think I understand look I'm sympathetic I understand
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:59.600]   um
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:02.080]   But when stuff okay, so
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:08.240]   I just don't see I don't see them winning these cases because this is
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:10.960]   Every artist who ever created a painting
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:17.040]   Uh looked at a lot of other art before they did that and maybe even copied some styles first
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:21.440]   They hold on to Leo. This is me. No, by the way everybody Benino was our technical director. Hello, Benito
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:24.000]   Um, but now you're treating you're an artist you're a creator
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:29.120]   So you have a now treating the AI like a person though saying that I can do it, but then why can't the AI?
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:33.200]   So because it's an AI it's it's a computer program. This is not a person you're talking about
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:36.320]   So why would we treat the first why would we treat the AI to say most people?
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:39.520]   Well, we have to treat copyright law. I mean
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:43.840]   You're right. I mean uh good luck getting any money out of the machine
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:51.200]   When they sue they're not suing the machine. They're suing the people who run the business the company and machines make copies
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:55.280]   Like all the time. Yeah, you don't you don't sue a Xerox machine
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:59.200]   For copyright infringement. You sue the human who did it
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:01.440]   so
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:04.800]   Yeah, it's a machine, but they're suing uh sam altman at all
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:09.680]   But it's I don't I I don't know is uh, so one thing
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:14.320]   Like a bar said this is a precedent setting it is precedent setting, but I don't think they're gonna win this one
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:22.320]   Yeah, the ais can do it. I mean adobe adobe is saying very clearly to avoid this. No, we're only gonna license
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:24.400]   We're gonna absorb licensed material
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:28.880]   Um, we're not gonna but if you put something public on the internet
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:33.840]   You're putting it in public
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:37.680]   Right
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:39.760]   I
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:43.120]   Don't I think we'll see of course it will be a precedent
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:48.640]   But I think the courts are gonna come down and say no, this is this is transformative. This is not
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:54.080]   This is not what you're similar to the google books case with right with his shit years ago
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:59.520]   But that was actual books google was copying the actual books scanning books. Yeah. Yeah
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:05.440]   And I guess the other issue would be like could you go to chat gpt team be like
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:13.120]   Give me chapter one and just no output sure you can't but you could say you can either
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:15.600]   Write me a book in the style of sera silverman
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:19.040]   Right
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:24.160]   That's not violating, you know, even if it's very much in the style of sera silver and just just as you know
[01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:28.320]   Paint me a painting in the style of the of concade
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:33.680]   Yeah, it's gonna look like concade painted it, but it's not the same painting. Yeah
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:37.680]   I will see I think the courts are gonna universally say no
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:40.640]   That that's not copying
[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:44.560]   That's that's uh
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:48.400]   synthesizing anyway would be very interesting very interesting to see
[01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:51.920]   Abar, what do you think? I
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:54.880]   I agree with you. I do think it's it's unlikely that they would
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:56.400]   um
[01:43:56.400 --> 01:44:01.920]   That they would side with silverman, but I do think I at the end of the day what's interesting here is is
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:06.480]   That fear right that fear from a lot of creators. Oh, I understand it. Absolutely
[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:12.000]   Yeah, so I think it'll be it's interesting to see what becomes of that and um,
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:16.640]   It is very reflective of of that general anxiety about what can this do?
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:18.960]   What can we allow it to do what should we allow it to do?
[01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:23.520]   But I think you definitely have a point in terms of um, I don't have a lot of faith that they'll be like, okay
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:25.520]   No, you can't do that. Um
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:31.200]   I I do I do think you have a point there. Well, the courts could I mean if they did say that they would really put a
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000]   uh
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:40.480]   A block in front of a ai's development it would slow it down quite a bit if you can't just uh
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:43.920]   You know there's an interesting article about uh
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:47.840]   AI using brave now is apparently
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:51.200]   allowing uh ai companies to
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:57.440]   Take copyright data and use it for ai training. This is an article from uh
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:04.960]   Stackdirey Alex even of the shady world of brave selling copyrighted data for ai
[01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:08.000]   Training but see google's been doing this
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.960]   too
[01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:19.120]   Brave is going out and uh and using it spider to try to create a search index to compete with google
[01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:22.000]   and apparently you can
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:28.160]   Brave offers numerous api products some which are specifically designed for ai
[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:34.880]   In fact one's called data for ai lets you feed results to ai models for inference
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:38.240]   You pay if you pay for it
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:40.240]   Uh
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:47.600]   You can get all that info that a that brave is you know spidering for its search index and use it for your uh
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:53.760]   For your ai so they're even enabling this but I say I don't I don't buy the uh the headline
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:56.400]   the shady world of brave
[01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:59.600]   Because it's I don't think it's shady is it
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:03.120]   If it were if we're private information, yes
[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:08.560]   Google has proposed using something like robots.txt it wouldn't be robots.txt, but some sort of
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:16.240]   uh file you as you may know you can keep google from indexing your website with a simple text file in the
[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:18.560]   directory of your website saying
[01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:23.680]   It gives permissions to spiders and so forth saying don't index this index this you can't you can say
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:31.760]   Do not index any of my site if you don't want your site to show up in google search results google is proposing something similar for ai
[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:37.440]   Which probably is a good idea, but I don't think there's a legal requirement that you would do that
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:39.520]   I think that if it's a public website
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:42.480]   It's a public website
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:45.680]   You're not saying well human can look at this, but no machine can
[01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:48.640]   or I mean
[01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:53.200]   That's what robots.txt says no machines allowed humans only
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:55.440]   I
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:47:01.360]   All right, you guys have nothing to say about that so i'm gonna i'm gonna move on
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:05.360]   It's a very intry it's a brave new world. We're part of
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:12.000]   Yeah, I think it's just interesting to watch it unfold because there's so much to think about right like we just we don't know the answers and there's
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.840]   Yeah, there's a there's a lot to each side of the argument
[01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:20.720]   Dan you so this is good. This is a good beat for you. This is what you're writing about for a zd, huh?
[01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:26.560]   It is yeah, uh, especially the the weird gray area of AI ethics
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:32.800]   And balancing that with innovation because a broad like you said this is a brand new era
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:37.440]   The social web era existed and now it feels like the past it does feel like
[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:41.760]   Metiverse or no metaverse. This is a new era of the internet
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:48.400]   Well, certainly that's one of the things the hollywood writers the writers killed of america and now
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:53.440]   The actors are worried about sag after going out on strike
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:56.160]   uh
[01:47:56.160 --> 01:48:00.400]   Boy, you got the actors and the writers out. I don't think there's going to be a lot of new hollywood material
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:02.480]   uh
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:07.680]   Coming out in anytime soon actors say one of the reasons they're striking
[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:10.160]   is because
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:14.320]   Hollywood studios will sign deals that basically give them the rights forever
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:17.680]   To your digital likeness
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:20.240]   um
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:22.640]   and so the uh so the
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:30.240]   This sag after is saying we want to prevent this the association. I'm sorry alliance of motion picture and television producers
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:33.040]   Uh
[01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:35.680]   Say well, we have something that's going to protect actors
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:39.360]   um
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:44.880]   But the the groundbreaking proposal according to the verge that they offered is
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:48.800]   uh, the background performers should be able to be scanned
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:51.680]   get one day's pay
[01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:57.040]   And then the company owns the scan the image their likeness and could be able to use it for the rest of eternity
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:02.480]   On any project they want with no consent no compensation. That's their proposal
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:06.640]   Sounds like a great deal
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:09.520]   And like they showed that uh
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:15.040]   They showed netflix there with uh the latest black mirror season. Yes. Yes
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:22.080]   That first episode uh, jones is awful. I haven't seen it. Tell me what that is. Do they did you guys jones?
[01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:25.120]   Yeah, when
[01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:29.840]   You'll love it actually because it's about when you uh agree to the terms of service
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:30.720]   Yeah
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:31.840]   in there
[01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:37.360]   Was netflix was saying we can own the likes your likes and basically what this says
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:40.160]   And that we can do whatever we want with it
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:45.360]   And you're not going to get any money in any compensation and so late
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:48.240]   I have to say when we would wait if you came on
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:51.120]   Uh on tech tv back in the day
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:57.360]   Uh, and maybe you did I don't know we would give you a contract that said we own the rights to this to be used
[01:49:57.360 --> 01:50:02.720]   In any form of media now existing or to be invented in perpetuity
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:10.480]   That's just the difference here was this was the consumers though who just watched now. Oh wow. Yeah, I don't think that's
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:14.560]   It wasn't for the actors. Although the actors were doing it too. So then what happened was
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:17.680]   Joan had a bad day. She came home
[01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:23.440]   She turned on netflix and then one of the first shows and it's not called netflix though. It's called a streamberry
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:25.200]   Which is a really great
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:29.600]   In fact if you go to if you go to streamberry, you can create your own
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:37.280]   Blah blah blah is awful. So I created a daniel's awful show and it does the whole banner here it is streamberry dot tv
[01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:42.160]   Somebody somebody did who set this up was it the black mirror folks or is it?
[01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:48.960]   Yeah, black mirror netflix. Yeah, oh that's funny netflix whether your name is john or not you or the star of the show
[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:54.640]   Take or upload a photo of yourself. You could be the next star of streamberry
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:58.560]   Well, wow, that's cool. So haven't
[01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:02.240]   Joan comes home from work. She turns on
[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:10.640]   Streamberry is watching it with her boyfriend and the show comes on called jon is awful and the lead is uh
[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:14.720]   Selma hi, I think it was Selma hi, yeah
[01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:18.400]   Yeah, it was uh, and but she has the same haircut
[01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:24.960]   As jon does and they start watching it and jones horrified to find that it's basically her day
[01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:28.480]   Act it out and what they're doing is they're using
[01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:32.240]   Selma hi, actually didn't act they just used her face
[01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:36.480]   Because she signed a contract saying that they can just use her face for whatever they want
[01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:40.080]   And so the show is entirely generated by ai
[01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:44.080]   Not in real time, but couple hours later
[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:50.720]   And so
[01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:53.040]   So all her friends and family end up watching it
[01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:56.640]   And like they're all like learning about all the secret stuff
[01:51:56.640 --> 01:52:02.080]   She's been saying and doing and that's why it's called jon is awful because it makes her look really bad
[01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:04.080]   Even though what she was doing wasn't really bad
[01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:07.760]   And they sometimes they take liberties with some things to add drama
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:12.960]   And then as a show progresses it turns out that they plan to do this
[01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:18.720]   Or everyone who signs up for streamberry that they're all going to have their own show
[01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:21.200]   Wow
[01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:23.120]   It's a little kind of Truman show except as everybody
[01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:25.680]   That's
[01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:28.400]   Has to be the name of this episode is leo is awful
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:30.720]   Yeah
[01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:36.320]   There you go. Yeah, it's our 18 plus 100 match one season. I am awful. Wow
[01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:38.480]   That's that's gonna be
[01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:41.760]   I think it though is one of the funniest episodes to watch it
[01:52:41.760 --> 01:52:42.800]   It's
[01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:45.440]   It's a riot and some a high it could just incredible in it
[01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:47.520]   She's and it gets it has a very meta
[01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:52.080]   Ending to it that kind of just really starts to hurt your brain and in terms of how deep the ai
[01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:59.120]   And supercomputer thing goes but it's uh, I mean it's not much different from what this is proposed with these actors
[01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:06.720]   Which is pretty absurd in my opinion that like I almost get like we can scan you and use you but the no compensation part
[01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:09.280]   Ever in that way, I mean
[01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:15.040]   Like if they had compensation like I could see the benefit there for the actor maybe like
[01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:19.680]   But nothing and not even an acknowledgement. That's just like, I don't know
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:22.800]   That's always think that you could probably use
[01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:25.120]   digital
[01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:31.680]   Simulacra as a threat too like if you don't sign this you're getting nothing like we're just gonna create our own tom cruise or
[01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:36.960]   Or some a hike or whatever like, you know what you don't like it. We can there's new movie stars all the time
[01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:39.280]   I think there's also plenty of artists
[01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:43.520]   Who would just sign it right and say fine, you know, okay?
[01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:47.120]   Give me it's a new ones. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:52.080]   Look work. That's where well. Yeah, I guess if you're extremes, right if you're super wealthy and you don't care
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:58.000]   They might do it or you're old and get ready to die or if you're sorry young. No other option
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:06.000]   I should mention if you're super young new amptp says no, no, we never said that it's you'd get compensated
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:07.680]   for that
[01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:13.520]   Show or movie, but if we were gonna reuse it we'd have to negotiate with you for you but no residuals
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:21.040]   Yeah, or yeah, maybe no residual. I you know what if if the if sag after wants to strike. I was I'm no longer a member
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:23.200]   on
[01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:26.960]   I don't know on vacation or something because I don't do the radio show anymore
[01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:31.120]   But I was a long time member of sag after if they want to strike I support them
[01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:35.840]   I think writers want to strike I support them they deserve they create great stuff for us and
[01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:38.400]   It's clear that you know the the
[01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:42.240]   Mowgles are making plenty of money. Just share a little bit
[01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:45.520]   It's important to support unions. Yes
[01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:47.600]   Yeah, I do think this is a prime example of what I mean
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:51.120]   But I'm glad that people are speaking up now about these things because you know
[01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:56.800]   Imagine if that became the norm and and people didn't speak up and that was just that just became our new reality. Yeah
[01:54:56.800 --> 01:55:00.400]   Anyone see the uh brand treasure speech
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:07.520]   She is on fire. Yeah, the nanny is the president of sag after
[01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:12.400]   And she is great. I uh I voted for her and I support her
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:15.040]   Um
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:18.240]   Let me see if I can uh should I play a little bit of this? Let me see
[01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:21.520]   um
[01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:28.640]   Bob eiger says oh, you know, uh, we don't we don't care
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:30.640]   uh
[01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:32.240]   Disney uh
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:34.240]   Disney doesn't need these guys
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:37.440]   Uh, he said uh, this was at sun at the sun valley
[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:39.040]   uh
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:40.640]   Conference
[01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:46.240]   Bob eiger said they're not being realistic. I uh, so his friend russia said in response
[01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:48.960]   I I found his remarks terribly repugnant
[01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:56.560]   That of touch you have to do it in the nanny's accent though positively down daff. I don't think it served him well
[01:55:56.560 --> 01:56:04.400]   If I were that company I would lock him behind doors and never let him talk to anybody about this because it's so obvious
[01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:06.160]   He has no clue
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:10.480]   Into what is really happening on the ground with hardworking people that don't make anywhere near the salary
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:15.280]   He's making high seven figures eight figures. This is crazy money they make
[01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:20.880]   I don't care and they don't care if they're land barons of a medieval time
[01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:23.120]   I want to find a recording of that. That's uh
[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:28.560]   I want to hear who say that you can I guarantee you can make a I make that I could do it
[01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:33.120]   Make you bet speech in the voice of the nanny
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:37.760]   I'm sure that that could be done. Um, I was gonna say though
[01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:42.400]   Like what's interesting too is none of this is completely new of course right on netflix
[01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:46.480]   They're running that really good short series about american gladiators
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:53.440]   And that was the theme of that show where the all the members were getting paid the gladiators were barely getting anything
[01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:56.800]   They're getting no residuals. They're getting nothing from those terrible and then
[01:56:56.800 --> 01:57:02.560]   Yeah, then they kind of gathered together almost as a union but not quite and they went said I hate
[01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:07.120]   We would like more money. They got fired on the spot and it was samo gold when he was like, we don't renegotiate
[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:13.200]   Yeah, now we're just a little bit going on from from your old employer. Uh, dan. Here's a little friend dresser
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:18.080]   Thank you. Thank you, don't kennan. Thank you everybody for coming to this
[01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:25.680]   That's her voice isn't it? It's really important that this negotiation she's a I have to say she's a great president
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:28.560]   Of sag after the cast of op and hymer
[01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:30.560]   Uh
[01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:34.400]   Ready to promote the movie was already in the group. Sorry stop that
[01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:41.440]   It walked out of the london premiere of the movie when the strike was announced they said, oh, we're on strike. Bye. Bye
[01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:47.920]   Which makes you wonder who's going to promote these films if the actors won't show up. This is not good
[01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:55.360]   Uh, silly and murphy emily blunt and matt daman walked out from the london premiere of op and hymer
[01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:58.320]   to quote right there picket signs
[01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:01.840]   ahead of the uh strike uh thursday evening
[01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:09.200]   Yay, demon has a long history of flavor. I mean he's always been active in that that scene anyway. Yeah, yeah, yeah
[01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:15.200]   John kusac had a great twitter thread. I think he was talking about his sister jon kusac about her getting paid a seventh
[01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:17.680]   of what the male
[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:23.600]   Stars of her show, uh, we're getting and not even getting she was always a guest star because they could pay her less
[01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:30.640]   Even though she was on every episode and yeah, there's all sorts of predatory practices in hollywood. Uh, are you surprised?
[01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:38.000]   especially for women and uh, yeah, it's so unfortunate just because this summer felt like the first summer
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:42.560]   I know we were coming back. I got with the movie theater. I got some good movies like
[01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:48.480]   I was just like wow where it's it's some really good stuff in the set of my now, you know, and it's just like oh
[01:58:48.480 --> 01:58:51.280]   Now the breaks everything has been put on on pause. Yeah
[01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:55.120]   Are you uh, are you uh barbie or open hymer?
[01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:57.760]   which
[01:58:57.760 --> 01:59:01.680]   I think barbie barbie looks up there with like the lego movie where
[01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:05.600]   Love movies shouldn't have been that good. Yeah, and then like I see this stuff on barbie
[01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:10.640]   I'm like, oh, this might actually be legit pretty hilarious. So i'm pretty excited about but yeah, open hymer is gonna be uh,
[01:59:10.640 --> 01:59:13.920]   Amazing to dan is our social con conscience here
[01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:18.560]   Uh, no, should we should we strike these movies? Should we not go see these movies?
[01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:21.280]   Now she goes to movies. Oh, okay
[01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:24.240]   I was worried
[01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:27.440]   It was a little bit weird, but I actually do support I wonder though. I mean
[01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:33.520]   The effects of a strike aren't going to be felt for a long time because a lot of stuff is already in the pipeline
[01:59:33.520 --> 01:59:40.800]   Uh, it's not going to be for six seven eight months. Maybe a year before we start seeing nothing a bunch of reality tv
[01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:43.760]   Yeah, depending on how long the strike goes on
[01:59:43.760 --> 01:59:51.280]   Producers and the writers have been on strike already. I know or months now. Do the right thing take care of the writers take care of the actors
[01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:53.360]   please
[01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:55.360]   We want our shows
[01:59:55.360 --> 02:00:01.840]   Uh, nobody here is unionized though, right? Okay. I was once part of the wga. I was actually a part
[02:00:01.840 --> 02:00:04.080]   Were you in the writer skills? I wasn't the writer's really
[02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:10.320]   Did you go out on strike last time? No, I wasn't I wasn't a part of it. You were five years old last time. That's why
[02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:14.400]   I guess I mean, I don't I don't know what I would have done as I mean
[02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:16.640]   I was an after the american
[02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:21.520]   Federation of radio and television artists, but then they merged with sag a few years ago
[02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:25.680]   So I have my sag after card. I guess I would have had to uh
[02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:30.240]   That we're not a union signatory. I could keep doing the show podcasts. They don't care about
[02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:34.560]   I was an IOTC for a long time. Were you were you stagehand?
[02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:41.600]   No theater projectionist. Oh, in fact, I organized a union. Yeah, I actually organized my movie theater
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:46.080]   Good. Yeah, it was a college project. My best friend and I came home for college. We're like, yeah screw this
[02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:50.000]   We're gonna organize a union totally get it. I'm college kids. Go back to school
[02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:53.280]   Exactly rowing in our lives
[02:00:53.280 --> 02:00:58.160]   All right. Let's take one final break. We've got a great panel so nice to have a bra. I'll heedy here
[02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:04.080]   Next time we'll find something good for you to talk about. I apologize. We talked so much about gaming
[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:08.000]   I'm enjoying this. I'm during the AI talks and the amazon talks. Yeah, great
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:12.960]   What do you what do you tell me a little bit about what you cover on on cine you do a lot of video for them?
[02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:19.920]   Yeah, a lot of video. I'm I'm very much focused on the social platforms and also digital accessibility is another uh,
[02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:25.120]   Focus out for me a very good area. Yeah, yeah, it's it's it's a great thing to work on
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:29.760]   I just got iOS 17 the public beta of iOS 17
[02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:35.680]   On my phone and there's a feature which I'm gonna I guess I'll have to I'll do this before a mac break weekly on Tuesday
[02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:38.160]   But there's a thing where you
[02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:42.880]   Teach it your voice personal voice. That's a voice. Have you played with that? Yeah
[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:48.640]   Um, I'm waiting. So I'm too scared to download the beta on my personal device once I get into the office next week
[02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:55.520]   I'm gonna play around with it. Um, but I am very excited about this feature. Um, it's very cool. It's it's slightly creepy, but yeah
[02:01:55.520 --> 02:01:58.400]   It says create your personal voice record yourself
[02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:02.240]   The reason I haven't done it yet is you have to read 150 phrases
[02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:07.920]   Uh out loud and then it securely stores your personal voice the idea being that
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:12.000]   Uh for it says assistive technology. So if you have trouble speaking
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:16.320]   You can uh or if you think you're going to have trouble speaking
[02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:22.720]   You can do this and now you can use your voice type and just like, you know, uh,
[02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:28.800]   Stephen Hawking instead of a robotic voice it'd be your own your own voice. So that's yeah, it's very cool
[02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:33.440]   There's a lot of really cool features on android and and iOS that are geared towards accessibility
[02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:36.240]   But as with all digital accessibility benefits everybody
[02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:41.280]   Yes, I agree, but I want my voice to be series voice
[02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:44.560]   I I don't know if they'll let me do that. That would be great
[02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:50.000]   If it could really if I got a series would respond to me in my own voice that would that's what I want
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.240]   You don't want france voice. I feel like you're real
[02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:53.280]   I could go fran
[02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:55.280]   I'll be a friend
[02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:58.560]   That would be kind of fun being being fran
[02:02:58.560 --> 02:03:03.840]   I when we come back. I want to ask you about uh house. What tiktok status is now
[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:06.720]   Like are they are they surviving?
[02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:11.040]   All of the attacks on them and I have to admit have a little dog in the sun because
[02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:16.000]   My son has become this, you know, he's got like two and a half million followers on tiktok
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:21.040]   He's become this tiktok influencer and and it's been huge for him
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:26.640]   So I was very I'm kind of was very worried about what was going on, but we'll check in with you in a second
[02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:30.640]   On that one also with us daniel rabino editor in chief of windows
[02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:33.760]   Central a great publication if you want to keep up
[02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:39.440]   With windows and so glad to welcome dan patterson back. I thought we'd lost you to the dark side
[02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:44.880]   But uh, no you're you're back as a journalist and doing great
[02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:47.040]   but
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:49.040]   Would you be if somebody came to you and said?
[02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:53.920]   Do you want to be freelance or with somebody came to you said we want to hire you would you would you want to be hired?
[02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:57.680]   Do you have a kid? I need a job. You need a job. I mean yeah
[02:03:57.680 --> 02:04:02.640]   Yeah, I I mean I was at cbs news for a very long time and I regret going to the
[02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:05.760]   Particular
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:09.280]   Were you doing pr is that what it was no no no no no no no no no no no
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:16.800]   I I was editorial for a cyber security firm. Okay, so it was kind they I I worked there for seven months and they laid me off
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:21.200]   Yeah, they said we don't what do you we were crazy. Why do we hire somebody? We don't need this
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:27.760]   Sorry about that. Well, look at this. It's not personal. They have to feel personal, but they're not personal
[02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:32.160]   They're about numbers believe me. I know we've had to lay off people in the past and we can't afford people
[02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:36.640]   You can't afford people but look at this pwnham who wouldn't want to hire this guy
[02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:42.320]   He's a wonderful journalist. No, this is great and twitters always great. I love having you on Dan
[02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:45.920]   I know that's not sanctimony
[02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:51.760]   That's your art. That's the conscience speaking and I think it's really important. It really is
[02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:56.960]   I've been bringing it up, but I've been bringing up gently in all our conversations about threads
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:05:01.360]   You know, it's meta right you know, does that bother you? Yeah, I got off
[02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:06.400]   I got off facebook years ago because I don't yeah, I deleted mine. Yeah me too
[02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:09.680]   Uh, and and I don't have what's app
[02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:14.080]   I had to have instagram but not so much to contribute up to it
[02:05:14.080 --> 02:05:18.640]   But more because if you're not logged in you can't show people's instagram pictures and sometimes
[02:05:18.640 --> 02:05:22.000]   That's how we you know, we would show that content on the shows
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:27.280]   But then it made it really easy for me is to slide in the threads
[02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:33.440]   And they got me and so now you're making me think twice and I think you're right. Absolutely
[02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:38.400]   Our show today brought to you by express vpn
[02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:43.200]   There are a number of good reasons to use a vpn
[02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:45.600]   security
[02:05:45.600 --> 02:05:47.120]   privacy
[02:05:47.120 --> 02:05:49.120]   eliminating geographic restrictions
[02:05:49.120 --> 02:05:56.080]   But I got to tell you there's only one vpn I recommend for these purposes and that's express
[02:05:56.080 --> 02:06:00.320]   vpn because they do it right let's talk about geographic restrictions
[02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:02.880]   Uh, I have a netflix account, right?
[02:06:02.880 --> 02:06:07.920]   But only when I'm in the us all I can see is netflix us if I travel I could see netflix in the uk
[02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:12.400]   Or japan or wherever I am they're all over the world in fact 100
[02:06:12.400 --> 02:06:15.200]   I think they're in 100 different countries
[02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:19.760]   Wouldn't it be cool if you didn't have to leave the us to be in another part of the world?
[02:06:19.760 --> 02:06:26.240]   Well, you can there are tens of thousands of shows and netflix that you don't get to see because you're in the us
[02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:30.320]   Watching netflix without using express vpn would be like I don't know
[02:06:31.120 --> 02:06:37.440]   Paying for a gym membership, but only using the treadmill baby. You got lots of stuff out there express vpn
[02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:42.560]   Let's change your online location. So you control where you want netflix to think you are
[02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:47.760]   So I was watching netflix in italy. I was thinking this is great stuff. Well now I can do that anytime
[02:06:47.760 --> 02:06:51.840]   Express vpn is all over the world over 100 server locations
[02:06:51.840 --> 02:06:57.760]   And it works with other services to bbc's iplayer youtube and more
[02:06:58.800 --> 02:07:03.280]   Uh, it is a real boon if you're a traveler, but it's even if you're just at home
[02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:08.000]   If you want to watch let's say top gear you just go to uk netflix by not being bad up
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:13.040]   Jurassic world on the hong kong netflix pulp fictions on canadian netflix
[02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:18.880]   Here's how it works express vpn's got an app for every platform windows mac even linux
[02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:27.440]   iOS android even routers they celebrate little router you could put in your house and now the whole house is on
[02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:31.520]   Express vpn very cool. So you fire up the app
[02:07:31.520 --> 02:07:36.640]   Now normally you just press the big button and it chooses the server it's closest to you because that's gonna be the fastest speed
[02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:40.480]   But here's the trick you can say no no. I don't want to be in the uk today
[02:07:40.480 --> 02:07:42.720]   You tap that button
[02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:43.920]   Suddenly
[02:07:43.920 --> 02:07:49.280]   Your ip address is no longer visible the ip address you're emerging under the public internet with
[02:07:49.280 --> 02:07:53.760]   Is in england and so sure watch what watch whatever you want
[02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:59.440]   Why should you choose express vpn blazing fast speeds let you stream an hd
[02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:03.360]   Anywhere in the world it's compatible with all your devices
[02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:10.720]   And privacy is job one express vpn goes the extra mile and I know this because they have independent third party audits
[02:08:10.720 --> 02:08:13.360]   Express vpn runs a special
[02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:18.240]   Distribution of debi and that automatically wipes the entire hard drive every day
[02:08:18.240 --> 02:08:23.280]   They also wrote their own trusted server, which has been vetted by third parties
[02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:28.800]   It operates sandboxed in ram and as soon as you close the server, it's gone forever
[02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:33.280]   Only you are on that server so there is no logging no trace of your presence
[02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:38.160]   It is truly private and of course everything you do is encrypted
[02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:45.920]   So you're fully secure be smart stop paying full price for streaming services and only getting access to a fraction of their content get your money's worth
[02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:51.840]   With a great service that protects your privacy and security at the same time express vpn.com/twit

[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:07.280]   Design like you pull this phone out. I've had a couple of comments from people just ran to places like what is that?
[02:10:07.280 --> 02:10:10.720]   You know and this is not a case. This is what the phone actually looks like
[02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:13.440]   Windows weekly the big story of course

[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:23.520]   Google and meta you've got these belligerent monopolists
[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:29.600]   Or at least dominant market players that are obviously doing harm and you're gonna go after this
[02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:32.080]   Yeah, it just never made sense
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:35.760]   Mac break weekly ray max well a long time friend in the network
[02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:41.120]   I ray he seems to love the mac pro because every time a new mac pro comes out right by his one
[02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:48.560]   I'm quite happy with it. I knew what I was getting. I knew why I wasn't getting the studio
[02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:52.800]   It does include a mouse, but does not include wheels. Did you buy the wheels?
[02:10:52.800 --> 02:10:56.480]   No twit it is a static mac pro
[02:10:56.480 --> 02:10:59.680]   It just sits there and don't roll nowhere
[02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:02.800]   We had a lot of fun and yes, uh
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:10.640]   mashed potatoes asking uh in the chat room is the table still greasy? No, we we wiped it down in fact
[02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:15.520]   Lisa my wife cleaned it up afterwards that was her uh on on the left there and uh
[02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:19.040]   She said they must never wipe this down. Look how filthy this
[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:23.600]   So we yeah, we don't we don't clean it as often as we showed it
[02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:25.600]   We actually left the place cleaner than it was
[02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:29.600]   When we started if you're not a member of club twit, that's just part of the fun

[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:19.520]   Uh, okay, abrar tick tock remember everybody was saying is chinese shut it down
[02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:25.760]   States were blocking it and just like last time this happened under trump a few years ago
[02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:28.960]   As everybody just said moved on
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:33.440]   Listen an addiction is an addiction. Uh, that's where I stand
[02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:40.080]   It's the one social media platform that I feel like I don't feel worse after I'm on it
[02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:44.160]   And I think a lot of people are in that same boat where um a lot of people just become hooked on it
[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:51.600]   It's a really the algorithm is and it's harmless, right? It's not it's you know as I I will not go on the record saying that
[02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:54.000]   But I will say that I
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:59.840]   Don't want that to be attributed to me if I'm absolutely wrong, but personally I do feel like you know for for me
[02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:05.280]   You know, you're you're gonna be at risk of of sharing too much data no matter what platform you join in 2020
[02:13:05.760 --> 02:13:11.280]   Right and so um for me what it ends up becoming is it's a platform where I don't feel myself
[02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:16.400]   You know, I don't feel like I'm comparing myself to other people like I do with instagram and I don't feel like I am just
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:19.360]   You know becoming undone every time I open up this app
[02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:23.120]   It's an app that I open up it shows me exactly what I want to see I get a good laugh
[02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:28.080]   Um, and it it brings a lot of people joy and I think um, you know
[02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:32.480]   I actually read a really interesting article from taylor lorens that really echoes what I feel
[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:36.560]   um in terms of people talking about twitter versus threads, but really
[02:13:36.560 --> 02:13:43.760]   TikTok is is the winner for a lot of people because that's where I go when I want to know about a trend or a product or
[02:13:43.760 --> 02:13:49.360]   No, if other people feel the same way that I do that's that's the platform that I gravitate towards
[02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:55.120]   And so I think that's why tiktok really has continued to grow and that's why people don't feel deterred by
[02:13:55.120 --> 02:13:58.560]   A lot of the concerns that um, you know lawmakers bring up
[02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:05.200]   And and a lot of privacy and security experts. Yeah, and if you're worried about privacy everybody just jumped on threads
[02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:09.040]   I mean if you look at the stuff threads gathers about you
[02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:13.360]   What is the argument that doesn't send it to the chinese government? Is that the issue?
[02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:20.080]   Right, that's a silly issue because it does that data brokers and if the chinese governor or anybody else
[02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:23.680]   wants that information they can buy it cheap
[02:14:23.680 --> 02:14:28.880]   From data brokers. They don't need tiktok together than information metas doing it for them
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:35.440]   Yeah, exactly and that's the argument a lot of people brought up was would you prefer the that you know, the us gets your data versus
[02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:42.320]   China is that really where you're drawing the line? Um, and yeah, it's all exactly so so taylor had a very interesting a couple of pieces
[02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:47.520]   Because they're I don't know what it is about tiktok, but there's a certain group of society that just
[02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:54.720]   It's just there. Oh, it's skit. Oh tick tock. So the latest today show the today show actually
[02:14:55.520 --> 02:15:00.960]   Ran a segment on a dangerous tiktok trend called the boat jumping challenge
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:03.360]   where people were
[02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:07.040]   Apparently jumping off boats and they said many have died
[02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:14.320]   Except it didn't happen and you know good on taylor for for looking into it
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:19.600]   Stories were published in people magazine forbs the daily mayor the new york post
[02:15:19.600 --> 02:15:22.160]   Uh
[02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:25.040]   It's and the mail-in post tell you something both murdock
[02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:29.200]   Publications that it's that there is some political slant
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:34.240]   To this there was no which taylor writes there was no boat jumping challenge on tiktok
[02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:39.520]   Before the media frenzy no boat jumping videos had gone viral no
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:43.600]   Hashtag related to jumping off boats had ever been popular on tiktok
[02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:49.360]   Not a single trending audio and tiktok has ever been linked to jumping off boats
[02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:54.800]   So it started with the alabama law enforcement agency saying
[02:15:54.800 --> 02:16:03.120]   On july third a new story was shared by today by nbc's today show regarding first responders warning
[02:16:03.120 --> 02:16:06.160]   Against a deadly boating tiktok trend
[02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:08.960]   Please be advised
[02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:13.120]   The information was wrong. There is no record of this happening
[02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:15.360]   Uh
[02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:20.880]   Until thursday of this week the spokespeople for today wouldn't refuse to comment
[02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:25.600]   finally tiktok today admitted it and uh and
[02:16:25.600 --> 02:16:29.600]   Has uh has retracted the story
[02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:36.640]   Didn't have it does feel like a lot of a lot of publications do hop on that when they hear about something that feeds into that
[02:16:36.640 --> 02:16:40.000]   That bias of okay tiktok is dangerous. Let's let's talk about this
[02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:44.080]   Let's really lean into the fact that it's dangerous because of xyz and you know
[02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:50.800]   It with a non equal distribution in terms of talking about the other social platforms and the dangers that they might um, you know present
[02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:57.440]   The uh origin of the boat jumping challenge Taylor laren's rights can be traced in the washington post could be traced to a single comment
[02:16:57.440 --> 02:17:01.440]   That a local alabama resident made during a news broadcast
[02:17:01.440 --> 02:17:04.000]   Uh
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:08.240]   Bobby uh plot event a multimedia journalist at abc news
[02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:13.120]   In bermingham got a tip about boating accidents spoke to jim dennis
[02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:19.520]   During the interview dennis claimed it was tiktok that was causing children to jump off the back of boats
[02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:23.920]   He just made that up
[02:17:23.920 --> 02:17:26.080]   It was wrong
[02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:32.240]   It's the same thing with the tide pod challenge and uh the benedrill challenge we had that in the petaluma
[02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:40.000]   Our local paper read a story. Oh, it's all over tiktok teens are going up to doors and kicking on them and then running away
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:41.920]   kind of uh
[02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:45.600]   And what is it a dingon dash dong and dash ding dong and dash
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:50.880]   Doorbell ditch doorbell ditch. Thank you sounds like you know a little bit about that there bonito
[02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:52.640]   um
[02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:54.640]   And they were saying you know
[02:17:54.640 --> 02:17:58.560]   People were terrified. They were there were shootings and never happened
[02:17:59.360 --> 02:18:02.640]   Never happened. We I don't know what it is. We just want to believe this stuff
[02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:07.760]   It's if it's a platform that people don't understand then they'll very quickly lean into
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:13.040]   That's what it is. Anything that's sound makes it sound dangerous. That's what it is. So don't worry
[02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:18.080]   Kids are not jumping off boats. The today show says that was wrong
[02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:23.440]   Uh and don't kill wasps with gasoline. That's not a good idea either
[02:18:23.440 --> 02:18:26.640]   So what about the states? Well, actually texas
[02:18:27.440 --> 02:18:33.520]   Has been sued now over its tiktok band saying that's a violation of the first amendment government cannot do that and
[02:18:33.520 --> 02:18:35.840]   You know what? I think that's a good point
[02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:41.280]   The night first amendment institute at columbia university found the lawsuit
[02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:47.200]   Uh against the texas tiktok band. So maybe these bands munt muntana has one
[02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:54.320]   Alabama has one I think that's right. Yeah, um, yeah, it's it's interesting. I you know, obviously people are not going to uh, uh,
[02:18:54.640 --> 02:18:59.200]   You know, take it take it. Well, if if you're if you're banning an app that popular
[02:18:59.200 --> 02:19:05.120]   I mean, I have to say that tiktok has the same issues that other platforms have in terms of you will come across content
[02:19:05.120 --> 02:19:07.840]   Especially younger users that you know
[02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:13.200]   That might make them feel that's up to the parents. That's up to the police. Yeah, right?
[02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:15.920]   That is, you know, that that is an argument that that's up to parents
[02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:21.520]   It it goes back to the discussion that we've had this whole show of is that the platforms or is it the ways that people use those platforms?
[02:19:21.520 --> 02:19:25.680]   But I but I can't I can't rave about tiktok without also saying there is a caveat here
[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:28.320]   It's not all great content that's gonna make you feel amazing
[02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:34.720]   But you know, there are certain certain demographics that might struggle more with the content that they see versus the content that I see
[02:19:34.720 --> 02:19:41.680]   Um, so I just had to put that out there too. There is nothing wrong with learning how to make sandwiches on tiktok
[02:19:41.680 --> 02:19:49.120]   And I strongly encourage that you all do that it was delicious. Yeah 8.4 million views on this one
[02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:53.920]   Um, my son though has moved to instagram for the most part instagram and youtube
[02:19:53.920 --> 02:19:58.800]   Um, but he got to start on tiktok. It's funny. He went from zero to
[02:19:58.800 --> 02:20:02.320]   It just took it took a few months because the algorithm picked it up
[02:20:02.320 --> 02:20:08.400]   And once the algorithm picks it up it launches you. It's pretty cool. It's the algorithm doesn't like me
[02:20:08.400 --> 02:20:14.160]   So I'm glad it likes that's great. You think it's uh because you wear a hijab. Do you think it's like?
[02:20:14.160 --> 02:20:15.360]   I don't know
[02:20:15.360 --> 02:20:20.800]   I I feel like I I wish I knew the answer, but you know, my friends like my tiktoks. So i'll take it
[02:20:20.800 --> 02:20:25.840]   Let's get some followers. What's your tiktok handle a bra?
[02:20:25.840 --> 02:20:30.640]   It's my first and last name. So it's a bra rlhitti. No hyphen. How hard is that?
[02:20:30.640 --> 02:20:33.280]   It's just yeah, it's just me being
[02:20:33.280 --> 02:20:36.480]   Uh ridiculous and anything that pops into my head. I just do it
[02:20:36.480 --> 02:20:40.080]   And it says tech reporter who downloaded this app for research
[02:20:40.080 --> 02:20:42.640]   Yeah, quote-unquote
[02:20:42.640 --> 02:20:49.680]   Wait a minute. That's wrong. Everybody please follow a bra right now. I appreciate that
[02:20:49.680 --> 02:20:55.360]   Um, I have a video my latest video is unboxing elan musk's burnt hair perfume
[02:20:55.360 --> 02:20:57.360]   So if you're into that
[02:20:57.360 --> 02:21:01.360]   My reaction it's awful. I sprayed one spray and then my entire apartment
[02:21:01.360 --> 02:21:06.400]   I had to like open all the windows light a candle. I don't know what's in there, but what's wrong with him
[02:21:06.400 --> 02:21:10.720]   I mean, it's a funny. It's a funny dad joke, but he actually made it
[02:21:11.360 --> 02:21:14.160]   He made it and sold out and you know, I bought it for work
[02:21:14.160 --> 02:21:21.840]   So I wasn't like personally purchasing it with my hard-earned dollars, but um, but I don't know why people are really excited
[02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:25.280]   Somebody commented on there saying sell it to me and I was like, oh, I mean, I'm happy to sell
[02:21:25.280 --> 02:21:29.040]   I don't want it anymore, but this people want it actually smell like burnt hair
[02:21:29.040 --> 02:21:31.200]   I think it does. I think it okay
[02:21:31.200 --> 02:21:33.200]   So the way I described it in my video, which is really weird
[02:21:33.200 --> 02:21:37.280]   But I said it smells like dirty outside, which if you don't live in san francisco, you might not understand
[02:21:37.280 --> 02:21:40.800]   But it's basically like that's what I feel like it smells like
[02:21:41.120 --> 02:21:43.120]   What is wrong with elan
[02:21:43.120 --> 02:21:47.520]   We have to have a whole show about that if you want an answer. I don't know
[02:21:47.520 --> 02:21:51.920]   I don't know it's sold out. So he's doing something right. He has his stance, doesn't he?
[02:21:51.920 --> 02:21:58.320]   Yeah, oh, absolutely. By the way, speak freely. Taylor's version thumbs up. Oh
[02:21:58.320 --> 02:22:04.400]   Oh my god double thumbs up. Uh, I'm going to her concert in two weeks and people are treating it like it's my wedding day
[02:22:04.400 --> 02:22:06.800]   Because they keep asking me when's the big day?
[02:22:06.800 --> 02:22:10.400]   That's a stir I call
[02:22:11.200 --> 02:22:15.040]   I shouldn't out you on this but how much did you spend on those tickets?
[02:22:15.040 --> 02:22:21.440]   I spent 365 for lower bolsey's and I would sell a kidney honestly at this point
[02:22:21.440 --> 02:22:24.240]   So it was a steal for me. That's not bad at all
[02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:27.520]   Yeah, so you got directly through ticket master
[02:22:27.520 --> 02:22:31.520]   Um, it was a whole debacle. I was supposed to have access
[02:22:31.520 --> 02:22:35.680]   You know for presale it, you know as we all know ticket master as a disaster
[02:22:35.760 --> 02:22:40.000]   It didn't work out and then a friend a friend of a friend sold them a face value for me
[02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.480]   So bless her. I hope she knows how much I appreciate it
[02:22:42.480 --> 02:22:45.360]   She doesn't even know me personally, but my friend told her that I am a dinosaur
[02:22:45.360 --> 02:22:47.920]   I'm glad she did she not want to see Taylor
[02:22:47.920 --> 02:22:52.560]   They had um, they had two friends that were successful. So they didn't need both tickets
[02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:57.440]   Uh, they was like a friend group that broke it all up. So thank you to that to that person that kind soul
[02:22:57.440 --> 02:22:59.760]   California Senate bill 829
[02:23:01.040 --> 02:23:07.920]   Bars entertainment facilities like arena amphitheers and stans from entering into exclusivity contracts with ticketing companies
[02:23:07.920 --> 02:23:10.400]   like ticket master
[02:23:10.400 --> 02:23:19.040]   Yes, um, let's hope that that passes because this is the problem is that ticket master insists on exclusivity with the venues
[02:23:19.040 --> 02:23:22.800]   And so artists like taylor swift have no choice but to use ticket master
[02:23:22.800 --> 02:23:28.880]   And then it becomes a personal battle like it falls upon the artist to kind of like she's really been
[02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:34.240]   Pushing and speaking openly against ticket master as much as she can not much you can do that much
[02:23:34.240 --> 02:23:38.240]   But it the onus falls upon them to make their fans happy
[02:23:38.240 --> 02:23:43.920]   But it's your lignation is just such a huge force and and venues don't want to lose out on that revenue either
[02:23:43.920 --> 02:23:46.240]   Where are you gonna see her?
[02:23:46.240 --> 02:23:50.480]   At levi's in san kahre. It's here. Yeah, she's in it's here. She's in town
[02:23:50.480 --> 02:23:55.040]   I'm taking the full day off. It's a friday because I feel like we have to leave it like noon
[02:23:55.280 --> 02:23:59.600]   Oh, yeah, to get there and like not deal with the traffic. Yeah, we used to go to nonus games
[02:23:59.600 --> 02:24:05.520]   Down there the trick is to drive part of the way and then take the train the rest of the way so you don't have to park
[02:24:05.520 --> 02:24:09.280]   Oh, that's smart. That's a good night. Okay. Thank you. I've been asking around for tips
[02:24:09.280 --> 02:24:15.920]   I needed to be asking you the whole time. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I worked for football games. I don't know tatay is something
[02:24:15.920 --> 02:24:18.480]   Something next level
[02:24:18.480 --> 02:24:24.240]   So not being a taylor swift fan. I had no idea, but I really admire her re-recording all of her
[02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:26.960]   albums because she lost the rights to the masters
[02:24:26.960 --> 02:24:30.000]   That's right. And uh, so she said well fine
[02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:35.120]   I'm just gonna record them as taylor's version and all my fans will buy from now on instead of
[02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:40.480]   The old version they'll buy taylor's version. I really admire that so I listened to the whole album. I enjoyed it
[02:24:40.480 --> 02:24:45.680]   I love that. I'm not a young woman. I feel like it's music for young women primarily
[02:24:45.680 --> 02:24:46.720]   It can't be
[02:24:46.720 --> 02:24:51.920]   Well, the thing that's really great about this is as much as much of a burden as it was for her to go through that and rerecord
[02:24:51.920 --> 02:24:55.040]   everything and as much as it, you know, surely cost her a lot of money to do it
[02:24:55.040 --> 02:25:00.240]   But people are rediscovering those albums. So that came out in 2010, but the re-releases in 2023
[02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:04.480]   So she's doing it in 2010, but sure and has lived life
[02:25:04.480 --> 02:25:09.120]   So I've I mean, i'm christina warren's also a big fan. She's yeah
[02:25:09.120 --> 02:25:15.600]   She's been reviewing track by track. Would you say are they identical to no their her voice is even different, right?
[02:25:15.600 --> 02:25:19.040]   Her voice is different. That's actually better. It's she's you know, her
[02:25:19.040 --> 02:25:22.480]   Her voice is or more mature exact vocals are more mature exactly
[02:25:22.480 --> 02:25:27.920]   It's richer and also, you know, they're there's slight very very slight differences in the songs, but usually it's better
[02:25:27.920 --> 02:25:33.520]   Um, and it just sounds cleaner. Uh, her voice has has improved obviously over the years
[02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:37.680]   So it's it's it's like a new and it's like a remaster. Are the music tracks the same?
[02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:41.840]   I mean, are they roughly the same? The production is the same. They're not re-ranging it
[02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:47.280]   It's just exactly because if it was rearranged people would be compelled to listen to the old version and that would completely
[02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:50.400]   To keep the purpose so they've done a really good job recreating everything
[02:25:50.400 --> 02:25:53.760]   Yeah, she how did she do that she owns?
[02:25:53.760 --> 02:25:55.280]   um
[02:25:55.280 --> 02:25:57.360]   Also a swift person
[02:25:57.360 --> 02:26:01.280]   Uh and purchased the record and my daughter we play
[02:26:01.280 --> 02:26:02.800]   Uh
[02:26:02.800 --> 02:26:09.440]   Taylor swift vinyl for her your one year old is a tatay fan. I love that. That's awesome
[02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:14.800]   But I'm curious. How did she do? Does she own the publishing? Yeah, she didn't own the masters
[02:26:15.040 --> 02:26:18.240]   Right. Yeah, because she wrote the songs was able to rerecord them
[02:26:18.240 --> 02:26:21.120]   There are I think there's something that says that they have there has to be a
[02:26:21.120 --> 02:26:26.800]   You have to be able to distinguish them. So there might be one word that she sings slightly differently in the song
[02:26:26.800 --> 02:26:31.920]   Oh, there's something you can definitely hear the bass or like you can hear the instrumentation is different
[02:26:31.920 --> 02:26:34.720]   Exactly. It's a bit more subtle. Yeah, yeah
[02:26:34.720 --> 02:26:36.560]   That's the case. Usually it is better
[02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:42.800]   I will say this is probably the album that she's done the best job kind of the production is is the best and and the
[02:26:42.880 --> 02:26:47.120]   The audio engineering has been the best because I think for red which you were at least a while ago
[02:26:47.120 --> 02:26:49.200]   There were some that I was like this doesn't feel finished
[02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:52.160]   But I think this one is is definitely the cleanest example
[02:26:52.160 --> 02:27:00.800]   Well now now Dan and daniel know what it felt like early in the show when they were talking about gaming and
[02:27:00.800 --> 02:27:04.480]   You have leveled the playing field. Thank you all for sitting through that
