[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.960]   It is a year ender and in traditional style with all the media you got to look back at 2006.
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.960]   You got to look forward to 2007, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.720]   At least we've got a great group of people to do it.

[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.520]   from TechCrunch.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.960]   Man who really made all the stories of 2006 are great many of them.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.960]   You broke a few.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.960]   Hey, Mike.
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.960]   You broke the biggest one.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.960]   Thanks for having me.

[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.520]   Year's Eve.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.560]   It's a small task compared to the mammoth drinking that will be required.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.880]   Do you drink warm beer on New Year's Eve or do you do something a little fancier?
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.720]   I would never ever drink warm beer.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.480]   Who drinks warm beer?
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.080]   I thought the Brits drank warm beer.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.080]   Maybe I'm drunk.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.080]   I was a long time ago.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.360]   It was only in very bad pose.

[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.280]   Last time we talked, you were on a boat.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.840]   We were at sea.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.400]   We were getting free buffets, morning, noon, night, and every hour in between.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.200]   We were trying to struggle on even though we only had three meals today.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.840]   And all the Purell we could squirt.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.840]   And...
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.080]   We had some home with you.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.240]   Ladies and gentlemen, the star of our show, John C. Devorak.org/blog.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.240]   Hello.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.880]   Who in 10 minutes has to put some meat on the griddle.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.880]   Is that right?
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.720]   I'll start the timer.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.240]   Is that metaphorical for like writing or is it actual meat?
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.360]   Well, if it was going to be metaphorical, it wouldn't be for writing.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.360]   I can tell you right now.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.360]   It wouldn't be a metaphorical dinner.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.640]   I was about to say, look like Mr. Bigshot if you say that you're a professional tech
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.000]   writer and you're having meat tonight.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Metaphorical meat.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.040]   I'm having Top Ramen with the fake shrimp sauce.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.040]   Yeah.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.240]   My son actually picks the vegetables out of the Top Ramen.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.960]   Just to show you how health conscious he is.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.960]   So we have a list.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.720]   I have prepared a list, which is unusual for me to have done any preparation at all, of
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.640]   the top stories of 2006 or just a few of them.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.520]   But if you guys have some that you'd like to add to the list, certainly do so.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.680]   Well, before we even get to those top stories, Leo, that's just something topical.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.240]   I sense Will seems to have some insight as to Dave being sold.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.240]   Yeah.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.240]   What's the deal on that?
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.240]   That will.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.040]   I don't have the inside info, but I read it on Valleywag, so it must be true.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.040]   I read it.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.120]   I want a bumper sticker.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.040]   I read it on Valleywag.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.040]   What do they say?
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.440]   Well, they say that Dig isn't going to be sold anytime soon since they've just diluted
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.600]   some more shares with some more money coming in.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.440]   Mike was saying that they got more money, too.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.600]   Eight million bucks.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.600]   From?
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.600]   Same people as before.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.040]   Yeah, the same investors.

[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.040]   No, no.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.800]   It was just it was great lock in.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.840]   Two of her else is in, I think.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.840]   Is it index?
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.840]   I don't know.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.840]   And they need the money for what?
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.880]   Well, they're not properly at the F18 employees.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.880]   Payroll.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.880]   They don't need the money for payroll?
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.880]   Eight million?
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.880]   Payroll and parties.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.680]   And ping-pong balls for the staff conference table.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.680]   What do you guess?
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.240]   What do you guess the burn rate at Dig is?
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.880]   Well, you can generally assume 10,000 or a little more per employee per month all in.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.280]   And you know, assuming that's, you know, with their number of pages they have, I'd imagine
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.360]   they're making $100,000 a month in revenue, maybe a little more.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.000]   So, you know, they're probably burning 70, 80,000 rough guests.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.520]   I don't really know what their revenue is.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.600]   Is bandwidth a cost for somebody like Dig?
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.600]   Sure.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.600]   And they have a ton of servers too.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.880]   So yeah, they're definitely going to have some expenses on that end.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.880]   I like to look it out.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.840]   I mean, about a year ago they took one point, whatever million.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.840]   And they was that about.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.000]   So that's like what, like 100,000 a month?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.920]   They raised 2.8 in October of 2005.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.480]   And then they just raised another eight and a half.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.480]   You know, what I've heard on that, I didn't read the story that you referred to in Valley
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.480]   WAG.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:55.320]   But, you know, from the sources, my sources on that, which are companies that Dig pitched,
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.640]   was that Dig was looking for 150 to 200 million for an easy exit.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.880]   And if they got it, they wouldn't raise the B round.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.400]   And nobody bit.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.080]   And although apparently they got close with Fox, but nobody bit.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.240]   And then, you know, they raised the B round to keep chugging along.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.720]   Nobody did an analysis though.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.440]   And it said, you know, if you look at the revenue multiple, it was like 200 million.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.920]   It's like 41 times their revenue.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.960]   And when my space was bought, it was something like four times revenue or something like that.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.880]   And so it just didn't make the 200 million just doesn't make any sense unless you really
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.080]   believe Dig is going to be, you know, a top five website on the internet.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.000]   Was this a, would you judge a big year for acquisitions or a slow year?
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.480]   I mean, there were quite a few acquisitions, AMD acquired ATI, Google.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.120]   Of course, the big Google buyout.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.120]   What else?
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.960]   There wasn't anything but acquisitions.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.040]   Yeah, Google spent a lot of money.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.400]   Yahoo spent a lot of money.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.800]   Sure weren't any hot IPOs, that's for sure.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.280]   Yeah, I can't think of any IP.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.440]   Were there any big IPOs at all?
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.240]   Were there anything that--
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.240]   Nothing in the web.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.120]   GoDaddy pulled them, their IPO.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.120]   And I think October.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.120]   That's right.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.120]   So the only money made was by people selling.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.120]   M&A.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:14.160]   It's hard to IPO right now though with Sarbanes Oxley and you know, that's just an incredible
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.720]   amount of compliance requirements, especially even for small startups that are going public.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.160]   And you know, the fact of the markets demanding profitability and a lot of these new web startups
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.160]   just aren't there yet.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.760]   They're not even close to profitability.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.920]   So it's going to take some time for them to mature.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.840]   Sarbanes Oxley is a disaster.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:31.840]   Oh, is it?
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.840]   Yeah, really?
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.280]   This is the legislation that was introduced after, of course, the Enron.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.080]   Yeah, after all the crookies.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.080]   The crooks were busted, which seems to me--
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.080]   Were all the crooks busted?
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.080]   We're all the crooks.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.680]   I mean, most of them were and it says to me that the system worked.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.360]   I mean, they were all sure these guys maybe got a little further than they should have.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.160]   But Sarbanes Oxley hurts everybody.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.560]   It didn't change anything about the-- with the options scandal.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.040]   You're able to go right ahead and give themselves bogus options.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.000]   Well, they got busted for that too.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.160]   By the way, the good news is an internal investigation and Apple has cleared Steve Jobs.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.160]   Do we trust in general investigations?
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.640]   I thought that was a great one.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.320]   Is there a line from a film?
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.880]   We should never start an internal investigation until you know what the outcome is going to
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:11.880]   be.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.880]   Maybe Steve knew.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.480]   Okay, well, I guess we can go to the stories now since we--
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.480]   We're doing the stories.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.480]   These are the stories.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.480]   These are the stories.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.480]   These are the stories.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.480]   This is it.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.680]   The stock options is the story of those six in it.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.760]   Huge story.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.920]   That and Del Soney battery recall.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.960]   I mean, that's about it.
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.680]   This is like white water was to the Clinton administration before they heard about Monica
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.920]   Lewinsky.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:37.440]   That's the chink in the Steve Jobs armor that everybody's just trying to put crowbar into
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.080]   and finally, finally, finally find a way to bring him down.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.080]   It's really a lot of fun.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.080]   And it didn't happen.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.080]   I mean, if you--
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.560]   Why does anybody care about bringing down Steve Jobs?
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.560]   Everybody does.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.720]   Everybody who's ever-- who ever tried to mark in an iPod, wants to bring down Steve Jobs.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.280]   No, maybe you're right for that.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.280]   Maybe you're right.
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.760]   This was the year Bill Gates announced that he was going to be stepping down in 2008.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.040]   We talked a little bit about that when that happened.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.120]   Like about a long lead time for a resignation.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.720]   You said it was a good thing for Microsoft.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.200]   Yeah, I did.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.560]   I'd like to see them, you know, kind of professionalize themselves at the top end a little better.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.560]   Anybody disagree?
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.640]   Think that Bill Gates leaving will be the end for--
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.360]   I find it amusing that Bill Gates leaving will be one of the stories of the years in
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.040]   2006 and two years later in 2008.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.080]   Yeah, that's what the chain letdown walk out.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:29.720]   Does anybody really think that Bill Gates is still having a really big impact on week-to-week
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.720]   operations?
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.760]   I can't at an organization of that size.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.280]   But I think this is Mike.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:40.640]   I think he provides a steady leadership there and he's fairly low key when it comes to just
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.600]   his personality and how much he promotes himself.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.840]   I think he's a great leadership force there.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.840]   You know?
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.360]   And they still have a ton of revenue to compete with Google.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.000]   You know, I'll argue with that because every time I've said the same thing in the past and
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.280]   every time somebody who's an insider up there says it's bull, that Gates is still at the
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.280]   company, he's still micromanaging, he's still got his fingers in every pie.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.280]   And I'm not going to disagree with the possibility that that's the case.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:12.280]   You mean even down to like on Vista, sort of the individual features and I.com and everything.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.880]   I mean, how could he possibly have enough time to do that even if he wanted to?
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:17.880]   He does.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.160]   I mean, how does he have time to do what he does?
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.360]   I mean, he's been a micromanager since day one.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.960]   He's got the biggest company in the world.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.760]   I mean, software company.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.360]   And he's loaded and he's got to play bridge all the time with Buffett and he's, you know,
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.480]   and he does these other things and he's got his, of course, I think his charity is largely
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.480]   run by his wife.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.640]   So I think that helps a little bit.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.200]   But for the most part, this is what I'm told and it's not unusual in the past.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.680]   I don't see why it would change in the future.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.680]   Well, okay.
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.680]   John's.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.680]   Okay.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.680]   Let me ask a different question, John.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.000]   Have you had a chance to look at Vista yet and do you have any, you know, any opinion
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   on it?
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   You know, I have only, I have not installed it.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.720]   I actually kind of refused to until I am not one of, I'm not the type of guy.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:59.680]   Who's like into the cutting edge of, you know, I am with some things, but not with Microsoft
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.040]   products because it's always like a painful experience.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.200]   Vista surprisingly good.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.280]   I've installed it on a, on a machine.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.400]   I'm actually, and you know, I'm, well, you are all, that's you, Leo.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.000]   You will all way, you'll have stuff immediately.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   You are in the cutting edge.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   That's my job, dude.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.480]   I don't know about that.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.880]   Well, I would do it anyway.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.880]   You're right.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.880]   No, you would.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.120]   That's just the way you are, but I'm a little more cautious and I saw no.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.320]   I mean, I've looked at it.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.680]   I've dicked around with it a little bit.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.840]   I do not have it running.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.840]   I'm pretty impressed.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.840]   So no, I'm completely and I'm not going to probably run it.
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.840]   I am.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.840]   I am.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.840]   It's to mid-year.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.840]   Andy and Aco, you're impressed.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.840]   You're a Microsoft hater.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:38.160]   Well, according to everybody who read my, my Zoom review, but I'm getting it from both
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.920]   sides now because I have an article for the international editions of Macworld.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.440]   It's now up on macusea.com.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:48.160]   That's basically the subject is all kinds of really great features in Vista that I hope
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.960]   that Apple steals for leper versions.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:50.960]   I agree.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.960]   I agree.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.960]   There's a lot of really nice.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:53.960]   Works for one thing.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.960]   The search works.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.760]   Yeah, but let's go beyond that.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.600]   The voice recognition should be standard on every single operating system.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.520]   It works incredibly well.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.520]   I've got it.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:08.360]   I've got it on my media center PC right now and because I'm a geek and I was able to
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:12.280]   instantly go out to RadioShack and spend 50 bucks on a really nice directional microphone.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:17.960]   I can simply, it's like using controlling this machine for my sofa is just like using
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.440]   the computers and Blade Runner where I can say YouTube, search.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.080]   David Bowie, three, play.
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:31.600]   And it's something or a nice feature actually for a Vista for a home media center.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.600]   That's something important actually.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.800]   Well, if it actually does it.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.800]   It's not just for home media play.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:36.800]   It's for just about everything.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:41.720]   It's the first voice recognition system I've seen that is so ambitious that anybody, even
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:46.840]   who people who are not unfortunate enough to require a system input will actually start
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.680]   using it from day to day because it's just that convenient.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.320]   Not continuous speech recognition though.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.320]   You're not talking about dictation.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.960]   You're talking about commands.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:58.360]   Commands are, I give commands an A minus, continuous speech recognition.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.240]   I would give a B maybe if I used it more.
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.840]   I would either give it a half letter grade above or below.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.920]   What are you asking this question?
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:11.480]   Just because Microsoft has its share of flops and I think the zoom is one of them.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:15.480]   I have three zoons laying around here and I just hate terrible.
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.480]   I'm a big iPod guy.
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.480]   I'm a big Mac guy in general.
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:23.840]   I got one of these controversial high end Acer computers from Microsoft and I've been running
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:29.480]   Vista on it and granted it's a $3,000-$4,000 laptop with a couple gigabytes of RAM and high
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.480]   end chip.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.720]   It's a pretty nice operating system and I am a hardcore Mac guy.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:42.120]   I got to tell you, it's easier or just as easy to use as OSX and it's pretty cool.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.920]   Windows users are going to like it because what it is is it's a really well done Windows.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.160]   But still, wait a minute, let's hold on a second.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.280]   I'm not, guess not the kind of feedback I'm getting from Windows users but I'm getting
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.280]   it from Mac users.
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.280]   Is that interesting?
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.280]   Does anybody find this to be a weird picture?
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.280]   I mean, that's interesting.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.280]   I just thought I just thought I shouldn't even be using the thing.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.280]   I'm the super super super super super.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:04.200]   You are all three Mac users and you like it but I have not heard this from Windows users.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.200]   I think you guys are liking it all.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:11.560]   I have realized that we all have the best possible accessory to Windows XP installation.
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.560]   That is a functioning Macintosh.
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:18.000]   It's like a vegetarian cookbook.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.240]   If I had to eat that all time 24/7, I learned to hate it but it's a nice alternative.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:26.360]   Plus, let's not be grudge Microsoft products for being better than they used to be.
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.360]   This is the best version of XP that's ever been released.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:34.960]   I have to think it's as good as Mac OSX but let's give credit to credit.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:39.400]   I had to put two gigs of RAM into my desktop though before I could get audition to perform
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.280]   at least at halfway decently.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.880]   So it does require significant RAM.
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.520]   I'll have to install this thing in a couple of minutes.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.520]   You know what you're going to like?
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.520]   It's pretty.
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.520]   There are some really nice features.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:54.040]   It's one of those things that you don't immediately grab you with one or two spectacular features
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.440]   but in the long run I think there's a lot to like now.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:02.400]   As I was starting to say, we're going to start covering this in security now and Windows
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.880]   Weekly very soon but a guy named Peter Gutman from New Zealand who will be interviewing
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.280]   on security now wrote and I'm sure you've all seen it.
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:13.560]   A cost analysis of Windows Vista content protection just came out yesterday or the day before
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:18.920]   and Lambas, the copy protection, the DRM that has to be built into Windows to make it work
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.840]   with modern content.
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:28.280]   Saying it's huge, huge cost in terms of performance, decreased playback quality on analog video,
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:34.760]   no more open source hardware support, elimination of unified drivers, all sorts of issues.
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:38.440]   This has really been a big story on dig and I think a lot of people have been reading
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.440]   it.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:42.120]   I've been forwarded the article about 100 times now.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:46.720]   Plus we really have to be concerned about what Microsoft might do with this technology
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.720]   in the future.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:53.600]   They've already indicated some little interest for instance in using Microsoft Word to retract
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.280]   documents and so forth.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:00.600]   On top of everything else, they have some really real bone head maneuver in licensing agreement
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:06.880]   that says that you cannot create or install anything that basically improves the product.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:13.920]   So I mean literally if Michael, is that a new thing in the license because I've seen
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.920]   that before with Microsoft products?
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.840]   You may not improve the product.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.520]   I know that was just in the early days of Windows they had one of those clauses in there to
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:28.080]   keep people from swapping out the executives so you could have your own like IO.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.440]   They're assuming that Mike Harrington because he's a lawyer actually reads you as, is that
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.440]   the case Mike?
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:39.480]   Yeah, as a reformed lawyer I avoid anything legal at all.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.200]   But you know and all this stuff might be true and it's important but I got to tell you
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:47.720]   the thing that I like the best about it is and this is coming things down quite a bit
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.880]   is the desktop widgets because I'm a big widget guy.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:51.880]   I love those.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.640]   That's the best features of Vista.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.960]   On the Mac you have to hit a hot key or hit a button to go and get your widgets to pop
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.960]   up.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:05.280]   I know there's a somewhat complicated workaround to that but with Vista it's just on the desktop
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:10.080]   and you can have these things on your live.com homepage so when you're on a different computer
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.160]   you have on your desktop.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.840]   I think this is the way, you know the web services that tie into a widget is the way
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.680]   that a lot of people, a lot of companies are going to get their content and services
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.880]   onto the desktop.
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.320]   The most popular widget right now is in gadget widget which does nothing but pull the
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.240]   RSS feed and put the headlines on the desktop.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.360]   I want to build one for TechCrunch right away because it's totally cool.
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.360]   It's an easy thing to do actually.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.360]   Right.
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.640]   I'm telling you I wonder if Steve Jobs ever listens to Twitch.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.680]   He's probably going to start getting a Twitch.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.000]   Let me ask you Will Harris.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   I mean I know you're a Mac user but you pretty much have to cover Windows.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.600]   BitDek is all about Windows.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.600]   Absolutely.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:53.640]   I mean I personally in a day to day I can't live with that X-Pose on the Mac.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.280]   And until Windows gets like X-Pose.
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.080]   They have an odd X-Pose like feature.
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:04.040]   Yeah it's a stupid version that doesn't work the same way X-Pose does.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.000]   But the only reason I'm excited about Vista.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.440]   I mean the reason to be excited about Vista is Crisis and all the new DirectX 10 games
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.080]   they're going to come out next year.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:16.840]   And DirectX 10 and the new GeForce graphics are some of these new games.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.920]   They're going to be absolutely awesome and they're not going to be on the Mac.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.720]   They're not going to be on Windows XP.
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.080]   That's the only reason for me to even to care about Vista.
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.080]   And you're not going to go.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.640]   Well I was just going to say different strokes of different folks.
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.880]   I like the idea of X-Pose.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:34.680]   The fact is I don't use X-Pose to switch between Windows because I don't have to leave my fingers
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.640]   leave their usual position on the keys.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.280]   Reach up and hit an F key and then scan each one of these little microscopic Windows to
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.560]   figure out which one I want.
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.920]   I really wish this was one of the things that I do want the Mac OS to steal.
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:49.640]   The idea that you have this big visual reproduction of a live window that you all tab between.
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.520]   You're not just all tabbing from application to application.
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.200]   You're all tabbing between from window to window.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.880]   So I can be a Microsoft Word.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.720]   You hit basically three buttons to get to not just an Explorer window.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:01.720]   That's a good point.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:05.640]   The alt tab is really better than X-Pose in this case in a way.
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:10.840]   And there's a way that you can switch on the Mac OS between the Windows in one application
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.480]   but that's another key sequence to remember.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.440]   I don't want to take my hands off the keyboard.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.840]   I just want to look up that one thing that's on that web page there.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.840]   I just want to look up that one.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.840]   I suspect that's an arrow feature.
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:23.840]   I'm not sure.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.840]   You do need error to get that.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:27.840]   Alright.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.840]   Hey, let's move to the next story.
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:30.840]   The next story.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.840]   I'm a little sick about spending so much time seeing positive things about Windows.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.840]   I am too and I like Windows.
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:37.840]   But anyway.
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.840]   As I said, we'll talk in more detail about Peter Gutman's article kind of
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:42.840]   lambasting the DRM in Windows.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.840]   I think there's a lot to be said.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.840]   You know, I'm looking over this list of the top.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:55.840]   The top story starting with the hot coffee mod in Grand Theft Auto raising a ruckus on Capitol Hill
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.840]   with senators who said, "What?
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.840]   There's sex in our video games?"
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.840]   Sex in video games and brain dead coma patients.
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.840]   Those are the two things that spur Congress to actually.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.840]   Now if they get out, just get a brain dead coma video game.
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.840]   They have because it's finally getting universal health care.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.840]   Speaking of which, another big story which I'm going to get this out of order
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.840]   is Senator Stevens and the tubes.
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.840]   I just the other day got an internet was sent by my staff at 10 o'clock in the morning and
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.840]   Friday.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:23.840]   I got it yesterday.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:24.840]   Why?
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:28.840]   Because you got tangled up with all these things that are going on in the internet commercially.
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:33.840]   And again, the internet is not something that you just dump something on.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.840]   It's not a big truck.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.840]   It's a series of tubes.
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.840]   And if you don't understand, those tubes can be filled.
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.840]   And if they're filled, when you put your message in, it gets in line.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:47.840]   It's going to be delayed by anyone that puts in that tube and enormous amounts of material
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.840]   and enormous amounts of material.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.840]   That is the story of the issue.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.840]   I think that's got to be it.
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:58.840]   The block of the story has generated such dump truck.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:05.840]   Just showing really that the US Congress at least has no clue when it comes to the internet.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:10.840]   Net neutrality was really the story around that story.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:15.840]   The bill to end net neutrality died with the most recent Congress.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:20.840]   But I imagine we'll see more of that battle in the next Congress or will we?
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:27.840]   Well, it looks like AT&T for starters is pushing it off by making these assertions that they're
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.840]   not going to even touch the idea anymore.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:35.840]   And they're not going to leverage their positions.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:36.840]   Should we declare victory?
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.840]   Then maybe all that ruckus about net neutrality.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:39.840]   I would never declare victory.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.840]   I'd keep a watchful eye.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.840]   The other big story of the year, of course, was YouTube.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:51.840]   It's not only its acquisition by Google for $1.8 billion, but also the fact that early when the year--
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.840]   That was $1.65.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:53.840]   Whatever it was.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:54.840]   It was actually the--
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:59.840]   By the time they closed the transaction, it was worth over $2 billion and it's gone up now.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:00.840]   Because of the stock.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:05.840]   It was great that it's way too much money to spend for a site that can only legally host videos of kittens on the toilet.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.840]   Hey, what's wrong with kittens on the toilet?
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:14.840]   Yeah, I think it was like a checkmate move by Google and it was brilliantly executed.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.840]   Not the actual acquisition.
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:17.840]   They just paid for that.
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.840]   But the moves they've made since then to stop YouTube from turning into endasters.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.840]   Just incredible.
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:28.840]   So you say they're good stewards of the YouTube brand.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:35.840]   Yeah, well, they're clearly willing to take the carrot and the stick approach to the content owners and say,
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.840]   "Look, we'll pay you off if you do business with us.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.840]   And if you don't, good luck suing us.
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.840]   We have a lot more money than you do."
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:42.840]   And it seems to be working.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.840]   Yeah, I think it's brilliant.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:45.840]   You're right.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.840]   As a year-end, really, we're talking about the end game of the YouTube story.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:53.840]   We began the year wondering how YouTube could possibly survive.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:22:01.840]   And it started with the lazy Sunday video from Saturday Night Live and NBC going after YouTube and getting them to pull the video.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.840]   And one of the most boneheaded moves ever by a network.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.840]   And there have been a lot of boneheaded television network moves.
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:15.840]   And then, of course, the question, could YouTube pay its bandwidth bill and be survived the lawsuits?
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:20.840]   I don't think anybody at the beginning of the year thought YouTube would have such a happy ending by the end.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:21.840]   No, no way.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:28.840]   Do you think that you'll take the responsibility for cleaning up even the content produced by people that are in partnership with?
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:33.840]   I think they'll rely on the DMCA and wait for people to request it to be pulled down and then they'll try to do deals with them,
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.840]   where they have a revenue share instead.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.840]   So, in other words, YouTube's got legs.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.840]   Yeah, YouTube could take over, you know, IPTV.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:46.840]   I think it's one of the players in that space along with the Venice Project and a couple of others that have a real chance of doing something interesting.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:51.840]   Venice Project is the new Skype beta project. I don't know much about it. Tell us about the Venice Project.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.840]   It's a downloadable application, which I think is a mistake.
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:00.840]   And I assume it's to increase responsiveness as a desktop application, as opposed to a web app.
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.840]   Also, they can have more sophisticated DRM if they do that.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:12.840]   But, you know, it's basically created a television viewer that you download and they're trying to do deals with content companies
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:17.840]   to license the television content and get it to viewers with advertising.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:21.840]   The reason why, it seems like it's a pretty good piece of software. They don't have any content on it yet.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:28.840]   But the fact that the Skype founders are behind it gives it a really big presence with the press
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:34.840]   and could make them a competitive threat to YouTube, which I think is sort of the incumbent right now.
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.840]   Skype has to be one of the big winners of 2006.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:43.840]   I mean, they've really positioned themselves. Well, it's... There are millions and millions of computers now.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.840]   Yeah, and I've seen so many Wi-Fi phones that are built around Skype. Skype clients.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:52.840]   Skype's one of those... You know, I guess, you know, John and I have talked for years.
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.840]   Where's the next killer app? Maybe it was Skype.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:59.840]   Well, it's definitely a killer app. But now what?
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.840]   Do you want to go put your meet on right now, John?
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:09.840]   Well, you didn't notice it. Not only put the meet on already, but I had a couple of stiff drinks thinking about all you Mac users
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:13.840]   and branding about how great this day is.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:21.840]   Okay, AOL changed its business model, ladies and gentlemen. I got an email just a couple of days ago from a guy saying,
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.840]   "Hey, AOL's free!"
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:30.840]   Yes, this is the classic "Hey, if you don't have any friends in school, just tell me of a pool and a bumper pool table
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.840]   machining your record. I'm not over!
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:37.840]   How much of your house? Please notice us again. It's really used to be the biggest thing in the world now.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:38.840]   Now we're free!
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.840]   So wait, is AOL's business model now not having any executives?
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:48.840]   Yeah, if I were the executives, charge no money. It's business model is such a brilliant...
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:53.840]   The business model is now take my lunch money, just don't break my glasses.
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.840]   So, another... Are we writing off AOL?
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:02.840]   You can write them off for years, Leo. Even when the two of us were working at the MSNBC, the site,
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:07.840]   before they actually had their stock run up, you were bad-mouthing AOL, so this must make you feel great.
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:12.840]   No, actually, I'm kind of sad now because they provide all the bandwidth for this week in tech, so...
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.840]   I'm hoping they survive.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:21.840]   Here's my guess for AOL, that within six months, maybe eight months, they get bought, most likely by Google,
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:27.840]   just because they already own a piece of it. The hardest part of the acquisition will be sort of pulling the time-wonder piece away,
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:31.840]   because they have pretty deep content within their deficit-subvised dev deals.
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:37.840]   But I think the more interesting thing is, whoever buys them, and if it... It'll probably be AOL, I'm sorry, Google or Microsoft,
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:42.840]   I think the other part is going to go hard after Yahoo! Unless Yahoo! has a couple of stellar quarters and their stock price goes up.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:46.840]   So I think by the end of the year, we can see a Google AOL and a Microsoft Yahoo! combination.
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:47.840]   Wow!
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:54.840]   That's an interesting theory. It would be interesting to speculate who, if anyone, would buy AOL, and it may be even a new player,
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:26:02.840]   but you probably... I'm dubious about Google doing it, but I could see Yahoo! doing it for sure.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:09.840]   They've got that woman, Susan Decker, is going to line up to take over the company, and she is an M&A specialist.
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:14.840]   If you really look into her background, she's not really a CEO type. She's like a merger and acquisitions person,
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:19.840]   and I think they're lining her up to do some big deal, just like you described it. It would be AOL would fit right into the...
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:25.840]   Yeah, but John, I don't think they'll do AOL for one reason. If you look at the acquisition history of Yahoo! in the last 24 months,
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:31.840]   it's been forward-looking technology-wise. It's flicker-delicious. They went after Facebook hard, and of course, there's a bunch of others.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:37.840]   They don't tend to look backwards, and AOL is definitely a backwards approach where you want a revenue stream that's going to die eventually.
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.840]   I don't see it myself. I just... But maybe I'm wrong.
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:50.840]   No, I mean, I agree with this. The theory sounds valid. I mean, although I can hardly really imagine Facebook being forward-looking, if you think about the...
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.840]   I mean, it's really such a piece of crap.
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.840]   Tell us what you really think.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:56.840]   It's a piece of crap, you know?
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:01.840]   I just signed up for Facebook. I'm closing my MySpace account and setting up a Facebook account.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.840]   I'm with it. I'm hip.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.840]   So you wrote the cutting edge of everything, Lee.
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.840]   When did you enter junior college?
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:14.840]   By the way, on the other side of the book, Facebook's also, apparently, letting anyone get on the radio.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:15.840]   I'm on there now.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:16.840]   Oh, yeah?
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:17.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:18.840]   But I misspelled my name.
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.840]   It is better than MySpace.
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.840]   I misspelled my name. I believe it or not.
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.840]   I misspelled my name on Facebook, and I'm trying to get them to change it.
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:26.840]   So, I don't know.
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:30.840]   And I really don't think it's a piece of crap. It's actually very... It's an okay product.
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.840]   No, it's like a... I don't know.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.840]   It's a clean version of MySpace.
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.840]   Is it better than LinkedIn, though?
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.840]   I'm closing my LinkedIn account.
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:41.840]   I hate LinkedIn.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:42.840]   I'm closing it.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.840]   Because everybody asks me to be their buddy on it.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:46.840]   I don't want to be here.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:47.840]   Oh, come on. That stopped me.
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:48.840]   Lee, I don't want any friends.
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:49.840]   I don't want any friends.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:50.840]   It's the last time that happened.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.840]   It happens to me all the time. I get three or four requests a day.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:54.840]   Really?
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:55.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:56.840]   You're so popular, Leo.
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:57.840]   No, it's it.
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:01.840]   If you've asked me to be on LinkedIn, forget it. I'm dumping you all.
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:05.840]   Well, it's good because on LinkedIn, the average person wanting to be your friend is like a 30-something business.
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:06.840]   Right.
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.840]   But on Facebook, you're going to get the hot 20-year-olds coming out.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:10.840]   Exactly.
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.840]   I think that's definitely to move.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:13.840]   Exactly.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:14.840]   The hot 30-year-old is pretending to be the hot 20-year-old.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.840]   I don't need any more guys in business suits.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.840]   So, let me see. How many invitations do I have?
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:25.840]   It's a different model. I mean, the reason you wouldn't... I mean, LinkedIn is not for... I mean, these are specialist sites.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:29.840]   No, I understand. LinkedIn is so that I can get a job and network and meet other people.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.840]   You know, I got Jason Calicanis on my LinkedIn list.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.840]   So, that puts me right up.
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.840]   You know where I don't understand, though, where you cancel your account on here.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:39.840]   Because I don't think you can.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.840]   That's the problem. You can't stop.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.840]   Well, that's... that maybe there's a connection with AOL. I don't know if people can get out of that either.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:46.840]   No.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:52.840]   You can cancel it by going in and changing your email address to John de Vorax and then you won't have to worry about it anymore.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.840]   Oh, that advice. What's yours again?
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:56.840]   Oh, I forgot.
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.840]   Wait a minute. I'll be right back with you guys.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.840]   I think you know the great thing about people will figure that out.
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:02.840]   Oh, this is good.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.840]   By the way, well, anyway.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:05.840]   I'm sorry, I'm busy changing.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:12.840]   We have to make a correction. I got... you know, I made the request for some Appalachian state hoodies.
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:15.840]   Yes, well, you got it some offers, I think.
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:22.840]   I got a bunch of offers, but mostly I got complaints from the people saying we were pronouncing it Appalachian, like a bunch of orts.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:23.840]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:24.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:25.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:26.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:27.840]   Appalachian.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.840]   You know, we sound like New England dorks that...
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.840]   Wait, I'm lost. John, what is this?
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:31.840]   He's asking for free clothing.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.840]   So you don't want to get involved, Michael.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.840]   You do this kind of stuff that we're doing here.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:41.840]   It turns out that, you know, it's a conflict the interests of getting equipment and stuff from some of these big vendors just by begging them for it.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.840]   But in terms of getting clothing from the listeners...
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.840]   That's no conflict whatsoever.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.840]   You can load up.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:51.840]   So basically, this is a barter proposition.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:52.840]   Oh, I'm gonna...
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:59.840]   Now requesting kind of famous things in Appalachian state, one, the one AA championship football.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.840]   This year, for the second year in a row.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:07.840]   And so I wanted to get a couple hoodies and I'm getting a couple coming in the mail shortly and I'll be plugging them the guys later.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.840]   See, if they'd ever figure that out on the Gilmore gang, it'd still be around.
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:11.840]   Really, you don't want money.
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:16.840]   What you want is clothing, food, clothes, and goods and good conno-
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.840]   Commestibles of any kind.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.840]   Do you think you could do like the paperclip project?
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.840]   Like you could start a podcast and trade up to a red podcast?
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:23.840]   Yeah, that's a bad idea.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:24.840]   That's not a bad idea.
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:25.840]   That's a good idea.
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.840]   Yeah, I've already got to have a head start with Appalachian state.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.840]   Wait, let me get a register that first.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.840]   Let's see, let's just see them pronounce words like "wister" and "lemonster" though.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:36.840]   There you go.
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:37.840]   We still rule Appalachian.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:38.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.840]   In regional plates names.
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:40.840]   "Lemonster."
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:41.840]   We can drop up at a rotary.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:42.840]   They won't know what to do.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.840]   Where's "lemonster?"
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.840]   In this is good content right now.
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.840]   This is good stuff.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:49.840]   Now we try to get the content.
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:50.840]   Maybe we should...
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:51.840]   It was getting too real, listen.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:54.840]   We had to get off the track here because it's short of the drawing if we just talk about check.
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:55.840]   Yeah, part of the job.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.840]   I could talk about Patricia Dunn and the HP Spying Scandal.
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:30:59.840]   We skipped that one.
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:00.840]   Who cares?
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.840]   Microsoft ending support for Windows 98.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:04.840]   Yes.
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:05.840]   You thought that was a big story?
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:09.840]   I put it in there because if you're using Windows 98, it's a big story for you.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:10.840]   You're using Windows 98.
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.840]   You've got bigger problems than Microsoft.
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.840]   I'm going to run through a few of these stories.
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:18.840]   I think I just might talk about the Windows 98 thing.
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:19.840]   Yes.
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:20.840]   Or we'd like to go ahead and see.
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:24.840]   I just want to say that I thought that was a big story because it really illustrates Microsoft's
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.840]   problems and current and future versions of the OS.
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:31.840]   If they have to officially tell people, "Look, I know you still use Windows 98.
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.840]   I know you're happy with 98.
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.840]   Please, for God's sake, give us some money."
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.840]   Stop using it.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.840]   We call it people's disease across the world.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:41.840]   A lot.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.840]   Millions, tents, probably 20, 30 million people are still using Windows 98.
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:45.840]   You just made that up.
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.840]   You don't actually know that, do you?
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.840]   No, but I'm sure it's at least that number.
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:50.840]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.840]   Let's stop for a second if we're going to discuss this topic.
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:56.840]   One thing, automobile manufacturers and other people, they've always had support that last.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:58.840]   I think by law they had to do it for seven years.
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.840]   Sometimes they'd take it out longer.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:04.840]   I don't see why you would criticize somebody for using Windows 98 when they could still be
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:10.840]   driving around a 1995 Cadillac or whatever, an old car.
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:14.840]   It seems to me to be similar, the model similar is an analogy here.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:16.840]   No, 70 million.
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.840]   70 million, says the BBC.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:21.840]   70 million, says CNET.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.840]   So it's somewhere between 50 and 70 million people.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.840]   Those people care about this story.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.840]   They're not listening to a twit, but they care about this story.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.840]   They can't get to it because they're running Windows 98.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.840]   They also dial up modems.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.840]   It does a kind of TCP stack built in.
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.840]   He's still needed to get a slip server to get that working.
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.840]   Yeah, I don't approve of them still using that operating system.
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:41.840]   They should stop.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:42.840]   I don't have a problem with that.
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:43.840]   Yeah, it should stop right now.
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:44.840]   All right, what else, John?
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:45.840]   Go ahead.
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:46.840]   Rag me on some more of these.
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.840]   What's your favorite thing about this story?
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.840]   Can an abandoned film SLRs?
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:52.840]   Is that a big surprise?
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:53.840]   Is that a big story?
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.840]   Yeah, it's a watershed moment in the--
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.840]   I'm going to do this as a critical deal.
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.840]   I'm going to criticize you for this list.
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:02.840]   You realize I put all of about 12 minutes into putting it there?
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:03.840]   Yeah, I know.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:04.840]   I can tell.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:08.840]   What's with all these news stories about President Ford being dead?
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.840]   He was President like 30 years ago.
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.840]   And for like a month, right?
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:13.840]   I mean, yeah.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:14.840]   It was very brief.
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:19.840]   One of my readers sent me a note saying, you know, to do the Ford funeral, right?
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:24.840]   Somebody should like slip so the coffin falls over and Ford rolls out for old times sake.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:25.840]   This is live from New York.
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:31.840]   I was saying that I wish that the two coffins get switched so that Gerald Ford lies in the state of the Apollo Theater for two days.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.840]   Dressed in James Brown's stage wig and jumpsuit.
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:34.840]   Wow, wouldn't that be great?
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:42.840]   All right, now we've alienated the 50 million people who use Windows 98 and the four people who are Gerald Ford fans coming up on.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.840]   We'll get over.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:44.840]   Oh, no more.
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.840]   Gerald Ford seemed like a pretty nice guy.
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:47.840]   He's a nice guy.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.840]   Dell and Apple recall Sony batteries after fires.
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.840]   This I think may be one of the biggest stories of the year.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.840]   Millions of dollars lost to Sony.
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:57.840]   Both Dell and Apple, you know, actually I think turned it into a positive.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:03.840]   Well, Michael, with Michael here, let's just take the story to another level.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:08.840]   Isn't it the big news business news or in the year is Sony screwing up this?
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:09.840]   Once again.
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:12.840]   And one thing after another, Blu Ray?
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:16.840]   Yeah, yeah, Sony, Sony, you know, seems to be kind of done right now.
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:20.840]   But once the, I haven't seen the PS3 yet, the week came out of nowhere.
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:24.840]   But I think that's going to be a big factor in whether they can pull out of this.
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:32.840]   You know, I remember the days in the 90s when I bought electronics and I was willing to pay the premium for Sony products just because they were the best period.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.840]   And I don't do that anymore.
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:35.840]   I don't really like the Sony to be.
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:43.840]   The one area where they still preserve some ascendancy, I think the TVs, the Bravias, are considered by many to be the best LCDs and plasmas.
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.840]   I think the sharps are the best.
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:46.840]   I don't know.
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:47.840]   They're up there though.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:48.840]   They're in the game.
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:50.840]   They're not in the game in any other of their markets.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.840]   But don't you remember when it was Sony was the best period?
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.840]   I mean, it was just that we're in a drawn era.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.840]   No, they've completely fumbled.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:00.840]   But that just shows you the dominance in any company is impossible to maintain.
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:06.840]   I think it's because they lost focus. They became a Hollywood producer, Columbia Studios and all this other stuff.
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:09.840]   And now they have built-in conflicts of interest.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:12.840]   They can't sell an MPP player and then sell music.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.840]   It is tough.
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.840]   You know, when you make up your minds what you want to do.
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:16.840]   Yep.
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.840]   I think a big story, but maybe not anybody else.
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:24.840]   But the fact that the US Congress banned online gambling seemed to be a pretty big story for 2000s.
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:28.840]   So is it really true now that in the States you can't play poker online?
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:30.840]   I play poker online all the time.
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:31.840]   It's illegal.
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:32.840]   It's illegal.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:36.840]   So is BitTorrent and about half of the other things I do on the Internet.
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:40.840]   So how do you get away with it? How come they don't come to your door and knock on it?
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:41.840]   Well, they...
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:42.840]   I don't know.
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.840]   How do you...
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:44.840]   How can you use your credit card?
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:45.840]   Because you're playing too.
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.840]   I don't understand. I thought it was illegal.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.840]   Because the games are fixed. That way it's not really a game of chance.
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:55.840]   Yeah, the biggest problem is getting money into the system because the credit card companies are stopping it.
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.840]   But there's always a side or two that you can get on.
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.840]   So how do you do that, Mike? I mean, how do you get the money in it?
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:05.840]   I don't know if I'm willing to sort of, you know, on a recorded podcast explain exactly how I'm breaking a lot.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:09.840]   But there's plenty of people in the US that are gambling online. It's a very big market.
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.840]   Well, there are plenty of people buying heroin online too, but that doesn't mean it's legal.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.840]   Nobody's buying heroin online.
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.840]   I don't think anybody's buying heroin online.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:19.840]   I think you can get it from Canada.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:20.840]   I think they know about Canada.
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.840]   You can get ambient in biagranism, but I don't know about heroin.
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:24.840]   Can't you get it from Canadian pharmacies?
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.840]   I thought you could.
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:26.840]   I might be wrong.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:33.840]   You're a
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:34.840]   Canadian.
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:35.840]   I gotta get my heroin.
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:41.840]   Let me just see if heroin.com is available because that wouldn't be a bad.
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.840]   Somebody's got you know heroin.com is long gone.
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.840]   It's probably by some, you know, anti drug.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:47.840]   I'm guessing it's a Lou Reed site.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.840]   You know, it just leads to a bunch of detox.
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:51.840]   It's, you know what it is.
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:52.840]   It's a link farm.
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:53.840]   It's own best.
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:54.840]   It's own best.
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:55.840]   It's a park page.
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:56.840]   Park page, yeah.
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:57.840]   Is heroin H-E-R-O-I-N?
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:58.840]   Yes, it is.
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:36:59.840]   It still is, yeah.
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:00.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.840]   You never know what a link farm do you have?
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:14.840]   You know that heroin was for, there was a great special on the history channel on the history of these addictive drugs, and heroin first came out, I think around like 1915 or something like that as a cough syrup.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:18.840]   They, because there were so many people that had all these weird, you know, coughs back then that they were.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:19.840]   It works.
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:20.840]   It did, it worked.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.840]   And then they figured that, well, the stuff is so good.
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.840]   We'll use it to get people off of morphine.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:26.840]   Right.
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:27.840]   As a kind of a, you know.
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:31.840]   Well, and then they put coating in, because it's a heroin analog, isn't it?
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:38.840]   Yeah, but coating doesn't have the addictive nature, or, I mean, apparently, heroin's over the top for, like, stringing it out real fast.
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.840]   But you don't see many junkies with coughs, so that's the point I think.
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:44.840]   No, they don't cough, so they don't spread TB.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:45.840]   It's a plus.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:46.840]   It's a plus.
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:51.840]   Microsoft takes on the iPod with this thing called the Zoom, which I think we've all gone on record is hating now.
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.840]   I came, I said it was okay.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:54.840]   I liked the device.
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:55.840]   I think it's a really cool device.
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.840]   The next rev will be much better.
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.840]   They sell a brown version.
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:01.840]   I mean, I think that kind of says it all.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:04.840]   Like, it just, it's just a terrible device right now.
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:05.840]   But brown flesh it.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:06.840]   It really is.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.840]   And people who like the Zoom are investing in future editions of it.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:15.840]   Because I certainly got absolutely no shortage of emails after I publish my Sun Times review of the thing.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:20.840]   And after talking them down from the ledge where they realized that I was an idiot and I murdered little puppies.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:28.840]   And finally getting to talk some on a one-to-one basis, every single one of them was saying that, well, no, I acknowledge that the Zoom right now is really not a very good player.
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.840]   But we bet that with firmware upgrades, it's going to start doing more.
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:38.840]   I think that what they need to do is go for the higher end of the market and release 100 gigabyte version before Apple does.
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:39.840]   And they'll sell a few that way.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:45.840]   I think it might be the other way around.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:49.840]   It's the lower end of the market that the Zoom is going to hit somebody who isn't smart enough to know that the iPod even exists.
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.840]   But who likes the idea that working with his Xbox Live points?
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:54.840]   There is a Leo there is the iPhone.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:59.840]   I wanted to know that the iPod, ever you've been around town, I mean, there's a believable.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.840]   Actually, that's this would be a good time.
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:02.840]   We've gone through all of the stories.
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:03.840]   This would be a good time to just--
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:04.840]   I know you missed one.
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:05.840]   You missed one.
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:06.840]   Which what?
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:09.840]   The one where all these anniversaries, the--
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:10.840]   Oh, yeah, this was a big year.
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.840]   The web turned 15.
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:13.840]   The PC turned 25.
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.840]   The hard drive turned 50.
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:16.840]   I don't know.
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:17.840]   What do you say about that?
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:18.840]   I mean, happy anniversary.
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:19.840]   That's it.
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:20.840]   We're just getting started.
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:23.840]   We're just beginning, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:28.840]   And if you go to heroin.com with an E, you'll get some fabulous photos.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:35.840]   Let me move on to the next portion of our game, which is always the most fun, which is what's ahead for 2000.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:39.840]   7, Mike, you already made a pretty darn good prediction, I thought.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:40.840]   Do you want to add anything else to that?
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:41.840]   I'm actually sorry.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.840]   I'm looking at the soft porn on heroin.com.
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.840]   Sorry.
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.840]   What was my prediction?
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.840]   You predicted Microsoft and Yahoo!
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:52.840]   Microsoft would buy Yahoo! and Google would buy AOL.
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.840]   Well, somebody's going to take AOL out.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:55.840]   I mean, they have the layoffs.
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:56.840]   They have the CEO change.
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:57.840]   They're clearly ramping.
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:01.840]   All my inside sources there, medium levels of management are saying that clearly they're
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.840]   positioning themselves for that.
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:07.840]   If Google takes them out, which makes some sense given that they already own a big piece of it,
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:13.840]   I think Microsoft is going to look for Yahoo! acquisition, but Yahoo! is going to fight to stay independent.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:16.840]   And so the only way that's going to happen is if they continue to stumble particularly
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:17.840]   around Panama.
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:19.840]   And if that doesn't work out for them.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:20.840]   Panama?
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:23.840]   Yeah, the Eastmist connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific?
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:25.840]   No, a different Panama.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.840]   In this case, you know, and this gets a little bit of detail, but Yahoo!
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:34.840]   Yahoo! is an over-tour product, which they acquired, is not as good as Google's in terms of generating
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:39.840]   revenue, because there's some technical reasons why they don't do as good of a job at getting
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:40.840]   the bid prices up.
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:45.840]   Panama, which is a two or three year project now, is designed to sort of be competitive with
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:46.840]   Google.
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:51.840]   And so it should have a very positive impact on revenue, but they've stumbled, they still
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:52.840]   haven't released it, they've sort of beta released it.
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.840]   This is what really hurt Yahoo! stock price through 2006, of course.
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:41:00.840]   And if it doesn't help their revenue as much as analysts are thinking it will, then their
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:04.840]   stock price won't do well in 2007 and they'll be right for picking off.
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:10.840]   And Microsoft has a great advertising platform, technically, but no customers yet.
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:13.840]   And, you know, they would probably be very hungry to acquire.
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.840]   Hey, Mike, tell us why the Microsoft platform is so much better.
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:17.840]   I don't know.
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:23.840]   So if you look at the three main platforms, you have Google, Yahoo! and Microsoft for pay-per-click,
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:27.840]   advertising, where advertisers can go on and say, I'll pay five cents a dollar, whatever
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:28.840]   per click.
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:32.840]   Google makes the most money right now because they have the most advertisers and because
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:36.840]   of the way they rank ads isn't just the highest bidder, goes on top.
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:39.840]   It's a combination of who's bidding the most and who gets clicked on the most.
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:43.840]   And so you might not be the highest bidder, but you might be the top ad because your ad gets
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:44.840]   clicked on a lot.
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:48.840]   And the reason why that's good for revenue is it's actually revenue maximizing.
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:52.840]   What they do is they say, you know, this click only pays 90 cents, the other one pays a dollar,
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.840]   but it gets clicked on twice as often.
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.840]   We're going to make more money by putting it on top.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.840]   That's what Panama is doing at Yahoo!
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:00.840]   Why can't Google just do that though?
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:01.840]   No, Google is doing that.
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:05.840]   And what Yahoo is doing is they're trying to, they're launching something that'll do the
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:09.840]   same thing where it won't necessarily be the highest paying ad on top.
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:11.840]   It'll be the most profitable one.
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.840]   What Microsoft does, which is better than--
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:17.840]   Which, by the way, pisses me off if I'm bidding on these ads and I bid the most and I'm not
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:18.840]   the top ad.
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:19.840]   Yeah.
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:20.840]   Yeah.
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:21.840]   I'm sure you're saying that.
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:26.840]   I know you're probably mad as a wet hand about that, Lee, with all the advertising you do.
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:29.840]   Well, no, I don't--I mean, if I were an advertiser, wouldn't that be an--
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:34.840]   No, you know, when I was--I was previously at a company, we spent a lot of money on both
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:35.840]   Google and Yahoo!
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:36.840]   And it didn't bother me.
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:37.840]   We just tried to make better ads.
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.840]   I got clicked on more often, to be honest.
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:44.840]   But what Microsoft is doing, which is different than all of them, is they're doing all of
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:45.840]   that.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:49.840]   They're sort of maximizing the clicks, but they also have all this great demographic data on
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:53.440]   the users that have a Microsoft or passport account.
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.120]   And they're factoring that in as well.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:59.560]   And so, if they're factoring that in what ads they show, and so theoretically, they're
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:03.720]   even more contextually relevant ads that they're showing users and they'll get a higher click-through
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:04.720]   rate and more money.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:06.480]   So, that's why it's a better platform.
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:09.840]   Oh, so they have--in other words, they're going to--they use one of those tricks where
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:15.200]   when I'm on the page and they're starting to serve ads to me, they see that I'm in California
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.960]   and they twist it a little bit.
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:17.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.960]   And you've recently done a search for cars and they'll show you auto-
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:26.960]   [crosstalk]
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:30.960]   I mean, of course, Google's aggregating that data right now, but don't you think consumers
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:32.960]   are going to start to get a little twitchy about that?
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:35.960]   I think the problem with Microsoft's approach there is that it relies on people doing a
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:36.960]   search on MSN.
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:40.960]   Well, there's your first problem right there.
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:44.960]   Yeah, you've got to be Googled to have it work, although obviously many, many, many, many people
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:47.680]   use MSN and other non-Google search engines.
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:49.440]   Nobody knows why, but they obviously do.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:50.440]   Nobody knows.
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:51.440]   Well, why?
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.440]   I mean, really?
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:53.440]   They can't find Google.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:54.440]   They can't spell it.
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.440]   You find Google.
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:56.440]   Put an EI on the end.
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:44:02.440]   I do have a bit of an insight into a bit of an upcoming story for 2007.
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:05.440]   Your prediction, Mr. Will Harris, a bit tech-daddy.
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:11.440]   Well, a little birdie told me that the next big news corp acquisition, news corp loves
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:16.440]   and look at my credibility, they're going after this site I've never heard of, but I
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:18.440]   think it's called the Vorak.org/blog.
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:20.440]   Oh, huge story.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.680]   The Vorak.org/blog, is that what it is?
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:25.440]   That's the next Rupert Murdoch acquisition, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.440]   Wow.
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:27.440]   You know, it's funny.
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:29.800]   I actually know what their next acquisition is.
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.440]   It's a pretty big one, and I was afraid you were...
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:33.440]   You thought you were...
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:36.440]   You thought you thought you thought you thought you thought I was actually going to break it?
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:37.440]   All right, go ahead.
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:38.440]   I'm looking at it.
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:39.440]   You said that.
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:40.440]   You got to tell us.
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:41.440]   Hey, I'm doing it on a place where I get the advertising dollars.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:42.440]   It's not where you deal with it.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:43.440]   Oh, look at...
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:48.360]   No, this is actually the first, uh, Twitter of 2007, and the ad-free, the new ad-free
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.360]   Twitter.
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:50.360]   I'm proud of that.
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:51.360]   Well, it still doesn't affect my net worth.
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.880]   I'm going to do it on TechCrunch.
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.360]   All right, when will you be doing that?
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:57.360]   As soon as I'm able to do it.
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:58.360]   Uh, in the next week or two, hopefully...
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:44:59.360]   And it's a big deal.
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:01.360]   Yeah, it's a big deal for...
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:05.360]   I mean, it's not as big as MySpace, but it's bigger than most of their 7-5 million dollar
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.360]   acquisition statement.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:09.360]   Now, this is the Murdochs group again, you said?
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:11.360]   No, it's Fox Interactive.
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:12.360]   Yeah, it's Murdochs company.
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:17.880]   They're doing a deal that is not as big as MySpace, but it's a big deal compared to the other
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:18.880]   deals we're seeing.
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:19.880]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.240]   Yeah, my understanding is 80, 100, something like that.
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:23.800]   I'm not 100% sure yet.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.760]   We'll be able to figure it out before it happens then.
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.880]   I think start your engines.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:31.080]   Uh, does anybody else want to get on the prediction bandwagon?
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:33.920]   I'm like, Micah's really set up pretty high standard here.
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:38.240]   Uh, Annie and Aka, what will be the big story of 2007 from your point of view?
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:40.520]   Uh, I really think it's going to be the OS War.
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:45.320]   This is the first time that we've had a real good three-dog race in primacy and operating
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:46.320]   systems.
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:49.160]   Who versus Vista versus who's the third dog?
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:52.440]   Versus Ubuntu versus Linux, which is finally one of the big stories that I thought from
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:56.920]   2006 was that this is the first year that from my perspective, at least, we finally
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:01.200]   had a Linux that you could really release into the general population without expecting
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.200]   a great deal of disaster.
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:06.800]   Yeah, credit to Mark Shuttleworth for actually making Ubuntu a really solid desktop operating
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:07.800]   system.
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:08.800]   Yeah, it's wonderful.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:14.720]   It passed my on a stealth test where I actually installed Ubuntu on my 75-year-old aunt's computer.
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:18.560]   She just uses the web, she's his email, she's his basic word processing.
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:24.240]   And she's had about, I think, something like seven months without any problems whatsoever,
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:27.560]   it's certainly been a lot more stable for her than Windows XP has been.
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:31.760]   And considering that she also has a digital camera that she has a tendency to plug it
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:36.760]   into the system from time to time, that's almost a first-time thing for Linux.
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:37.760]   That's wonderful.
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:38.760]   All right.
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:43.000]   Anyway, I don't think the Linux is going to overtake macOS, maybe not even going to overtake
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.960]   the XP in 2007.
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:47.720]   But that doesn't mean the first time that people are going to really start looking at
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:51.040]   it as a very good general use alternative, OS.
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:54.160]   Andy, what computer, sorry, is it Will or Andy that was speaking?
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:55.160]   That was Andy.
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:59.120]   Andy, what computer did you install it on exactly?
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:02.520]   It was a three-year-old compact presario of some flavor.
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.720]   And what are the specs on it, roughly?
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:06.560]   It doesn't need much.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:07.560]   It really runs pretty well.
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.480]   Yeah, I know it's cold firing.
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:16.000]   It's not a modern machine, but it runs on, I know it has less than a gigabyte of memory.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.320]   It has about like a 20 gig, maybe a 40 gig hard drive.
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:24.280]   And will it handle Firefox 2.0 or anything like that?
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:28.280]   I've tried 2.0 on my own machine, some of the punkier models in my office.
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:29.920]   And it works fine on that machine.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:35.000]   I've not tried 2.0 on, again, something that's older than, let's say, two years.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   Why do you ask, Mike?
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.360]   Was that a key application from your point of view?
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:43.160]   I think I'm curious as to what these older computers can run with Ubuntu.
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:49.640]   But I think that the big factor here is Google promoting it and to hurt Microsoft in another
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:50.640]   way.
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:51.640]   That was kind of a surprise.
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:55.480]   So a lot of people go to Google.com and all of a sudden you see an ad for Firefox.
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:59.400]   Yeah, but also just promoting an alternative OS and it would make sense that they would
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:03.560]   go down that road either promoting an Ubuntu or somebody like that or doing their own version,
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:07.520]   their own flavor of it, and then doing a deal with Dell and other people to launch very
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:12.160]   cheap low-end computers that can do all the things.
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:18.040]   You think about their, Google now has a functional office suite for the basic stuff and they also
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:22.920]   have, with Firefox, you don't need a whole lot more to have a very functional computer.
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:27.200]   So you're saying they're going to follow the people PC model where you give away computer
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:31.600]   just really why not give it away and have all the Google apps on it?
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:32.600]   Yeah, or Google away.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:37.400]   Dell to launch it branded with a Google version of Firefox.
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:38.400]   Why not just give it away?
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.400]   I would imagine there's enough revenue in it.
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:43.960]   Now, do you see this as more of like the same sort of approach the cell phone manufacturers
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:47.920]   do where they heavily subsidize the cost of the hardware in order to get more eyeballs
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:52.080]   on your product or do you think that the cost of the OS and the cost of the software is really
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.960]   going to drive down the cost of the package?
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:59.840]   I don't think that Google generates enough revenue to make it a sort of a perfect analogy
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:01.840]   to the cell phone manufacturers.
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:07.200]   I know that they make, the browser tends to make $2, $3, $4 a year per user on Google
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:08.200]   revenue.
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:10.200]   That's what everyone's saying with Firefox.
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:14.640]   If it defaults to the Google homepage and they can assume a certain number of searches
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:18.720]   per year, I still don't think you're talking about more than $5, $6 a year per user in
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:19.720]   revenue.
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:20.720]   I don't think they could.
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:28.520]   I still think we're talking about an opportunity in terms of getting Linux in the homes and
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:29.960]   hearts of most people.
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:33.040]   I think we're talking more of a Tivo approach where people just aren't even aware that they're
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:34.800]   running Linux in their house.
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:38.000]   All they know is that they have this box that works perfectly that doesn't crash on them.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.240]   I think that this is a great opportunity for some company to start making more appliance
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:47.680]   like PCs that are just for the three R's of computing.
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:50.480]   Let's assume that web browsing, email, and word processing, I'll start with the letter
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:51.480]   R.
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:52.600]   I think that's a very interesting prediction.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:56.080]   The operating system wars, Leopard Vista versus Ubuntu.
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:58.560]   Will Harris, what's your prediction for 2007?
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:05.080]   Well, I think one of the most interesting stories of 2006 and will continue to be in 2007 will
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:07.680]   be the Firefox adoption rate.
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:15.400]   Worldwide now, there are all sorts of figures flying around 15%, 25%, Firefox worldwide.
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:22.720]   Those are pretty spectacular numbers coming from the almost 99.7% dominance of IE just
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:25.760]   two or three years ago.
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:32.760]   If Firefox can really crack a concerted 25% of all users in 2007, that's a pretty good
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:33.760]   money.
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:40.280]   Well, especially if they make it three bucks a user, that's going to be pretty good.
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:49.000]   I think there are so many advantages to Firefox that it's going to really make some interesting
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.120]   differences in a way a lot of the web is laid out.
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:53.840]   Will have you tried IE7 yet?
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:59.480]   I have, and I sort of liked it, but I felt a little bit dirty.
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:00.480]   Give me two.
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:02.560]   I'm a Firefox user.
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:07.960]   Knowing how good IE7 is, is it your prediction in a year from now that Firefox will have
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:10.440]   a bigger, smaller market share than they do now?
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:12.160]   Yeah, that's what I think.
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:19.160]   If given the IE7 is actually not bad, if Firefox can get to that 25% mark, that will be significant
[00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:23.800]   progress in the face of some opposition, as well as just this year, significant progress
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:27.000]   in the face of barely nothing.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:32.800]   John C. Devorak, pull your meat off the grill and tell us what will be the big story of 2007?
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:39.080]   I think 2007 is going to be the last gasp of YMAX if they don't get their act together
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:40.080]   pretty soon.
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:42.720]   That's one of the interesting things to follow.
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:45.880]   Whatever happened to YMAX, that's a really good point.
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:47.520]   Sadly, that happens to YMAX, sure.
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:52.040]   Now that and the interoperability issues, these guys just can't seem to get in the same
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:55.840]   room together and you can't get two pieces of equipment from any two manufacturers to
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:56.840]   work with.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:01.880]   They both YMAX, but I think that's a huge problem.
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:04.080]   And then there's some of these new things going on.
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:12.560]   The fact that Ergo got bought out by Qualcomm, I think, is a problem for the future of 802.11
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:13.560]   necessarily.
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:19.800]   Alright, my prediction for 2007, HD DVD wins the war and Blu-ray goes away.
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:20.800]   Ooh.
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:25.080]   Do you think that's just because of how Sony overalls been mis-managing all this time?
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:31.200]   It certainly has something to do with it, but I think also HD DVD has some technical advantages.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:35.280]   You'll see Blu-ray on computers, I'm not saying you won't, but I'm talking about for home
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:36.920]   entertainment systems, I think.
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:38.760]   I'd like to say something about that.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:41.600]   I'm not going to argue one way or the other on who's going to win that battle.
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:44.400]   I think that battle is going to go on for a few more years, so I don't think next year
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:46.080]   is going to be the year that this happens.
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:52.160]   And by the way, Leo Kudos for actually taking the bet on the last week's show when you said
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:57.440]   that these gizmodo guys hadn't right about the iPhone, we just didn't know it was a
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.440]   non-apple product.
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:03.320]   Yeah, and I've announced that I will no longer read gizmodo ever again.
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:05.080]   That pissed me off too.
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:06.640]   Did it piss you guys off?
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:08.280]   It infuriated me.
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:12.160]   And I got a fairly lame apology from Brian Lamb.
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:17.560]   All you need is add the E, and it frankly didn't, it didn't, it pised me in the least.
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:18.560]   And you know.
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:20.160]   I thought it was cute.
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:24.120]   He said, just running a note to say, I'm sorry I ticked you off.
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:25.120]   Cheers.
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:26.120]   Well, okay.
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:30.080]   Go away from there.
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:32.600]   Back to the HD thing, you know, HD DVD.
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:37.160]   I have to say that when I got the dog and pony show from both these guys, both the Blu-ray
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:42.600]   and the HD guys, I was still the most impressed by the skinning feature that they have built
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:47.800]   into the HD DVD system where you can, at some point, theoretically at least, if the
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:53.160]   movies are actually produced a certain way, replace the face of any character in a movie
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:57.720]   with your own and have that face be throughout the film.
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:00.360]   And of course, you know, the porn industry may get a big boost from this.
[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:02.760]   I just wanted to always star in the English patient.
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:05.920]   Finally, that damn Ray finds is out.
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:06.920]   All right.
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:08.000]   There's our predictions.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.400]   There are the stories of 2006.
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:15.840]   I want to thank you all for being here and look forward to another great year in 2007.
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:16.840]   We're done.
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:17.840]   We're done.
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:19.640]   Michael Arrington is at TechCrunch.com.
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:24.680]   Go there right now to find out what Rupert Marnock is going to buy next.
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:25.680]   Thank you, Mike, for joining us.
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:26.680]   I really appreciate it.
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:27.680]   Hey, thanks for having me on.
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:28.680]   I really appreciate it.
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:29.680]   Oh, my pleasure.
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:30.680]   Always a fan of TechCrunch.
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:33.760]   And I wanted to get you on to it for some time.
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:34.760]   Take care.
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:35.760]   No, anytime.
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:41.280]   Michael Harris is at bit-tech.net, which is the place to go for all your New Year's Eve
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:42.280]   entertainment.
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:43.280]   Right, Will?
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:44.280]   Absolutely.
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:47.320]   I don't know why I said that, but I'm sure it is.
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:50.440]   Well, if you're looking for something to do on New Year's Eve, we just did a little round
[00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:52.240]   up of our favorite products of 2006.
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:53.240]   There you go.
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:55.800]   So if you're looking for a little read, maybe the best graphics card or the best.
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:57.840]   What was that game you said is going to be big?
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:01.280]   Oh, well, this year we said the game of the year slightly controversially.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:03.320]   It was Loco Rocco for the PSP.
[00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:04.320]   Oh, my.
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:07.760]   Which got quite a few people's backs up, but it was Loco Rocco.
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:08.760]   I played all year.
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:09.760]   I have to find that.
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:11.640]   I didn't even know there were games on the PSP.
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:12.640]   That's good news.
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:14.720]   Well, that's partly why it was so fantastic.
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:15.720]   I don't know.
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:16.720]   They're still selling it.
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:18.320]   Yeah, I've got a fine mind now.
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:22.320]   Loco Rocco, but you said there was a big game direct X10 game coming out.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:23.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:26.320]   Well, Crisis is coming out, which is the sequel to Far Cry.
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:28.320]   And it's the first kind of news.
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:30.600]   All the spangly direct X10 effects.
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:32.880]   And it's going to look spectacular.
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:34.120]   I'm looking forward to score.
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:35.800]   Are we going to see Spore in 2007?
[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:36.800]   I think.
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:37.800]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:38.800]   I can't wait.
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:39.800]   What platform is that?
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:40.800]   That's the new.
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:41.800]   Yeah, that's on PC.
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:42.800]   PC only?
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:46.040]   No, it's coming to I think it's also going to be on the 360.
[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:50.200]   And there are also rumors about the Wii, which would be quite interesting.
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:52.480]   That's the new game from the Sims guy.
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:53.480]   Will.
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:54.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:55.480]   Will.
[00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:56.480]   Right.
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:57.480]   Thank you, Will, for being here.
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:58.480]   Have a happy new year.
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:55:59.480]   It's an absolute pleasure.
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:00.480]   All the best for 2007.
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:01.480]   You may now go to bed.
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:02.480]   It's only 7 brilliant.
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:04.480]   It's 7 a.m. now in Britain.
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:07.920]   It's 2008 here.
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.440]   Thank you, Will.
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.760]   And we exchange rate it's more like 19.
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:13.200]   It's right.
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:18.080]   Andy Enaco is, of course, a stalwart at the Chicago Sun times.
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:21.640]   And the British version of Mac users, that what you said?
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:22.640]   The international editions.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:23.640]   Yep.
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:24.640]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:25.640]   And it's so great to talk to you.
[00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:27.200]   Old media still has its places.
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:28.480]   Well, you also have a website.
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:30.480]   Also websites.
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.480]   I'll do online stuff.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:33.560]   But you got a new, you got the new website up.
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:34.560]   I like it.
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:35.560]   It's cool.
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:36.560]   It's fine.
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:37.560]   It's funky.
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:38.560]   It's the first one that I have an Apple scripted.
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:41.280]   But still, even if you use the third party products, it actually works.
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:44.080]   Andy Enaco's colossal waste of bandwidth.
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:45.080]   C-W-O-B dot.
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:47.120]   It lives up to its premise.
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:48.120]   I promise.
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:49.120]   Thank you, Andy.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:50.120]   Have a great 2007.
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:52.440]   We'll get back soon.
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:55.760]   And a John C. Devorak, not yet purchased by Fox Interactive.
[00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:57.880]   Yeah, that'll be the day.
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:58.880]   Wouldn't that be nice though?
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:01.160]   You just take that big check and fade off.
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:03.960]   And then blow it on bad stock options or something.
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:05.560]   Yeah, inevitably, that'd be something.
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:07.000]   Hey, it's good to have you.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.920]   You are really the man that makes a tweet happen.
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:14.120]   We want to make sure that all the people out there have a safe New Year's and they get
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:15.120]   the bit early.
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:18.720]   Well, actually, you can go to bed after midnight.
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:19.720]   Listen to Twitch.
[00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:20.720]   It'll put you right out.
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:22.200]   You'll be asleep before midnight.
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:25.640]   Although, are we putting this up, this show up, since we're ready for it?
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:26.640]   We are.
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:29.480]   It'll be up just in time to listen on New Year's Eve.
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:30.880]   And I think that's what people should be doing.
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:33.600]   So, just should be doing instead of drinking or drink and Twitch.
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:34.600]   It's OK.
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:35.600]   Just don't get in a car.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:36.600]   Right.
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:40.520]   And don't forget there's a Devorak drinking game with the mention of Devorak.org/blog.
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:43.120]   If they've been playing that game, they're not listening right now.
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:44.120]   They're long gone.
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:46.040]   They're a little low on that, aren't we?
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:47.040]   All right.
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:48.040]   Vorak.org/blog.
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:49.040]   Thanks, John.
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:50.040]   Happy New Year.
[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:51.040]   Next week.
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:52.040]   Happy New Year.
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:53.040]   Another Twitch is in the can.
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.040]   I should have paid attention.
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:55.040]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:56.040]   Too much work.
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:59.080]   The problem is there's no limit by servers completely collapsed.
[00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:00.080]   So here's the deal.
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:03.880]   I'm just trying to get the thing off, but I have a hell of a ton of blue screens.
[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:05.120]   Like forget it.
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:06.920]   I'm killing you.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:12.400]   [MUSIC]
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:19.800]   I'm on the Twitch.
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:22.800]   All right.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:27.160]    Do it, the you, the you, and the swift, baby, 
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:31.020]    Do it, the, the you, and the you, baby,

[00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:48.900]    Alright.

[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:10.780]   I wanna twist.
[00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:11.640]   - See you on the twist.
