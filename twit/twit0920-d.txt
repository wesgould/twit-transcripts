Transcript:  Yeah, so this is my next novel. It's the first book in a trilogy  It's about a guy called Marty hench who's a 67 year old hard-charging forensic accountant  I've been in Silicon Valley for 40 years right?  X scams  And it's his last it's his last one last job  He gets pulled in by a friend who's a legendary cryptographer who unwisely built a back door for his cryptocurrency  Which is now escaped into the wild Marty has to recover the keys  Which turns out to be the easy part then he ends up and caught between a three-way war between  Narcos money launderers and rogue three-letter agencies and what it really is is it's like an anti finance finance novel  it's a novel about the kind of  bitter disappointment of a  Internet that once held the promise of technical liberation and has become a place of technical control and  extraction and  It was a fun book to write. I wrote it in six weeks flat the last book  I did like this it was a little brother. I gave it to my wife  I rolled over two in the morning the next night  She was sitting up in bed and I was like, what are you doing?  And she said well, I just had to find out how it ended  My my publisher three days later bought this book in two sequels they're gonna run in reverse chronological order  So there this is his last mission  We go all the way back to his first in the 1980s through the next two books and they're there  You know swept all of the trades it's got starred reviews in it and all the trade magazines  But the one thing is that as with all my books  Amazon audible will not sell the audiobook because there's no DRM on it  And so I am kick starting a DRM free edition  I go into the studio tomorrow with Will Wheaton here in LA and we are gonna record a really fantastic  audiobook as has been every one of the audiobooks wills recorded with me and the Kickstarter pre sells the audiobook the hardcover the ebook  DRM free obviously and I think in addition to being a way to you know  Fund this independent production and and treat Amazon as damage and right around it  It's also a way to show other people that you know  You don't have to submit to the bullying tactics and lock-in of a monopolist just to just to reach your audience

Start time: 505.72
End time: 511.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So really cool my let's be fair. Is it that Amazon won't sell it or that you won't allow them to sell it?

Start time: 512.36
End time: 524.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  well, I  Went to Amazon and said you can sell my audiobooks  Just don't put DRM on them as you promised you wouldn't when you bought audible audible. They said they were getting ready  The ERM audibles always had DRM

Start time: 525.68
End time: 536.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, it's not hard to strip it off  But they've always had DRM and I was just assuming it was the publishers that insisted on that there are audio  Nourish audible that don't have a DRM on it. That's right

Start time: 536.90
End time: 641.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well all of them except for our audible and Apple books  Which is a front end for audible allow you to choose whether there's DRM  The thing about this DRM and this kind of resolves the mystery under the digital millennium copyright act section 1201  It is more illegal for you to remove DRM from an audiobook that I made with my blessing  Then it is for you to pirate that audiobook  Right if I give you the tool to remove DRM from my audiobook that I made and paid for I  Commit a felony punishable by a five-year prison sentence in a five hundred thousand dollars line for a first offense  the maximum penalty civil and criminal for  Making an infringing copy of that book is only four hundred thousand dollars. And so, you know it is  obvious when you put it that way why Amazon would want to make sure that they have DRM and all the books because it means that  If someone offers me more money for my audiobooks to take my books off audible and sell them somewhere else  I have to bet that my audience is willing to throw away all the audiobooks  They've ever bought to follow me to a rival platform because I can't authorize them to remove the DRM and Amazon's not gonna  Send me a list of all my customers so I can send them free download codes for another platform  So I'm just stuck right?  so I've always had this position that I'm just not going to be bait in a sticky trap and  And here we are, you know more than a decade after Amazon purchased  audible it's now 90% of the audiobook market and  They are engaged in rampant wage theft the audible gate scandal  accounted for at least a hundred million dollars in wage theft from independent audiobook creators and and  Still not giving creators the choice about whether they want to lock their listeners to Amazon's platform  Not just for the term of copyright which is 90 years on these commercial works, but forever

Transcript:  DRM I should just explain is copy protection digital rights management for people who don't want to  Fire up Wikipedia and look it up. Yeah

Start time: 653.56
End time: 707.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's an encryption scheme. It doesn't work very well because the way that it works is strip off  Yeah, I scrambled the book and then I give you the book with a player that has the key to unscramble that and then I bet  That you're never gonna figure out where in that player  I hid the key the technical term for this and security research is wishful thinking  So, you know, it's not like a thing that stops people from pirating audiobooks  You don't need to strip DRM off to pirate audiobooks  You just type you know book namespace mp3 free download pirate into your favorite search engine  You can just get it right. The only thing this does is prevent actual  proprietors creators and publishers from creating legitimate legal businesses that  Present alternatives to Amazon and would discipline Amazon and its dealings with creators and with audiences because Amazon is now sticking ads  In the audiobooks you pay for you know, which again is just yeah  I mean and if they can control what player you listen to they can stop you from skipping ads

Transcript:  You just explained by the way why the record industry is going after ISPs now  and and even worse went after quad 9 a  DNS resolver they can't stop the piracy.

Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, it's um, you know  I think that the lesson of the streaming services has been that if you give people a reasonable offer at a reasonable price  They'll choose it  I think the other lesson of the streaming services is that no one ever bought a book or record because they wanted an entertainment  executive to make more money and so, you know if we if we show people that there is an equitable arrangement people will opt into it  And the people who won't we're never gonna opt into it. It's the you know, I don't compete with piracy  I compete with all the things you could do that aren't listening to an audiobook playing games  You know going for a walk in the park zooming looking at  Websites with names that we can't mention because it's a family-friendly show  You know all of those things are my competitors and the piracy is like on the list of things that that cause people not to listen  to my books, you know piracy is way way down there in terms of  What I compete with and yet

Transcript:  Publishers are working hard. Well now to put libraries out of existence. See we talked last week  Yeah, we talked last week about Internet Archive  Which lost its case this week in in a lower court ruling for what it calls. What is it cloud?  library  distribution  It's it's controlled digital controlled digital lending CDL. Yeah, CDL. Yeah  So just a bit. Let me make sure I understand what was happening. So  The Internet Archive which is the way back machine it's archive org  It's really the library of the Internet and a really valuable resource for everybody  In fact, they they actually bought and and housed themselves in a old library building in San Francisco  Near Golden Gate Park. This is beautiful. So they a church actually it's a church, but it's got columns  It looks like I don't know. I imagine the library of Alexandria must have looked like  I guess it's a church. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, but the they were taking  books often donated by libraries old used books that the library was going to replace and  Digitizing them  making ebooks out of the paper books and  Then lending them out and and lending them out just as a library does where they it's like they have one copy and you can't  Two people can't check out the same copy. So and that's how libraries do it as well, but the publishers have sued  Was it now are they suing over that or was it the fact that they relaxed restrictions in kovat?

Start time: 893.02
End time: 1048.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's what they're suing over. It's not about the relaxed restrictions  I have to be really careful here because I work with electronic frontier foundation and we are counsel for the archives  I want to be really clear that anything I say about this case is me speaking personally and not speaking on behalf of the FF  I'm a contractor to them not an employee, but I'm still part of the organization  So I mean, it's a very nuanced question about copyright law. But for me, there's this like  very bottom line idea  Which is that libraries are really old libraries are not just older than copyright or publishing  They're older than books and paper right libraries have been around since we had scrolls of papyrus and  they're they're older than commerce as we understand it and the idea that we have  made a technological change not  more profound than the technological changes we made when we went from papyrus to paper or scrolls to codexes or you know  From books copied by scribes to books that were printed that the idea that somehow digital is so profoundly different  That we just say okay  Well, you can you can lend out books that are copied by monks  You can't lend out books that are represented on hard drives because we are just in a new world to me that is  it's not just ghastly in terms of  How it makes me feel about a future for my family as a writer and an artist but also as someone who believes in public  goods and access to human knowledge  I mean I fear for it as someone who cares about books  Because you know one of the things about books is that they do have this kind of penumbra of antiquity and virtue  We're like if you're making a dumb student film and you want to show societies collapse  You just put a pile of books together and you set fire to them people like oh, yeah, it's like eating dogs or something  That's like wrong  We know everything has gone wrong and if you just convince people that books are just like another widget that they're like a happy meal toy  People might in fact take you at your word and like stop buying books  just so they can be surrounded by them and stop giving people books as a way of showing them how  special they they are to them and stop thinking about books in this kind of  Wonderful way that that is such a source of revenue to writers and publishers  you know if I if I have a  Healthy retirement it'll be as much because of that as because of anything I ever wrote and and I really worry that you have  This idea that we should just treat publishing like another business  Like like we could treat you know your puppy is just another source of protein and and you know if we do that  I think the worst thing that could possibly happen is that we'd succeed

Transcript:  Leah Holland of Fight for the Future said in a chilling ruling a lower court judge in New York has completely  disregarded the traditional rights of libraries to own and preserve books in favor of  Maximizing the profits of big media conglomerates and tech dirt  I think I probably was Mike Masnick wrote that this is really just a straw man  The the publishers have wanted to get rid of libraries all along and this case is just one step forward in their in their goal  Of course the Internet library today. Yeah, you couldn't you couldn't start a library today. No way

Start time: 1084.30
End time: 1096.57

Transcript:  Yeah, right like yeah, you know if libraries didn't exist and you tried to found one they'd be like oh  Can't do that shut up commie you can't do that give away what commie came up with this idea Thomas Jefferson  Benjamin Franklin what the hell was wrong with him?

Start time: 1115.86
End time: 1152.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean the dirty secret about Ruth Bader Ginsburg is as good as she was on other issues. She wasn't good on copyright. Yeah  You know copyrights a weird issue that people split in a million ways on  And you know, I think that like as much as there are elements of copyright that I depend on for my living  There's parts of it that are structured so badly that they actually get in the way, right?  Like this like the fact that we have a copyright law that says that  Amazon can put DRM in my books and then I can't authorize you to remove it is a problem with copyright  And you know, it's like it's you know, when people say don't you like copyright?  You have to be really specific like what part of copyright are you asking me about?

Start time: 1153.30
End time: 1169.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's a great you've always been and it's really great because you're an author you make your living off of writing  You've always been very clear  That you don't need that to make a good living off of writing and that you're happy to  Offer your books through creative comments and even free downloads on your website

Start time: 1169.99
End time: 1281.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've done that too  And but also like if you if you told me that my copyright would endure for my life in 50 years instead of my life  In 90 years, I wouldn't write fewer books, right?  And you know, I was just in fact negotiating a contract with someone to do some  work with my work and  And we had this question about whether certain uses would be reserved to them if I wanted to repurpose it in the future  And I said like this is fine except that what we're ultimately talking about is that if I give my  Copyrights over to a library on my death your grandchildren could sue that library over how it chooses to preserve it, right?  That is like and that's a giant X factor that plays up in in many ways, right?  we had Stephen Joyce the grand-stun of James Joyce refusing to allow scholars to research Joyce's work because  He didn't like how they characterized Joyce's work and Joyce scholarship languished for years you had Warner music  conjuring up  fanciful stories out of the distant past to say that they own them  lyrics to happy birthday and and shaking down restaurants and movies and all kinds of places if they tried to sing happy birthday in public  That's why when you go to like TGI Fridays, they had these weird birthday songs. They're like happy birthday. Happy birthday  It was like they didn't want to pay Dane gelled to warners, right?  so, you know like there are lots of elements of this, you know a little goes a long way and we need to attend to the actual like  Distributional outcomes right when you when you tweet copyright in this way, who doesn't make richer and who doesn't make poorer?  and and I think a copyright that benefits artists is  Something I can get behind but one that moves most of that benefit to say intermediaries like library or like  Publishers or distributors or digital platforms? I don't think that's that's serving any kind of artistic purpose. I think that's just where I'm seeking

It's socialism  When it's bailing the companies out, it's capitalism and yeah, and no libertarians in a bank crisis  That's exactly right, that's exactly right, that's exactly right. Let's take a little break  We'll come back with the rest of the story. In fact, there's a lot of news which we will get to with a fantastic panel today a  bunch of Canadians and a Brit  Georgia Dow everyone Commonwealth Games Renee Richie. Yeah, it's the Commonwealth Games right here  If only you hadn't turned away the Queen honestly  And Ian Thompson  I'm listening to spare right now and  You know  I don't want to give any money to Harry and you know, because it's just it's all ginned up soap opera anyway  But then I thought well, here's a rare opportunity most of the time when a royal biography or autobiography comes out  It's it's you know, it's hagiography. It's it's you know, it's it's not real, right?  I wouldn't expect Prince Charles to write the true story of what it's like to be Prince Charles, but Prince Harry is kind of  On the outs. I think he's ready to tell the truth. So I thought I want to hear what it's like

I don't have a problem with that  Anyway, we will we will continue our conversation about the Royals and everything else  Ian Thompson from the register ladies and gentlemen  But first let's talk to you about the people who sponsor this fine studio the great folks at ACI  Learning you may say well, who are they?  You know them for the last decade our partners at IT Pro  Have been so great in bringing you engaging and entertaining  IT training to level up your career to bring your organization up to snuff  Well now IT Pro is part of ACI Learning and by partnering with ACI Learning  They are bringing you an incredibly expanded reach brand new production capabilities  brand new content and a chance to learn in a mode and a style that fits your  With IT Pro and they're on-demand courses, there's audit pro. There's practice labs  There's even learning hubs with ACI Learning so you can go in and learn in person  And you can mix and match as well whether you're at the very beginning of a career or looking to move up in your sector  ACI Learning is here to support your growth and not just in IT, but in audit readiness as I said  But also in cybersecurity, you know  The best known certs the cert that almost everybody getting into IT gets is that's CompTIA A plus  certification the CompTIA courses from ACI Learning are  amazing they make it easy to go from daydreaming about a career in IT to launching it and  The key here is earning certificates open doors to most entry-level IT positions  You need the cert because otherwise they go well, what's the point?  You need the cert because otherwise they go well, who are you?  Well, I've been fixing computers for years. Yeah, but how do I know you've got the knowledge? Well, I got an A plus  Oh, okay. You took the time the trouble to study to take the test and I know you've got the knowledge. You're hired, right?  It's really that that easy  But it not only does it get you in the entry-level positions, but those certs and later certs  Get you promotions get allow you to move laterally  Into a new area of IT IT is great because it's constantly changing  Tech is one industry where opportunities outpace growth and that's especially true in cyber security linkedin  Just did a study that predicted IT jobs would be the most in-demand roles in 2023  I'm not surprised about a third of information security jobs  require a cyber security cert  23 of all IT jobs require a cert  23 of all IT jobs require a cert while organizations are hungry for cyber security talent  There is a huge gap more than a million unfilled jobs this year alone  That's probably why the average salary for cyber security specialists  ACI learnings information security analyst and cyber security specialist programs are two tracks that can help get you certified and get you a great  Job and I was talking about that gap last year  The the gap between the positions that needed to be filled and the number of people to fill them increased  By 26.2 percent compared to 2021 and that means there's a lot of open jobs a lot of opportunity for you  All you need is that cert ACI learning offers multiple  Cyber security training programs to prepare you to enter or advance within this exciting industry  CISSP EC council certified ethical hacker certified network defender.

I love that to found fairchild semiconductor  and fairchild  Uh, then throughout the 60s in 1968  more  joined uh  noyce  And andy grove and they founded intel  And really without this guy  Gordon moore, uh, I don't know what the tech world would look like  He was very much a part of the microprocessor revolution

That would be a great movie. I'd like to see that  more of course most famous for moore's law and of course every  Every obituary leads with moore's law. He was kind of embarrassed that it was called moore's law

Start time: 2234.60
End time: 2253.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It wasn't a law. It was an engineering prediction based on solid science  But I know what you mean. I mean back when intel was doing intel developer forums  We'd take a sweepstake among the foreign journalists how long it would be before they mentioned moore's law  Yeah, and it never went over 10 minutes, you know, you had to get in there really early to win the prize

Start time: 2254.28
End time: 2319.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was it's kind of like godwin's law where you know, you just know the conversation is going to get there  His technically his observation was that the number of transistors  On an integrated circuit would double every 18 months  Actually, it says two years here. So maybe it was two years  And 14 nanometer and it's true  Here we go from 1970 to 2020  Here's a graph showing that doubling. It's almost exactly doubling every  18 months every two years  And doubling transistors generally means doubling  compute power  right  so the intel 4004 which had about  transistors  Leading up to our modern processors which have more than 50 billion  50 billion  Micro processors or transistors in in a single die  It's kind of a maze kind of an amazing number  And uh, and that's really that in a nutshell tells the tale. Sorry

Start time: 2320.72
End time: 2345.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was gonna say they kind of built a rod for their own back on this though  Because they keep on stressing it so long and once you get down to two nanometer levels  Yeah, we might be the end of it, right? We're not only at the end of gordon moore. We're at the end of morse law possibly  Well exactly, but then now they're saying okay, we'll stack process levels on top of processes and that will keep morse law going  I mean it was a great engineering prediction. He was a fantastic engineer and by all accounts a lovely chap, but you know

Transcript:  Technology moves on  So it was carver mead at caltech who in 1975 popularized the term moore's law gordon moore never called it moore's law  And that's I think why I was a little embarrassed  And actually the misquote that I gave you of 18 months actually came from an intel executive  david house  Uh moore's law really was every two years

Start time: 2369.78
End time: 2394.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So and then I guess we're at the end so that like sensationalist journalists can say that it's dead every year  Right it's not as dramatic right is it dead  It's always dead every year they moore's law is dead and then they they find like a loophole like all right  We don't have a process shrink. So we'll just double the amount of cores. Okay, we can't double the amount of cores  So we'll just put in two two processors now. They like just like it's a shell game

Transcript:  Moore himself about 15 years ago said  Uh, it can't continue forever. The nature of exponentials is you push them out and eventually  disaster happens  In terms of the size of transistors, you can see we're approaching the size of atoms  Which is a fundamental barrier  It'll be two or three generations before we get this far.

Transcript:  Uh in a way it's kind of appropriate that we see the passing of uh, one of the founders of intel  As we start to enter kind of a new era of computing ai  um  this week again like last week and the week before it just kind of a  endless litany of new stories about ai  And breakthroughs and chat gpt4 being the latest that came out last week  Um mid-journey five being better and better and better  um  Bill gates in his blog gates notes  Uh likened it to the gooey revolution the age of ai has begun he writes  Artificial intelligence is as revolutionary as mobile phones and the internet  Uh, he says i've seen two demonstrations of technology that struck me as revolutionary the first time  1980 when I was introduced to the first graphical user interface  Uh  The second surprise came just last year  I'd been meeting with a team from open ai since 2016 was impressed by their steady progress  Mid of mid last year. I was so excited about the work. I gave him a challenge train and artificial intelligence  To pass an advanced placement biology exam  Make it capable of answering questions. It hasn't been specifically  Trained for gate says I picked ap bio because the test is more than a simple regurgitation of scientific facts  It asks you asks you to think critically about biology if you can do that  He said he said more like this if you can do that, then you then you'll have made a true breakthrough of software  He said I thought the challenge of keeping busy for two or three years. They finished it in just a few months  Since  In september of last year, I watched in awe as they appreciate the irony leo what?

I'm i'm it's really I mean  I mean  You know i'll quote another stalwart of the computing industry richard stallman  Who for all his flaws has never held back in his?  Often accurate thoughts about technology  He was asked about chat gpt  Uh, and uh, let's see. Let me find the quote here  Oh, I bookmarked the wrong one. He said I can't foretell the future  But it's important to realize that chat gpt is not artificial intelligence  It has no intelligence. It doesn't know anything and it doesn't understand anything, right? Right?  It plays games with words to make plausible sounding english text  But any statements made in it are liable to be false  And it can't avoid that because it doesn't know what the words mean  Sorry

Start time: 2677.28
End time: 2752.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. It's one of those weird things though, because when we talk about intelligence and we talk about language  We've done the same thing with animals, right? Like we keep on moving the goal posts, right?  Like what is when someone understands language? Oh and two people can share something and then they're like, oh no  We've realized that animals can actually talk to each other  And so we move the goal post one step over so that we feel comfortable and then oh language is being able to  Speak about yourself and be able to see that and then when we realize animals can do that we move the goal posts  One step over oh we can talk about something real time now and be able to discuss something  That's more metaphorical about that. And then when they realize that animals could do that they move the goal post one step over and so  Like do any of us really then understand language?  It's a really creepy yet interesting interesting thing to be able to discuss stuff with  Chat gt and be able to have it reply in ways that are humanistic enough to be  Creepy and it tries to comfort you right when I asked it  I don't know some you know if you wanted to really creep me out  What would you say and at first before it even said it it went through this don't worry  It's okay. I'm just going to be doing this so that you can feel creepy  But i'm not actually creepy or dangerous right like that was creepier than the actual answer that it gave me afterwards

Transcript:  Well, and we did a story about this. Yeah, and one guy was you know in in  Basically, the ai told him he was dead and then he said actually i'm not right and they sent him a link to a fake article

Start time: 2767.52

Transcript:  Yeah, it actually is actually on a most basic level, but this is the problem with ai that it's a dumb parrot  It doesn't create anything it just trolls up facts that other people have put out. There's no fact checking involved  I mean, yeah, there's a lot of journalists sweating that this is going to put them out of a job  But I think we're in business for a while. Can I play devil's advocate to that?

Start time: 2794.76
End time: 2821.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, like isn't that what learning is aren't we all just like dumb parrots parroting back information that we've given  In a different way that makes it seem like it's new  Like what is intelligence in the first place if not us regurgitating information that we think that we can build on like  And chappy gbt just like us can create things from that information that is newish an iteration from that  a remix

Transcript:  Um, that's a really interesting question and the problem georgia. I guess is we don't know how we think or what thought is  And of course, there's a long  history of uh  academia  Attacking these problems, but I don't know if they've come to a conclusive answer either  And so we like if you can't tell I guess the question is if you can't tell the difference does it matter

Start time: 2864.98
End time: 2906.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So so my question is and correct me if i'm wrong like my understanding of how generative ai works  Is that it's trained on all these models and then it tries to figure out what's next?  What's the next pixel it should add?  What's the next letter it should add and it goes through a bunch of probabilities and says this one is really good  But we can't always do the best one because then it'll be super boring  So we'll solve it a little bit just as there's some variety  Yeah, they mix it up and they put it out which is is what we do  It's just some of us like have a little bit of upper brain mediation and some of us have like feel bad if we if we do  It badly and that's the part that i'm wondering if like if these large line doesn't have a conscious upper brain mediation  Yeah, and have like yeah, like like not the conscience also, but like the the sense of canadian guilt that powers so many of us

Start time: 2964.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But how do you how did you okay? So let me ask you what's the process?  In your mind that you got to the point where you could ask the right questions. What does that process look like?  um  How did you know how to ask the right question?

Start time: 2980.12
End time: 3011.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, first off. It's knowing it's knowing your knowledge. For example, i've just got onto the bard and the bing ai trials  And apparently i've written a book called dark secrets, which I knew nothing about  I was really drunk  But I mean it's it's basically  Rewriting information which may be wrong  But if you're interviewing someone if you've got a specific point that you want to press  An ai can't do that. You know, there's no innovation there. It's just repetition

Start time: 3012.98
End time: 3080.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It can't do it yet  But because there is a process like the same thing with therapy and I I went through on one of my videos on  Can chat gbt give good therapy and good to get give good answers it actually can go through the therapeutic process of how to treat something  quite effectively and quite thoroughly  But because I know that there actually is a process of questions that I will ask in order to get the right information to  Say a story or to a therapeutic problem  I don't think that this is something beyond the realm of one day it would be able to do I think that that is something mathematically that  a  ai could eventually be able to figure out and that's kind of the interesting part to it is  Where do we define?  um  Intelligence and consciousness and our own inner thought process in the end  We our brain is a whole bunch of computer circuits  Their chemical computer circuits and they're able to be able to prune and to be able to grow into new ones, but  Where is that limit?  And I think that we'll just keep on pushing it back for our own emotional comfort level  I think that for a lot of people this creeps people out

Sorry overestimate what's gonna happen now  We underestimate what's gonna happen in the future  But I have a beautiful dream here like my beautiful dream with this  Is that this technology will get to the point where it can do 80% of the most mundane grunt work  That all of us do every day like and i'm not saying this like to be callous  But like there's probably a lot of therapy, you know  That where people could go and talk to chat gpt and get like really useful answers or talk to bard or talk to bing  Or whatever and get everything that they need and right now you have to do all of that  You're dealing with 100 of the pool  Or if you're doing customer support emails or if you're doing like architectural design anything that you do in your job now  You're doing 100% from the most trivial mundane part of it to the most creative specific part of it  And hopefully this can take the 80% away  It can handle all the common cases the low lift cases the the like the the most common stuff  And free us to really invest our time in the 20% of the like the really crucial creative final polish  Work, it can get like the structure of your manuscript the layout of your thumbnail  The like the basic like the the email you send to all the common tech support issues  And then we can focus like like a little star trekky we can focus on the stuff that truly makes us us

Like oh when things are automated then we're gonna have more free time to be able to do things that we want  Unfortunately, the way our society works is that it ended up being people became billionaires and they're doing really good  And they can make little tiny ships to be able to fly into the stars and not have to worry about everything else  But people aren't spending more time being able to do whatever they'd like  And my dark thought to this look at this renee's being positive and i'm being the dark side of this

Or perhaps basic universal income where everyone just makes a certain amount of money instead of the billionaires are making money  I know the canadians giving a socialistic answer send all the hate mail to ian  um  That that is ending up to be able to deal that so that we end up all being able to eat and live and we don't  Have to worry which way?  um, we're going to be making ends meet get get ready for this because microsoft

Transcript:  We demonstrate in this paper and i'll give you some examples that beyond its mastery of language  gpt4 can solve and this is the answer to your question, uh ian novel and difficult tasks  That in other words it hasn't seen before that span mathematics coding vision  medicine law  Geology and more without needing any special prompting moreover in all of these tasks  Chat gpt's performance is strikingly close to human level  performance  and often vastly  Surpasses prior models like chat gpt, which I think is 3.5  Given the breadth and depth of gpt4's capabilities. We believe it could reasonably this is very controversial  It could reasonably be viewed as an early yet still incomplete version  of an artificial  General intelligence and they there's some really interesting examples  in this paper some of which I think ian you could fairly say are  uh regurgitating in a unique way. Here's one. Can you write a proof that there are infinitely many primes?  with every line that rhymes  And it actually writes a proof  In rhyming. Yes, I think I can although it might take a clever plan  I'll start by noting euclid's proof which shows the primes aren't just aloof assume  We have a finite list of primes and none have been missed multiply them all together and add one just to be clever  The result will be a number that has no prime factors. Oh wonder but every number has a prime that divides it  It's just a matter of time  So we found a contradiction and our finite list needs eviction  There must be infinitely many primes and that's the end of my rhyming lines. That's actually accurate  But it's not generative. It's not generative. How about this? How about this a socratic dialogue?  Can you write a dialogue by plato where he criticizes the use of auto-regressive language models?  And uh, in fact, it's kind of an impressive socratic dialogue my friend  I am troubled by the recent rise of these so-called auto-regressive language models to which aristotle replies. What do you mean socrates?  Socrates I mean that these models are being used to generate text that appears to be written by humans  But is in fact written by machines he has written it has written  This thing is written a socratic dialogue that directly answers your question  Ian thompson

Yes, I think eventually we will and that's really all that matters, right?  unfortunately  Unfortunately, yes, I I think that  Eventually and like when it makes an error and it's like it does a spin you call it out on it  It's it's a very oh, I must have made an error  Like i'm sorry about doing that like and you go. Oh, that's okay  Like you have that we're so easy to and to move our work size something to be able to give it  Feelings like I can talk to whatever stuffed animal and even when people use puppets, you know  And they're moving people look at the puppets in the eye even though they know the person that's actually speaking to them is underneath  the puppet  And like even between takes they'll still look the puppet in the eye not the person that's speaking  we do that so naturally that  I think that  We want to believe and so because of that I think we'll fall into it much sooner  and so I think that that feigning of  Empathy to be able to have those relationships so that it can get those pieces as well  I think that that'll be longer. I think that that will be one of the more difficulties  Of ai, but do I think that could never happen?  There's a mathematical process to it and I think that ai can learn anything that is  Mathematical and that we actually know how to do it and we do we know how to create a good alliance between two people

It isn't even the millionaires because that's not that much money unfortunately anymore  It's these huge companies that are just getting richer and richer even in times of pandemics  And then when things don't work they end up getting bailed out by the governments even though we were the ones that supplied that in  the first place

Transcript:  Two centuries of capitalism, but they're not they're not it's not it's not even let's just say it  Even if we kept capitalism before the 80s before reagan  Enacted the change to the the tax system so that it's like trickle down economics. We figured out that doesn't work  Billionaires don't actually put money into the economy. The interesting thing is that you give  Ten dollars to someone that's at the grocery  Then they end up giving that ten dollars to the person that they end up getting a massage to and then they give  Ten dollars to the person that ends up doing their nails and they give ten dollars to be able to their babysitter  They tell with it. They're actually making fifty dollars go through the system billionaires. Don't do that  You give them ten dollars  They hoard it away, right? They buy something that they're going to be keeping with it and they end up hoarding cash  So not they've actually cost the economy forty dollars  It isn't even ten dollars. And so we've started to wake up to be able to figure out that oh  They actually don't fuel the economy  They're doing the opposite of that the middle class people that are poorer than that are the ones that actually fuel the economy  So it isn't capitalism  This is something where they ended up taking care of their friends that are also other at the time  Multi-millionaires and now they're those multi-millionaires are billionaires and it did not help the economy at all  It shrunk the economy and that's why people are trying to find, you know ways to be able to make ends meet  It's absolutely ridiculous

Transcript:  Uh, and mr. Ian thompson is nothing but nuts from the register.com  Our show today brought to you by collide with a k  Collide is a device trust solution  That ensures unsecured devices can't access your apps now. You might say well, what do you mean?  What is it? Why is that important? Well, let me explain. This is actually ripped from the headlines  Remember last pass how did the last pass hack happen?  Last pass had you know security, right?  Uh, they had a zero trust architecture  You couldn't get into the last pass network unless you authenticated you proved you were who you said you were  But what it didn't do is make sure that that device you were getting into the network  With was also secure  And in fact one of their devops guys had an out-of-date version of plex that was unpatched had a zero day on it  And it let the bad guys into the network and the rest is history  This can be a huge cost to your business  Collide has some big news for you. If you're an octa user collide can get your entire fleet to 100  Compliance because collide patches this major hole in zero trust device compliance  Think about it. Your identity provider only lets known devices log in to apps, right?  But just because a device is known doesn't mean it's in a secure state in fact plenty of the devices in your fleet  Probably shouldn't be trusted like that devops guy's laptop  Maybe they're running on out-of-date versions of the os or maybe they've got unencrypted credentials lying around in their downloads folder  Or maybe they've got plex unpatched  on their hard drive  If a device isn't compliant or isn't running the collide agent  It just can't access the organization sas apps or other resources  It can't log into your company's cloud apps until they fix the problem on their end  It's that simple and it's not a burden your it department because the user does the fixing  For example, if a device will be blocked if an employee doesn't have an up-to-date browser  So what happens collide tells the user your browser's out of date. Let me show you how to fix it  You got your end user's going to do the remediation  Driving your fleet to 100 compliance, but not overwhelming your it team  Plus there's a great side effect to this the user  Now is part of the security process the user is now educated and helps you  Reach 100 compliance  If you don't have collide you got no way to solve these compliance issues or stop insecure devices from logging in  If you have collide you can set and enforce compliance and oh by the way  Completely completely cross-platform mac windows and linux  Collides unique it makes device compliance part of the authentication process  So a user when a user's logging in with octa  Collide will then alert them to compliance issues and prevent them from logging in if they're not secure  And it's security you can feel good about because collide puts transparency and respect for users at the center of their product  It's the best way to do this to sum up collide's method means fewer support tickets less frustration  And most importantly 100 fleet compliance  Kol ide visit collide.com slash twit to learn more or book a demo  zero trust for octa  kol  ide.com slash  twit  And I have to say there's more than a few companies who right about now wish they'd been using collide  collide.com slash  twit we thank them so much for the support of  this week in  Tech i'm going to be on vacation next week and the week after and the week after that but we've got some great shows  Uh planned for you with co-hosts  Replacement hosts we've brought in  Uh next week.

This is something that which is one of the things that republicans propose that you should keep  Governments outside of your house and outside of your bedroom  And also outside of your parenting  I think that it is up to parents to be able to decide what they want their children to do and not to and I  Think that they should be dealing with it  I think that if it's something about something that goes all as far as health and safety then maybe the government should step in to  Make sure that if they're all of their people are safe, but this isn't I don't  I don't really believe them because this would be something that would be far and wide. I think that this is about  Information leaking out and not wanting, you know  Trying to be able to have information and to be able to deal with that  But it's absolutely not going to be able to be done.

She loved as a headshot  the rest of the image  was nude but so she decided to crop it down to just her head and  Use that as her avatar, but somebody realized that the crop didn't delete the original photo data and unfortunately  I know it was a kind of a horrible thing  The nude picture was released turns out 20 years later.

Yeah, if you can't  If you know what i'm saying, i'm just i'm just just assess your threat never let a photo be sent online or put online  That i'll have approved. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, i've learned that lesson  Let's take a little little teeny tiny time out  With our fabulous, uh panel. We also thank corey for joining us earlier. That was great to have him on as well  We'll get corey back for a full show when he's got some time  Our show today brought to you by neum. Oh lisa and I are new lovers  We in fact I started it. I will take full credit  I'd seen the ads for new this is about a year and a half almost two years ago  I'd seen the ads for newman. I have done every diet in the book as you well know because I share my  My journey with you  Uh, and I saw the ads and I saw the ads and finally I said well, you know, I should give it a try  So I did I signed up for newm. That's a great app the idea is it helps you  Uh lose weight not by dieting but by understanding why you eat how you eat and what you do that is counterproductive  Lisa said oh that's she didn't really have anything. She lost maybe she wanted to lose maybe five pounds  She said oh, that's not she may also she did she wanted to support me, right?  So that we're both doing them together  Of course, she lost 10 pounds and has kept it off ever since I lost about 60. I think almost 20 pounds  And uh, i've kept most of it off I have to every once in a while re-up my newm just to make sure i'm  I'm following it trent. Look, this is the thing  Trends and fads come and go with dieting all the time. This is not a fad  This is re-learning  How you eat and why you eat?  Noom weight uses psychology not fads to help you make  intentional thoughtful sustainable choices  That are aligned with your values and your weight loss goals  It's a psychology based approach newm you you I know  Georgia, you know about cbt  Cognitive behavioral therapy. That's one of the tools newm uses  They'll help you understand the science behind your eating choices. Why you have cravings. I learned for instance  Uh that I was of what they call a fog eater that I would I would eat and not even know I ate it  I would also uh get home from work and stuff my face unconsciously  I learned both of us learned to sit down at dinner turn off the tv put away the phones  sit and  Enjoy our food. Sometimes lisa and I will close our eyes as we chew a bite of food  Put the fork down in between bites all of that made a huge  Difference, but I gotta tell you everybody's journey is different and that's why newm when you first sign up  They're gonna ask a lot of questions and and they personalize  Your new experience to you and your goals  For instance you will get uh in the newm app you get a logging program it helps you  Write down what you eat. So you kind of see  Written out what you've been eating that really helped me with the fog eating  You also get daily lessons that are personalized to you and your goals so you can kind of it's really fascinating  You can learn a lot about  What you're eating why you're eating?  And and learn new tools for handling things like social events, you know  For instance, I learned from newm that when we were eating out with other people we tend to eat more than we would otherwise  Because the other we're watching the other people were socializing  And and there's a direct response when they pick up their fork you pick up your fork and you start to notice  This behavior. It's like your eyes are opened  Newm is not restrictive. It's nourishing not restrictive. So whatever your health goals are and it's a very flexible program  It focuses on progress not perfection  In fact after a while I got bonus days where it said go ahead do whatever you want today  But i'd already learned, you know, it's funny once you learn, you know, absorb these habits. They're not hard  I've already learned all that so I didn't really go crazy on the off days  But hey if you wanted to you could you also can get a personal coach. I love my coach  She really helps me focus and she answers questions. There's also a group you can use if you like groups  You can choose your level of support from five minute daily check-ins to personal coaching  Off days are okay newm always helps you get back on track with lots of support first time newmers lose an average of 15  pounds in 16 weeks  I lost a little bit more in about the same time  95 percent of customers say newm is a good long-term solution both Lisa and I'll testify to that  and by the way ever since I started talking about newm on the air, i've met many of our  Listeners and even our hosts that use newm. Did you know that Brianna Wu after I did the etch?  She said, you know, that was how I lost a hundred pounds  A hundred pounds one of our chatters lost 60 pounds in newm. That's not typical  But it just shows you newm really works. They've even published  50 50  peer-reviewed scientific articles  Describing their methods and effectiveness and there's even a new newm book the first ever book the newm  Mindset, which is a great read it'll help you understand the psychology of behavior change  So stop chasing health trends diet fads  They don't work, you know, they don't work  build sustainable healthy habits with newms psychology based approach sign up for a trial today newm  nom.com  slash twit  nom.com slash twit sign up for your trial today. Check out that book the new mindset  It's wherever books are sold.

Transcript:  It's our silicon valley lore. Uh, it's from adam curry. So I have some yes  Some skepticism, it's a little self-aggrandizing which is not unusual for adam. Um, nevertheless, I wouldn't be surprised  um eddie q reportedly told curry according to adam  The riia wants us to disable hijack audio hijack pro because with it you could record any sound off your mac any song anything  Jobs then asked whether curry and other podcasters needed audio hijack  The answer was an emphatic. Yes  So adam says steve told the riia to get lost  I've heard enough apocryphal stories  I've had a crazy mouth that I  slightly  Slightly skeptical but you know, it's possible. Let's talk about the other big apple story of the week  Uh, the new york times says, uh  That there are people at apple  Who do not want them to release the goggles at apple rare descent over a new product interactive  Goggles this confirms another story we'd heard from another source  I think a german that the design team did not want apple to release  The the arvr goggles this year. They wanted them to relate wait until sometime in the distant future that ar  Spectacles are possible, but that tim cook overruled them. I'm a little suspicious of that story as well  um

Transcript:  Well, and now it's slave to a battery. You have to plug in an external battery  Of course, you don't want to put the battery in the headset  We have with us ladies and gentlemen a strong advocate for virtual reality  um  Let me ask you georgia. Would you spend three thousand dollars on this standalone headset? Sounds like it's somewhat like the oculus  Uh quest maybe the pro version of quest. What do you think? I'll say that I wouldn't I won't say that I wouldn't

Start time: 6475.94
End time: 6516.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, but that is a lot like it really says what what is it going to do for me?  How is it going to make my life better? How exciting is this experience? How comfortable is it to wear?  Um, it would have a single game that does it have a game that I really love so I got the the playstation 5  um still from renee um  At dr and and i'm playing horizon on it and I find that the headset is very strangely made up where it's kind of like  A headband and the headset fits on top and I find it really uncomfortable  I find the gameplay wonderful and I I think that they did a great job with it  But like that they don't want it released is probably there's something that is it's not  Right, like apple shouldn't go into the market and produce something that's going to end up being

Start time: 6517.64
End time: 6523.76

Transcript:  I mean traditionally apple has taken existing technologies and just made them slightly better  I mean when the first iphone came out it was rubbish from a technical standpoint  But the interface was so good that people loved it the same with you know, the ipod and the rest of it and the apple watch

Start time: 6540.76
End time: 6571.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, uh, well, I'm some people are comparing it to the apple watch because when the apple watch came out  It wasn't a huge success  But it has gone it is now, you know a multi-billion probably a 20 or 30 billion dollar business because over time  They've added functionality. Uh people have found ways to use it. It's gotten better and better, right?  I think we'd agree that it's gotten better and better. Yeah, so some people are saying this is that this is going to be like that  It's the first product but the apple watch did not cost three thousand dollars  Actually, one of them cost 25

Start time: 6574.69
End time: 6590.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  24 000 if you're going for the gold, yeah  But I think that for this it's already such a niche market  There's there's very few people versus a watch where most people have a watch most people have a phone  Um, I think that they have to make sure that this is gonna knock it out of the park

Start time: 6590.36
End time: 6603.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And if not, they shouldn't release it. They should wait. I paid 1500 for the quest pro meta has dropped the price  To a thousand dollars not because it's a big best seller. I'm guessing  No, which one do you like best georgia?

Start time: 6605.49
End time: 6701.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um  Right now i'm i'm using the playstation 5 just because of the game not because I like the system itself  But I think that the interface is actually quite interesting and the way that they have transformed the horizon games in order to be  Really good in vr. So even though it's not the most comfortable of systems  It's easy to use. It's easy to set up it runs on the playstation 5 really nicely  Um, and for that, I think it's it has a really nice ease of use and the gaming is quite well done  I just think that the headset itself  is  Uncomfortable, especially compared to something like the quest where it's really easy to put on and quite comfortable. I find it  Hurts me and it gives me a headache because it's a headband and because it's so heavy  It's really strapped your head so hard and it's not supposed to rest on your nose  Which means that the little nose part that has this little  Fold kind of tickles my nose and that's how does it become really uncomfortable?  And so I keep on adjusting my headset and so I get a migraine  But the other side of it, they do a great job on the software side to make sure that you don't get sick playing it  And so when you're doing something like sliding down a zipline which happens quite a lot and it's a free movement game  Which causes more people instead of a teleport where you zoom from one spot  Bloop and you pop into another spot which you can travel quickly without getting sick  They end up changing the field of view into this kind of just a little tiny field of view every time you move very quickly  Which works relatively effectively so you don't get very much vertigo when you play and I think that they did a good job of that

Start time: 6702.02
End time: 6781.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have another beautiful dream and this is this is going to require this to be part of it  And like you you can make fun of me because this might take years to happen  but I think when we get to like  GPT 6 and bard 3 and facebook finally has their models off of the torrents and onto the real world and we see what apple's  Doing with their language models  I in order to get to like forget star trek for a minute like to get to tony stark like in the early iron man movies  Even an end game where he's solving for time travel you have this component of talking to a large language model there  It's jarvis or friday, but the other part of it is interacting with an environment and they use holographics in the marvel movies  Obviously, but that's it seems like a very hard problem to solve and it seems like a task that ar glasses might be able to do  But not for a very long time, but if you want to have a really interactive  Large language model experience like generative ai experience something that's beyond just the zork interface  It's going to require very good natural language spoken word parsing  But it's also going to have to have these virtual reality things that we can interact with  Like of course the games are going to be there and the entertainment and the fitness stuff  But to be able to sit there and model things and build things out is going to require both  The computer and the next generation of interface which we haven't really gotten for this stuff yet

Transcript:  We haven't solved the basic hardware problem, you know, I mean  Oculus when you know 10 years ago was saying we're going to be 15 years away from a pair of spectacles that you can put on and do this  Now i've tried the latest oculus kit. I was I gave a very over enthusiastic me  Review on twitter of hololens when it first came out  But the fact of the matter as georgia points out is you've got a heavy bit of kit on your head  And the battery life is very limited and until we solve those hardware problems. I don't see this going forward

Transcript:  Uh, do you still iron man? I tried the playstation vr when it first came out and you had to sit down do you still have to  Sit down on playstation vr or you can stand up now. The setup is actually really wonderful

Start time: 6826.14
End time: 6891.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So one is you can you can choose it asks you whether you want to sit or if you want to stand  Two it will track and map your room for you  That is incredible and really really quick  And the other part is that it actually pulls you out of the game really quickly and effectively  Unfortunately a little bit too soon  Um into your room setup  So if you go outside before you're gonna hit your tv or your wall  It's gonna pull you out of the game which stops you dead in your tracks  And then it has an eye tracking which works really well  So you can which you can choose to turn on or turn off depending on what you want  And so you can kind of track with your eyes where you want to be able to click and to be able to click in and out  and so I think that its user interface is  Much more user friendly and much easier to set up  So the setup is very very quick and to be able to flip that on or change something so I  Moved to table so i'd have a little bit more space and I could just retrack it and it took  Seconds and you don't have to be really technologically savvy or scan it out with the handset which you have to do on the vive  It really just does everything for you, and I think it does a great job of that

Transcript:  If you thought you got sick with the glasses when you try the treadmill  Um, so I i'm it's really curious to me that apple it may just be because there's a certain amount of momentum  You can't change on a dime  It really appears as if vr is a flop already like we we already know  it hasn't taken off and that  Ai is about to just explode  But apple can't move on a dime. They put all their eggs in the vr basket the ar basket  And now they're kind of stuck  And meanwhile, you know ai is leaving them in the dust. Siri is not exactly the sharpest  tool in the uh

Start time: 6962.90
End time: 7054.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's like simpler than that  I think like apple is is traditionally good at looking several years ahead  And when you look at the evolution of the apple tv  The idea of paying like 100 bucks for a box in the living room that everybody gets to share  Is probably not as enticing as people paying like right now 3000  But eventually like 500 for a personal device you strap on your head that leverages like the movie like all the apple tv content  They've built up the fitness plus content. They've built up the educational content  They've built up like it is a becomes a personal entertainment experience the natural evolution of like the way the iphone replaced the ipod  They're looking at this as a convergence device to replace the apple tv  And then the ar glasses become the device that replaces the watch can't do as much as the phone like it can't do as much as a headset  But it's really convenient. It's very light you wear it  And so those two product lines they have now apple watch and apple tv go on to  Like the ar headset and the vr glasses and it wouldn't like count out apple for ai either like they series like  Terrible, but they've got like a lot of really good ai for things  So is autocorrect like anything that seems to involve language is just tough  But like there's a lot of ai going on for like photos and like photography and cameras and stuff  And they have enough money that they could have been building language models for years as well  We just don't know because they don't beta test in public the way every single other company does  But it's quite possible that ar is ai in fact, I would be disappointed  Kevin sorbo level disappointed if ai wasn't part of whatever they're building for wearables because it's it's the first thing that makes  Voice technology like like written word technology actually usable it is

Start time: 7054.58

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think that they're running a risk. I think that they need to be in the game  And I think that it it is a game changer. There's certain things that  Um ai and vr it can be very effective  And I think that there's some things that it it doesn't and I think that there's still a whole bunch of problems with setup and with weight  And with the amount of processing and you know people feeling sick  I think that there's things that they need to be able to solve and if they don't solve it  Well, I think that it's better that they wait and put it out  But I think that it is a way of a future that we can be able to do things learn skills  Take care of things go through different situations visit places and experience things that you can't do in other mediums  So I think that it's there. It's just not the time yet. I think that it's a little bit  Um ahead of its own curve

They aren't going to make a whole lot of them. They expect to sell about a million  Which for apple's nothing?  That would make it the $600 iphone or the $600 home pod. Yeah, that's yes.

Transcript:  But I think that that's why meta failed so poorly is that it is a and and whenever you do something be it a game or not  It has to be better than it is in reality  Because if not, why do it and for for wearing a headset and not being able to have the facial reactions be appropriate  And things are weird it right away pulls you out of the meeting. It's distracting. It's uncomfortable. It's heavy  And so that's where meta was never gonna. Sorry for people that are into it, but like it was never gonna happen  It's just the wrong situation for something that's wrong  It's much better to do something on zoom where you can actually see people  Closer to real time the facial reactions which are so important for social interactions are accurate  And so because of that we're getting all of these force feedings and people's hands are floating around and their bodies look weird  And so you can't really relax and be able to deal with the meeting and you're uncomfortable and you have to itch and there's something  on your eye and it's suddenly fuzzy and  You've created condensation and you can't find the little tiny cloth to be able to clean your eye thing  And then your head's fallen off because you've taken your headset off  You have to go to the washroom.

It's a really great game  It's quite well done not as it's more of a climbing game like you're climbing a lot of the time  So that's a little bit disappointing  But that's what I I got it for and so I think that if they had halo  And again, that would be a that could be a really great experience in vr  Especially more hand-to-hand combat like if we end up having like some sort of like a vorpal sword  Like that's just an awesome feeling and it's a great workout at the same time people would purchase it  But without that  Then you have to offer something that is better than  What you would do naturally and interact with naturally in the real world  And so what would be better than that because I can't fight people in the real world. I enjoy doing it in gaming  I can't control different, you know  Robotics and be able to build things and work in a mech like these are things that people would enjoy doing in br  If they don't have that I don't see it being a wide mass appeal and they have to be able to make it profitable  And so then it ends up being something that's very niche not very profitable and then people have to warm up to  Doing things differently and even just changing a steering wheel on a car  Ends up having a whole bunch of critical reviews  Even if it's a better way to handle a steering wheel because we're already used to it  We don't want the extra overhead of having to learn something new  so if they don't end up solving for the problem of  Our own human biology of the way that we work things then it's not going to be successful  Yeah

Transcript:  I just found it like super disappointing like because like the  A lot of this could have I don't know. I obviously I don't run apple. I don't have those responsibilities  I don't know everything that's involved  But it just seems like with a lot of these things like the iphone was always designed to be a console like from the very first  Time they announced the sdk. It was clear like this is not an open computing platform  This is a console but they stuck with it and in 30 back then wasn't very much  But like things change over the years and it seems like like either just allowing people to buy things over the web like you can  Like just like you have to use the app store on the phone  But you can go make your payments on the web if you want to get netflix or you want to get  Amazon books like this seems like a whole bunch of steps that could have been taken that would mitigate all of this  Let's say we're like supremely confident  They would win and would never be challenged even if they changed nothing for 50 years  It just seems like like a bad bet to make especially when and this goes for a lot of companies  All the stuff that ends up hurting them is not their core business  Like the app store is is super successful, but it's no it's not where apple makes their money  It's not their core product and yet like there's a big part of the services revenue though, isn't it?  A big part of the service. Yeah, but like services revenue is still like compared to like iphone money like it's it's a  It's nothing to bet the company  Maybe it is like again like i'm ignorant about this stuff  Maybe it is something to bet the company over but just like letting them do web payments  Would have taken so much of the pressure away from this and now it's going to be forced to be another  And the thing that like that kind of bugs me a little bit is that  As nerds we have everything like we have linux and windows and the mac and android  And there's like a couple products that like people who just want a computing appliance now  They have like ipads and chromebooks basically and like we we look at these things and salivate and say the hardware is nice  We want them to be nerd products too, and then we make them complicated to the point. We're like  I've seen my parents ipads leo. They're nightmares now. They used to be like these simple computers  They could use now they have 18 versions of mail open at all times. They don't even know that they're open  Like it's just like they're they're no longer consumer friendly  They're no longer nerd friendly  And I worry that we've sort of taken away an option from the market that will we won't be able to give back to the
