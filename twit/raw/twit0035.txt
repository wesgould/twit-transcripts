[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   This is Twit, this week in Tech, episode 35 for December 18, 2005.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   [Music]
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Leo LePorn here and kind of an unusual confabulation of Twits today.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Patrick Norton is out of reach of the Internet.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   I'm not sure what he's up to, but we found some pretty good replacements for him.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   I introduced the gang. Kevin Rose is here, hasn't been here in a long time, very busy with dig.com.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Welcome back, Kevin.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Hey, thanks for having me back there.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Oh, which?
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   You're a Twit, you're an original Twit.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   So there's always a home for you.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   I think people were starting to speculate that something happened, you disappeared or something, but no, you just been very busy.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Yeah, I've been all over the place last few weeks, but finally I'm back in the States and I'm here for a while.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Good, good.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   And of course Steve Gibson from Irvine, the King of Security.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Mr. Hamach, this week.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Oh boy, yeah.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Well, if you haven't heard episode 18 of Security Now, it's all about this new VPN program he's fallen in love with.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   And then of course, John C. Devorak, who gets it.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Hello.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   No spam.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   He had to be no show without John and a special guest.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Celebrity.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   A celebrity guest to have here in our little round table this week.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Steve Wozniak, the creator of the Apple One, the Apple Two and the founder of Apple Computers.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Woz, it's great to have you.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   This is very unfortunate because I'm probably the one who at least wants to be, at least tries to be a celebrity.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   And you are the celebrity.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   And all of us are working so hard to be celebrities.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   You don't like that mantle of celebrity?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Plus or more, minus than anything because I was a real shy guy.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   I just wanted to be quiet and have a life and do my fun technical things.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   I'm really drawn away from that more by the celebrity than anything.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   The results are good.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   I need a lot of great people and I get a chance to do a lot of good things, you know, helpful things to the world.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   I just assume, I can't go show and just look at products and get interested in acting like a normal dummy.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   A lot of the things that you want to do, Steve, do require that you have money in order to make these things happen.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   So the celebrity power probably helps you to achieve some of the goals.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Well, yeah, it probably does.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   It does, but I don't think I try to apply it and I don't think it goes in any big ways there.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   I mean, I look at the things that are important in my life and they don't really delve around the celebrity at all.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Is there one surprising side-defect or benefit of celebrity that you didn't expect that you do enjoy?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Oh, the amount of time just taken to talk to people, strangers and everyone and try to listen to their ideas and be polite to them.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   I mean, it can be, you know, more than 24 hours a day.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   I'm impressed though, you're very available. I mean, Woz and I went on the Mac Mania Cruise in, I guess it was a boy, it's a year ago now in November.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And it's just the most agreeable and open and willing to talk to people.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   And of course, you spent all your time doing that.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Well, no, it's so interesting.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Meeting people actually is one of the greatest things that I get.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Just aside from celebrity, it's just actually from the celebrity even.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I get to talk to people, hear their stories and share some of mine and then get into joking.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   And I'm real shy at first, but once I get to know someone, then watch out.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Yeah, really, no kidding.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   He was talking about laser pointers with my son and now my son wants, because Woz has some way of hacking these laser pointers so that they can melt things.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   I don't know.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Oh, brother.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   I would tell you, one of my latest gags is I placed this metal torpedo shaped device on a table, like with a waiter there, you know, in a restaurant.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   And I show them how you can shine one of these powerful, powerful lasers on it and it starts to wiggle.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Jiggle, just a little and then it wiggles more and then I can finally with the laser get it spinning and I explain.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   I use a line that my son came up with.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Light is heat.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Of course, they don't see the magnet.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   I'm holding it under the table.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   [Laughter]
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Yeah, it's a little magic trick.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   It was.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   What kind of car are you driving nowadays?
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Mostly my Prius.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   2005 Prius.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   I almost bought a Prius.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Should I buy a Prius?
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   I love the car.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   I can recommend it as one of the best general cars for almost every one.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Some people object to some pieces of it.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   I'm around a lot of people that it's too cheap to use a Toyota drive a Toyota.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   But I just, I love things when they happen automatically and the one thing I get in that car that works is I get in it and my telephone becomes hands free.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   The cool thing also is the car knows you're approaching, right?
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   So it unlocks its doors as you get close to it.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Yes, and I love that and actually I understand you can buy watches that will do that for you.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   That'll unlock your car.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   They'll unlock the Toyota Prius.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Oh, I see.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Unfortunately, the watches I found didn't exist or they didn't work.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   They don't tell the time, but they do unlock the car.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   They didn't look good.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   They didn't look good.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   But I also love, I don't remember anything else.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   I love the way the car feels.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   It's a smooth, quiet acceleration.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   You almost don't notice.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   And it's only supposed to go like 103 miles an hour, but I went down to LA the other day and we got it up to 100 miles an hour.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   We got it up to 108 on the flat.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   And we used the laser as a piece of technology to clear traffic ahead of us because the trucks are in the slow lane.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   You just zoom past them, but occasionally some idiot driver in the left lane and you just shine the laser down in his rear view mirror.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   They see a green flash and all they do is hit their brakes and pull over.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Oh my God.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   One after another, another will clear day.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   At nighttime it's dangerous because if you do it to a cop, you're going to get serious trouble.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   The only reason why is I just want to let you know that I actually got a handcuff for doing just that.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   I had a red laser and I shined it at someone and they thought it was a gun and they pulled my car over.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   The cops pulled me over and they searched the car for a gun and they handcuffed me and put me on the hood.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   It was crazy.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   There is, actually, I know people have been arrested, charged, even convicted for some, and the crime is using a laser to annoy people is actually a crime.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   But if you're using it for fun, they enjoy it and you're not really trying to scare them.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Using it to scare them is the crime.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Well, and as a cat toy, a little, no, a laser pointer is such an amazing cat toy.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   They just go chasing themselves all over the place. This is wonderful.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   These bright green lasers get people to pull over so fast, but then when they see a little Prius slide go by, they're probably pissed.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   One guy shined his brakes on you.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   You have a coming after with a gun if you keep this up.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   One guy shined his brakes on me.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Really? Now, do you use a green instead of a red because you don't want people to think you're targeting them with your laser sights?
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   I carry green, red, and blue. And the blue is my most valuable gadget because you can't buy it and you can't, they aren't made. They aren't really sold.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Doing a blue laser is tough, huh?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Yeah, blue handheld laser. There is a solid state interior that lasers blue. It's very expensive and it's not made into laser pointers, but I got the company to build me one.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Wow, very cool.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   There you go, the benefit of celebrity.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Yes, and when you take the green laser and the red laser and the blue laser and you shine them on a bald head and have them all go in circles and it takes about three people.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Because one person can't hold two lasers and do them very effectively. It is so funny to see those three colors.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   If you could do it fast enough, you could do a TV show. Have you done any laser hacking Kevin Rose? Is this the sound that someone's hearing to?
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   No, it's just one of those things where I bought one of lasers. I thought it would be fun to do the exact same thing, but in Las Vegas they take it a little more seriously.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   I used to live and learn. Yeah, friend of mine got arrested recently for that. Her daughter had shined a laser on some kind of daughter cleaned up on the roof when the cops came and she said the daughter wasn't home.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Oh my goodness, I'm sorry I brought up the question now.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   No, I'm enjoying this. This is great.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Alright, I suppose we should get to some tech news. Before we do that, I just want to mention a couple of things.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   First of all, Waz, he's going on another Macmania cruise and I know Captain Neil would be really upset if I didn't mention that we're going to Mexico on Macmania 4, February 4th through 11th. You're still on for that, right, Waz?
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   I am on for that. I'm excited for that. And right after that, I'm heading over to New Zealand for the... I'm representing the United States of America in the very first international Segway Polo match.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Oh man. I thought you invited the Chinese?
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   I thought you invented Segway Polo.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   We did. Our group did. We didn't quite invent it because a lot of people were talking about it.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   But we were the first ones that started playing it and we played it for a year and a half and we've got the long-term reputation.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   So most of the Segway Polo groups in the world use our rules and we're inviting the Chinese and the Australians and hope that that turns out great.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Too fun. Isn't that great? Waz has a number of Segways and they play... You play in Mountain View? I forgot where you play, but on the peninsula.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   So, you play in Sunnyvale and Oakland and I wanted to bring the Segways on the cruise and was told it was going to be too inconvenient.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Oh, you can't? No.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Are there after factory mods to the Segway to do cool things?
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Like Polo?
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Well, there are. One of the things is to take off any speed governors, for example.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   The key tells you how fast it goes and I went on the online and forgot the codes for the speed and the codes for the CRC and figured out all the algorithms.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   And then I programmed a little processor to re-burn the keys with different speed codes, but I'm so good a person.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   I only programmed for slower codes.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Oh.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   But to have people ask me, how fast have you taken it? Because the legal limit is 12 and a half miles an hour and I always tell them the truth.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   I've taken mine 60 miles an hour without a helmet.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Oh my God, you're crazy.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Without a helmet?
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Any backup?
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Oh, that fast?
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Oh, no, it's in the back of his Hummer.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Oh.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   How fast will the Segway go if you took off all the governors?
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   They have extra governing down in the base that I haven't gone to and tried to reverse engineer.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   That would be a big job and that one is going to be, so it's 12 and a half as fast as I've really gone.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Well, a plug for the Geek Cruise, GeekCruises.com was and I and David Pogue and a lot of other people beyond that.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   And that should be a lot of fun.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   And if Apple goes ahead with its Intel Max, maybe that's all we'll be talking about because it'll be a month after the Mac world expo.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   So there might be a lot to talk about.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   And that should be a lot of fun. Guess what just happened?
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   What?
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   My nerd meter went to 10. I've never seen that before.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Believe it.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   John hates it when we get all nerdy and stuff like that.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   We'll talk about the tech news right now.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   AOL, and this is kind of an interesting story.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   AOL about two weeks ago said, "We're going to dump Google search for MSN search.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Google, it turns out, makes made $400 million this year alone on the AOL links to Google.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   That's a valuable commodity." So they went to AOL and said, "No, no, you can't do that."
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   They offered them a billion dollars, took a 5% stake in America online.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Google now is a 5% owner of AOL.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   And this is where I get a little hanky about the whole thing.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   They also are giving AOL pride of place in their ads.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   They're going to, you know, I'm worried that a little bit of a sellout.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Do you think that Google might now be a little bit more interested in promoting AOL links?
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   Guess not.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Hello.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   I've been trying to figure this story out, and I haven't really come to any conclusions like that.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   I mean, there's, you know, for one thing, you know, getting a piece of AOL and people switching
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   from one search engine to another and all this kind of, it seems like a lot of politics here,
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   you know, and the fact of the matter is if you're going to be using a search engine
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   in your, unless somebody has a better search engine, I don't know why you'd swap out of Google.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Well, tell you why you'd leave Google if all of a sudden Google's results were tainted by partnerships they'd made.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   I don't think it's going to happen.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   They wouldn't do that.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   I actually think it makes sense.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   How so?
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   I think that AOL's new entries into like the multimedia content of the world, entertainment content,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   a lot into music.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   They did the live 8 and all that, making a big push in that direction.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   And that's sort of an expansion area that makes a lot of sense for Google.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Do you think AOL's reputation is starting to be buffed up a little bit by this relationship
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   with Google doing things like Live 8.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   They're no longer seen as kind of the newbie internet service, but really more of a big player in content?
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   I think it's going to be a slow switch that way.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Well, also...
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   We'll really have an opinion about AOL.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Well, how's AOL Radio doing?
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   I think it's doing very well.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   They say they have 10 million uniques, of course, we're part of AOL Radio, and we should just claim that right up front.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   They broadcast this show on their podcast channel and give us bandwidth and return.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   No money, but bandwidth.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   You might also wonder what Microsoft was offering AOL to carry MSN in lieu or in favor of Google,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   because we know that Microsoft's got a big concern for the growth of Google and what's happening in the future.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   So, you know, Gates may have been offering AOL something really substantial.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Washington Post says they were offering hundreds of millions of dollars, but, you know, certainly Microsoft could have given them a billion.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   I mean, why not?
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Does anybody else but me find it pathetic that Microsoft has to pay people off for them to use a search engine?
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Well, I think really it was an AOL's party must have been a bluff, because certainly they couldn't have wanted to shift from Google to MSN search.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   Their users wouldn't have been happy about that.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   I think it was a bluff, you know.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   They're really getting out of that whole walled garden thing, and so they're making their move into, like, they need this money.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   They're going to get all this free ad dollars to promote all of their new sites that are going to be launching over the next year.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   So, it just makes sense for AOL.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Yep.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   And to have prime placement on Google now as a result.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   I mean, that's super valuable.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Oh, I think it's a very good deal for AOL.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   It'll be hard to...
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   What could Microsoft...
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   I mean, obviously Microsoft could offer more money, but what else could they offer compared to what Google's given them?
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   I think it's just a good deal for AOL.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Yep.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   You know, maybe Microsoft should spend most of its time and money improving its search engine.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   Does anybody think that's a possibility? It's like a really good idea.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   I think they're doing a lot of R&D on the search.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   I mean, I've seen a lot of stories saying MSN targets Google and...
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Dad, there's a lot of talkin', you know, and I see a lot of talk, but I don't see much action.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   And I'll tell you why I say that is because I really monitor the vorac.org/blog to an extreme.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   And I see those robots when they come through, and I count them up, and I look at robots coming through,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   and by far Google hits the site, and the other sites that I monitor,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   by a factor of 10 over MSN, and then the second place is Yahoo! Not even MSN.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   I don't even know what Yahoo's doing, but they come by about 1/3 as much.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   I think that's fair. I think it's Google number one, Yahoo number two, and everybody else far behind.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   Well, and Microsoft likes to buy things that they can't create, or they're very slow to create things.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   So it makes sense that they would throw money, which is what they have,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   to compensate for what they don't have, which is a really contemporary search.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   They may in 10 years, but there's no way to cheat that.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   I mean, there's no way to fake having a good search the way they are able to fake having good anything else.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   Well, there may not be a way to cheat it, but they could at least put their bots out there, or increase the number of 'em.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   I mean, they could do that.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   Well, I think they're doing some really interesting stuff.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   If you go to sandbox.msn.com, they have their search results clustering stuff, their new start.com,
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   which is like the Google IG killer, and there's a few different things on their little tools
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   that they've been starting to slowly roll out.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Have you played with the live.com? Microsoft's new start page is kind of like the start.com.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   What do you think?
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   I played with live maps.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Yeah, I think there's some interesting stuff, but it all feels like it's following on.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   It doesn't feel like it's innovative. It feels like, well, let's do something like Google.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   It's like 1999 portals all over again, just now you can move the content around.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Yeah, it's with Ajax.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   Well, here's an interesting question. Do you use Google or do you use Yahoo?
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Does anybody move to Yahoo?
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Why would you move to Yahoo? You'd move from Yahoo?
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   Some people are saying Yahoo's doing a better job.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   In fact, we were talking about that the other day.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   You got to put dark glasses on to go to Yahoo's page.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   I mean, it just jumps. You can't find anything. It's just a disaster.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   But I do know from, actually from a friend of mine who's spoken to Google engineers that they believe
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Yahoo produces better results than their own search.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   So what you need is something that scrapes Yahoo's search and gives you the results in a clean page.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   What do you use, Woz?
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Google.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Yeah. It's just so clean.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   It's real straightforward. I got it.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   He uses a laser.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   [laughter]
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   Have you seen the new, has anybody tried the new Yahoo mail beta?
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   It looks really cool.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   Isn't it slick?
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   Yahoo bought Oddpost about a year ago, which it was sad to me because Oddpost was the coolest
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   internet mail. They were really duplicating Microsoft Outlook's user interface using very slick DHTML and CSS.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   Finally, Yahoo has come out with the new interface.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   I think if anybody was a Yahoo mail account, should be able to sign up for it, even a free account.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   I've been playing with it. It's great.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   Is it a little slow for you to load?
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   I only played for it with it once, so I haven't gone back in.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   When you're doing all that Ajax stuff, you've got to preload a lot of stuff.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Well, talking about Ajax, has anybody looked at Protopage?
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   Yeah. Isn't that cool?
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Well, I don't know if it's cool or not. I've been looking at it. It looks like it should be cool.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   It is cool. In fact, it's a nice tie, and we're going to interview the founder and creator Protopage.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   It's just a two-person company on inside the net on Tuesday, so you can hear the interview with Andre.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Protopage.com. I mean, this is like the ultimate Ajax. You've played with it. Yes, Kevin?
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Yeah, I played around with it a little bit.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   The idea is you could use it as a way of creating your own homepage or sharing it with other people.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   There are people who use it. There's a husband and wife, Andre, who used it to pass notes to each other, like shopping lists and things like that.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   You can also put RSS feeds in it and your own backgrounds. It's pretty cool.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   Does anybody remember desktop.com from Wayback?
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   I vaguely do.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   It was just like this, just like Protopage, but it was way back before the Ajax Times.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   Well, you know, what is Ajax besides DHTML, which Microsoft was promoting six years ago?
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   I mean, isn't it just DHTML?
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   Well, it's like asynchronous JavaScript. It's an easy way to pull live content without having to refresh the page.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   That's what DHTML was. The idea was there's content that you can open up as a window without rebuilding the page.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   I mean, I don't think it's... Unless there's something I'm missing.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   I don't see that it's anything new. It's just they gave it a name.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   I made it sexy and it's not Microsoft.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   And all the browsers now support it, so it's...
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   Well, that's true.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   That was the big problem with DHTML. It was Internet Explorer only, really.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   You know, during the era when Bill was first getting busted by the government, I ran into him and chatted with him about that a little bit.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   But he brought up this DHTML thing.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   Yeah, about '97 or '98. This was Microsoft's voice.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   It was like a big deal. He made the comment. I was kind of baffled by it.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   He says, "Yeah, I think this is the future of the Internet. Blah, blah, blah."
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   I'm thinking... I think he's thinking about XML and he just got mixed up, although Bill's not the type to do that.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   He usually doesn't, you know, just start talking about one thing while really meeting another.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   And to this day, I've been kind of baffled by it because the trend really has been toward XML in regards to the net, generally speaking,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   not necessarily in terms of this kind of thing where you're moving stuff around.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   And the whole DHTML thing just kind of died on the vine, I thought. Does anybody see it differently?
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   That's kind of what you're seeing here. You're seeing a combination of JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets, HTML 2, and there is XML in it as well.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   And that's kind of what Ajax is. I mean, I'm sure a developer will say, "Well, no, DHTML was this and not that."
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   But it's very similar. And in the effects or so. Remember, there were DHTML games.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   People have written games in DHTML. Right. I do remember that. I think we should have some out there.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   And there's the whole Ajax thing easily cross-platform. Does it run on all the current browsers?
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   All the browsers, yeah. Cool. There is no such thing as Ajax, though. I mean, it's really a hodgepodge of web technologies that somebody just decided to label.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Right? Kevin? Yeah, you're absolutely right. You're working with it more than anybody I know.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Yeah, but the funny thing is, like, all the sites that I see that are just Ajax sites now, the big push is like you see people, you can move windows around or you can, you know, something flashes and does something crazy.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   Like Google IG or Microsoft Star. Yeah. I think we're going to see that for a while. But, I mean, the true, the balance that you have to find as someone that's building a site is that mixture of actually value from the tool that you're creating and not just about, you know, being able to move around a window just because you can.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   And just never see anything right now. That's proto pages. All G is in very little content. It's just a, it's a cool use of Ajax. But it, when it cool, hey, speaking of Bill, he's the person of the year, Bill and Melinda Gates and Bono are Time Magazine's 2005 Persons of the Year.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Bono! You got to see the picture of Bono looking very, you know, he's got the shades. He's looking very cool and kind of angry.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   He's looking creepy. He's looking like a derelict. And then there's Belin Melinda standing there next to them. They all have a globe. It's a very weird and on the cover of Time Magazine, Bono's in between Bill and Melinda. She doesn't look happy about it.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   So I don't know. It's a weird trio. The idea is that they all have done a lot to promote philanthropy.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   It's kind of interesting because usually, usually Time Magazine picks the people that have had the most inches in the news that year. And this time it's sort of like it's more on an ultra, the people have been the most altruistic.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Yeah, it's an unusual kind of choice on their part. And it's a weird combination to bring the Gates's together with Bono.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Of course, you remember the time that Steve Jobs was supposed to be Man of the Year, but they did their interviews and decided he couldn't be, so they made it a machine of the year.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   That's right. The computer was the machine. Why couldn't Jobs be the man of the year? That was '82, wasn't it?
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   Yeah, the interviewer Mike Moritz talked to all these people around the valley that knew Steve Jobs and basically told me he just came up with negative story after negative story.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Can't be Man of the Year. Well, you should have been. I mean, you invented the darn thing. Make you the man of the year.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   That should have been a real challenge finding bad stories about Steve Jobs.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   I think the other side was still trying to go to school anonymously.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   That's right. You were being rocky. What was your code name?
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   Rocky Raccoon Clark and I have it on my diploma from Berkeley.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   You may have seen this in Andy Herzfeld's got that great folklore.org website where he's putting together just stories after story about not just the Macintosh team but the Silicon Valley in general.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   But there's a new story there in 1984 in which he said that the Apple board hated the 1984 commercial when they first saw it. They didn't want it.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   This is so funny because I was so unpolitical. Anything in the company had to apologize. I wouldn't be near.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   I had no idea what the commercial would mean to board members. I didn't really know what real board members were.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   But Steve called me over one night and showed me the ad. It was just shocked by the science fiction, the drama appearance of it.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   Wow, that is so incredibly great. We're not going to show it. Our board doesn't want to show it.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   I said, "Why?" He said, "Well, it costs $800,000 to show it on the Super Bowl."
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   I said, "Well, I'll pay half of it if you will." I just thought it deserved to be shown.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Did you or did they finally relent? No, they changed their mind.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   But I had no idea. They didn't like portraying business people in a bad sense.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Was the problem. Oh, is that it?
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   What did they think about the next year's commercial where they had the same geeks walking over the cliff?
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   The IBM Lemmings.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   Unfortunately, after a huge success of the commercial and free air play on all the news shows and things like that,
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   they approved the Lemmings of it. I thought that was just awful and sick. I just sat there.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   I agree with you. It wasn't a great piece of science fiction of film work.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   No, that was insulting. I thought the other one wasn't insulting in the least.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   I thought it was just fantastic. It got more free airtime than any other ad in the history of advertising.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   The 1984 commercial was really more of what our minds are and not insulting to real people.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   Right. Right.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   They only aired the ones in the Super Bowl and then once before that to qualify for the Clio Awards.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   Did they ever air again?
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   I don't think so. I think I heard that it went five times up for real,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   as well as the one that was in the year that got qualified for the Clio.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   Very, very expensive. Yet, I think they got their moneys worth.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   People still watch that ad. In fact, there's a great podcast that's bringing back old Apple ads and all sorts of stuff.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Lots of video and it's on there. Have you seen that podcast Steve? I think it was. You might enjoy it.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   It's just a bunch of old, like they have the old Dick Cavitt ad for the Apple II.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   It's just fun to see all those old things.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   I haven't seen that. I've got my own collection of Apple ads though.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   That's true. You probably don't need to see it. You've got them already.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   Yeah, this is a great... If you've never seen Folkload.org, Andy Herzfeld has done a great job of just bringing back some great stories.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   This one is in there and you confirmed it. It's a true story.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   Well, a great thing about that book is the stories were really written by the people who were developing the Mac as they developed it.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Right.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   And their impressions, their memories and others, comments on this that add a little bit of features.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   Even a person that's working on something doesn't understand part of a suggestion that went into it.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   And then you get that cleared up. It was a great book.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   You know what? You're going to interrupt in that.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   Herzfeld is at Folkload.org is an excellent site if you want to hear some of these old stories.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   But I don't understand the nomenclature here. This is not folklore.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Andy means so stretch of the imagination.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   It's a true story.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   Yeah, it's essentially written oral history.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   But I mean, it's folklore. I think he should go look up folklore in the dictionary before, you know, because he's related to change the name now.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   He's probably the only domain name he could get.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   He's a programmer.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   He's a programmer, not a writer.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   And Susan Care put a lot of effort into the look and feel.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   And it really is nice. They have a kind of needlepoint logo.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   And I like it.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   And it's just fun to read these stories. And yeah, he did, I forgot to mention it as you did.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Well, as he turned it into a book.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   But the site continues and is getting bigger all the time.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   Speaking of books, I have not a biography coming up next fall.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   Yeah, Gina will be mad if we do not plug this.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   You worked with Gina Smith to create this memoir. What's it called?
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   It's got, well, I'm not going to say it has a name yet.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   It has a name, but I'm not happy with it.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   Is Gina Smith, is Gina Smith still in the country? I haven't heard hiding her hair from her.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   That's just a joke because I know she's going to hear that.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   She's been promising to do the show in a sense.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   I cannot tell you how many days I had to go down and to interviews into a microphone to get it into my voice.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   And then we had transcripts and worked on those editing them.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   And we had to go for every word and every paragraph and change them to get them accurate technically, accurate in time, accurate for what they said.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   So I wouldn't look like too much of a dummy.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   But I went through a period of like three months where I could only do one thing a day.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   I was on some drugs for a ruptured disc and could only, I was sleeping 18 hours a day.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   Oh, man.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   I would get on my segue and ride an hour down the road to Campbell.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   We'd meet at a restaurant, work for a few hours, and then I'd come back home.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   I'm impressed.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Day after day.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   And it was a long job.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   It will be a must read.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   I'm sure for everybody.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   You said it's not going to be out till next fall?
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Well, I think that's how long it takes.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   We turned it in in November.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   Wow.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   Wow.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   It's a long time.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   So, the segue caused the ruptured disc.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   Actually, I think that it was lifting a segue into my truck caused it so I use a ramp now.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   Yeah, don't lift.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   I knew those things were dangerous the first time I saw them.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   Trouble.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   It smells trouble.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   Listen.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   I, the New York Times said, "I am the Wayne Gretzky of Segue Paula."
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   And it's really because I was so clumsy at first.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   I was so clumsy at first.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   I would accidentally bump into people.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   I couldn't control my position that well.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   And they just, it seemed like I was the rough player.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   The Wayne Gretz.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   But I push, but I push the rules to the limits.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   It's like they, when a guy was just about to shoot him, he knew our goal and just about
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   to shoot a goal, I would throw my mallet out of my hand, under the ball and mess up a shot.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   And they made it legal for a while, but about the third time I did it, they made that one
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   illegal.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Real quickly, other stories.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   Warner Shephell has issued an apology.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   Thank goodness.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   This is the, you know, the music publishing site company that shut down a pair lyric.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Have you used a pair lyric?
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   It's very cool.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   But it's sad because the guy who wrote it had to pull it off because the music industry
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   said, "You can't."
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   This thing didn't even have lyrics in it.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   It was just a search engine.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   When you played a song in iTunes, it would look up the lyrics for you and display them
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   on the screen.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   And he got, he got ceased and desist out of business.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   And now they're apologizing.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   They sent Walter Ritter as the guy.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   They sent him a letter saying, "The goal of our letter to pair works was to gain assurance
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   that the pair of lyrics operated according to copyright principles.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   However, in both tone and substance, the letter was an inappropriate manner in which to convey
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   that inquiry.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   They apologize.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   Well, what are the results?
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   No.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   I've never heard this.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   He's got a 10 on the reason meter.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   Well, the irony is, yeah, okay, they're not going after Walter because everybody paid attention
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   to that and we mentioned it and so forth.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   But now they are going after other lyrics sites and they are pulling them down.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   They're saying they're commercial because they have Google ads on it and they're trying
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   to get these guys to stop putting up lyrics sites.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   Don't they get that this sells music?
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   Well, also you have a right to memorialize something.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   You hear, you have a right to record a song that you hear.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   Well, good luck.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   You're hearing the lyrics.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   So why would they force somebody to type them down if they're going to make it illegal
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   to listen along with the song?
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Along with the song.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   It really should have been an MP3 tag.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   It should have been the lyrics.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   There is an MP3 tag for lyrics.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   You can put lyrics in.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   I'll tell you, I think it sells records.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   If I hear a song on the radio and I can't figure out what it is, I'll enter the lyric
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   into the Google and find the song name and buy the song.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   Why are they upset about this?
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   Well, if it was non-commercial, would they have a problem with it or is it just the fact
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   that they have Google ads and they're making money from it?
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   That's exactly what they say.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   They say we're not going to pull down the non-commercial sites.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   We're only going to pull in sites with Google ads.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   What difference does it make?
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   Nobody makes money on Google ads since.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   I doubt people are making a lot of money.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   It's certainly, what do they want to license the lyrics?
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   What is the deal?
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   It's crazy.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   At least we've got one apology out of the music industry.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   We'll never get another one, but enjoy it while you got it.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   You have a right, Woz, to write, to memorialize something you hear.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   What does that mean?
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   Well, this basically goes back to the Sony lawsuit.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   If you watch a TV show, you have a right to record it for personal reasons.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   Now, of course, you may not have a right to decode digital television, but you have a
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   right to point of a camcorder at your TV set and record it just to keep a memorabilia
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   around.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   You saw it.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   If you hear it on a radio station, you can record.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   You always could record it for your own personal keeping.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   Now, making money off that, of course, means you're making money off of somebody else's
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   work and they do deserve a cut.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   Although how much money are they making?
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Ironically, Google is moving into this space.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   Now, I think I'm wondering if the music industry is saying we want to clear the way for Google.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   This is an added music listing feature to the search engine.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   Google making money on it, believe me, you can buy the songs and so forth.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   Including the search by Lyric, but I don't think that sites up yet part of that service
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   is up yet on Google.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   No.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   I wonder, will the music industry go after Google or will Google have to pay license fees?
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   You know, Google's got lots of great things about Google nowadays.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   They've got deep pockets.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   They can fight these guys better than anyone.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   Yeah, that's a little different going after some guy who writes a shareware program.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   It probably makes 10 bucks a day out of it than going after Google.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   If he makes that much, then the other thing is, these guys are big tough guys, but they
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   would, I'd like to know why they're not in Malaysia right now.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   You know, in Kuala Lumpur, busting those guys that have the real piracy operations.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   They haven't got the nerve to do that, but they'll take on college kids.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   The guy who invented the Walkman has been fighting with Sony for 20 years over this.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   He finally got an apology and a payout from Sony.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   And of all things, would you believe he's a Brazilian?
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   He's a Brazilian.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   He was a young Brazilian kid.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   You want to tell the story, was?
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   Sure.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   He developed, he thought about making a portable music device, and he did.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   He remembered being with his girlfriend, Switzerland, and exactly where they were on a snowy day,
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   and he pulled it out, and they both listened to music, and they had really brought portable music to the world,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   portable stereo music.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   And he, I guess, when after Sony, in a few countries where he had patents, he got one deal from Sony that was so ridiculous.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   It was only on certain models of Walkman's only sold in Germany, but yes, he kept it up over the years.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   They put him $3 million in the red, and eventually kept it up, and now he's got a deal, and they aren't disclosing the terms of horse.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   As an inventor, I'm sure you're sympathetic to this guy, but you got to, I mean, he's even, this guy's even said, you know,
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   I basically wasted my life, I try to keep other interests up, but this is my whole life has been spent in this litigation.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   And it was not his intent.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   It's not what he wanted to do.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   And I kind of feel bad on the one hand, and wonder maybe if he should have just given it up, I don't know.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   What would you have done?
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   Hey, you have a choice, but you would really have a choice.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   And you know what, there's a book that was put out by the Lemelson organization based on another inventor,
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   and it's got story after story about people that won the Lemelson prize like Dean Kamehain, inventor of the Safeway.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   And almost case after case after case, they had to go through a lawsuit to finally get their due out of a...
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   Really?
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   ...in the event.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   Really? So it's not uncommon at all then?
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   Not for a lot of the big ones that get found by a small person, and how do they take the credit for it.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Right. I mean, it's hard to fight Sony, but you know, the guy did. So good news.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   So I'm floating around and I found a very interesting program.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   I'd like to get some feedback from you guys, not necessarily now, but over the next week or so.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   Has anybody taken a look at it or played it with rightly?
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   No, what is it?
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   It's www.rightly, like right, you know, like as in pinwriting, rightly.com.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   And it's a online word processor that's actually quite astonishing.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   I never thought that these things would ever work because, you know, the idea of doing a word processor online,
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   I would say there would be a lot of lag issues and other kinds of problems.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   But this little product, which is done here in the Bay Area, it's an online word processor.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   It creates doc files. You can upload things into it and you can use it as your word processor.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   It's like, seems to me to be like maybe an entryway to different kinds of portable computing or thin clients or whatever.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   It's quite interesting. I want everyone to look at it and tell me what you think.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Yeah, I'm looking at the page and I mean the UI looks extensive just like what you have in front of you.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   And it looks like it does HTML and, you know, complete control of fonts and so forth.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   This stuff has to scare Microsoft. I see the wheelies out of Microsoft.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   I'm sure that this is exactly the kind of thing their web services terrifies them because you can put whole application suites online.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   Who needs Microsoft Office?
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   Well, when they worked this smoothly, I'd have to say that. I mean, I was skeptical about this because we were promising this during the initial .com boom in the late 90s.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   It's kind of, you know, Scott McNeely, the biggest, you know, BS or about this stuff.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   But, you know, using Java and some of these other technologies that were just so slow, it was like impossible to do.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   And we also didn't have the connections we have today. And I was playing with this.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   I think the office is a good example. It was Java-based and it was slow. It was painful. The idea seemed good.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Yeah, but this thing's really snappy. I was shocked by it.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   Well, and it looks like it's collaborative because there's a little tag at the bottom that says "Sass!"
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Also editing this document.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   Right. You can do multiple, you can put a whole group, kind of a collaboration group together over the net and use the new user system, which is really valuable.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   Wow.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   Maybe we should dump delicious and use this for our news instead.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   You know, it might be better.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   We're working under a handicap, folks, because for the last few episodes we've been using Delicious as a repository for all our news tags.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   And Delicious went down today. In fact, Kevin, you were talking with Mr. Delicious, right?
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   Yeah, I spoke with Josh. He said hopefully in the next few hours it'll be back up.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   Who's blaming MySQL for it?
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   Yeah, there's some problems.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   That's kind of tough. I mean, I'm starting to get a little taste of it just running my own servers for Tuit and my other stuff.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   And in the past I've always used somebody to run the servers for me.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Now that you're running the servers for Dig, this is kind of something people don't really talk about.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   Keeping those servers up is non-trivial.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   It's definitely tricky.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   I mean, we run into problems all the time.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   You know, when you have a master and multiple slaves all trying to work together, there's issues that pop up at two in the morning that you won't see until the next day.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   And it's just really weird stuff, too.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   Something that happened a few days ago on Dig is that users were digging stories, but they're actually happening.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   There were negative numbers were showing up.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   And that's because they were actually hitting the slaves that had kind of fallen behind and weren't keeping syncs with the master.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   So it's just like, you know, stuff like that that doesn't actually throw out warnings to you or tell you that it's broken.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   You can't predict it until it happens.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   And, you know, with all sites that, especially that are growing this fast, it's really hard to keep up with growth.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   And I'm sure that's what Josh is going through right now with Delicious.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   Getting back to rightly, this is one of a lot of, I mean, I'm starting to do my invoices online with BlinkSail.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   Backpack is storing stuff for me.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   I'm starting to use, you know, this project management.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   You just see more and more of these web services.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   And I think this is really exciting.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   And you're right, John.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   It works finally.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   Yeah, the thing is, you know, there's still this, we like the Delicious issue.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   There's still this thing about scalability.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   I mean, people talk a big game about it.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   Google's managed to do it.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   But how big, you know, when these guys start getting too big, are they going to fall apart on us?
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   Now, in the late '90s, when a lot of these ASPs and all these companies came along promising what we're starting to see now, which is like six, seven years later.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   Their issue was that they couldn't stay in business long enough.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   And I used to use a thing that was similar to the Palm desktop that was an online product.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   I could get my names and phone numbers online any time I wanted.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   And then, you know, somebody VC says, "Hey, you know, even though we gave you all this money, now we actually want you to try to show us that you can make money."
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   They shut down.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   And they're, in fact, most of the really cool free stuff, all shut down from, you know, bad plant, you know, kind of the bad aspects of the venture capital scene.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   Now these guys are greener and meaner, and they can stay in business, but can they scale?
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   We don't know.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   It's exactly the right, because you don't have the, if you don't, and as Kevin's learned, if you don't have the financial resources to add servers as needed, you just fall apart.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   You would think that with the Yahoo input that Delicious wouldn't have that issue, but I guess it's too new to have taken.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   Yeah, it's one of those things where you also have to plan the site to scale that way from the beginning. Otherwise, you're going to have to rewrite all the code.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   Did you find that to be, I think we talked about that, didn't you?
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   That digging almost had to be rewritten because of that.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   Parts of it did, because it was just a side project at first, you know, and then all of a sudden you get hit with a huge mass amount of users, and you have to rewrite certain queries and things that are slowing it down.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   But I think Google's going to do the right thing, you know, they're planning this whole online office initiative that hopefully we'll see sometime in '06, I don't know.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   They're going to have some tough competition from this Yahoo mail beta. I really like, I mean, you got to try it. It's basically outlook, except it's online.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   It's your Yahoo mail.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   I've heard you tell you about Google Calendar. I have a buddy of mine that has played with it, and it's supposed to be really good and be out in the next couple of weeks.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   Well, and you're right, Leo. All of this has to just be scaring Gates to death, because it's what he's been worried about from the beginning.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   It's the reason he was so fanatical about Netscape in the start as he recognizes that the Internet can move the value from his OS over to the net and...
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   And his apps? Machine independent, yes.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   Who needs office if you can do it online?
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   But I'll tell you, you know, speaking of mail though, I get on Gmail and they made it work with your pop system if you want. And I wanted to.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   Boy, would they make it hard. Boy, would they hide the secret little part you have to put in to make it work.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   I haven't tried it. Wait a minute, let me think. Now, I can get my Yahoo mail, my Google mail on my Blackberry, but I think it might have done auto-discover.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   Yes, you can do it on your Blackberry, but they give you instructions of how to do it. You follow all those instructions and it doesn't work.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   And you have to look up some third party web pages to tell you. You have to set your port to such and such for SMTP and for pop.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   It doesn't use standard ports. Right. Yeah. It uses very unstandard.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   That, which is a problem because that'll be blocked in a lot of places that you go if they don't use standard ports.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   If they use SSL ports, that'd be all right.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   No, no, no, no, where places I go, what I do is for my own server, I use a nonstandard SMTP port.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   And because when I traveled and used port 25, they blocked it. They blocked it. Yeah, they use it in the nonstandard. They don't catch it.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   Right. You know, I kind of like the combination approach that I think these guys are going to have to figure out how to do.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   And I think rightly maybe has a few ways that you can do this. But for example, I used the mail servers that computer time has where I get no spam.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   But he also, but I can use it with any client, but then when I'm on the road, if I'd say I just want to, you know, my machine, break my machine, I'm traveling, that can happen.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   You know, but he also has squirrel mail because everything's I'm. Right.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   Right. This idea of having like, you know, this redundant approach to everything so you don't have to rely on just online seems to be have an appeal to me.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   Well, it does because for me too, because I use iMap, but if their server is down or I can't get online, I can't even get, I don't access my mail. I'd have to, you know, it's gone.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   And that's everything I need is in my email. Email has become the database. How is it true for you guys to? I mean, I basically assume that I can search my email almost instantly.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   And I just leave everything in there. I don't add stuff to my contract book because my address book because I know it's in the email.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   I do the same thing. And that's Google's whole concept with Gmail, of course, and giving us two gigs of never delete your email.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   Two gigs isn't nearly enough. I want to keep 20 years of email. Why? Because it's all in there. My life story is in there.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   You don't want to hear it. I can start at the beginning. I started a small 5,000 watt radio station.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   You know, you can always use pop and keep it on your own hard disk.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   Well, and that's kind of, I guess what I'll do is keep an iMac server but download it to the pop, you know, because then I can use spotlight or something like that to search.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   But you also don't, you're sent mail in there.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   Right. Well, and that's the advantage of having iMac is that when I send the message, no matter what system I've sent it from, it shows up in the sent mail on the iMac server.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   So I can see my old messages. And that was kind of part of the problem. I was using pop mail on four different computers, but they'd get out of sync.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   Right. So what do you do Mr. Gibson for your email?
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   I'm just using Eudora from the old days.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   Oh, he's an old timer. Yeah. I use Eudora. One computer. One program.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   Yeah. You know, I was using Eudora for a long time and it would blow up a box every once in a while. I got tired of it.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   And I found out, did some research on the web and I found other people, some, some, a couple of colleges.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   In fact, where they found the same problem and I've talked to the Eudora folks about it and they've never mailed a solve this.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   Now I assume possibly that maybe with an upgrade or two that, you know, that's whatever this bug was, it went away.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   But I did blow up a box and the box was completely gone. And it was all, and it wasn't, it was pop mail.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   So I mean, I don't get it personally. You mean a mailbox or your computer, the mailbox?
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   It was on the computer. I mean, and it was just before pre-i-map.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   Because it uses the Unix inbox format, I think.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   Well, it was a database of some sort. It's like debase.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   Well, I never trust a database. That's true. If it's using it.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   I like you. I know Eudora stores everything in a lot of text files and now it's got a good built-in indexing search so you can find things.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   And I use it the way you do Leo, when I'm trying to find something that I know happened a few years ago.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   I'll just, I'll tell you Dora to find it for me and give it as many keywords and a compound search and it does the job.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   Has anybody tried Thunderbird? Yeah, Thunderbird's awesome.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   You like it?
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   I like the extensions. They have like, tabbed, different tabs you can add to it now. It's really turning out to be a nice product.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   Do you use it as an RSS reader, Kevin? No, I use Sage within Firefox.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   Yeah, I think I'm going to switch to Thunderbird for a while. Maybe I can go back to Eudora one of these days.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   I have all these old systems. And you're talking about the 25 years Leo. I don't think it's possible because I have like, you know, five years of mail and some old Eudora boxes.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   And I got a couple years of mail and a Mozilla system.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   And then I got, you know, a new computer. You can't keep copying it over, I guess.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   Isn't Apple's mail supposed to be pretty good too? Built in OS 10?
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   Apple mail is very good. I don't actually use it because it's IMAP support isn't as good as it's I'd like.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   And I'll tell you why. I don't use it. Eudora gives me the ability to make buttons for anything that's in a menu, including transferring to different mailboxes and whatever.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   Line up a ton of these little one quick dozen instead of a drag.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   But it also allows me to do Apple scripts, for example, I can forward an email to my assistant and I cannot do that with Apple's mail.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   It has a ton and a ton and a ton of Apple script commands, but not enough to send a mail only the text, not the attachment.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   You'd think it would. Yeah, you'd think it would. Oh, that's brain dead.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   And a few of the other things that I use scripts for, I couldn't do in it.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   You could just make a call though, right? Wasn't that just happens, right? In the next version?
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   [Laughter]
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   [Laughter]
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   That would be cool.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   I get involved in more important things like making sure my razor phone is going to work with all of us, Tim.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   Do you do a lot of Apple scripting?
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   I do a little now. I used to do a lot.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   It's fun. It's really fun. It's really nice to have that scriptability in the... Have you tried Automator at all?
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   No, not yet. I actually just brought it up and played with it and didn't think, "Oh, no, this doesn't seem to do as much as I'd want."
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   Right. Well, you're probably like more powerful programming languages anyway.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   No. No, really. I'm not supposed.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   I was going to say that Waz and I both came from an assembly language land, and I'm still coding everything Waz in assembly language.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   Yeah, that's the thing that way.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   Yeah, really? You're thinking assembly language? I'm going to watch what I'm saying.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   You think about registers and moves and you never multiply. You just add over and over again. Things like that?
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   No, I like simple... Actually, simple, easy to use for anybody languages.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   Like Fortran basic where one time ago.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   What Waz probably means is that when he's coding in a higher-level language, he's thinking about what the compiler has to do.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   So he writes in a way that is probably compiler-friendly.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   Well, that's old school. I doubt very many people think about the compiler or the assembler anymore.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   Nobody cares. And that's why software is 800 megabytes and can't fit on a CD.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   The irony of software to me has always been the following, which is that if you have an idea to present this, sometimes when I give talks,
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   I said, "Let's say you want to sell something." And you have two DVDs that for sale with software that say the program is exactly the same.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   Both discs do exactly the same thing, no difference whatsoever.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   And one of them is tight assembly language code and the whole thing runs in 50k. The other one is 500 megabytes.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   Which one will outsell the other?
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   Always, you get more... You obviously buy more. It's bigger. It must be better.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   Same reason the computer book publishers want thicker books, not thinner books.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   I'll tell you though, John, my web server has been up for 14,000 hours now.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   And it's running at about 0.7% CPU utilization, just doing nothing, because all the code that I wrote for my site is an assembler.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   And it just sits there and it never dies.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   I thought you used IIS?
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   I do have IIS and I have a custom DLL that I glued to it that does all the work.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   So IIS is just kind of sitting there.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   It's just sort of does the protocol front end stuff. And all of the shields up and e-commerce and everything is an assembler.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   And just takes up no time and it just rocks all up.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   And that's why all your URLs are so goofy.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   Well, now you need to get an artist or something steamed so that doesn't look so crummy.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   I really do.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   No, he's so dishonest.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   He's absolutely right. He's absolutely right. It's really looking like, you know, 10 years ago.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   So, you know, I have a subject to toss out.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   Yes, Steve.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   Well, as we know, Kelly Reclinton is opposing, burning the American flag, but she's also for a law curbing game sales to minors.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   I don't think we have to comment too much on it.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   I don't know. I mean, I don't think it should be a law that you can't sell games to minors, but I don't, as a parent, I don't mind it.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   Did you let your kids, when they were younger, did you let them play violent games?
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   Absolutely. I just believe that everything, that any fiction, books, any TV shows, any movies, why the fiction?
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   I feel the same way. We did the same thing here.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   Kids are fine.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   And my kids are mass murderers. So there you go.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   Some of the weirdest kids never, you know, you keep this stuff away from kids.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   You know, most of the time they reject it on their own.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   Times have changed, though.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   I mean, the video games, I mean, look at Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   It's not only very realistic, but the things that you're doing to people are heinous.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   And I think it's a little different than it was even a few years ago.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   You know, it's disgusting, but it seems to me that the kids just get some sort of perverse thrill out of playing it.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   And they, I don't know that this is increasing the crime rate. It's probably lower.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   It's getting it.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   It is.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   You know, it's like those Japanese offices that have all those punching bags, and you can go to a punching bag room where there's pictures of the bosses and you can punch away at them.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   It gets it out of your system.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   I always said, I see it, but I know it's a movie.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   Right.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   Right. You know the difference.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   Well, I'll tell you the, I agree with you guys.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   And my tone, my tune only changed when my son, 11 year old son said, "Come here. Look what I can do."
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   And he, this is in Vice City.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   He blows some guys head off and the blood spurts straight up, and then he kicks the head down the street.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   And I said, "You're 11 years old. I think you shouldn't be playing that game anymore."
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   But it's also a little bit like jokes and political correctness.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   It's like they have that Japanese prime minister riding the Segway the other day, and some of my friends were commenting, "Well, he can't drive anyway."
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   Oh, geez.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   [laughter]
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   You send your email to...
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   Yeah, it's just, it's just...
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   [laughter]
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   But us.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   Yeah, anybody but us.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   Well, I understand that, yeah, but I mean, most 11 years, I don't know how many 11 years I want to play that game, but...
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   They all do.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   My son did.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   Well, they didn't let him play.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   I don't know. I have mixed feelings about the adverse effect.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   I have strong feelings about the simulator aspects of a lot of these games, because simulators are known to be the way you can learn things.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   Well, they can't have it both ways. If you're saying the simulator aspect works, this kid's got a simulator for beating the hell out of people.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   I agree. My comments always been when somebody asked me about, "Well, I let my kids play Grand Theft Auto."
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   I said, "Well, I don't think these kids are gonna ever steal a car, but if they ever take it up, they're gonna be really good at it."
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   Lots of practice on that car, too.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   I mean, you know, he's giving him a break there.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   At least your kid won't be a network administrator in that case he's out of the house.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   [laughter]
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   That's seriously one of them became just that.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   [laughter]
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   Oh, well, now we know why.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   One last story I kind of want to get into is this Wikipedia story. It kind of never dies.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   Of course, we talked about John Segan-Thawler and his whining and moaning about Wikipedia.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   Now, unfortunately, with all the attention it's been getting, Wikipedia has been getting vandalized.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   Somebody changed Jimmy Wales article in Wikipedia. Jimmy Wales, the creator of Wikipedia,
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   to say that a hit squad from the Segan-Thawler family had assassinated him, which I think is actually pretty funny.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   I'm sure that got fixed right away.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   Ironically, nature did a study that just came out of articles.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   They took 42 articles from Wikipedia and the Encyclopedia Britannica.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   And found that vandalism aside, Wikipedia was very nearly as accurate as Britannica.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   On average, there were four mistakes per article in Wikipedia and three mistakes per article in Encyclopedia Britannica.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   That's pretty darn good.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   The follow-up to that, Leo, is the fact that some people came out of the woodworking and admitted that they wrote both for the Encyclopedia Britannica and Wikipedia.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   There you go.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   The same people putting the stuff up. There's people out there that really like to get accurate information out to the public in any way they can and they do it.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   They do it some obviously, mostly anonymously for Wikipedia.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   I think I'm very sad if Wikipedia goes by the way.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   Jimmy Wales has implemented a number of administrative changes.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   He says, "It's not news."
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   But I think it's news.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   For instance, now they're requiring registration before you can post.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   They're thinking about sandboxing people who are brand new and not letting their posts maybe have some sort of validation on their posts before they appear.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   I hate to see it modified in any way. I think Wikipedia is really great.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   But I guess if these modifications need to happen to make Wikipedia survive, it's worth it.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   Well, you know the other possibilities. Maybe it's already gotten to the point where it has enough critical mass and enough information.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   We don't really need that more stuff to it.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   Shut it down.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   Well, there's always going to be new stories.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   Somebody should spider it by the way as we speak so we don't have to worry about losing this data.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   But save it. That's a very good point.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   But the point is, you know, do we really, I mean how much more stuff needs to be put on Wikipedia?
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   I mean, it's already a great resource.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   I mean, if they just frozen in time right now and started over, it would be okay with me.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   You sound like one of those guys.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   Nothing new will ever be invented.
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   This is the way, this is the, everything good's been invented already.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   And to say that, that's the point I'm saying, I'm saying is that, you know, if they frozen in time right now, as opposed to shutting it down,
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   well, that, all right, I agree there.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   I wouldn't complain about it.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   It's a good news source too though.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   I mean, Wikipedia's news is actually very up to date and very good.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   I'm big stories anyway.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   Do you, was, have you ever looked up your article on Wikipedia?
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   I don't look up my article anywhere.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   I think I did. Somebody did send me the link to it in Wikipedia.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   So you haven't looked at it to see if it's all right or make any changes to make it accurate?
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   No, none of them are all right.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   I don't ever make changes.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   It'd take too much time.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   They've all got mistakes.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   Huge mistakes.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   What I do is I read the mistakes and then I say, that's who I have to be because that's who I am.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   That's history.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   That's your public persona.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   It doesn't take, it doesn't take more than five minutes to fix a Wikipedia post.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   Depress the edit button and fix it.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   Yeah, Woz is reverse engineering himself to be accurate.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   Do you feel that that's an interesting, getting back kind of full circle to our original questions about celebrity?
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   I guess you must feel some of the pressure or the weight of history on your shoulders.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   That you are kind of what history says you are.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   You've given that up, huh?
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   No, I never felt that for ages and ages and now I feel it a little bit.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   You just give it up?
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   Well, what do you mean?
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   I am with history.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   Well, yeah, a lot of the mistakes that are written into history into books.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   Yeah, yeah, just becomes, yeah, it's not worth fighting.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   You've got to give it up.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   Interesting.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   You are with people who want to see you more than you are yourself.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   Yeah, but you know who you are inside.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   I mean, that's not going to change.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   I guess there's two, there's two Woz's.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   There's the public Woz and the real Woz.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   Sure.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   Oh, I never think about anything else.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   There's only one more.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   There's only one me.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   I am what you, I am what I am.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   We are a clone.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   Check under your eyelids for two more gods.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   You're right.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   Oh, anyway, this has been a lot of fun.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   I think we have to do this again.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   In fact, Woz, we're going to be doing the show from Macworld Expo on the Tuesday after the keynote.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   I imagine there will be some big stories and if you knew, of course, you couldn't tell us now,
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   but maybe after the fact you could come by and say hi.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   Talk a little bit about what Apple's got coming out in 2006.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   Woz, how connected are you to what goes on at Apple corporate?
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   Are you still in the loop?
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   I do not try to stay in the loop like what is Apple working on in the future.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   Try to be one of the people that might be privy to some of the knowledge that used to get leaked as rumors.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   I think it messed up the company and it's not in high regard.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   I think if I tried to know the rumors of what's really going on, the secrets, I would know.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   It'd be suspicious, even in my trustable.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   Interesting.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   I don't try to know that.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   I try to keep up with the latest announced products and software hardware how it works.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   I just download a lot of it and play with it as much as I have time.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   What is your business relationship with Apple?
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   Are you on the board? Do you have any relationships?
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   I have a small salary. I report to Steve Jobs.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   I talked to him on the phone once in a while and tell him what I think is not working with some product usually.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   Very cool.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   First, we'll talk.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   Knowing Apple is probably one step away from being sued.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   No, come on.
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   I had to have my one Apple joke in there.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   You think the rumors and all the leaks were actually a very bad thing for Apple at that time?
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   I think the element of secrecy works better for the company in selling its products and having a lot of excitement when they come out and sort of got to have this one mentality.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   Everything from Apple is only brought out if you've got to have it and then also the company doesn't overbuild.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   They build it way too much.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   They have to junk some.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   It sure would be nice to know when the next iPod is going to come out so you could decide whether you want to have it for one week or not.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   The Bikinio?
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   Did you see that? I'm sure you all did see that.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   The Micro, yeah.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   The Enviso.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   The Enviso.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   That's the Saturday Night Live bit that was so very funny.
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   So many funny bits came from the Switch campaign too.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   Did they? Oh yeah.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   My favorite one, if you can look it up, you can probably find it besides the actual real one with that stoner girl.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   My favorite one is the guy who's the Canadian who switched from being American and he talks about the smelly money.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   Try to find anyone out there and just get just a guy that says Canadian guy switch ad.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   I'll put a link in the show notes.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   I'll find it.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   Our money is smelly.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   I never thought about that.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   You know, that's right.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   Steve comes up to Toronto every month.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   It's nice clean money up there, isn't it?
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   It really is.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   Always crisp and fresh.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   Fragrant, almost.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   A lot of it is because they don't use dollar bills.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   They have loonies, one dollar coins and two dollar coins.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   They don't have coins.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   Steve wouldn't have his favorite prank to play anymore.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   He goes and buys those.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   Do you still get the two dollar bills in a big deal?
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   I sure do.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   I sure do.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   One of my favorite lines is you can still smell the ink and that starts them thinking they were just printed.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   Hey, I do that.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   You know, they came out with a new batch of those into about three or four years ago.
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   Another big bunch of, I buy 100.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   I buy a couple hundred dollars with the two dollar bills and pass them out.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   I like to take them to farmers markets.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   You don't do it was does.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   The 2003 2004 series was the latest.
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   I bought them also before that.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   Not back as far as when they used to print the serial number in red ink.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   What I do is I buy them in large sheets of 32 and get printed to cut them down to sheets of four each.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   Put them into pads of 50 sheets each.
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   They look like pads of paper with cards of backing and then perforate them so you can tear them off like green stamps.
[00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   And then they smell like funny money and they look like they have the same serial number on each bill when they come on a sheet.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   And I tell the stories in a way that I get myself a point if a person won't take them because they think they're counterfeit.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   And I lose a point if they accept them because they accept them.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   By the way, the ones that were printed with the red serial numbers were actually US notes.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   They were federal reserve bills.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   And my favorite line with funny money too is these meet the specs of the US government.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   So by law they are legal tender.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   Why would you ever say such a thing?
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   If they were everyone thinks they must be.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   How can you get away with that?
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   You know, I talked to a guy that worked at the printing company or he works with the Federal Reserve.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   So I can't remember the exact top.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   But he said that you can buy what he liked to do as a gag.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   He'd buy a big sheet.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   That's how you do it.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   You can take them and cut ones.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   And he'd bring a pair of scissors with them and then they'd usually do a 20.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   He'd cut a bill out.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   I used to go round lost gatas.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   They only sold months and twos this way back then.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   And I would carry it and pull out a big sheet of twos and unfold it and cut out a weird shaped pattern that had the right number of twos.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   I did it many times.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   But now that then they added five dollar bills then tens and twenties and just recently just this month I think they added 50s.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   I like the pad idea though.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   I didn't know about the pad idea.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   I liked the pad idea too.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   That would be cool.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   That's very cool.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   I'll bring it to Mackerel and show you.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   Alright, bring your pad and we'll get it.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   I wonder what happens when you try to pass one of those through customs.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   They open up your baggage to a sector like this.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   That was pre 911.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   Who would that security have you and jail in a minute?
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   Also known as the secret police.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   No one pre 911.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   I also brought long six inch knives onto every plane ride I took.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   But they were ceramic knives.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   I got all the metal out of my pockets.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   Walked through the metal detector with a ceramic knife.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   And then I would talk about how their knife was dull and I hope the stake is tender.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   And then I pull mine out.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   And the passengers would get a little upset and the stewardesses would say,
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   "Wow, plastic knives."
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   Oh man.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   We've got to put these in a book.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   We better get them off.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   I'm not putting these in my book.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   I'm not putting these in my book.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   Everything's in my book.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   Everything's in the book.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   So look for the memoirs.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   And actually Gina, I'm hoping, I'm trying to get Gina to join us.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   She says she will every time.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   She's kind of...
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   She never does.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   She hates us.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   She loves us.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   She's got a little kid.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   But she'll definitely come to Macworld Expo.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   I'm hoping we can get Gina too.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   This has been so much fun.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   Woz, you've got to make this a regular stop.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   Anytime you're available, we'd love to have you on Twitch.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   Well, this has been really fun.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   Love to be with all such a great crowd.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   It's so great.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   It's John C. Devorak at Devorak.org/blog.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   Always a pleasure.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   Kevin Rose, it's been nice to hear from you.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   Why don't we see you again?
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   Next time you have a Twitter, I'm here.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   Are you?
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   We're doing it.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   We're going to take Christmas week off because nobody should have to Twitter on Christmas.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   Kevin, the Internet is global.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   No matter what country you're in, you could be participating.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   I thought we were doing it live.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   I think the best of Twitter would be good for Christmas.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   I'll do a best of Twitter if I have the time.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   Unless you want to do it, John.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   You're welcome.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   I'll give you all the tapes.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   I can't hear you.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   I can't hear you.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   What happened?
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   Hello.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   You lost it.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   You lost it.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   But December 30th, we're live.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   Kevin, if you can come, that'd be great.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000]   But do keep...
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   I would like everybody to keep...
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   What is that?
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   January 10th?
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   Which is Tuesday of Mackerel Expo open because we're going to do a special event at the Zeeam.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   Seating will be limited.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   We'll have a way of getting tickets to everybody who wants to come.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   I think we can seat about 200 people in the audience.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   But that's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   I have a feeling, I know, Woz can't say or won't say anything or doesn't know anything.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   But I have a feeling there's some big announcements there and I'm looking forward to talking about that.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   Chewing those over as we do in our Twit fashion.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000]   Steve Gibson, thanks.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   We'll see you next on Security Now on Thursday.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   Absolutely.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   We're actually...
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   We're taping on Wednesday, right?
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   Wednesday morning.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   Yeah, we're taping on Wednesday and we'll put it on Thursday because it gets close to the holidays.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   I have to go visit family and stuff.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   Anything you want to plug Woz besides the book?
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   Oakley Razor wire Bluetooth is great.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   One of those and then I thought or once I bought another, you know it's fashion, so does fashion.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   Along with the Razor phone.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   Is you a snowboard?
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   The Oakley store is right next to the Apple store in New York.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   And I got the first one back so I put one on the left or one on the right here.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   I carry two cell phones on me now and I can talk to two people at once.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   Or if I call one person and conferences the calls, I call them from both sides of my brain.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   My left brain can talk to my right ear and my right brain can talk to my left ear and it echoes and echoes and echoes.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   And it sounds like I'm a God.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   And on that note, I'd like to close out the proceedings thanks to AOL Radio for providing the bandwidth for this week.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   And if you can listen to us on the AOL Radio Podcast channel, AOLMusic.com.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   I'm Leo LaBourde, another Twit.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   Wow, is in the can.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:26.000]   [Music]
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   [Music]
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   [Music]
