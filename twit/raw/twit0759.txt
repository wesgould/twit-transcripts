[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.440]   Coronavirus is in the news.

[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.480]   That's all coming up next on Twit.

[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:31.160]   Well everybody, it's time for Twit,
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.760]   the big show where we talk about the week's tech news.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.280]   This week in tech, Lori Gill is joining us.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.960]   Normally Lori's at Mac break weekly
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.320]   but we thought it'd be fun to get somebody
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.480]   with pink hair on the show.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.680]   Managing it at iMore, great to see you again, Lori.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.880]   - Thank you, great to be here.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.720]   - A real pleasure.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.040]   Lori says she sang in her punk band last night.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.400]   So she might be a little horse.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.560]   - A little froggy.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.720]   But I'll tell you why we felt we needed you Lori
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.200]   because we have the pink hair, we have the blue beard.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.040]   And I just wanted to color parody here.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.780]   Owen JJ Stone, who looks like Papa Smurf tonight.
[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.360]   Owen, is that a real beard or is that, what is that?
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.440]   Brillo?
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.480]   - I bleed Twit Uncle Leo.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.560]   This is losing out of my body.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.800]   I can't stand it.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.640]   - Ew.
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.560]   - It's just coming all out of my face.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.520]   - It's great to have you.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.760]   - YQMZ.com.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.600]   And Dan Morrin is here, a legendary Macintosh journalist
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.320]   and podcaster from sixcolors.com.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.160]   It's always a pleasure to have you on as well Dan.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.000]   - Thanks.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.840]   Very good.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.920]   I'll represent the six colors
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.520]   rather than the any colors on my hair or anything.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.360]   I don't have anything.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.760]   - Yeah, we have two and a half colors.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.680]   Something like that.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.000]   Are you located in the, where are you located?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.680]   Are you here in the Bay Area?
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.600]   - No, I'm in Boston actually.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.760]   - Boston, okay.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.840]   You also do a clockwise with our friend, Micah Sargent.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.800]   You do the rebound and conceivable, the incomparable.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.400]   From Somerville, Massachusetts,
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.880]   weighing in at 102 pounds, Dan Morrin.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.720]   - Oh, that sounds good.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.440]   I have my Boston weight back.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.240]   - Great to have you.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.800]   So we were talking before the show.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.120]   In fact, I'm gonna take the interview
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.840]   that we did with Dr. Mom.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.680]   I was curious.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.080]   We know that there are a lot of conferences coming up
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.280]   and I've been reading articles saying the world should prepare
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.240]   because it's probable that the coronavirus
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.120]   now named COVID-19 will be a pandemic
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.240]   that they have not been able to contain it.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.000]   Not a reason to panic by any means,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.320]   but a lot of companies are reconsidering
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.080]   the tech conference thing.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.000]   And so there's a number of stories about,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.760]   well, Sony is backing out of PAX East.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.360]   We already know a mobile world congress.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.440]   Congress was canceled.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.080]   Sony and Facebook say they won't go
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.000]   to the game developers conference.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.200]   IBM has a platinum sponsor of the RSA conference
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.000]   this week in San Francisco has pulled out.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.280]   It seems as if a lot of companies
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.720]   are taking this coronavirus very seriously.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.960]   And there will be, we already know probably
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.680]   a financial hit to Apple and others
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.800]   because of manufacturing issues in China
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.320]   with COVID-19.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.720]   Apple shares dropped 2.6%.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.560]   Although honestly, if you're an Apple stockholder,
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.480]   you're probably taking any opportunity you can
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.400]   to do a little profit taking just because the price
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.240]   is up 80% over this year so far.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.400]   I mean, it's year over year.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.640]   It's amazing what's been going on.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.560]   It's just a temp, look at that blip.
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.700]   Little drop here, but man.
[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.000]   Whew.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.240]   (whistles)
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.280]   You know, Dr. Mom gave us a little,
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.320]   and we'll give you the rundown on what to do,
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.800]   protect yourself.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.480]   The short answer is wash your hands a lot.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.840]   Try not to touch your face.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.120]   If you can get an N95 mask and they are widely sold out,
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.600]   might be worth getting one.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.600]   But Dougo, you recommended the CDC site, Lori Gill,
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.960]   where they tell you which N95 masks really will protect you.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.480]   It's not all will, just N95.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.440]   Yeah, apparently, apparently there's little additions,
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.400]   not just N95, but there's a couple of tag numbers
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.040]   at the end that you want to look out for too,
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.960]   which is why Leo, you noticed it was so hard
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.400]   to find those specific ones.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.240]   Those are really, really expensive
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.000]   if you even have the opportunity to buy one
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.080]   that's come up.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.280]   And Dan, you just said something that kind of
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:41.080]   suppresses me that the carnivales being canceled in Venice.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.640]   Yeah, I think they canceled that.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.360]   And I mean, there's obviously a bunch of other events.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.960]   I heard this morning, I think there were some,
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.240]   Italy has sort of the biggest number of cases in Europe right now,
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.760]   which is one of the reasons Venice is one,
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.440]   and Milan was another one.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.640]   And it's a little surprising because they're both
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.640]   unconnected too.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.200]   So like, this is the thing we're going to see more and more,
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.520]   right?
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.520]   And I think that's what's interesting about seeing
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.640]   how companies react to it is because this is the first
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.280]   example of it, but it's certainly not going to be the last.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.520]   So watching all these companies pull out of conferences
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.200]   and watching cities cancel major events,
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.120]   I think you're going to see a lot of effects
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.920]   from these types of things going forward.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:23.360]   It also is an opportunity for entrepreneurs here on Indiegogo.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.880]   This is just in time for Venice.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.520]   This is Carnival is a plague doctor N95 mask.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.200]   Honestly, if you wore that on the streets,
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.440]   I think you'd be assaulted.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.560]   I just think it looks scary as hell.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.880]   People leave you alone, maybe.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.240]   And that's how you're going to say you're not.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.920]   You're going to be the one assaulting people
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.480]   if you're wearing that.
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.920]   You're never going to have anyone approach you to bother you
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.200]   at all wearing that mask.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.800]   So terrifying at all.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.400]   And by the time you get it, it's probably too late.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.560]   So--
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.000]   But you haven't for the next pandemic.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.400]   For the next pandemic, you'll be--
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.480]   You said, Owen, that you have a go bag?
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.080]   Yes.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.000]   What's a go bag?
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.760]   A go bag is in case of zombies, a pocket lifts,
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.600]   a world falling down, people catching cocoa Venus.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.680]   I have a bag that I could take with me and my kid.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.200]   And we hit the road to our secret bunker to go hang out and live.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:14.720]   Wait, wait.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.760]   You not only have a go bag, you have a secret bunker?
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.200]   I personally do not have a very wealthy friend that has a--
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:21.640]   You're kidding.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.160]   Has one.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.040]   You have an invite?
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.600]   I have two invites, depending on if I'm on the west coast
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.400]   or on the east coast.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.960]   I have two places I can go to.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:29.680]   Can you hook a--
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.080]   Lucky.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.680]   Can you hook a friend up here?
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.320]   You know-- you probably know 12 people that have them.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.640]   You just haven't talked about it because you think it's a joke.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.440]   But I'm sure you know wealthy enough people
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.600]   that they have them out there.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.720]   I've been with Jason Calicanis.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.640]   I'm guaranteeing Jason's--
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.000]   Has one.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.840]   I'm putting that on the books.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.640]   But I'm going to say, if you have a secret bunker,
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.440]   one of the keys is not to tell anybody.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.400]   Well, again--
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.560]   Secret is operative, yeah.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.160]   It's the same secret.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.320]   It's the same thing I say about how
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.040]   come we're not going to Mars, OK?
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.360]   First of all, you need people that are useful.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.120]   All these rich people think they're going to Mars.
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.440]   We're going to go to do tweet and build a new Twitter.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.840]   No, you need engineers, laborers, plumbers.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.560]   You need people that actually do work.
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.440]   So if you find yourself useful, then you
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.840]   could get into a secret bunker.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.880]   Now, whether that usefulness is money or other skills--
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:18.600]   I have no skills.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.120]   --certain skills.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.320]   --anybody would want in the secret bunker.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:21.880]   You got money.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:22.880]   You got a podcast.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:23.880]   You got a--
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.400]   You need a podcaster?
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.520]   You could put in a bunker?
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.840]   No, actually.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.340]   See that?
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:29.840]   I just might not.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.840]   I just might not.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.840]   And you sit here in this separate bunker right out.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.360]   Yeah, you go with the telephone sanitizers
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.040]   and the insurance salesman over there.
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.040]   Wait a minute.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.680]   I feel like we're going somewhere really dark with this.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:40.520]   It is dark.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.000]   I'm scared.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.200]   Isn't this a part of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.240]   where the Earth was populated by the dumping
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.400]   people who were laborers?
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.160]   Good catch.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:48.800]   Good catch.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.360]   You're exactly right.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.440]   Just in case--
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.040]   Hey, hey, I'm just saying, you know,
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.480]   zombies happen, the cocoa venus is out here.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.960]   Even though, like, I don't worry about this stuff.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.520]   Every couple of years, there's something where everybody's
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.240]   dying, and I'm supposed to be afraid where I'm like,
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.600]   do people die in car accidents every day?
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.920]   People out here on heroin and addicted to drugs.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.200]   The world is a beautiful, horrible place.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.840]   You don't think this is--
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:15.080]   Like Bernie Sanders' conspiracy to get all the rich people
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.000]   in the bunker.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.840]   And they say, OK, lock them in.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.280]   And now the world is a better place.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.200]   That was the case.
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.480]   I would say everybody can go to Mars.
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.120]   We just put people on ships and blast pump and space
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.320]   and see what they can make out of them.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.280]   And then, sad to say, the entire population is wiped out
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.080]   by a virus they caught from a telephone.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:34.680]   So--
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.520]   We're going to be just fine, Uncle Ian.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.840]   We survived the plague with no medicine, no technology,
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.520]   no science, no geniuses.
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.360]   We'll get past this too.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.160]   Should Apple investors be worried?
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.440]   I mean, they've had a huge run-up over the last 12 months.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.400]   Warren Buffett sold off $800 million
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.440]   worth of his Apple stock last quarter.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.600]   I mean, certainly he didn't know coronavirus was coming.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.000]   I don't think there's a reason for them to worry about it.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.120]   I mean, and Buffett, it's more interesting to look
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.960]   at how much Apple stock he still owns.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.640]   Still has a ton.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.040]   I think it's billions.
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:11.560]   Yeah.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.320]   And so that's a pretty small amount for him.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:13.760]   Holy cow.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.560]   Yeah, so that's a small percentage.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.080]   Even with Apple revising, it's quarterly earnings.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.320]   They estimated $63 million in revenue next quarter.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.440]   If they missed that and they only get $60 billion in revenue,
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.240]   is that really the end of the world for them?
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:29.880]   I don't think so.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.360]   I don't think-- I think what's interesting about it for them
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.280]   is between this and the relations they've had with China
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.400]   and the problems they've had with that over the last year
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.800]   in terms of the social aspects, I think
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.440]   it's pointing out to them how much of a weak link it is the fact
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.880]   that they've centralized so much in China.
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.960]   They need to consider diversifying their operations
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.600]   for assembly and all of that to more places around the world
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.080]   because they can have a situation where a pandemic breaks out
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.880]   and a whole bunch of their facilities
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.120]   have to get shut down, which could impact their bottom line.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.160]   So I think that's interesting going forward
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.640]   is just trying to figure out how are you going to deal
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.840]   with these kinds of situations when you've put so many eggs
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.760]   in that basket?
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.440]   The very--
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.720]   You've got a lot.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.760]   Like, that's so true.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.600]   There's-- the problem I think that we're seeing right now
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.400]   is that two years in a row, Apple has
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:19.840]   had an issue where being so centrally located in China
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.040]   has negatively affected their finances.
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.720]   A year ago, they had something happen.
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.840]   They talked about how they were diversifying.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.520]   We didn't see that happen fast enough.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.240]   And now, a second year, something else
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:36.200]   has happened where there's too much centralized stuff happening
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.160]   specifically in China.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.160]   And they didn't diversify where they go for supplies
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.840]   and even just building up their people who are buying things.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.720]   So I think at this point, it is starting
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.080]   to frighten investors a little because they're not
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:49.960]   acting on that.
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.400]   They didn't act on it a year ago.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:55.360]   And if Apple wants to make them feel better
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.360]   and make the investors feel a little safer,
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:01.880]   they will actively go out and diversify with more efforts
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.600]   so that they won't have to adjust their guideline.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.280]   If something big happens, they'll just say, oh, everything's
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:08.880]   fine with us.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.880]   We've got things all over the country or all over the world.
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.520]   It's not going to be-- if something negative happens in China,
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.640]   that's not going to affect if tariffs won't affect us.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.640]   Drops in the economy aren't going to affect us.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.760]   That's what they need to do.
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.400]   Have they diversified sufficiently?
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.480]   I guess not.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.640]   So two things about diversification.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.200]   One is hard to diversify when you have a labor force that
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.320]   works for negative money and putting them
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.800]   on other places around the globe.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.680]   So that's the first thing.
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.960]   Finding another place that can make these products at the price
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:41.160]   that China makes these prices at, which keeps your investors happy.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.320]   Second thing I'd like to point out is if you're a regular person,
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.560]   now's the time to buy a couple of Apple stocks.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.880]   And the high-cost subchains of their subsidiaries, OK?
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.680]   Because not only is Apple going down,
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.560]   but the place where Apple gets their chips, their memory
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.760]   cars, their glass, everywhere, all those places
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.800]   are taking a hit because they're losing out right now.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.160]   So if you got a little bit of money to spread around,
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.840]   now's the time to buy, buy, buy.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:06.480]   This would be a good moment for me to say, none of us
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.040]   know what the hell we're talking about.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.000]   And if you make investments based on any recommendations
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.680]   you hear on our shows, good luck.
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.520]   And that being said, I think--
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:20.280]   Apple, in general, is a safe bet again.
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:21.600]   Again.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.760]   I'm the guy who told my dad five or six--
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.120]   went after Steve Jobs died.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.000]   So it was nine years ago.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.160]   Oh, sell your Apple stock.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.880]   Apple's not going anywhere.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.400]   And every Thanksgiving--
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.720]   In the tank.
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.120]   Yeah, Apple's going to tank.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.200]   You should sell that stock cash in on all the money you've made.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.600]   Everything's giving.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.760]   He tells me, and I didn't do it.
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.600]   Ha, ha.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.600]   I think--
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.040]   Oh, it makes great point too.
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.280]   The other issue there is volume.
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:54.560]   Apple makes so many devices, just millions
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.880]   upon millions of devices.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.080]   Moving their supply chain from one place to another
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.800]   is a huge challenge, right?
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.160]   Finding not only the labor force, but also the facilities
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.200]   that are available to produce these kinds of things
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.640]   in the huge scale that they needed to be produced.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:09.760]   That's almost impossible.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.640]   So even to Lori's point, like this being a problem a year ago,
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.800]   a year is not enough time for them to ramp up
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.040]   these kinds of production lines because of the fact
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.120]   that they're so deeply invested in China.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.640]   So it's going to be a gradual process.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.080]   And in some ways, they're unlucky
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.560]   that they got hit two years in a row
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.520]   by these very specific OK events.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.520]   But yeah.
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.840]   We're talking about a $60 billion company, though.
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.200]   I think you can throw money at it to make it go faster.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.200]   I do agree with you.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.080]   To a certain extent.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.760]   But like, yeah, there's still limitations
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.320]   in terms of the factories, just because China has made
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.280]   such a huge part of their economy,
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.120]   creating these places where they can build all of these things
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.360]   and having these gigantic labor forces.
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:53.000]   And other countries have not invested as much in that yet.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.400]   And so Apple can throw money around.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.040]   But even so, there's just physical limitations.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:56.840]   But let's not forget.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.720]   I mean, Apple has done this already once.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.120]   They did it in 2007 when they introduced the iPhone.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.320]   They actually built an amazing--
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.920]   I mean, it's not like all this stuff
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.160]   existed before Apple came along and said,
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.320]   let's build the iPhone.
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.080]   They had to invent machines.
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.600]   They had to create a supply chain.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.440]   This is why Tim Cook is now the CEO of Apple.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.040]   He created an amazing supply chain.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.280]   OK, maybe it took him what, 10 years--
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.840]   probably didn't even take him 10 years, five years.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.040]   Is there evidence to say that they're doing that now?
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.160]   Are they starting to look at--
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.800]   Samsung did not get bit because they've moved their production
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.680]   to Vietnam some time ago in South Korea.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.600]   Well, you also have to figure that people, again,
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.120]   smarter than us, are looking at it and saying--
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.280]   I would hope.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:37.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.200]   Can we weather this storm?
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.080]   What is the cost of building a whole new infrastructure
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.440]   as opposed to riding this wave out?
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:45.920]   OK.
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.800]   So that might be another reason why they're not
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.440]   just jumping on the board and throwing that.
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.680]   Just because, OK, so this wave you write out.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.640]   Yes, more than us.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.280]   But then there's going to be another-- well,
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.400]   not necessarily Owen.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:56.960]   We're smart.
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:57.840]   They are pretty smart.
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.840]   Pretty smart.
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:16:59.320]   Pretty smart.
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.080]   You just called yourself a podcaster 20 minutes later.
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:02.720]   I'm not listening.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.360]   And you told your father, the dumpster,
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.520]   I'm not listening to you.
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.560]   I'm not smart for a podcaster.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.760]   It's a small--
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.560]   It's a low bar.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.640]   I'm just saying you heard of the Alwanine Stein
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.160]   in 30 seconds on yourself.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.680]   We don't.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.240]   Cherry.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:21.040]   So the idea would be, it seems to me, diversify.
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:25.400]   We always say, don't put all your eggs in one basket.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.760]   Samsung is going to benefit from this
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.200]   because they're cranking out--
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:33.800]   I mean, admittedly, it's the S20 and the Z flip.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.120]   By the way, I canceled my Z flip.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:36.960]   What?
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:37.460]   Yeah.
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:38.600]   Oh, Leo.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.320]   Yeah, well--
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.000]   I wanted to see that so bad.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.720]   I was so miffed because I ordered it
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:48.800]   within a minute or two of the midnight Eastern time.
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.480]   And I couldn't get it.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.080]   And then I went into the Best Buy that I ordered it from.
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.240]   They said, yeah, we had two.
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.120]   So two people beat me.
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.160]   And then I said, well, all right, ship it to me.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.920]   And I canceled it Friday because it's like,
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.560]   they still haven't shipped it.
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.240]   You breathe on it and it breaks.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.360]   Yeah, and that's the other thing.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.400]   By the time I get it and review it,
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.000]   no one will care.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.400]   No one will care.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.200]   I wanted that razor so bad and I watched a stress test
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.000]   and a drop test.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.400]   I got anxiety in my heart knowing that I was about to put out
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.960]   $1,500 or something.
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.360]   And if I put it in my pocket and I turned the wrong way,
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.000]   I got issues.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.560]   I got an old razor here.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.400]   I'll sell you for $1,000.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.160]   Jerry Rick, everything.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.200]   I think Jerry Rick, everything kind of put the kibosh on it.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:37.440]   But I didn't plan to take an exacto knife or pointed things
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.040]   to my screen, but it did look like it
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.560]   wasn't the most durable screen ever.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.840]   And then it folds in half so you don't have to worry about that.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.600]   It's self-protecting.
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.520]   Don't talk me into it.
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.920]   No, the outside has a touch screen in this glass.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.000]   And I saw a drop test on it.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.200]   It shattered into a billion pieces.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.160]   And you can't cover it.
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.680]   I can't protect it with something.
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.320]   I mean, other cases for it.
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.520]   They're cases. But more than the case in the box.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.120]   How many times-- OK, 10 years ago, when we all
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.320]   had flip phones, you didn't mind pulling out your pocket
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.840]   and flip it to send the occasional text
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.000]   or make the occasional call.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.880]   How many times you pull your phone out of your pocket
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:12.360]   these days.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.720]   You want to have to flip the thing open every single one.
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.680]   OK, I like you, Jan.
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:16.640]   You're talking about it.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.800]   It sounds so satisfying.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.560]   That sounds wonderful to me.
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.040]   Especially when you hang up on somebody and you go, boom.
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.080]   And then it shatters into a million pieces.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.080]   Here we go.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:26.600]   Here we go.
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:27.920]   Now they know.
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.640]   Get over here.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.240]   That's your bill fold.
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.000]   I love it.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.600]   That's a classic Merlin man.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.720]   It's a Merlin man talking into his bill fold, baby.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.920]   What are we doing out here?
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:39.440]   OK.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.240]   Let me flip it up.
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:40.960]   Look how you flip it, though.
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.400]   You look so cool.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.360]   I love you so much for lying to me like that.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.320]   That sounds so good.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.840]   I appreciate you.
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.840]   So there are a trend forces you to report
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.920]   on what the COVID-19 outbreak could
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.680]   do to tech manufacturing.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:03.640]   Smart phone production, they project 12% decline this quarter.
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.040]   The supply chain is labor intensive.
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:08.240]   So having people out sick, obviously,
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.320]   is going to cause not only a shortage in the phones,
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.000]   but all of the upstream components, like camera modules.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   So it's going to take a while to recover there.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.720]   Several fiber optic suppliers are based in Wuhan,
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.680]   the locus, the epicenter of the coronavirus.
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.160]   That's 25% of global production.
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:31.200]   That could impact 5G because 5G is going to require,
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.280]   in many cases, fiber optics.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:38.240]   The flash and DRAM market know because there
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:42.400]   are companies making them in Vietnam and Singapore
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:46.440]   and South Korea, and they're also highly automated.
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:50.000]   All the robots don't get in COVID-19.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.760]   No, they don't.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.840]   Video game console manufacturing has been heavily hit,
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:58.400]   but next generation production should not be impacted
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.760]   since the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.880]   aren't launching till the holiday quarter.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.080]   And so they'll be time to make the--
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.600]   they don't sell that many of those.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.240]   Smart watches, laptop PCs and smart speakers
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.360]   will see the biggest decline in previous forecasts.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.280]   Smart watches, 16%.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.360]   So there are some sectors that are
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.680]   going to be hit worse than others.
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.160]   But we'll recover, right?
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.200]   It's so, so what?
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.840]   You can't get the phone for another month or two, right?
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.120]   I think there's a coming and going aspect to it too.
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.720]   I mean, when Apple talked about revising their forecast,
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.640]   part of it was not only the production aspect,
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.240]   but the fact that they had to close all their stores in China.
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.680]   And China is a huge market.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.760]   So any company that's doing business in China right now,
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.360]   they're going to take some hits from that.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.480]   And then the question is, if this continues
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:52.320]   to expand more globally, are other cities and other countries
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.040]   going to follow the playbook that China set out
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.360]   and close down a bunch of these stores in other countries,
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.760]   thus killing some brick and mortar retail?
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.040]   So there's definitely a consumer impact as well
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.320]   as just the production side.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.400]   Well, since I've got Dan and Laurie here,
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.480]   and they both covered the Apple space,
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:13.320]   let's talk about whatever this next phone that Apple--
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.760]   the rumor is now March 31.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.840]   Is that credible that Apple will have an event
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.640]   to announce this $400 successor to the iPhone SE?
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:22.480]   Is that a bad one?
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.680]   Yeah, if there will be an Apple event,
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.600]   March 31 makes the most sense.
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.360]   I think they traditionally will have it
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.480]   the last Tuesday of the month,
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.960]   so that fits right into the narrative
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:37.240]   of when they would have it for sure, yeah.
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.880]   And I agree.
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:42.120]   Dan, how much has the coronavirus impacted that?
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.960]   I mean, that's probably what those factors were making.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.440]   Yeah, there's the possibility of that.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:51.280]   I think what's likely is that since Apple already said
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.200]   in their guidance that they'll be constrained on the iPhone,
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.040]   it's likely that if they are sort of ramping this,
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.000]   that there will be short supply of it in the first place.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.320]   There's an open question of what the demand's gonna look like,
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.160]   though.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.480]   There are certainly a lot of pent up demand
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.840]   from people looking for a cheaper iPhone.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:06.680]   And smaller.
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:07.520]   I think that is a Pinterest.
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.880]   Yeah, cheaper or smaller, certainly.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:09.680]   Yeah.
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:13.040]   Yeah, so I think that is a risk because I think
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.280]   you'll be looking at maybe just,
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.520]   it's gonna take more, you know,
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.200]   there'll be a few weeks, ship times will slip pretty quickly,
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.440]   and it will take a little while for them.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.760]   But I don't think it necessarily will push back them announcing it.
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.560]   I think they wanna hit that March date just for not only that,
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.040]   but whatever else they have in the pipeline.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:27.960]   Yeah.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.880]   And you can hit the launch in the pre-order
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.520]   and then get that first wave out like they always do,
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.880]   and then tell you that the next wave
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.320]   is gonna take a month to get to here,
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.160]   whatever they wanna do,
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.760]   but then they can actually judge what the marks are gonna be like.
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.960]   And you gotta figure they were already pumping out
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.680]   these phones before this happened.
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:44.520]   They're not just making these phones a month
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.560]   before they announce them, you know what I mean?
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.040]   So these phones have already probably been in production
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.960]   if they planned on having a March launch on them.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.600]   Right, and they're gonna wanna under promise
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.560]   and over-deliver rather than the other way around.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.400]   Yes, right.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:57.240]   That's how they do it.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.080]   Like the Z Flip.
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:02.240]   Well, I know this phone's gonna sell like hotcakes,
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.520]   not just because it's cheaper,
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.680]   but just because I personally in the world
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:11.160]   see so many people with small phones and annoys me,
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.200]   and I ask them why, and it's just because
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.840]   they can't deal with a bigger phone.
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.640]   And I'm like, you are living in 1980 right now,
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.640]   and I cannot hold this thing in my hand,
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.240]   but they love a small phone.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.640]   So I think this thing is gonna sell like hotcakes
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.360]   for a lot of people.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.600]   It's not even that much smaller though.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.520]   I mean, it's basically gonna look a lot like the,
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.160]   probably the eight, the iPhone eight in terms of size,
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.320]   which is smaller than the 10 and the 11,
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.480]   but it's not as small as the SE.
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.640]   Right, the SE was way smaller.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:38.640]   I don't think they're going back.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.480]   Dan's dad's got my back up.
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.320]   Was SE 4-inch?
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.160]   Yeah.
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.800]   Look at the size of that.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:46.240]   Hey grandma, look at this thing.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.400]   It's so easy to hold in my hand.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.480]   I love it so much.
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.480]   Which model is that?
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.480]   The SE.
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.560]   That's the old SE.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:54.960]   It's so nice.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.800]   Yeah, it looks just like an iPhone 5, doesn't it?
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.400]   I'm over here working with the new iPhone.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.720]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.000]   It has small, so I need something that just,
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.800]   you know, just dominates my whole hand.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:04.640]   It's a phone.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.480]   That's right.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.320]   That's a candy bar phone.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.160]   You don't like the new--
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.000]   Oh, sorry.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.960]   I apologize, my mistake.
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.880]   I wish I had an iPhone eight in front of me
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.440]   to show the difference between the two,
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.440]   because it's like--
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.440]   It's much bigger.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:20.160]   When we talk about small, I'm thinking of that four-inch
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.560]   form factor, so I'm thinking of that size.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.280]   So when people say the iPhone 9, if you want to call it,
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:28.720]   that is the smaller phone, I'm completely in a disagreement.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.040]   Dan, you are right down my pathway
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.960]   where this is not the small phone.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.480]   This is the same size as the iPhone 8.
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.360]   That's not a small phone.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.960]   That's a huge point.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:37.880]   It's like a 4.7.
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:38.880]   It's like a 4.7.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:39.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:40.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:41.880]   It's way too big.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.880]   At some point, you're going to get aged out, though.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.640]   You're going to have to do it.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.160]   No, and that's true.
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.440]   Actually, my standard phone is an iPhone 11 Pro,
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.760]   and I've talked about this before.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:55.480]   And Renee Ritchie is actually the one that pointed out to me
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:59.440]   that that size phone, the 4-inch phone,
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:04.080]   that it can't handle the processors that are now
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.680]   being made for these faster phones.
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.360]   So if you wanted a 4-inch phone,
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:13.880]   you would have to have a series chip that's 3 or 4 years old,
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:17.160]   because that size can't handle that capacity.
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.840]   So Apple's not going to make a phone that small anymore.
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:20.840]   They're just not going to do it.
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.520]   It's to the technology that goes inside it would be too old.
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.520]   Nobody wants that.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.920]   I don't want an iPhone SE that has technology
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:29.920]   from five years ago.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.720]   I want an iPhone SE that has to look like--
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.720]   You want it to look like--
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.440]   You want it to look like five years ago,
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.240]   but work like today.
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.920]   And that's not going to happen.
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.640]   So until technology-- You're the Emily Dickinson of iPhones,
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:41.720]   basically.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.640]   So they say the rumor is that it'll be an A13.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:51.200]   The current A model processor in this new iPhone.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.680]   So they just couldn't make it small,
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.400]   because is it heat?
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.240]   Or is it just physical size of the chip?
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:00.160]   The processor would just burn out the phone.
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.800]   The processor is too strong to handle--
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:03.920]   Too much, man.
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:04.920]   You can handle the processor.
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.120]   The phone can't handle it.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.040]   The phone would just kind of blank out.
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.360]   It would just crash on you all the time,
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.200]   because it could be a--
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.000]   I assume battery capacity would probably be an issue too, right?
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.600]   You need that extra space to fit in those higher power
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.560]   batteries, with power not only the processor,
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.480]   but the screen and everything else that goes in there.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:23.120]   So there is a physical space limitation for that as well.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:23.680]   Yeah.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:27.720]   My hope, though, is that someday the guts of phone technology
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.920]   will be advanced enough that we can go back to smaller phones
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:34.200]   and just have faster processors and stronger
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.160]   batteries that are smaller so that we can have that small phone
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:37.440]   again.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.760]   That's my hope someday.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.480]   It's interesting.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.360]   It's interesting, too, because there was--
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.880]   I think back to the '80s and '90s,
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.400]   and miniaturization was the trend for so long, right?
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.640]   Especially with the advent of microprocessors.
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.240]   And it seems like now we've moved away from that on that arc.
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.080]   And so eventually, we have to wait to get back
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.800]   to the point where we can miniaturize everything once again.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.000]   Well, we're trying to do so much.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.880]   We've got multiple GPU cores in this thing.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.520]   I mean, these are much more complicated chips.
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.400]   And then, of course, there's radios.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.120]   I mean, think about it.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:06.640]   It is.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.600]   That's the thing, too.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.480]   This is a supercomputer in my pocket.
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.400]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:14.640]   But to be honest, they're overdoing it at some point.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.640]   There's no R&D in reverse engineering
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.200]   to make things smaller now, because you're making a phone
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.040]   that's got 16 gigs of ram in it.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:21.840]   For what?
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.640]   What are you really doing on your phone
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.120]   and on a Samsung--
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:25.880]   Everything.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:26.600]   --every thing that you need.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.000]   Everything.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.080]   16 and 30-- no, you're not doing everything.
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:29.840]   I'm doing everything.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:30.240]   What's the point?
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.240]   You're taking pictures of cats.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.960]   When's the time you've edited a video when you're--
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:37.600]   I can have a terabyte of cat pictures on my phone.
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.160]   But you don't, though.
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:39.800]   You don't.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.240]   You bump it off to the--
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.480]   Nobody uses that stuff, but we just keep pumping them
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:44.200]   in the air.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.760]   And I'm like, why are we doing that?
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:46.920]   Because you got to sell it.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:49.240]   And it's just so annoying because why?
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.920]   And greed, and we got to do it anyway.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:51.920]   I'm sorry for complaining.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.480]   But I mean, we don't need this.
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:54.840]   We don't need it.
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:55.200]   All right.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.280]   I just need to tweet and text and videotape my kid sliding
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:00.440]   on a skateboard or something.
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.280]   I don't know.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.680]   It's back to that flip phone again.
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:03.160]   There we go.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.160]   There we go.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.960]   I should have bought the Z Flip.
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.600]   I'm killing myself.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.760]   You need that battery power for your go-back, though.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:10.520]   So you know.
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.360]   Oh, true.
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.080]   Got to have that.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.200]   True.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.160]   True.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.280]   Our show today brought to you-- we got a great panel.
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:17.440]   Thank you for being here.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:21.200]   Bluebeard himself, O. Dr. Owen J. J. Stone,
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.040]   is in the house.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:24.720]   R. He literally--
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.720]   folks, if most people listen, so they don't know.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:32.120]   Just imagine-- how could I describe this?
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:36.200]   It looks like a Brillo pad strapped to your chin.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.320]   And it's bright blue.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.040]   It's twit blue.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:39.520]   Yes.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.600]   Yes.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:41.440]   Only you can--
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.360]   You can press for us for ourselves.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:43.720]   I know.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.240]   I can't.
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.480]   I can't.
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.280]   Laurie Gill--
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:47.800]   Beautiful.
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.000]   Laurie, it's beautiful.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.520]   Laurie Gill, the lady with the pink hair.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:50.520]   It's beautiful.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.840]   I love this color.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:55.440]   Man, I feel like I'm living in a different world.
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.480]   I feel like Emily Dickinson right now.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.360]   Come on, Boomer.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.040]   Yeah, OK, Boomer.
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.160]   OK.
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.400]   Dan Morin's also here.
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.600]   It's great to have you all.
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:08.520]   We do this show on Sunday afternoons
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.840]   with a lovely studio audience visiting us
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:17.440]   from France, from Australia, and some other places.
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:20.680]   I have it written down Milwaukee, from Mark,
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.600]   and a raise visiting from Minneapolis.
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.520]   So we've got people from all over the country visiting us.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.680]   Thank you for being here in the studio with us.
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:32.120]   Our show today brought to you by Zapier.
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.960]   I am so in love with Zapier.
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:38.840]   Now it's got to the point where when I use a new app or tool--
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.400]   first, before I even get into it,
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.400]   I say, do you have Zapier integration?
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.800]   Zapier lets me automate the things I do over and over again
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.920]   so that I can still do them over and over again,
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.720]   but with no effort.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.960]   And man, it works so well.
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.040]   There are over 2,000 apps.
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:55.920]   You can connect with it.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.240]   If you're in business, everything from emails
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.640]   to spreadsheets to CRM.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.720]   Got a home automation system?
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.680]   Yes.
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:09.800]   I use it for our shows all the time to build our rundowns.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.920]   I use Zapier to bookmark, to tweet,
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.200]   and to put it into a Google Doc spreadsheet.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.840]   So Carson could put it in the show rundown,
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.440]   and it happens automatically.
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.960]   4 and 1/2 million people who use Zapier.
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:26.720]   And on average, they save 40 hours a month.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.480]   40 hours a month, they don't have to do anything
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.120]   because they're using Zapier.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.120]   And you don't have to be a developer to use Zapier.
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:34.920]   It's easy.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.440]   Just connect the apps you use.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.400]   Connect your business software.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.560]   If you're in sales, you engage leads, instantly,
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.200]   automatically import new customers.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.080]   You can notify your team about opportunities.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.600]   Zapier is unique in another way.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.960]   It supports multi-step zaps.
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.600]   So multiple things can happen with a single trigger.
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.000]   That's very, very cool.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.240]   Very, very cool.
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:56.960]   You want to try it?
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.880]   We've got a two-week trial for you.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:31:59.840]   But you've got to hurry.
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:01.000]   Right now, through the end of the month,
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.960]   if you go to zapier.com/twit, z-a-p-i-e-r.
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:11.120]   .com/twit, you can try it free for two weeks.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:16.280]   Zapier.com/twit.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.480]   I get an email every month from Zapier, every week
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.920]   from Zapier saying, we save 40 hours.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:20.920]   We've used so many hours.
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:21.620]   It's so cool.
[00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:23.320]   You're going to love it.
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.520]   And don't be intimidated.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.440]   It's not programming.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.880]   It's much, much simpler.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.440]   You can build the exact solution you need in minutes.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.440]   No code.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.720]   No developer necessary.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.720]   You'll feel powerful.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:39.000]   Take Zapier to work and make more time to grow your business.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   Take Zapier home and have your lights come on and wild things
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.960]   happen right now through the end of the month.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.640]   Try Zapier free for two weeks.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:53.640]   zapie-r.com/twit, z-a-p-i-e-r.com/twit with thanks
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:57.960]   Zapier for an amazing product.
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:59.960]   Oh, now I know why I can't get--
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.440]   Carson just put a story in.
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.280]   Now I know why I can't get the Z Flip.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.360]   That factory's closed.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.360]   Whoops.
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.960]   Now I know.
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.520]   Were you just saying the same thing with the clear?
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.000]   I was just saying they were in the clear.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.360]   An employee in the division that's
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.760]   in charge of smartphone production tested positive
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:22.280]   for coronavirus, so they've shut the factory down.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.840]   And this is in South Korea.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.960]   This is not in China.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.800]   Might reopen on Monday.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.800]   Oh, that's bad news.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:33.040]   The shutdown's expected to be minimal.
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.040]   I guess if nobody's buying it.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.240]   That's what I was about to say.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:37.680]   I didn't want to say it because it sounds rough.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.520]   But I'm like, oh, now this is the problem.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.720]   Why you didn't get your phone?
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.720]   I'm like, four people wanted this phone.
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.280]   And they were the four people that did reviews
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:45.600]   and dropped their own concrete.
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:46.120]   I know.
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:46.880]   Nobody bought this phone.
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:50.160]   I was mad because all the YouTubers got theirs.
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.840]   Yeah, and they had to send them back.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:52.520]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:55.840]   I wanted one to keep.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.360]   AirPods, you can't get those either, can you?
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.680]   I don't know if that's related.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.120]   That's just always been that way, right?
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:03.800]   You mean AirPods Pro?
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:04.520]   The Pro's.
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:09.160]   Since its launch, it's just been behind on--
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:11.200]   I don't want to make this in all Apple's show.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.120]   It's apples and viruses together.
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:18.360]   But as long as we're talking, I saw that weird Target Post,
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:22.440]   some Target employee posted pages from a Target inventory
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:28.080]   system that showed a bunch of new X products, including
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:31.760]   AirPods X Generation.
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:32.760]   What do you guys think?
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.560]   When I looked at that, I thought--
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:35.320]   That's fake news.
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.280]   That's fake news.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.040]   Well, no.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.480]   I'm skeptical, for sure.
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.160]   OK.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.960]   I got a fake news.
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.200]   Dan, you're skeptical.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:47.240]   Yeah, I think-- I mean, it's no secret that Apple's
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:50.000]   been working on other versions of the AirPod.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.280]   And they would be crazy not to.
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.040]   Like Laurie just said, they've been back ordered,
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.960]   basically, since they came out.
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:58.440]   There is a clearly huge demand for their wireless headphones.
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.960]   The sales are great, right?
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.480]   So why not expand that?
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:03.920]   Because the biggest issue with AirPods for a lot of people
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.960]   is that they're not the right fit, or they're not comfortable.
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:09.200]   So if they're talking-- there's been a lot of rumors
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.280]   that they would be using things like--
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.800]   Yeah, or possibly an over-the-year set,
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.600]   like more like a studio set of headphones.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.480]   And obviously, Beats makes some of those now,
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.960]   but certainly something with Apple branding.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:20.460]   Right.
[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:21.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.160]   But certainly something with the Apple branding,
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:23.400]   I think--
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.080]   Dye the white.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.280]   --and eventually even just drawing more people.
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:25.960]   Bingo, AirPods.
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:26.680]   There you go.
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:28.520]   So I'm not surprised there might be something coming.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.480]   I don't buy the name.
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:30.280]   That's the other thing.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.680]   Well, and then there were these images following shortly.
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:39.160]   They're after Apple TV Gen X, Apple Watch Series X Band,
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.720]   Apple iPod Touch X.
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.960]   So Laurie, you believe it?
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:47.480]   Well, I mean, it doesn't seem out of the question.
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:50.720]   So I don't look at that and go, oh, this is definitely fake.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:52.960]   I look at this and go, well, on March of End is coming.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:56.600]   Apple always releases new watch bands in March.
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:00.080]   TV Plus is something that they're really trying to promote.
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.120]   So putting out a new Apple TV, just
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:05.200]   in a bumped generation version, nothing special.
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:08.000]   Makes sense to me that that would be called out at the March
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.360]   of End or maybe at WWDC.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:12.640]   Just an update, nothing crazy.
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.840]   And new AirPods.
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:18.160]   So the price on that one is what kind of throws me off,
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:19.720]   because I do believe that we're going
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:22.520]   to see a third generation AirPods coming out maybe
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:24.000]   by this fall.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:24.760]   That makes sense.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.320]   They're just making it a little better,
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.000]   doing little changes here and there.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.760]   That's why we're hearing about AirPods Lite, whatever that is.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.480]   AirPods Pro Lite, which I don't think is true.
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.360]   I think it's just a third generation AirPods.
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:39.600]   But the price of that looks more like an over the ears thing.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:45.120]   But Beats also hasn't put out a new version of Studio Pro
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.400]   with the H1 chip.
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:50.640]   So this could be called Apple AirPods Generation X.
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:54.560]   But what it really might be is the new generation
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:57.880]   of the Beats Studio Pro.
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:00.080]   I hope I have that right.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:02.200]   Their naming scheme is so hard for me to remember.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:07.600]   It's their over the ears Pro's noise canceling headphones
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:08.560]   for Beats.
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.480]   So that could be the new generation that's
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.680]   going to have the H1 chip.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:12.520]   We know that's coming.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.000]   It just hasn't come out yet.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.080]   So these to me all line up with potentially, yes,
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:20.400]   that's this could be what's coming in March or maybe
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.520]   by WWDC.
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.600]   So that's my fault.
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:25.160]   First of all, they're not going to use X.
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.120]   No, no, no.
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:29.000]   I think X must just be a placeholder.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   And it feels to me--
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.880]   I don't think these are like Photoshop.
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:33.400]   It feels to me like they're real.
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.520]   But it's the target inventory system.
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.720]   So we just put in a bunch of dummy entries.
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:43.080]   I said fake news because I saw that Apple logo
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.720]   on the over the ear headphones.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.680]   And I'm like, there's no way they can do it.
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:50.040]   Well, no, Josh--
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:50.960]   He put it right on there.
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:51.960]   That's not--
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:52.640]   It's a mockup.
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.160]   That was when it was a mockup.
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:54.800]   It's just right on--
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:57.080]   He's not trying to claim this was an actual image.
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:01.440]   He's just saying this was the image that I created as a mockup
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.600]   just to give you what I do.
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:03.080]   But I might--
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:05.720]   Yeah, I agree with Laurie that there's
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:07.520]   enough here that works in terms of things.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:11.000]   I think the watch bands, they roll out new colors every spring.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:11.500]   Right.
[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:12.480]   We know they're going to use that.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.160]   I think that makes--
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:13.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.360]   So this stuff does line up well with that March event.
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.280]   The TV one is the one that I have the biggest question
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:19.320]   Mark about because I think--
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:22.120]   although I think Laurie's logic for that is spot on,
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.880]   I think that product is such a weird place for them
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:28.400]   to be right now just because it is so much more expensive
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.840]   than any competing product.
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:30.680]   It's 200 bucks.
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:31.560]   It's roughly.
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:32.320]   Right.
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.720]   And because they've been putting their Apple TV plus app
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:36.240]   on all the other platforms--
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.240]   Including other people's TVs.
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.800]   Yeah, TVs, Roku, Amazon Fire TV,
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.960]   you can get a device that will stream that content much cheaper
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:48.080]   than an Apple TV box will do for you.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:48.640]   So I'm curious about that.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.400]   But now it gets the game system too,
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:53.680]   that with that new gaming 599 a month arcade games,
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.680]   because their last one had a gaming component
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:56.840]   where you could play games on it,
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:58.680]   they might have something that's a little bit beefier for that
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:00.000]   if they find that people are actually--
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:00.840]   Would it be?
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:01.360]   Right.
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.880]   Paying for their arcade?
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.480]   Something with that maybe?
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.040]   Yeah.
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:08.040]   And just like a little spec phone, which is why--
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.640]   it's not a revolutionary brand new product that's cheaper
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:11.720]   or something like that.
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:15.720]   They're successful with Apple TV, with the box itself.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.000]   Not as successful as Roku or something
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   that's much less expensive, but they're successful enough.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.480]   So until they come up with the completely new set top box,
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:29.000]   or maybe dongle or streaming stick or something,
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.480]   they're just going to give a spec book here and there.
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:35.960]   And just kind of say, if you were waiting to buy an Apple TV
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.520]   because you were waiting for a spec bump,
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:38.560]   well, we just gave you one.
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:41.680]   So just go buy that now and start watching TV+
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.080]   and playing Apple Arcade on it.
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:46.320]   It makes a lot of sense to me that they would just kind of--
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.840]   appease the masses in that way.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:51.040]   I actually waited way longer than I needed to
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:54.760]   because I was hoping that they would put out a new Apple TV
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.560]   with even just a minor spec bump.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.320]   And they never did.
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.960]   So finally, in like last December,
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.480]   I just upgraded to the 4K.
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.000]   I had the 1080p one.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.520]   And I just upgraded to the 4K just
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:05.840]   because I was tired of waiting around.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.400]   So this probably appeals to people like me.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.720]   It was like, yeah, let's give it to them.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:12.400]   And then we'll have something bigger later.
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.640]   But for now, here's this.
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:18.400]   Yeah, and if you think that you get a free Apple TV+ year,
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.400]   it kind of cuts the price in half.
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.000]   If that's the only way you can get it
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.520]   if you didn't buy an iPhone or an Apple computer
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:27.720]   or something in the last year.
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.520]   I still yet to watch anything on Apple TV.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:30.360]   It's crappy.
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.680]   Don't waste your money.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.080]   No, it's free to me.
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.320]   I still haven't done it, it's free.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.320]   And I didn't look at anything.
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:38.400]   Yeah, I bought Disney Plus or I got it free with Verizon.
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:41.240]   And I tried to watch Mandalorian.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.720]   And I didn't even get to the baby Yoda part before I gave up.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.840]   Oh, Leo, I don't think I'd be your friend.
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.000]   That hurts me.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.560]   I didn't get to the Witcher in the bathtub scene either.
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:53.480]   I feel like I'm--
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.720]   I have a short attention span.
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:58.440]   How soon does baby Yoda show up?
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:00.080]   Like the end of the first episode.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.480]   Yeah, it's like a half hour episode.
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:01.840]   Really soon.
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:04.200]   Come on.
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.800]   Seriously, I got about 15 minutes in.
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:08.480]   Lisa and I looked at each other and go, this is for kids.
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:11.880]   And we went and watched something else.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.640]   I know, I'm a bad man.
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:17.280]   I am not part of the Star Wars generation.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.400]   In fact, God, I feel so terrible.
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:25.680]   Did you see the Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Deep Fake?
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:26.720]   Have you seen this yet?
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:27.440]   Haven't seen it.
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:28.600]   Have not seen it.
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.200]   Can I-- Carsten is my new conscience.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.080]   No, I can't show it.
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.080]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:34.600]   Who's going--
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:35.080]   It's so cool.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:35.600]   It's so cool.
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:36.800]   Who's going to get mad at me for this?
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.720]   You should describe it really well,
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.280]   because it is so cool.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:42.520]   Who owns the right-- I won't play the audio.
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:44.600]   I don't know who owns the right, but--
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:48.640]   Nobody who makes Deep Fake's is going to take us off YouTube.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:49.040]   All right.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.440]   OK.
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:51.280]   Don't play the audio.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:54.800]   I won't play the audio, because that is owned by Paramount.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.840]   So this is the menagerie.
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:59.640]   So first of all, I got that wrong.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:01.080]   First, I called it Star Wars.
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:02.520]   Then I got that wrong.
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:03.520]   I said that's--
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.640]   I said that's Shatner, and it's not.
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:07.160]   It's Christopher Pike.
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:07.680]   OK.
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:08.720]   It's Jeffrey Hunter, yeah.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:09.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:09.760]   All right.
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.840]   Obviously, I'm with the wrong crowd here.
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:16.160]   So this is a pretty-- now, the audio, which we're not playing,
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:19.480]   is this audio from the actual TV show.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:21.320]   But look at their mouths.
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:22.880]   Look at their eyes.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.720]   It looks-- it's indistinguishable.
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:28.080]   You think Jeff Bezos is the alien with a giant brain,
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:30.840]   and that Elon Musk is a commander Pike.
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:31.560]   It's creepy.
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.080]   It's a little uncreased, I think, that guy.
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.280]   Is this the one crazy thing about this is?
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:34.840]   What?
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:38.440]   They rendered this on a Samsung S20.
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:39.880]   I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:41.120]   You're joking, obviously.
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:41.800]   But--
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:42.360]   I am.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.000]   I don't know.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.680]   Would you know if you saw that that that was a Deep Fake?
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.240]   Not at all.
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.400]   I mean, other than the reality of the situation.
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.920]   I think I could write an article to say many people don't know this,
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.200]   but Jeff Bezos was an actor in his early days
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.720]   and even appeared in a Star Trek episode.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:42:59.480]   I mean, I think--
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:01.480]   Well, there's a lot of--
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:03.600]   Elon's been in a lot of movies, so people will believe that,
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:04.760]   if you said that about Elon.
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:06.620]   The makeup on Bezos makes it a little more
[00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:09.240]   passable, whereas I think looking at Musk, it's just
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:10.560]   a little uncanny valley.
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:12.480]   There's something a little weird about it.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.960]   But I think the Bezos one is pretty good.
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:15.560]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:17.160]   There is something a little odd.
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:21.120]   Of course, humans are anatomy so fine-tuned
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:24.280]   to detect something weird or wrong.
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:26.120]   And you couldn't even put your finger on it,
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:26.920]   but you could kind of see--
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:28.640]   I was just thinking CGI or something.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:29.640]   Something looks weird.
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:30.960]   They just generate this character.
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:34.080]   It's like his face is too big for his head or something.
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.800]   There was one the other day making the rounds
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:39.040]   of Back to the Future, where it was Robert Downey, Jr.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.920]   over Christopher Lloyd and Tom Holland from the Spider-Man
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.760]   movies over Michael J. Fox.
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.480]   And it was eerie.
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:47.080]   It was very weird.
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:48.760]   Can I play that, Carsten?
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:50.320]   No, please, please.
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:52.720]   Let's not push our luck.
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.200]   Let's move on.
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.200]   I won't play the audio.
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:00.040]   Oh, man.
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.760]   All right, well, all right, if you don't mind,
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.960]   I'm just going to look at it.
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:04.800]   And I'll--
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.760]   No.
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:08.720]   I'm going to go get a copy of you while you're watching.
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:09.840]   I don't think the audio--
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:10.520]   Do the audio.
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:12.800]   I don't think the guys that make deep fakes
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:15.200]   are going to give us a takedown notice on YouTube.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:18.280]   No, but I think that that one is close enough
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:22.760]   that I think the automatic movie--
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.360]   So it will be the Back to the Future people
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.200]   that will take its time.
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.200]   Back to the Future people.
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.120]   We'll see.
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:28.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:31.120]   So Robert Downey, Jr. Oh my god.
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:32.920]   His doc-- what's his name?
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:34.680]   Mark-- Doc Brown.
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.000]   Wow.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.920]   The Tom Holland one is virtually indistinguishable.
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:41.200]   Tom Holland looks so much like Michael J. Fox.
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:42.280]   Michael J. Fox.
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:44.960]   Yeah, I can kind of see that it's not quite right.
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:47.120]   So they're getting better at deep fakes, obviously.
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:50.920]   I mean, these are much better than the ones I've seen in the past.
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:52.920]   The technology has come a long way.
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.720]   It's a little-- it is disconcerting.
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:56.840]   And I think it's worrying, obviously,
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:59.880]   in terms of the ability to figure out what's real
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.080]   and what is it certainly.
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:02.040]   Yeah.
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:06.240]   In fact, I went to kotkey.org to see this link.
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:10.880]   And he has a link to an earlier version that's not nearly as good.
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.880]   And so you can see that we have been making progress.
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.440]   What I really is amazing is the lips,
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.880]   because they're using the dialogue in both of this
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:20.600]   and the Star Trek from the original.
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:23.640]   So the lips have to move exactly like the original.
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.280]   And the lip sync looks great.
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:29.440]   But they have to be Elon Musk's lips.
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:33.320]   That's pretty interesting.
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:34.920]   It's disturbing for sure.
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:35.800]   Is it worrying?
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:37.520]   I don't know.
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.560]   As long as you're not famous, you're probably OK.
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:41.560]   Oh, God, wait.
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:42.560]   It's going.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:43.560]   I'm a famous podcast.
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:45.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.600]   I'm not even a famous podcaster.
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.080]   I'm nothing, man.
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.680]   That was the worst kind of friend of mine
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:54.000]   once when I was working at Tech TV said,
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.440]   you're an unknown host on a barely watched cable channel.
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:02.360]   Ouch.
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:03.600]   Ouch.
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:05.840]   Wouldn't hurt if it weren't true.
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:10.640]   EU has passed the bill that says, "Interoperable Chargers."
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:13.440]   And there was some conversation that maybe
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.720]   wouldn't affect Apple because it wasn't
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:17.120]   about the actual cables.
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:21.560]   Well, now it looks like maybe it is going to--
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:22.840]   Apple was fighting against it.
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:28.160]   The EU voted 582 to 40 in favor of a common charging
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:31.480]   standard, Type C.
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:33.640]   So and the reason is, hey, we're all
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:35.440]   buying way too many chargers.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:36.720]   It'd be nice if we could reuse them.
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.760]   And they wouldn't end up in the landfill.
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:41.080]   Apple says, you're going to kill innovation
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:45.080]   because the lightning port is, of course, so much better than Type
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:47.200]   C. Is it?
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:47.920]   No.
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:48.360]   No.
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:49.360]   No.
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:49.880]   No.
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:52.040]   That's the same thing, right?
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:54.840]   It was better than Micro, but it's not better than Type C.
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:55.520]   Oh, great.
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:58.320]   You use much-- anything's better than Micro USB, but Type C.
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:46:59.840]   I mean, I'm just saying.
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:01.680]   It doesn't have that argument anymore.
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:02.160]   So there--
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:04.280]   I think the tricky thing with that too is, like,
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:06.840]   so 10 years ago, you tried to do this with the Micro
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:09.840]   Chargers, and it didn't really catch on.
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:12.280]   They didn't make it a law.
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:13.520]   They did it a kind of an agreement.
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:14.360]   Right.
[00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:16.480]   This time, it's going to be a law.
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:18.280]   Right, but there's also a moving target, right?
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:21.440]   Because Type C will last for 10 years,
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:23.880]   and then they're going to have to mandate another connector.
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:27.040]   So like, putting that in the hands of government regulation
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.760]   rather than the individual filmmakers,
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.960]   I applaud the idea behind it.
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:34.720]   I just wonder how much it's going to be workable.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:38.440]   Like, is Apple going to create a second phone for the Umarket?
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:40.240]   Are they really going to abandon the lightning port
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:42.480]   after all the time and money they spent at it?
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.840]   Are they just going to figure out another loophole for skirting
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:45.360]   this?
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:47.600]   I'm a little skeptical it's actually going to happen.
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:51.360]   That's what Tim Hardwick's contention is in Mac rumors.
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:55.440]   He says, this is just going to make Apple make this connection-less
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:58.680]   iPhone that there's been rumors about that just does wireless,
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:01.120]   doesn't have a port at all.
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:01.520]   That seems--
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:02.280]   Which is horrible.
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:04.360]   I don't think I'm going to have to happen.
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:07.880]   And they've already gotten rid of their own lightning
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:08.520]   cable.
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:11.080]   When I buy my MacBook Pro, I'm not even going to pick it up
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:12.800]   because I'm going to touch it.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:14.800]   Has two USB-Z ports on it?
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:15.800]   No other ports on it.
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:16.800]   I can't put it on it.
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:17.800]   No, I can't put it on it.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.800]   So everything else should just be that,
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.200]   and they need to get rid of it on their own.
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:22.960]   They know better.
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:26.120]   They're just squeezing out because they can charge you $45,000
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:27.800]   for the stupid lightning cable.
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:29.160]   There is a good point to be made there.
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:32.160]   UbeKey sells their dongles.
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:37.200]   I use a UbeKey to log into LastPass and other Gmail
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.600]   highly secure things.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:40.600]   And this one has a Type A connector on it,
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:43.920]   but there's a UbeKey with a Type C and one end
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:45.360]   and a lightning on the other end.
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:47.880]   The one with lightning on it is $40 more than the one
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:51.360]   with just Type C. And then away, that's how you can tell.
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:54.240]   That's the Apple Tax is $40.
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:55.920]   Well, there's an NFC one too, though.
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.960]   So that, in theory, that should work.
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:58.760]   Yeah, that's actually--
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:00.200]   You know, when we're going to wireless one.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:02.160]   Yeah, I have the NFC one, right.
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.960]   I think they'll move eventually because the lightning port
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:07.560]   will eventually just pass its usefulness, right?
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:09.640]   Like, in the same way, I think the issue is like,
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:11.600]   they're also worried like when they abandoned
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:14.720]   the 30-pin connector, it was the right move at the time,
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:17.120]   but people were not happy about that
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:18.440]   about having to replace all their stuff.
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:20.080]   I mean, it softened a little bit by the fact
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.160]   that the USB-C is at least standard.
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:26.280]   But yeah, I'm kind of picturing there being a lot of revolt
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:28.400]   when they decide to eventually abandon lightning stuff
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.160]   because so many people have not only cables,
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.920]   but accessories and peripherals that work the way.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:33.120]   I think it's in the next year or two.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:34.360]   I think they're going to have to.
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:37.360]   And I think now more people are voting because they want USB-C.
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:39.360]   Yeah, blame the EU.
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:42.680]   And I'll be here because I have USB-C chargers all over the place.
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:45.040]   I'd love it if everything was USB-C.
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:48.200]   But to further Dan's point, and while on the win-hand,
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:49.880]   I do think that Apple was still trying
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:53.000]   to protect their proprietary cables.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.320]   The fact is that it potentially could stifle innovation
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:00.800]   because if there's a regulation that mandates
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:03.840]   that phones in the EU have to have a USB-C port,
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:07.640]   why is anyone going to try to make something better than that?
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:10.760]   If you have to do it, nobody's going to invest
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:12.680]   in the research to make a better one.
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:15.560]   They're just going to stick with the USB-C.
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:18.960]   So 10 years from now, I don't even see why anybody would invest
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:22.120]   in 10 years from now trying to make a better port
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:24.720]   because there's this regulation that forces them
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:26.080]   to make it USB-C.
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:29.560]   So I do think that these kind of regulations
[00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:32.560]   to have a negative impact on our ability
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:34.560]   to see advancements in technology
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:37.400]   because money has to get put into researching
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:39.400]   and investing in this kind of stuff.
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:42.600]   And if somebody says no matter how cool it is,
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:45.840]   you can't use it, you have to use this other technology,
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:47.600]   no one's going to put the money in the first place.
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:49.120]   It's just going to stop right there.
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:53.960]   - I believe in the power of man and the power of USB 2.0
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:55.760]   to now USB 3.0.
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:59.920]   And I look forward to the USB-C 2.0 or 5.9.
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:00.760]   - USB-4?
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:02.120]   - It's already been asked.
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:03.760]   And it uses the type-C connector.
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:04.600]   Yeah.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.400]   - Yeah, so they just got to keep the same thing
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:08.200]   and just upgrade it and innovate.
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:09.800]   I believe in that, but I'm just trying to get off
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:10.920]   this lightning cable so bad.
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:13.680]   - I think I would guess Type-C, I would hope Type-C
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:14.520]   as well.
[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:16.080]   - My path goes, USB-C?
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:16.920]   - Yeah.
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:17.760]   I would hope.
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:19.400]   - Well, there's also the, there's the physical engineering
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:22.200]   part of it too though, because if your phone always has
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:24.160]   to be thick enough to accommodate a USB-C port.
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:25.600]   - Well, that samples other complaint,
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:29.000]   but I think I could get a USB-C port on my iPhone.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:29.840]   - Yeah, it would fit though.
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:30.920]   - I would disagree with that.
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:32.720]   - I wonder there you don't see.
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:36.440]   Like if you go to, I fix its rundown of the internals
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:37.800]   of an iPhone, you'll actually see that.
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:38.640]   - I understand.
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:40.000]   - There's a lot of stuff crammed in there
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:40.840]   down at the bottom.
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:42.560]   - But I'm just saying USB-C isn't that much bigger.
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:44.600]   I mean, I'm not claiming not to know,
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:49.520]   but I'm putting my USB-C Pixel 4 right next to my iPhone 11
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:51.440]   Pro Max with its lightning.
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:53.800]   And that's about, it's a little bigger.
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:54.640]   It's pretty close.
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:55.480]   - It's pretty close.
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:56.320]   Yeah.
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:57.480]   - And we all want it.
[00:51:57.480 --> 00:52:00.680]   Like Apple fans want USB-C at this point.
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:03.560]   But those of us that are kind of entrenched in technology,
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:04.880]   of course, my mom doesn't want it.
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.640]   But people like me, we're on board with this.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:09.520]   We're ready for USB-C.
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:10.520]   We want it.
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:11.360]   It's coming.
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:15.640]   We were hoping Apple would do it on iPhone XS, actually.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:17.800]   And we're really hoping it for iPhone 11.
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:21.160]   So with this sort of like regulation in place,
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:22.800]   with the potential of seeing it,
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:26.960]   maybe not in this fall, but in 2021 almost definitely
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:27.920]   seems very exciting,
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:30.520]   'cause we've been wanting this all along anyway.
[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:33.720]   It's just all the rest of the people
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:34.920]   you have to get on board with it.
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:37.040]   Like why do they take away my lightning?
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:39.040]   Or now I have to get a new cable.
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:40.960]   - I want them to replace the lightning port
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.000]   and all the other stuff too.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.400]   I mean, like my trackpad and my keyboard charge
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:46.400]   be like, you know, like that?
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:47.240]   Why?
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:49.880]   - You're Apple TV remote.
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:50.720]   - Yep.
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:51.560]   - Yeah.
[00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:52.400]   - Everything's USB-C.
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:54.120]   So I would hope that C is well enough design
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:56.280]   that it could accommodate future generations
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:57.360]   with having you to be complete.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:59.720]   It's just a physical form factor.
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:00.560]   It's not.
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:04.880]   - Well, look at how long we've had the first USB-A ports
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:05.720]   have been around.
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:06.560]   - Right, those are still good.
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:07.960]   - So, and they've gotten faster.
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:09.640]   So I agree, I think, you know,
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:11.520]   it's not like the end of the line,
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:13.280]   but Lori does have a point that like,
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.280]   if people are mandated to put that on there,
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:17.760]   how much time and energy are they going to invest
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:19.280]   into trying to find the next best thing?
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:20.120]   - No, that's true.
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:21.760]   - And can Apple make an end run around it
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:24.200]   by doing that, you know, totally portless phone?
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:27.200]   - It's the general argument against government regulation
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.560]   is, well, don't mess with it.
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:31.200]   Just let the market rule, but I don't know.
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.040]   I think something-
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:32.880]   - I'm not usually in favor of that.
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.360]   I wanna be really clear.
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:36.280]   I'm not making an advocate for it.
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:37.120]   - I do, I do.
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:37.960]   - It'd be better.
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:39.320]   - I wanna back you up with that day
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:40.160]   and I'm right with you.
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:41.640]   I just want you to see how that everything.
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:42.480]   - Yeah, me too.
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:43.960]   - There's something else I'd totally disagree with.
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:44.800]   - That's my vote.
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:45.640]   - I just want C.
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:46.480]   C is for cookie.
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:47.320]   It's good enough for me.
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:48.800]   (laughing)
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:50.840]   - All right, show today brought to you by
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:52.800]   speaking of cookies wasabi.
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:53.640]   How about-
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:54.480]   - Sabi.
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:55.320]   - Oh, wasabi.
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:56.960]   I'm not talking about that green blob on your sushi.
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:00.080]   I'm talking, it's hot, but it's hot cloud storage.
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:03.760]   I like what'sabi in both cases.
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:08.280]   Wasabi was created by my friend, David Friend,
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:11.520]   and his co-collaborator, Jeff Flowers.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:12.480]   They are brilliant.
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:16.760]   They found a way to write data onto hard drive sequentially
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:19.320]   instead of bisector, which saves a lot of time.
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:20.560]   It's much more efficient.
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:25.920]   And it gives you hot cloud storage that is,
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:29.360]   I mean, it sounds like I'm making this up.
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:31.200]   It's 80%, but I'm not.
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:35.240]   It's 80% cheaper, all because of this new technology.
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:39.120]   You get 11 nines of durability, as good as you can get.
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:42.760]   Wasabi does regular integrity checking.
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:45.920]   All the objects store to check for integrity every 90 days.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:49.320]   They have multiple redundant operation centers,
[00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:51.080]   tier four data centers.
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:53.120]   They're highly secure, they're fully redundant.
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:56.440]   So if something, if you do the integrity check
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:58.520]   and the data file has changed,
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:00.480]   you can get it from the other center.
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:03.600]   So you're never gonna lose a bit, not one bit of data.
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:06.800]   You've got, I think this is a great feature
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:09.920]   in today's era of ransomware.
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:13.480]   You can designate your data to be immutable.
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:16.000]   It cannot be erased, it cannot be altered.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   Human error, ransomware, nothing can change that data.
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:24.080]   That is, you try that on your on-prem storage.
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:25.160]   You can't do that.
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:29.040]   You've got access control mechanisms, bucket policies, ACLs,
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:32.120]   so that you can control who has access to what.
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:34.240]   Wasabi follows all the best security models
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:35.440]   and design practices.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:37.240]   State of the art, it's HIPAA compliant,
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:39.840]   it's FINRA compliant, CJS compliant.
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:42.400]   And it is 80% cheaper than S3.
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:44.400]   And oh, by the way, if you use S3,
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.200]   you already know how to use Wasabi,
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:48.840]   'cause it uses the S3 API.
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:52.320]   But unlike S3, there's no charge for API requests.
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:54.480]   There's no charge for egress.
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:57.200]   There's no complex storage tiers.
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:58.480]   It's just a better technology.
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:55:59.320]   Why?
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:00.800]   Because they're the little guys.
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:02.400]   Everybody, when they say, let's go to the cloud,
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:07.000]   they're saying S3, let's go AWS or Azure or Google Cloud.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.200]   And so that nobody even knows about Wasabi.
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:11.360]   That's why I'm really, I'm on a mission to tell people,
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:12.520]   look, if you're looking at those three,
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:14.280]   I had one more name at Wasabi.
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:18.520]   I think you're gonna be very, very impressed.
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:20.280]   And I love it, 'cause I think we're making headway.
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:22.000]   I talked to more and more people.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.040]   They'll come up to me, say, yeah, we chose Wasabi.
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:24.800]   You were right.
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:27.640]   You can find out if you wanna try it,
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:30.480]   you can get an unlimited trial for a month.
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:32.960]   When you go to wasabi.com, click the free trial link,
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:34.640]   and then use the offer code Twitch.
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:36.880]   So really bang on it, put a bunch of data on it,
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:39.520]   move it around, try and see how it works.
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:44.440]   Wasabi, W-A-S-A-B-I.com.
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:46.320]   Don't forget to use the offer code Twitch for two reasons.
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:48.200]   One, so they know you heard it here.
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:51.280]   It helps us, but also so you get that unlimited,
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:52.760]   free storage for a month.
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:53.600]   It is great.
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:56.080]   If you're a managed service provider,
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:58.040]   you're reselling this stuff,
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:59.760]   you can actually give it to your customers
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:00.940]   for less than they're already paying,
[00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:02.880]   and you'll still make more money.
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:04.980]   You gotta love that.
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:09.340]   Wasabi, W-A-S-A-B-I.com.
[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:13.820]   (sings)
[00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:16.460]   Let's see.
[00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:18.460]   (sighs)
[00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:20.820]   Is there any, I don't, I'm, more Apple stories.
[00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:21.820]   I'm sorry, I apologize.
[00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:24.820]   We'll get, well, all right, I won't do an Apple story.
[00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:27.100]   Well, I was gonna ask about the story
[00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:29.260]   that Mark Gurman had that Apple's thinking about,
[00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:33.780]   thinking about letting you make a different default browser
[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:35.900]   or a different default music app on the iPhone.
[00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:37.460]   Is that even possible?
[00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:40.140]   - Sure, it's possible.
[00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:42.940]   - Well, I know they can do it, but why would they do it?
[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:44.340]   - I think it's actually good.
[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:47.100]   - Well, it's good for users.
[00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:48.220]   - I think it's good for everybody.
[00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:50.420]   I think it's good for users who get a lot more choice
[00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:52.420]   and are a lot happier with their options.
[00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:53.780]   I think it's good for developers
[00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:55.180]   who make those third-party apps
[00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:56.780]   because it means they can actually compete
[00:57:56.780 --> 00:57:58.420]   on a more level playing field
[00:57:58.420 --> 00:57:59.700]   with things like mail and Safari.
[00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:01.140]   Previously, if you had a third-party app
[00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:02.820]   and you used like Chrome on the iPhone,
[00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:04.140]   you'd still get kicked into Safari.
[00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:04.980]   - It's so annoying, I know.
[00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:05.820]   - Oh, that's annoying.
[00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:07.180]   And I think it's actually good for Apple
[00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:10.500]   because not only does it get sort of the competitors
[00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:12.020]   and antitrust regulators, that's a fact.
[00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:13.580]   - That's why they do it, right?
[00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:15.980]   But also it makes their users happier
[00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:18.420]   and I think it encourages them to improve
[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:21.100]   their own built-in apps because they actually have to compete
[00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:22.460]   not just because it's built in
[00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:24.180]   and it's the thing that everyone's gonna use.
[00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:26.580]   And I don't think everyone, most users,
[00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:28.940]   are not going to ever touch that.
[00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:30.780]   But the users who do wanna change it
[00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:32.660]   are gonna be really happy that they finally have it
[00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:33.500]   as an option.
[00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:35.380]   So I think it's a win-win-win.
[00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:37.820]   - I don't see Safari loading up on a Samsung phone.
[00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:38.820]   I won't do it.
[00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:39.900]   - No, I wouldn't do it.
[00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:41.180]   - No, no, no, Android phone.
[00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:43.580]   On any Android phone, you can choose whatever browser
[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:45.220]   is the default, you can choose,
[00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:47.220]   I wish Apple would do this, you could choose your own,
[00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:49.540]   you could, Apple, you can only use Springboard.
[00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:51.420]   I'd love to see a different desktop interface,
[00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:52.660]   a launcher.
[00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:53.620]   I'd love to see all of that,
[00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:54.940]   but Apple's never gonna do that one.
[00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:55.780]   - They're never gonna do that.
[00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:56.740]   - That's not gonna happen.
[00:58:56.740 --> 00:59:00.140]   Apple did try to suppress Tom Sadowski's book,
[00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:04.140]   App Store Confidential saying the book has
[00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:08.220]   stuff that Tom has agreed never to reveal.
[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:10.700]   Well, of course, according to 9-5 Mac,
[00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:13.140]   it's now number two on the German best-selling list.
[00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:14.300]   (laughing)
[00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:15.140]   Whoops.
[00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:16.580]   - I almost bought it right away.
[00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:18.820]   As soon as I saw the first report come up,
[00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:20.580]   I went, "Oh, this looks interesting,
[00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:22.700]   "but I don't speak German, so I didn't end up buying it."
[00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:24.420]   But yeah, I would buy it too.
[00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:25.740]   It looks pretty cool.
[00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:30.740]   - Yeah, Apple says that the operation of the App Store,
[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:32.420]   this guy worked in the,
[00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:35.300]   was ran the German version of the App Store.
[00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:37.380]   They say the operation of the App Store encompasses
[00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:40.580]   a multitude of business secrets,
[00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:44.500]   and Sadowski signed a agreement
[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:47.580]   that he would never reveal it or something like that.
[00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:49.380]   - Well, I think the original report
[00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:51.180]   that where Apple had made a statement to,
[00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:52.940]   I think the Verge, if I remember,
[00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:57.020]   so they fired him.
[00:59:57.020 --> 01:00:00.380]   And he had said that he showed them the book.
[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:02.260]   He presented, before he was fired,
[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:03.500]   while he was still working with him,
[01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:04.460]   he showed them the book,
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:08.060]   and he felt very strongly that this was gonna help developers.
[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:10.300]   And I think that's why this book got so popular
[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:13.540]   is the App Store to a lot of developers.
[01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:15.940]   It feels like a dark-- - It's a black box, yeah.
[01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:19.060]   - Yes, and this can help them.
[01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:20.060]   I haven't read it,
[01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:21.580]   but it sounds like what he was trying to do
[01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:24.420]   was making it easier for developers
[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:26.660]   to get their apps through the App Store
[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:29.460]   and get them approved.
[01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:32.220]   But he has been fired by Apple.
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:35.860]   Their statement was that he had been let go,
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:37.660]   that he shouldn't have written this book,
[01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:39.500]   that he had signed an anti-agreement,
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:43.420]   so they want him to remove,
[01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:45.420]   destroy all copies of it, not sell it anymore.
[01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:48.500]   - But today, they haven't sued yet.
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.020]   - Not yet. - He's still selling it.
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:51.380]   - Right. (laughs)
[01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:52.940]   Maybe they were just hoping.
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:55.300]   - You can't take back those books that people bought.
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:57.460]   Like if you buy a physical copy of this book,
[01:00:57.460 --> 01:00:59.660]   it's your physical copy of the book, so.
[01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:02.020]   - It isn't German only at this point.
[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:04.980]   - Right, I'd love to see it translated to US.
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:06.100]   I would buy it and read it.
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:10.340]   I would love to know some more helpful tips
[01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:12.500]   for developers to be able to get their apps
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:15.340]   through the App process because so often.
[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:19.060]   - You just don't know. - Yeah, and arguably,
[01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:20.700]   Apple should be doing this themselves
[01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:22.100]   rather than waiting for someone else
[01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:23.300]   to write a book about it, right?
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:24.620]   They should be helping developers do that.
[01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:26.580]   - No one's supposed to know why we banned their app.
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:27.980]   That's secret.
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:30.260]   - Yeah, and that shouldn't be that way.
[01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:31.860]   They should be able to know what's going on.
[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:36.860]   I think we come across apps that somehow,
[01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:40.820]   Apple suddenly takes down from the App Store
[01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:42.460]   and the developer doesn't understand why,
[01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:44.820]   and they get this very vague response.
[01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:47.500]   This allows Apple to continue to do stuff like that.
[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:50.420]   That seems really, it doesn't make sense.
[01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:52.460]   Why would you suddenly tell me that my app
[01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:54.860]   is not approved even though it was approved before?
[01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:56.180]   And Apple might say something like,
[01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:58.740]   well now you're copying our operating system,
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:01.820]   even though Apple might have been actually copying there.
[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:03.620]   Or something like that.
[01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:06.300]   The secretiveness must allow them
[01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:08.020]   to get away with stuff like that and just say,
[01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:10.580]   well, we've got our regulations inside here
[01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:13.660]   that you have to follow and you just have to figure it out.
[01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:17.660]   - Larry Ellison is, as you know, Oracle is in
[01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:22.260]   the Supreme Court in their fight with Google.
[01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:27.140]   This is one that's been going on forever and ever and ever.
[01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:29.980]   Oracle's trying to collect $8 billion in royalties
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:34.260]   because Google used Java in the Android operating system.
[01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:35.900]   Except they didn't use Java.
[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:39.140]   They duplicated the Java API.
[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:41.460]   And Larry says, well, we had a,
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:43.340]   that's a copyright API.
[01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:46.060]   So Ellison hosts a nice dinner
[01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:47.540]   for the president of the United States,
[01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:52.060]   a golf outing, $100,000 per couple for the golf.
[01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:54.100]   And if you want to go to the policy,
[01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:57.180]   policy round table, a quarter of a million dollars
[01:02:57.180 --> 01:03:00.060]   raised a lot of money for the president's reelection campaign.
[01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:03.940]   And lo and behold, the Trump administration
[01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:05.700]   is now telling the Supreme Court,
[01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:10.540]   you should probably reject an appeal by Google on this one.
[01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:12.860]   You should, you know what, Oracle's right.
[01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:16.780]   There's really no comment on this, right?
[01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:19.140]   It's just, wow.
[01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:21.180]   - Business as usual, it seems like.
[01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:23.340]   - It's a slow pro quo, you know.
[01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:24.180]   - Yeah.
[01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:25.220]   - It just is what it is.
[01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:28.980]   - Justice Sotomayor just published a piece saying,
[01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:32.980]   actually no, it was her dissent in a recent Supreme Court case
[01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:35.420]   where they upheld a Trump administration policy
[01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:39.260]   on immigration saying apparently the Supreme Court now
[01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:41.660]   is just gonna listen to whatever the administration says
[01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:42.660]   and support there.
[01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:45.700]   So that normally you'd say that Amicus brief
[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:47.540]   from the president doesn't carry any more weight
[01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:48.500]   than from anybody else.
[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:52.060]   I would say in this case, it might carry a lot of weight.
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:53.180]   - And I thought I saw a story too
[01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:54.460]   about a bunch of people walking,
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:56.660]   a bunch of employees at Oracle walking out.
[01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:57.500]   - Yes, hundreds.
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:00.660]   - Related to, yeah, related to who is so fundraising.
[01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:02.820]   - Yeah, it's fundraising for Trump.
[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:05.260]   So Oracle is now like Google
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:07.580]   where it's got activist employees who are trying to.
[01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:09.540]   - 300 employees in Oracle whole, you know,
[01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:11.780]   has thousands, tens of thousands of employees.
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:14.300]   So, but it made news, so.
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:15.140]   - Right.
[01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:21.420]   Bezos has committed $10 billion to fight climate change.
[01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:23.260]   A number of people pointed out
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:25.620]   that's somewhat cynical because,
[01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:29.020]   well, for whatever reason you wanna think that's cynical,
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:31.300]   the Bezos Earth Fund will begin issuing grants
[01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:32.420]   from that $10 billion.
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:34.220]   I think I'll take it from anybody.
[01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:38.820]   But some people say, well, Amazon could do a lot more
[01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:43.300]   to end climate change than just putting up a bunch of money.
[01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:44.140]   He could have-
[01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:48.180]   - I think this is a really great thing for anybody
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:49.340]   with lots of money to do.
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:53.780]   But I think the skeptics that are out there,
[01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:57.980]   Amazon has sort of single handedly changed the landscape
[01:04:57.980 --> 01:04:59.420]   of how people shop.
[01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:03.100]   And one of those things is that there's a lot of driving,
[01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:06.340]   flying, shipping, a lot of things that are detrimental
[01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:08.180]   to the environment are happening.
[01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:09.340]   - Do you think so that-
[01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:10.860]   - I wonder if there's a net gain
[01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:12.820]   because we're not driving to target
[01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:15.340]   that maybe that truck is-
[01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:17.140]   - I still do brick and mortar shopping.
[01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:21.620]   And I see the point of view that $10 billion from Bezos,
[01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:24.460]   well, nice is not necessarily combating,
[01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:25.300]   as Lori puts out,
[01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:28.020]   kind of the systematic change that we've undergone
[01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:29.020]   because of Amazon.
[01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:32.420]   I'm not sure, especially because of the overall rise,
[01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:33.700]   it's only one part of it,
[01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:35.620]   but it is certainly a big part of it.
[01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:36.620]   - Yeah.
[01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:37.700]   So-
[01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:38.780]   - I'm a fan of Jeff.
[01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:41.580]   When he was on Star Trek many years ago,
[01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:42.420]   I just-
[01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:43.980]   - When he played Captain Pike?
[01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:44.820]   - So good.
[01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:46.540]   He was such a good actor.
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:49.740]   - So let me just rain on this for a second.
[01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:50.580]   Okay.
[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:51.420]   - Oh, it's time.
[01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:52.540]   Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:56.500]   it's time for another patented Owen, J.J. Stone rant.
[01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:59.620]   - I could care less about your $10 billion
[01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:02.340]   from your avoid paying taxes and you pay zero taxes.
[01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:05.220]   How about you give out $10 billion every year
[01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:07.380]   for a climate change or to help homeless
[01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:08.540]   or to do something?
[01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:10.100]   Then also when you're giving out this money,
[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:12.580]   why don't you appoint a person that we can go to
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:14.540]   to know exactly what you're doing with this money?
[01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:17.020]   - Now Amazon is destroying the planet in general
[01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:17.900]   with its shipping.
[01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:19.900]   Yes, people go to the stores,
[01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:22.620]   but what do you save when you go order one toothbrush
[01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:24.100]   and have it shipped to your house?
[01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:25.460]   And then five minutes later,
[01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:26.820]   you, oh, I need toothpaste
[01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:30.620]   and it comes with a separate package delivered by UPS,
[01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:32.940]   Amazon and the mailman are coming to your house.
[01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:35.100]   So how are you really saving the planet
[01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:37.820]   with your crappy system of delivering everything
[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:39.340]   in every which way possible
[01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:41.020]   because you wanna be convenient?
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:43.120]   Then on top of that inside baseball,
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.740]   people return so much crap
[01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:46.520]   that they would never do at another store
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:48.720]   and it's wasteful, okay?
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:51.420]   UPS has a system now,
[01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:53.080]   Amazon came up with this great idea
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:54.480]   where they do bulk shipping.
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.600]   So instead of you returning that toothbrush
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:58.280]   and them shipping out one whole toothbrush,
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:00.460]   they collect things into an 18Q box
[01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:03.100]   and they can fit 20 to 30 items in that box.
[01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:05.480]   That's great Amazon, totally appreciate you.
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:06.720]   But also they have the system
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:08.740]   where it's computer and it's digitized.
[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:11.240]   At Halloween, at one of our stores,
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:16.240]   we return 2,000 costumes in the first week after Halloween.
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:17.080]   - Oh, that's right.
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:19.540]   You have a UPS shipping business, yeah.
[01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:23.480]   - Yes, so the day after Halloween for two weeks straight,
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:26.040]   people were bringing in four and five costumes,
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:28.280]   things that they would never return at another store.
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:29.480]   But since it's on Amazon,
[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:31.960]   they only had to talk to a computer, they return it.
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:33.320]   So they've got the scam going
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:35.120]   and they could dress their whole family up
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:37.780]   like the Disney channel for 200 bucks,
[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:40.840]   where go out, get their candy, come back in, return it
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:43.280]   and then send it back to wherever landfill
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:46.160]   or trash company or magic shipping container box
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:47.800]   that people come spend 250 on
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.080]   and they're just returning stuff
[01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:51.880]   that they would never, ever return and not use again.
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:54.960]   So it's a system that creates so much waste.
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:55.960]   So when he goes out and he says,
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.600]   he's putting out $10 billion in my,
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:00.880]   you owe me $10 billion in taxes to which you pay zero.
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:03.800]   So this one time cookie promo thing that you put out
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:07.000]   so we can talk about it, be happy, I don't care.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.600]   I want $10 billion a year
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.640]   or I want you to pay your fair share taxes
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:13.120]   or I want some direct accountability to this money
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:15.600]   that you're just handing out, Willie Nilly.
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:20.320]   - That was a two Caramelo Koala brand, thank you.
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:21.160]   - Love you too.
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:23.200]   (laughing)
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.480]   - Did you order those on Amazon?
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:25.560]   - No, I brought these.
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:28.160]   (laughing)
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:29.160]   - No, they're from Australia.
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:32.440]   Our Australian visitors brought me a treat, thank you.
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:33.240]   - They look delicious.
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:34.080]   - Oh, they're old.
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:34.920]   - Yeah, it looks great.
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:35.760]   - No.
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:37.960]   - They also brought me some minties.
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:41.240]   But the minties, they said, don't eat these
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:44.040]   while you're on the show and they were right.
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:45.360]   (laughing)
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:47.160]   They take out all your dental work.
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:48.640]   (laughing)
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:49.960]   - They just graved down with Lysol
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:51.320]   before you start popping them in,
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:53.560]   like where did they come from?
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:54.640]   Did you check the plane?
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:58.200]   - Oh no, come on, Oglia, we just got that talking about this.
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.560]   - What's done is done.
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:03.240]   - Oglia, you just came with all this.
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:05.800]   Oh my God, Oglia.
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.680]   - You need to drink some of that perot.
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:09.680]   - The dye is cast.
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:11.960]   - Hold on, hold it up to the screen, I got you.
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:14.200]   (laughing)
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:22.240]   - I'm gonna ask Dr. Mom if there's post facto pureelling.
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:24.080]   Like after you.
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:25.240]   - It's called whiskey.
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:27.160]   (laughing)
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:29.960]   - That's better, there you go, the whiskey's good.
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:31.760]   - Well, I'm definitely in the clean then,
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:34.560]   'cause last night there was plenty of that going around.
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:37.360]   - Oh man, you were in a punk concert.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:40.200]   I mean, the Mosh Pit alone, oh my God.
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:41.040]   That's like a little.
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.800]   - Oh, the germs, the petri dish of punks.
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:44.640]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:45.520]   - Oh man.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:50.920]   Twitter has been busy banning and all sorts of stuff.
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:54.120]   I think they banned 70 of Mike Bloomberg's.
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:57.640]   Is he, I mean, there's another rant here, Owen,
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:02.640]   because Twitter's all excited that they found 70 accounts.
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:08.160]   By the way, real people who were kind of all at once
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:11.640]   cutting and pasting tweets on behalf of Mike Bloomberg,
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:14.440]   so they banned those.
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:18.040]   But meanwhile, we're learning that the Russian troll factory
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:20.480]   is on overtime for the 2020 election.
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:23.080]   - Well, they just know how to do it better, is the problem.
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:26.680]   - Is that, Twitter is just spending 70 pro Bloomberg accounts
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:28.680]   citing platform manipulation.
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:33.920]   You know, I feel like this is kind of selective enforcement here.
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:36.760]   - Well, so think about this though.
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:39.880]   I've read this whole thing from top to bottom.
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:44.280]   And what it sounds like is that Bloomberg is trying
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:46.520]   to do something that a lot of people have done,
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:51.440]   which is hire a company that has people under it,
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:54.960]   sending out tweets to make that Twitter account
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:55.960]   look more popular.
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:56.800]   - Right.
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:01.440]   - And a good company would have people sending individual tweets
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:04.280]   that sounded more original, that sounded more natural,
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:06.160]   that actually spoke to these people's--
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:07.520]   - So is that their mistake?
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:08.360]   Is it?
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:09.200]   - Their mistake is amazing.
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:10.560]   - It is cutting and pasting.
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:12.160]   - And he's using people who--
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.120]   - Go ahead, sorry.
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:19.120]   - Using people who have no real influencer experience.
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:24.120]   There was some Twitter handle that had zero followers.
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:30.080]   Another who was previously a supporter of Bernie Sanders
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:33.400]   and Elizabeth, like an outspoken supporter of them,
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:35.400]   and then suddenly switching to Bloomberg,
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:38.000]   the problem is that this isn't grassroots,
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.720]   this isn't organic, this is the Bloomberg organization
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:45.600]   paying people to act like they want him as a president.
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:49.960]   And so their tweets sound fake, they sound cut and paste,
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:53.040]   and they don't sound like they're coming from the heart.
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:57.120]   And what the Bloomberg campaign needs to do instead
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:59.680]   is to find real passionate supporters
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:02.600]   and ask them to voluntarily do this kind of stuff
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:04.520]   instead of getting paid to do it.
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:06.080]   They're just doing it wrong.
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:09.160]   - I mean, the thing is, this is an easy situation
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:10.760]   because like all those things, like you said,
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.920]   if they're copy and pasted, that's easy for the,
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:14.640]   you know, an algorithm to track down.
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:17.840]   It's a lot harder to track down people who are being paid
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:21.960]   maybe but are also, you know, making it sound more original
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:22.760]   or more unique.
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:26.320]   So I think that's, Twitter at least is trying to crack down
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:28.720]   on some of this stuff which has some things to say for it.
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:30.240]   But I think that they're gonna find
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.720]   there's a lot more challenge below this.
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:33.200]   So tooting your own horn about like,
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:36.080]   well, we took out all these Bo Boomburg bots when, you know,
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:38.400]   Russia and all these other things are doing a much better job.
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.840]   As you said, I think that's the harder part.
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:43.440]   - And to be fair, they've updated their systems
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:46.280]   because they just caught like the peanut guy
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:50.280]   with the baby nut thing, the social media company
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:51.800]   that was promoting that.
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.800]   They caught all those fake accounts too.
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:56.320]   So the new Agri that is catching them in there
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:59.000]   and they are announcing when they're catching people.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.320]   - The peanut guy with the baby nut thing, what is that?
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:03.480]   - Mr. Peanut. - Mr. Peanut.
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:06.640]   - The VaynerMedia from the Super Bowl ad.
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:10.800]   They got caught by Twitter also by using fake accounts
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:11.800]   trying to promote the hashtag.
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:12.640]   - Oh, that's right.
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:14.240]   - That's right. - That's right.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:17.400]   - So Twitter has updated their system now.
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:19.680]   So they're announcing when they're catching everybody.
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:21.680]   And so hopefully they're just getting better at it
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:23.120]   and catching more people.
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:27.000]   I mean, it's just amusing how when it's something
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.200]   that you don't understand, it's like, oh,
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:30.240]   the Russians are doing it.
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:33.480]   Like we just blankly blame Russia for everything now.
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:34.440]   And it's just weird.
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:36.680]   So in Bloomberg finding someone that really cares,
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:38.960]   it's hard to do because he throws out money.
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:41.200]   I wouldn't do anything from Bloomberg unless he paid me
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:42.880]   because he just pays for it. - Which is exactly
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.240]   what people are doing.
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:45.080]   - Yes, yeah.
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:49.760]   $9 million in Facebook ads in a month in Sane.
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:50.760]   And guess what? - Yeah.
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:51.600]   Nobody likes you.
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.360]   (laughing)
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:55.280]   - Just pay that money how you want to.
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:56.280]   - You have to buy your friends.
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:59.560]   - You've hired more than 500 deputy digital organizers
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:00.720]   according to the Wall Street Journal,
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:03.240]   working 20 to 30 hours a week.
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:04.840]   It's not good pay.
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:07.760]   Mike, you could pay 'em better, $2,500 a month.
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:11.360]   And they're expected to promote Bloomberg every week
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:14.840]   to everyone in their phone contacts by text message.
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:15.680]   Oh, geez.
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:19.040]   You know, we're here in California.
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.640]   I know, Laurie, you're in Sacramento.
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:22.840]   We're starting to get inundated
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:27.280]   'cause our primary is coming up on March 3rd.
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:28.120]   - 3rd.
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:30.080]   - And I don't know, have you started getting texts
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:31.600]   from every candidate I am?
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.520]   - I haven't received any texts yet.
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:36.240]   I've actually been pretty good at not getting texts
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:37.080]   from candidates.
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:38.400]   They're knocking on my door though.
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.340]   So I've got the old school candidates
[01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:42.280]   see going on right now. - Which is worse.
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:43.400]   - I don't know, it's kind of nice.
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:44.880]   You can actually have a conversation with them
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:45.720]   a little bit about it.
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:47.880]   - The weird thing is I don't know they got my number.
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:49.640]   I mean, I think they got my number
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:52.000]   because I did give it to one candidate.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000]   I'm feeling the candidates are selling their numbers
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.080]   to other candidates.
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:58.040]   - Or they're getting hacked,
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:59.520]   the DNC's just tipping in,
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:01.160]   dabble in and doing what they wanna do.
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:02.600]   But the fact that you didn't give people
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:04.320]   a Google voice number, it shows the level of things.
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:06.080]   - I did. - You, okay,
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:07.200]   and what's the problem?
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:08.040]   - I don't know what's the problem.
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.680]   - I mean, I'm getting texts.
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:11.360]   - You could block that, that's no problem.
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:12.880]   - If I knew what number they were coming from,
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:16.600]   but if it's coming from a army of volunteers,
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:17.680]   then I can't.
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.680]   You see what I'm saying?
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:21.040]   It's not the same number.
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:23.520]   - Guess you need a backup Google voice number.
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:25.440]   - I've only got one or two, I just texted him back.
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:26.680]   I told you never to call me here.
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:27.520]   - Yeah.
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:28.360]   (laughing)
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:29.360]   - One of my friends said,
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:33.520]   "Oh, you got me wrong, I'm voting for Bernie."
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:35.520]   And they never heard from him again, so.
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:38.120]   (laughing)
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:39.960]   Let's take a little break.
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.840]   Laurie Gill is here, imore.com.
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:43.400]   If you like Laurie and who doesn't,
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:45.120]   you'll see a lot more of her every Tuesday
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:46.200]   on Mac break weekly.
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.440]   And of course at imore.com,
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:50.920]   she's @appaholic on the Twitter
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:55.920]   and her band Sickburn is legendary.
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:57.480]   (laughing)
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:58.320]   You need a whole bunch.
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:15:59.140]   - We're big in Japan.
[01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:01.880]   - Yeah, huge, huge in Japan.
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:03.720]   Also with us, it's his first time with me,
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:05.400]   but he's been onto it before with Jason Stelom,
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:06.720]   Dan Morin.
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:09.440]   Dan of course does a great podcast called Clockwise
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:11.720]   with Mike Asargent and writes for six colors.com.
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:12.760]   He does a bunch of podcasts.
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:14.280]   You can tell he's a professional podcaster.
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:17.160]   He has a Yeti floating from the ceiling.
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:18.000]   - I know.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.960]   - That means you must be a professional podcaster.
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:23.020]   And our Rantor in Chief.
[01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:28.020]   Oh, Dr. Owen, JJ Stone at iqmz.com.
[01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:30.720]   Anything you want to plug, Owen?
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:32.840]   - I got a new Raisin and Ninja podcast
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:33.680]   coming tomorrow.
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:34.920]   - That's the one you do with your daughter.
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:36.760]   She is so awesome.
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:37.920]   - She's pretty awesome.
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:39.240]   - She's pretty awesome.
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:42.200]   - I am really enjoying watching your journey together.
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:44.400]   It's a really great podcast.
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.360]   - It's fun.
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:47.880]   - Raisin and Ninja.
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:50.240]   - Because basically, now we're gonna start doing video,
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:52.640]   by the way, 'cause people wanted to see her expressions
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:53.480]   in mannerization.
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:54.920]   - You're not worried about that letting people
[01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:56.280]   see what she looks like?
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:58.480]   - So again, part of the whole concept
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:02.440]   of how I've raised her is she posts on the internet
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:04.040]   and she doesn't read comments.
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:06.480]   She doesn't like comments on her own stuff.
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:08.920]   She doesn't look at anything when we do a show together.
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:10.240]   She doesn't really listen to it.
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:11.240]   She doesn't look at it.
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:12.240]   She doesn't check it.
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:14.880]   She doesn't care, but she's all in in a moment.
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:19.400]   So just for me, training her about how it's supposed to be,
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:20.720]   she teaches her friends that.
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.680]   She's got her friends not being into likes
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:24.240]   or caring about who's looking at what
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:26.120]   and trying to make the perfect picture.
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:29.280]   Like she's really good with the internet.
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:33.120]   And I'm super proud because two weeks ago,
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:35.560]   she got slammed illegally in a wrestling match
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:38.800]   and her wrist was basically broken and dangling.
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:40.360]   - Oh.
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:42.080]   - She looked at the coach and she said,
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:43.360]   "I'm gonna keep going."
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:45.320]   And she got up and she finished the round
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:47.520]   'cause she was winning and she didn't want to quit
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:48.480]   'cause she didn't want to lose.
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:50.680]   So she finished the round, goes into the second round
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:52.320]   and then the coach called it
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:54.320]   because he didn't know if her wrist was broken.
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:55.640]   And the first thing she came up to me, she's like,
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:56.480]   "Look, I didn't quit."
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:57.320]   He called it.
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:59.760]   I'm like, "I know, I know, but I can die knowing
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:02.400]   that my daughter is tough enough to handle her own self
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:05.120]   mentally and physically that she's a tough cookie
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:05.960]   and she's a fighter.
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:09.120]   So I can pass out on this mic right now and be happy.
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:10.160]   - Oh, that's nice.
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:12.400]   You are indeed, right is a ninja.
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:14.120]   Oh, and JJ Stone.
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:16.120]   Is that at IQMZ.com?
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:17.040]   - Yes, it's on there.
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:18.840]   - I asked as if I didn't know.
[01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:22.880]   - Our show today brought to you by CashFly.
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:25.040]   If you're a podcaster, if you deliver content,
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:27.400]   if you've got a website, if you've got an app,
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:30.440]   you need a CDN, a content delivery network
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:34.920]   and there is no one better than our CDN, CashFly.
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:36.920]   That's what we've been on for 10 years now.

[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:44.520]   We all use it, LG, R is technical because it's,
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:47.320]   well, it's faster.
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:50.840]   It's faster than, you know, it's like five times faster
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:55.400]   than your HTML delivery mechanism.
[01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:58.720]   It's faster than most other CDNs,
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:01.640]   about 30% faster than their competition.
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:05.640]   And now with CashFly's new cash shield,
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:08.240]   you're not only gonna be faster, you're gonna save money.

[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:48.640]   guarantees zero cash misses,

[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:02.920]   And I say that as a happy CashFly user
[01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:04.820]   for many, many years.
[01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:07.580]   Look, we love CashFly, we know you will too.
[01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:09.260]   And so that's why we set this up.
[01:20:09.260 --> 01:20:11.620]   If you go to twit.cashfly.com,

[01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:19.900]   No hard sell, they're great people,
[01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:21.900]   but they can really make a difference.
[01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:24.820]   And if you wanna find out whether you're overpaying,
[01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:27.340]   whether you can get better bandwidth,
[01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:28.380]   this is the way to do it.
[01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:32.460]   Bring your bill, bring your usage trends to twit.cashfly.com.
[01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:36.340]   We love you, CashFly, thank you so much for your support.
[01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:37.520]   We really appreciate it.
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:41.300]   By the way, it's not just Bloomberg,
[01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:44.180]   get ready, starting, I guess,
[01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:49.460]   in October and leading into election day,
[01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:54.460]   YouTube homepage will be taken over by the Trump campaign.
[01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:57.660]   They're already spending millions and millions of dollars
[01:20:57.660 --> 01:21:00.940]   on this, YouTube would not comment on the deal.
[01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:04.140]   The take over, you probably know on JJ Stone,
[01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:05.340]   what's a takeover?
[01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:08.980]   Take over is when people grab your phone
[01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:11.660]   and then they post all their stuff on your Instagram.
[01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:13.580]   And you get that from part of the take over.
[01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:14.420]   - Not that kind of take over.
[01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:17.500]   - Take over is when you own the homepage
[01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:19.500]   and no one else is on there.
[01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:22.060]   I mean, that is a big deal.
[01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:24.700]   - I'm joking about that, but that's what celebrities do.
[01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:26.140]   And like, they switch each other's accounts,
[01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:28.140]   they take over and they post their own stuff.
[01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:28.980]   But I mean-- - That's a different kind
[01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:30.260]   of take over. - It's different,
[01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:31.660]   but it's the same.
[01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:35.940]   I assume that YouTube is gonna have the lowest views
[01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:38.020]   that day in American history.
[01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:42.300]   And not so much that voters care about Trump,
[01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:45.940]   but anyone sub 14 is going to be very upset
[01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:48.340]   when they log into YouTube that day
[01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:52.300]   and they don't see their favorite YouTuber or song
[01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:54.620]   or whatever and they're gonna log out.
[01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:56.260]   - 'Cause it's a huge opportunity.
[01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:58.980]   This is why, people, my kids will say,
[01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:01.580]   well, why does the incumbent have an advantage?
[01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:03.020]   This is why.
[01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:05.260]   He already knows, the Trump campaign already knows,
[01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:06.660]   he's the nominee.
[01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:07.980]   The Democrats don't know yet.
[01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:11.940]   No Democrats gonna buy a YouTube takeover for election day.
[01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:13.540]   - That's right. - They can't.
[01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:15.580]   Maybe Bloomberg, but that would be nuts.
[01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:17.660]   Actually, he could buy it and change the message.
[01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:20.300]   - Yep. - Yeah, he's got the money.
[01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:21.260]   So does the Trump campaign.
[01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:23.620]   They may be spending as much as half a billion dollars
[01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:26.420]   on digital ads, according to Brad Parscale.
[01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:27.780]   They're gonna be very organized,
[01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:29.020]   but I thought it was interesting.
[01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:32.060]   They're spending as much as a million dollars a day
[01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:34.020]   to do a YouTube takeover.
[01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:36.780]   - Also, by the way, for all the listeners and viewers,
[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:39.820]   we're not talking politics, we're talking politics.
[01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:41.540]   Okay, this is-- - Politics, baby.
[01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:44.100]   - I love politics, that's a great story.
[01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:45.260]   - I'm stealing that.
[01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:46.740]   - I'm stealing that from you.
[01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:49.460]   - I'll license it to you and I expect royalty,
[01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:52.340]   but I just wanted our audience to know what was going on.
[01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:54.140]   Nothing's free, Uncle Leo, just so you know.
[01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:55.140]   They heard it here first.
[01:22:55.140 --> 01:22:56.300]   - Politics. - How about a delicious--
[01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:58.500]   - Politics. - Delicious minty.
[01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:00.900]   - Nothing's not saying it's not.
[01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:02.740]   - You're not saying it's not. - Don't you shit that out here?
[01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:04.620]   - Oh, it's a lot of no parts.
[01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:06.420]   - And we did send you candy once, didn't we?
[01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:07.340]   - You did send me candy.
[01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:08.860]   - Big bunch of candy.
[01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:10.740]   Popcorn, you guys love me over there.
[01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:11.580]   - We do, I love you. - We do, love you.
[01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:12.900]   - We do love you.
[01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:14.540]   There is a new, according to Brian Krebs,
[01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:18.420]   Krebs on security, a new extortion campaign,
[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:21.980]   which is kind of fascinating, pay up
[01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:26.980]   or we'll make Google ban your ads.
[01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:30.660]   So the threat is we are gonna send so much bot
[01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:35.260]   and junk traffic clicking your ads on your website.
[01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:37.100]   The Google's automated anti-fraud systems
[01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:39.940]   will suspend your account for suspicious traffic.
[01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:44.300]   - Wow, what a clever idea. - Next generation.
[01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:49.300]   - Yeah, here's an example from one of Krebs
[01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:53.660]   and securities readers who maintain several sites
[01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:55.660]   that receive a fair amount of traffic.
[01:23:55.660 --> 01:23:57.620]   Here's an email.
[01:23:57.620 --> 01:24:02.100]   Very soon, the warning notice from above,
[01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:03.620]   which is a Google warning,
[01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:06.860]   will appear at the dashboard of your ads sensor account
[01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:08.060]   undoubtedly.
[01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:10.500]   This will happen due to the fact that we are about
[01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:14.060]   to flood your site with huge amount of direct bot generated
[01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:17.420]   web traffic with 100% bounce ratio
[01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:19.780]   and thousands of IPs in rotation
[01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:22.980]   and nightmare for every ads since publisher.
[01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:26.820]   More also, we'll adjust our sophisticated bots
[01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:29.500]   to open an endless cycle with different time duration,
[01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:32.820]   every ads since banner which runs on your site.
[01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:34.940]   Man, who knew Dracula was so excited.
[01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:36.180]   - That's not Dracula.
[01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:38.660]   - That's a little Dracula.
[01:24:38.660 --> 01:24:41.060]   - Okay, next today it's serving Leemie,
[01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:43.860]   it will be placed on your, no, that's not Dracula.
[01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:46.540]   They want $5,000 in Bitcoin, what a scam,
[01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:49.740]   what a clever scam, 'cause you have to have a bot in it.
[01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:51.260]   - Yeah, I mean, it's essentially,
[01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:52.780]   it's still kind of a DOS.
[01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:54.420]   - It's like a DOS, yeah.
[01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:55.860]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:58.460]   But it's interesting to target the AdSense program
[01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:01.300]   because it's where the money is.
[01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:02.140]   - It's not right.
[01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:03.460]   - It's going to have to be money.
[01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:05.980]   - That certainly feels painful.
[01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:08.820]   I mean, I'm curious too about just like ad networks
[01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:11.700]   in general, this has been a bigger and bigger problem
[01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:14.740]   for a lot of these ad networks is dealing with these kind of,
[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:16.460]   not only like the DOS style attacks,
[01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:19.820]   but also like the injection of malicious ads.
[01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:22.460]   Like I can't count the number of times I've gone to sites
[01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:25.500]   where you get these junk ads that start taking over,
[01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:26.580]   a legitimate sites, right?
[01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:28.620]   Like you'll go to a site that's fairly popular
[01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:31.220]   and somehow the ad networks, you know, get hijacked
[01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:34.420]   and they don't police essentially the kind of content in there
[01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:36.780]   and you get the pop-ups or the things like win a free iPhone
[01:25:36.780 --> 01:25:38.380]   or get an Amazon gift certificate
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:40.180]   and you can't, especially on a phone,
[01:25:40.180 --> 01:25:41.620]   you can't go back, you can't get out,
[01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:44.100]   all of a sudden like you got kicked off this site entirely.
[01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:45.620]   It's really terrible.
[01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:48.460]   It makes me wonder about the longevity left
[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:52.660]   for digital ad networks between the fact that, you know,
[01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:55.980]   payments are getting lower and they're getting attacked
[01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:58.100]   by more of as vectors for these type of things.
[01:25:58.100 --> 01:26:00.100]   It seems like it's getting riskier and riskier.
[01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:02.940]   - It's called demonetization.
[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:04.500]   And you don't want it to happen to you.
[01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:07.140]   Earlier we were worried that we would get demonetized
[01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:09.220]   by putting that deep fake on.
[01:26:09.220 --> 01:26:12.940]   Well, Fortnite last week added a Rickroll emote.
[01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:17.300]   Just a week ago, Rick Astley inspired.
[01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:19.780]   The company has already rolled out an update
[01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:23.260]   that let PC players mute the music
[01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:28.300]   because if you're a streamer and all of a sudden
[01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:31.740]   your stream says, "Never gonna give you up."
[01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:33.660]   You might dare. - You're not saying that too much.
[01:26:33.660 --> 01:26:35.300]   - I don't know.
[01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:37.660]   Can they pull me down if I sing it?
[01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:38.980]   - That's a kind of big camera for us.
[01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:39.980]   - It's a big camera for us to give him a distinct guy.
[01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:41.980]   - Compulsory licensing, also real licensing.
[01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:43.540]   You need to be able to cover it.
[01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:46.100]   YouTube's copyright detection system
[01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:49.740]   has already flagged the emote.
[01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:52.580]   And the company that owns the rights to,
[01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:56.900]   "Never gonna give you up" was claiming copyright infringement
[01:26:56.900 --> 01:26:59.140]   and demonetizing the videos.
[01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:01.820]   What a world we live in.
[01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:04.340]   First of all, that there is a Rick Astley
[01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:05.620]   never gonna give you up.
[01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:09.060]   Emote in Fortnite.
[01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:11.500]   Second, that never gonna give you up
[01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:14.660]   is something you would want to have on your Fortnite stream.
[01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:17.620]   Third, that if you do it, the company that owns the record
[01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:21.220]   is going to have you demonetized on a platform.
[01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:23.020]   (mumbles)
[01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:25.020]   - At the end of the day-- - That song that goes back.
[01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:27.060]   - As Fortnite should have went to them and said,
[01:27:27.060 --> 01:27:28.980]   "Hey, look, we're gonna do this.
[01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:31.580]   "Let me just cut you a basic check."
[01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:33.020]   And so you're happy.
[01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:35.460]   They should know better than to do this
[01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:36.380]   'cause not for nothing.
[01:27:36.380 --> 01:27:38.380]   You are profiting off of that
[01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:40.620]   because it is something that everybody knows
[01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:41.580]   and it makes people happy.
[01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:44.340]   So if you are selling it to profit off of it,
[01:27:44.340 --> 01:27:47.180]   then you should have went to them and cut them a check.
[01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:48.020]   - That's true. - So go ahead
[01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:49.180]   and demonetize. - I think we're looking.
[01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:51.180]   We're looking at two different issues here though.
[01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:55.100]   We're not talking about Fortnite doing bad.
[01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:57.500]   We're talking about people who are streaming--
[01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:00.300]   - They're just playing the game. - And it's like,
[01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:02.300]   you know. - I would have to assume
[01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:03.140]   and I don't know,
[01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:05.100]   but I would have to assume that Fortnite did do that.
[01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:06.620]   They went and cut that check.
[01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:09.220]   And now it's the streamers who are getting in trouble
[01:28:09.220 --> 01:28:11.420]   because they didn't-- - Oh, you're right.
[01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:12.980]   That's the first thing that they said.
[01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:14.500]   - And their legal team should have better laws
[01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:16.340]   and under the license of the-- - They should have licensed it
[01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:18.700]   for all use in all the media.
[01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:20.660]   Now or here after ever.
[01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:22.020]   - Probably got the money for it.
[01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:24.380]   - But is there a contract for that that says
[01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:27.220]   not only us, the people in this video game--
[01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:28.460]   - Sure, as the lawyers before.
[01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:30.100]   - Literally after I've been being in the world--
[01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:32.020]   - Place in all derivative, you could say,
[01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:34.260]   we want to license it for all derivative works as well.
[01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:36.060]   Yeah, sure. - Yeah, there's a contract for everything.
[01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:38.860]   And all you have to do is that clip of what you're doing
[01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:40.340]   and you encompass it in that.
[01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:41.420]   'Cause you know what's gonna happen.
[01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:44.780]   Fortnite knows better in general.
[01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:46.060]   'Cause they want their stuff streamed
[01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:48.020]   because that's the popular part of the popularity of the game.
[01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:50.740]   So someone there should have known better.
[01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:52.220]   So apparently-- - I have to argue though
[01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:56.340]   that Rick Astley's career has stood the test of time
[01:28:56.340 --> 01:28:58.020]   specifically because of the song.
[01:28:58.020 --> 01:28:59.820]   So good on him.
[01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:02.420]   - Yeah, who did the first, who did the first Rick role?
[01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:03.900]   I mean, how did that start?
[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:06.340]   - I can't even imagine.
[01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:07.620]   - 4chan. - There--
[01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:08.980]   - Was it 4chan? - Yeah.
[01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:10.900]   - I'm in the middle.
[01:29:10.900 --> 01:29:13.540]   - Yeah, it seems like a 4chan-y kind of a thing.
[01:29:13.540 --> 01:29:16.260]   Let me Google the first Rick role.
[01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:17.100]   - Don't do that.
[01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:18.020]   It will shut your computer down.
[01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:19.420]   We're not on time for that.
[01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:20.820]   Don't you Google that.
[01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:21.660]   - Here's a guy. - Here's a guy.
[01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:22.500]   - This is a song that happened.
[01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:25.780]   - Here's a guy on YouTube who says,
[01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:28.180]   I did the first Rick role with proof.
[01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:30.500]   Don't play that, we'll be taken down by some guy
[01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:33.100]   with an American Airlines box in the background.
[01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:34.420]   (laughing)
[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:35.700]   - I thought that was an American Apparel.
[01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:37.220]   - Oh, I'm sorry, American Apparel.
[01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:38.420]   - Yeah, this is our new thing.
[01:29:38.420 --> 01:29:39.260]   - Either way.
[01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:40.860]   - Whenever we play videos, we're gonna play,
[01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:43.620]   we're gonna play with 50% transparency.
[01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:47.300]   And then no algorithm could ever detect that.
[01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:48.140]   This is like-- - Exactly,
[01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:50.540]   it's just an American-- - A reverse capture
[01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:51.380]   for algorithms.
[01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:53.220]   It's an algorithm capture.
[01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:54.220]   The bots can't see.
[01:29:54.220 --> 01:29:56.420]   - You're gonna just find all the supernatural people
[01:29:56.420 --> 01:29:57.580]   tracking down the ghost.
[01:29:57.580 --> 01:30:00.460]   Ah, this is my ghost. - That's my ghost, man.
[01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:01.380]   I want money.
[01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:05.140]   - Actually, what this has done is,
[01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:08.580]   at a feature to Fortnite, they tweeted this,
[01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:10.740]   where you can now, in the settings,
[01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:14.740]   you could switch off all audio from licensed emotes.
[01:30:14.740 --> 01:30:16.900]   If you're a content creator,
[01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:18.780]   you can select this option to avoid playing
[01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:20.740]   licensed music from emotes.
[01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:22.380]   This setting does not apply to prevent,
[01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:24.060]   to event playlists, the feature content
[01:30:24.060 --> 01:30:26.140]   that is licensed like concerts.
[01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:29.420]   So it turns, it mutes it so that, you know,
[01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:31.700]   you can do the emote, but you won't get the--
[01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:33.140]   - Never gonna give you a,
[01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:35.860]   never gonna let you down.
[01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:37.260]   - Let's do a test.
[01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:38.100]   Never gonna--
[01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:40.060]   (laughing)
[01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:41.780]   - Is Carson ringing his voice right now?
[01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:45.940]   - Yeah, Carson, I'm just doing this to make Carson crazy.
[01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:46.900]   All right, let's take a little break,
[01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:51.700]   and then there were a number of passings this week,
[01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:54.420]   and we're gonna talk about those.
[01:30:54.420 --> 01:30:56.140]   Our show today has always brought to you
[01:30:56.140 --> 01:30:57.980]   from the Twit Last Pass studios,
[01:30:57.980 --> 01:31:00.420]   we're mighty proud of our relationship with Last Pass.
[01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:02.780]   In fact, we're gonna be at RSA.
[01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:06.780]   I may be wearing a full body bunny suit and a gas mask,
[01:31:06.780 --> 01:31:08.220]   but we're gonna be at RSA,
[01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:11.260]   and we're gonna be hosting the Last Pass party
[01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:12.140]   at Bourbon and Branch.
[01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:13.420]   This is such a fun party.
[01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:15.540]   We've done this last three years in a row,
[01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:17.020]   and it's so much fun.
[01:31:17.020 --> 01:31:21.260]   We invite anybody who's going to RSA to come to our party.
[01:31:21.260 --> 01:31:22.980]   I do wanna mention Last Pass,
[01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:25.100]   because not only do they host the studio in our,
[01:31:25.100 --> 01:31:26.580]   they're throwing a great party at RSA,
[01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:29.420]   but they are the password manager I use
[01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:32.340]   and have used for 10 years running.
[01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:35.060]   And everybody should use, we use it here at Twit.
[01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:37.060]   Every business should use this.
[01:31:37.060 --> 01:31:39.620]   They actually did a survey of businesses
[01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:44.580]   that it was called the Global Password Security Report,
[01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:47.820]   and they found out that employees on average
[01:31:47.820 --> 01:31:51.860]   at a business will reuse a password 13 times.
[01:31:51.860 --> 01:31:53.860]   That means 13 separate accounts.
[01:31:53.860 --> 01:31:55.980]   If any one of those accounts gets breached,
[01:31:55.980 --> 01:31:57.100]   they're all breached, right?
[01:31:57.100 --> 01:31:59.140]   That's what we've seen happen now,
[01:31:59.140 --> 01:32:00.980]   is you should never reuse passwords
[01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:02.700]   because once an account gets breached,
[01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:04.700]   if you use that password anywhere else,
[01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:06.860]   you're at risk everywhere else.
[01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:10.540]   The average score, Last Pass is a great security survey
[01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:12.620]   that they do in Last Pass.
[01:32:12.620 --> 01:32:14.860]   And when you first put in Last Pass in your business,
[01:32:14.860 --> 01:32:15.700]   they run that.
[01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:17.380]   They say on those new users,
[01:32:17.380 --> 01:32:19.620]   49% is the average score.
[01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:21.260]   That's not even an F.
[01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:23.900]   That's like completely failing.
[01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:27.020]   Means half, in general, it means about half the passwords
[01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:29.580]   are reused or very, very weak.
[01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:32.740]   The good news is Last Pass makes it easy to fix it,
[01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:35.540]   and from then on, you use strong, unique passwords
[01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:36.380]   everywhere you go.
[01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:38.420]   Last Pass keeps track,
[01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:40.140]   but they solve the authentication challenge
[01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:41.220]   in other ways too.
[01:32:41.220 --> 01:32:43.460]   They have single sign on.
[01:32:43.460 --> 01:32:44.860]   When you use Last Pass at work,
[01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:46.980]   you have over 100 customizable policies
[01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:48.100]   where you use those like crazy.
[01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:50.740]   For instance, we're required to factor authentication.
[01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:53.780]   We have minimum password requirements, things like that.
[01:32:53.780 --> 01:32:55.820]   They have lots of other features,
[01:32:55.820 --> 01:32:58.060]   MFA, multi-factor authentication.
[01:32:58.060 --> 01:33:00.460]   They can guarantee that an employee is actually
[01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:01.620]   who they say they are.
[01:33:01.620 --> 01:33:04.900]   MFA is brilliant, uses geolocation, IP address,
[01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:06.660]   and other things to really verify.
[01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:09.260]   In addition to the password and the second factor
[01:33:09.260 --> 01:33:11.420]   and everything else to really verify that person
[01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:12.260]   is the person.
[01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:16.020]   And remember, you're giving your employees access
[01:33:16.020 --> 01:33:18.540]   to your bank accounts, your databases, your website.
[01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:20.700]   I mean, they have the keys to the kingdom.
[01:33:20.700 --> 01:33:23.340]   You wanna make sure they're logging in securely,
[01:33:23.340 --> 01:33:25.020]   but it doesn't have to be painful.
[01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:27.060]   Just give them the Last Pass browser extension
[01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:30.460]   and start solving your access and authentication challenges.
[01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:31.620]   There's Last Pass families.
[01:33:31.620 --> 01:33:33.060]   That's what I use at home with Lisa
[01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:35.340]   so I can easily share passwords with her.
[01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:36.340]   There's lots of nice features,
[01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:37.900]   including the emergency access feature
[01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:40.380]   that lets me designate family members
[01:33:40.380 --> 01:33:42.780]   or whoever you want as the people who will get access
[01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:46.060]   to your password vault if something should happen to you.
[01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:47.300]   I know we don't like to think about that,
[01:33:47.300 --> 01:33:50.500]   but to me that's a huge weight off my mind.
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:55.140]   Last Pass uses all sorts of really sophisticated
[01:33:55.140 --> 01:33:57.260]   encryption technologies to make sure that
[01:33:57.260 --> 01:33:59.660]   your Last Pass data is not accessible anywhere
[01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:01.700]   except on your device.
[01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:04.620]   The keys used to decrypt and encrypt data
[01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:06.620]   are never sent to Last Pass servers.
[01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:09.740]   They're never accessible by Last Pass.
[01:34:09.740 --> 01:34:12.700]   And just to make sure that you feel comfortable,
[01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:14.700]   that you understand there the gold standard,
[01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:17.660]   they engage trusted world class third party security firms
[01:34:17.660 --> 01:34:19.580]   to conduct regular routine audits
[01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:21.820]   and testing of their service and infrastructure.
[01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:24.420]   It works. We love it. You will love it.
[01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:26.500]   We use Last Pass enterprise at Twit.
[01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:29.540]   I use Last Pass at home and I have for a decade now,
[01:34:29.540 --> 01:34:32.180]   you need Last Pass for you and your business
[01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:35.420]   with amazing features that both improve security
[01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:38.860]   across your company and make life easier for your users.
[01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:41.940]   Lastpass.com/twit, find out how they can help you.
[01:34:41.940 --> 01:34:45.340]   Lastpass.com/twit.
[01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:47.340]   We had a great week of Twit this week.
[01:34:47.340 --> 01:34:49.380]   I may not be back after I go to the party
[01:34:49.380 --> 01:34:51.500]   and I get the coronavirus, so I thought I'd play
[01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:53.580]   this memorial video.
[01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:56.580]   Previously on Twit.
[01:34:56.580 --> 01:34:58.580]   I break your news. I just put it in.
[01:34:58.580 --> 01:34:59.580]   I just saw it across my feet.
[01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:01.580]   Oh, wow. This looks really important.
[01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:03.580]   Mark Zuckerberg reportedly gets his armpits blow-dried
[01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:04.580]   before speeches.
[01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:05.580]   No.
[01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:08.580]   I was picturing the hand-dryers for bathrooms.
[01:35:08.580 --> 01:35:09.580]   That's like a giant U.
[01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:10.580]   Oh my God.
[01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:11.580]   And I just don't know how that works.
[01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:12.580]   Oh, no.
[01:35:12.580 --> 01:35:15.580]   That used to drown my feet after a shower.
[01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:16.580]   Oh, that makes sense.
[01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:17.580]   That makes sense.
[01:35:17.580 --> 01:35:18.580]   Tech News Weekly.
[01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:22.580]   Apple is reportedly looking at letting folks
[01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:26.580]   use third-party apps in the way that folks can use
[01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:28.580]   Apple's default apps.
[01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:29.580]   This week in Google.
[01:35:29.580 --> 01:35:32.580]   Android 11 has been released, the developer preview.
[01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:35.580]   Walking through Android 11, there's not a whole lot
[01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:38.580]   new to look at in the quick settings.
[01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:41.580]   There is now an option to put in a screen record.
[01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:42.580]   Windows Weekly.
[01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:45.580]   There's people on Reddit, Microsoft Answer, a forum,
[01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:47.580]   and now I'm hearing from people directly.
[01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:49.580]   They have a new brand new Surface Laptop 3,
[01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:53.580]   and they're noticing either a hairline crack along the corner
[01:35:53.580 --> 01:35:56.580]   or sometimes a crack across the entire screen.
[01:35:56.580 --> 01:36:00.580]   How is it an opening sort of screen issue?
[01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:02.580]   Because this screen is not affecting the time of the time.
[01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:03.580]   Stop touching it.
[01:36:03.580 --> 01:36:04.580]   You're going to break?
[01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:05.580]   You're right.
[01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:06.580]   I think it.
[01:36:06.580 --> 01:36:07.580]   To it.
[01:36:07.580 --> 01:36:08.580]   How many news reports do you have to read?
[01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:09.580]   We read the Tech News.
[01:36:09.580 --> 01:36:11.580]   So you don't have to.
[01:36:11.580 --> 01:36:14.580]   Thanks so much to Mike as Sergeant for filling in for me
[01:36:14.580 --> 01:36:18.580]   on Windows Weekly and to Jason Hell for hosting the
[01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:21.580]   this weekend Google I was gone on Wednesday and I appreciate it,
[01:36:21.580 --> 01:36:22.580]   guys.
[01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:24.580]   I promise not to get coronavirus.
[01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:25.580]   I promise.
[01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:26.580]   I'll be back next week.
[01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:29.580]   That's a promise you can't guarantee, everybody.
[01:36:29.580 --> 01:36:33.580]   I have an excellent immune system, and I'm going to wear it.
[01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:35.580]   I'm telling you, full body armor.
[01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:40.580]   Sad story, but I wanted to make sure you all knew that Larry
[01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:44.580]   Tesla, who you may not recognize his name, but was a very
[01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:49.580]   important person in the computers that we use today.
[01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:53.580]   He was at Xerox Park, the Palo Alto Research Center, when
[01:36:53.580 --> 01:36:59.580]   Steve Jobs and Apple employees very famously came to visit and
[01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:06.580]   find out about Park's windowed, menued, GUI computing.
[01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:13.580]   Tesla was actually offered later a job at Apple where his Dodge
[01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:18.580]   Valiant were a customized license plate saying no modes.
[01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:22.580]   He was very famous and really very influential with Apple for
[01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:23.580]   eliminating modes.
[01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:27.580]   Modes, the idea of a mode, if you've ever used the I, for
[01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:29.580]   instances that, you know, in V.I.
[01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:33.580]   you're either in the edit mode or the command mode.
[01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:35.580]   You can't do both.
[01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:38.580]   The idea of modes is built into DOS computing, command line
[01:37:38.580 --> 01:37:39.580]   based computing.
[01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:40.580]   You can do one thing at a time.
[01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:42.580]   But with this new GUI computing, he was really into the
[01:37:42.580 --> 01:37:43.580]   computing.
[01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:46.580]   He was really interested in eliminating modes.
[01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:49.580]   And Apple was early on very much about modeless computing.
[01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:51.580]   It's kind of funny because we're going back to modes a little
[01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:55.580]   bit the way the iPad works, for instance, you're full screen.
[01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:58.580]   You're doing what you're doing.
[01:37:58.580 --> 01:38:00.580]   And you have to switch to another screen if you want to do
[01:38:00.580 --> 01:38:01.580]   anything else.
[01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:04.580]   He was VP of AppleNet and Apple's Advanced Technology Group,
[01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:05.580]   ATG.
[01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:08.580]   He played a role in the development of products ranging from the
[01:38:08.580 --> 01:38:11.580]   computer to the Newton.
[01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:16.580]   And maybe his most important invention was cut, copy, and
[01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:19.580]   paste without Larry Tesler.
[01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:22.580]   We'd have to call him something else.
[01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:25.580]   I think we would have come up with that sometime eventually.
[01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:29.580]   But he's the guy who was credited with cut, copy, and paste.
[01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:34.580]   Larry Tesler passed away this week at the age of 74.
[01:38:34.580 --> 01:38:42.580]   A big name in computing, but the name you may not recognize,
[01:38:42.580 --> 01:38:46.580]   Bert Sutherland also passed away this week.
[01:38:46.580 --> 01:38:50.580]   He was a computer scientist, longtime manager of the
[01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:53.580]   Sun Microsystem Labs, the System Science Laboratory at Xerox
[01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:58.580]   Park, and the Computer Science Division of Bolt,
[01:38:58.580 --> 01:39:03.580]   which was a very ironic and new man where he helped develop what was
[01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:06.580]   eventually to become the Internet.
[01:39:06.580 --> 01:39:09.580]   He participated in the creation of the personal computer,
[01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:14.580]   microprocessors, small talk, Java, and the Internet.
[01:39:14.580 --> 01:39:15.580]   It's kind of amazing.
[01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:18.580]   These guys who were in the early days of this stuff, how much
[01:39:18.580 --> 01:39:20.580]   they could influence.
[01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:25.580]   His brother Ivan Savith, Southern Wind, and Carver Mead, and
[01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:29.580]   the KLSI, very large-scale integrated circuits at the
[01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:32.580]   California Institute of Technology.
[01:39:32.580 --> 01:39:33.580]   Pretty cool.
[01:39:33.580 --> 01:39:40.580]   So another farewell to Bert Sutherland, legend in computing.
[01:39:40.580 --> 01:39:44.580]   He was 83 when he passed away in his Mountain View home.
[01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:46.580]   I don't like to end on a sad note.
[01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:48.580]   Let me think of something fun.
[01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:53.580]   How about 40 years of Photoshop?
[01:39:53.580 --> 01:39:56.580]   How about 40 years of Photoshop?
[01:39:56.580 --> 01:39:58.580]   And how it brought us the deep -- the deep -- the deep
[01:39:58.580 --> 01:40:01.580]   -- the deep face without it?
[01:40:01.580 --> 01:40:04.580]   Without Photoshop, we wouldn't be where we are today with deep
[01:40:04.580 --> 01:40:05.580]   face.
[01:40:05.580 --> 01:40:08.580]   New iPad and new features coming to Photoshop.
[01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:15.580]   Photoshop 1.0 came out February 19, 1990 on Max System 6.
[01:40:15.580 --> 01:40:20.580]   That's -- to even run on System 6 is an amazing achievement.
[01:40:20.580 --> 01:40:24.580]   I mean, there was no memory management or barely any.
[01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:26.580]   That was the first OS, the Mac OS I ran.
[01:40:26.580 --> 01:40:27.580]   Really?
[01:40:27.580 --> 01:40:28.580]   Yeah.
[01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:29.580]   You were eight years old at the time.
[01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:30.580]   10.
[01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:31.580]   10.
[01:40:31.580 --> 01:40:32.580]   Of course.
[01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:33.580]   Close enough.
[01:40:33.580 --> 01:40:34.580]   So --
[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:35.580]   I'm older than Photoshop.
[01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:36.580]   How about that?
[01:40:36.580 --> 01:40:37.580]   Happy anniversary.
[01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:38.580]   Yeah.
[01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:39.580]   Barely.
[01:40:39.580 --> 01:40:40.580]   Happy anniversary.
[01:40:40.580 --> 01:40:41.580]   30 years of Photoshop.
[01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:42.580]   That's pretty cool.
[01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:47.580]   I just saw this Hot Wheels RC-Cyber-Crock community.
[01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:49.580]   I thought you'd like this one.
[01:40:49.580 --> 01:40:50.580]   You want this?
[01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:53.580]   There is now a mini Tesla Cybertruck.
[01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:56.580]   It even has the broken glass.
[01:40:56.580 --> 01:40:58.580]   It's $400.
[01:40:58.580 --> 01:41:00.580]   Well, yes.
[01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:01.580]   It's a collector's item.
[01:41:01.580 --> 01:41:04.580]   I think how much cheaper it is than an actual Tesla Cybertruck.
[01:41:04.580 --> 01:41:08.580]   It's not -- I could pre-order a Tesla for $100.
[01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:10.580]   I got a Tesla Black already.
[01:41:10.580 --> 01:41:12.580]   It's a remote control vehicle.
[01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:14.580]   One tenth the size is not made out of metal.
[01:41:14.580 --> 01:41:16.580]   It's made out of plastic.
[01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:18.580]   Yeah, that's a little -- it feels like that's a little --
[01:41:18.580 --> 01:41:23.580]   I mean, $200, $250, maybe $400.
[01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:24.580]   Like, it's $164.
[01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:27.580]   Well, there's a $164 model that's only $20, though.
[01:41:27.580 --> 01:41:30.580]   Oh, there's a tiny one for $20.
[01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:31.580]   It's $100.
[01:41:31.580 --> 01:41:32.580]   I get that.
[01:41:32.580 --> 01:41:33.580]   So Hot Wheels is still a thing?
[01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:34.580]   That's pretty cool.
[01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:36.580]   Hot Wheels is forever a thing.
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:38.580]   I always wanted a Hot Wheels when I was a kid.
[01:41:38.580 --> 01:41:41.580]   They're definitely in the collector's market now, though.
[01:41:41.580 --> 01:41:45.580]   Yeah, a lot of the things that you say come out are sort of special,
[01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:47.580]   exclusive to a certain brand.
[01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:50.580]   They do a lot of licensing of cars and stuff.
[01:41:50.580 --> 01:41:54.580]   So there's a lot of adults buying Hot Wheels now.
[01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:56.580]   Are my old ones worth anything then?
[01:41:56.580 --> 01:41:58.580]   Because I got some of my parents at it.
[01:41:58.580 --> 01:42:00.580]   There are items actually out of Toister, not that long.
[01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:03.580]   I use Toister that had vintage stuff.
[01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:07.580]   And some of those old Hot Wheels in terrible condition are worth 50,
[01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:09.580]   60, 70 in good condition.
[01:42:09.580 --> 01:42:10.580]   Wow, glory.
[01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:11.580]   Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[01:42:11.580 --> 01:42:12.580]   Glory.
[01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:13.580]   I got it.
[01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:14.580]   Glory.
[01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:15.580]   Excuse me, Laurie.
[01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:16.580]   What are you doing?
[01:42:16.580 --> 01:42:17.580]   These aren't worth anything.
[01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:20.580]   And if you want to send them to me, I was in your prepaid shipping package
[01:42:20.580 --> 01:42:22.580]   and you can ship them all out to me.
[01:42:22.580 --> 01:42:25.580]   I couldn't imagine you getting two to three cents for those things.
[01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:27.580]   I mean, not to take a lot for you.
[01:42:27.580 --> 01:42:31.580]   If you want to get rid of their clutter enough to happen to like Hot Wheels a lot,
[01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:32.580]   I'm going to do you a favor.
[01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:33.580]   I'll give you a buck.
[01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:34.580]   There we go.
[01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:35.580]   There we go.
[01:42:35.580 --> 01:42:36.580]   Laurie, you're killing me out here.
[01:42:36.580 --> 01:42:37.580]   You're in nostalgia.
[01:42:37.580 --> 01:42:39.580]   You're doing it.
[01:42:39.580 --> 01:42:45.580]   Oh, and JJ Stone, even though he looks like Papa Smurf is not going to miss a trick on this one.
[01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:48.580]   Thank you, Owen, for joining us.
[01:42:48.580 --> 01:42:50.580]   As always, it's a pleasure.
[01:42:50.580 --> 01:42:53.580]   IQMZ.com, his raising and ninja podcast with his daughter is so good.
[01:42:53.580 --> 01:42:55.580]   And I'm doing IQMZ Tech's tomorrow.
[01:42:55.580 --> 01:42:56.580]   It'll be live.
[01:42:56.580 --> 01:42:59.580]   It won't be as good as this, but I try my best sometimes to talk tech.
[01:42:59.580 --> 01:43:01.580]   And I'm coming out there in April, but now I'm scared.
[01:43:01.580 --> 01:43:04.580]   I was going to come hang out and do some shows live with you.
[01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:05.580]   Yes.
[01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:09.580]   But now I'm thinking I'm saving some mentees for you.
[01:43:09.580 --> 01:43:12.580]   No, see, I got to have some of these.
[01:43:12.580 --> 01:43:14.580]   I'll come to the gate before I get there.
[01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:17.580]   And I'm like, "Oh, this is my life's all in Clorox."
[01:43:17.580 --> 01:43:19.580]   You know what we could do?
[01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:24.580]   If we were YouTubers, we could both have a minty and see you could talk first.
[01:43:24.580 --> 01:43:25.580]   That kind of would be fun.
[01:43:25.580 --> 01:43:28.580]   When I get out there, we're going to be TikToking all week long.
[01:43:28.580 --> 01:43:30.580]   It'd be the minty challenge.
[01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:31.580]   Thank you, Owen.
[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:32.580]   Always a pleasure.
[01:43:32.580 --> 01:43:33.580]   Great to see you.
[01:43:33.580 --> 01:43:35.580]   Thanks to to Laurie Gill, who's doing double duty.
[01:43:35.580 --> 01:43:38.580]   She's going to be back on Tuesday for a Mac break weekly.
[01:43:38.580 --> 01:43:40.580]   She sings for Sick Burn.
[01:43:40.580 --> 01:43:42.580]   She is managing editor at iMour.com.
[01:43:42.580 --> 01:43:44.580]   Doing it all on the Renaissance one.
[01:43:44.580 --> 01:43:47.580]   And her significant other has these softest hands.
[01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:50.580]   You're from using working hands.
[01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:51.580]   Yeah, we talked about...
[01:43:51.580 --> 01:43:52.580]   Are we plugging?
[01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:54.580]   Are we plugging something that you needed sponsorship for?
[01:43:54.580 --> 01:43:56.580]   Did that make it into the show Carson on Tuesday?
[01:43:56.580 --> 01:43:57.580]   We were talking about...
[01:43:57.580 --> 01:43:58.580]   No, I didn't.
[01:43:58.580 --> 01:43:59.580]   Moisturizing.
[01:43:59.580 --> 01:44:02.580]   For some reason I don't...
[01:44:02.580 --> 01:44:05.580]   But ever since I've been using helping hands, can you tell?
[01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:06.580]   Oh, great.
[01:44:06.580 --> 01:44:07.580]   You are using it.
[01:44:07.580 --> 01:44:08.580]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:08.580 --> 01:44:09.580]   It's nice, right?
[01:44:09.580 --> 01:44:10.580]   Yeah.
[01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:11.580]   Yeah.
[01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:12.580]   Thank you, Laurie Gill.
[01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:15.580]   Dan Moran, I hope we didn't scare you.
[01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:16.580]   Come back soon.
[01:44:16.580 --> 01:44:18.580]   It'd be my pleasure.
[01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:22.580]   I can take this opportunity to plug my book because I'm an author as well.
[01:44:22.580 --> 01:44:23.580]   Oh, yes.
[01:44:23.580 --> 01:44:24.580]   A writer and a writer.
[01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:25.580]   Nice.
[01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:30.580]   Yeah, so my most recent book, The Bayern Agenda, which is a science fiction spy novel.
[01:44:30.580 --> 01:44:33.580]   Came out last year at the sequel to It Comes Out in May.
[01:44:33.580 --> 01:44:37.580]   Pre-orders are open now on Amazon in all fine bookstores from around the world.
[01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:38.580]   Nice.
[01:44:38.580 --> 01:44:39.580]   So check that out if you're interested.
[01:44:39.580 --> 01:44:42.580]   And you also have the Caledonian Gambit?
[01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:44.580]   Yep, that was my first novel from 2017.
[01:44:44.580 --> 01:44:47.580]   And they make a nice little gift package.
[01:44:47.580 --> 01:44:53.580]   The Bayern Agenda is book one in the Galactic Cold War saga.
[01:44:53.580 --> 01:44:54.580]   So there'll be more.
[01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:55.580]   More to...
[01:44:55.580 --> 01:44:57.580]   Hopefully more to come, number two is out in May.
[01:44:57.580 --> 01:44:58.580]   Can't wait.
[01:44:58.580 --> 01:44:59.580]   How is it writing?
[01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:01.580]   You like writing novels?
[01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:06.580]   I love writing novels one wanted to do for my entire life, so I'm glad I get a chance to do it.
[01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:07.580]   It's hard work though.
[01:45:07.580 --> 01:45:08.580]   I'll tell you that.
[01:45:08.580 --> 01:45:10.580]   It's kind of like a little bit of podcasting.
[01:45:10.580 --> 01:45:11.580]   Yeah.
[01:45:11.580 --> 01:45:12.580]   It is.
[01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:14.580]   I work at home, you know, and all my work is a little solitary.
[01:45:14.580 --> 01:45:18.580]   I enjoy the podcasting because it's like the only time I get to talk to people all day.
[01:45:18.580 --> 01:45:21.580]   Yeah, I know how you feel.
[01:45:21.580 --> 01:45:27.580]   Also regular on the incomparable Jason Snell's podcast, he writes for the six color.com.
[01:45:27.580 --> 01:45:30.580]   He and Micah do clockwise.
[01:45:30.580 --> 01:45:33.580]   You also do the rebound on relay FM.
[01:45:33.580 --> 01:45:36.580]   And the nerdy game show inconceivable.
[01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:39.580]   And I hope you say it like that.
[01:45:39.580 --> 01:45:40.580]   Oh, indeed.
[01:45:40.580 --> 01:45:41.580]   Inconsceivable.
[01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:42.580]   Thank you so much.
[01:45:42.580 --> 01:45:43.580]   Great to have you today.
[01:45:43.580 --> 01:45:44.580]   Inconsceivable.
[01:45:44.580 --> 01:45:45.580]   Inconsceivable.
[01:45:45.580 --> 01:45:48.580]   I do not think that word means what you think it means.
[01:45:48.580 --> 01:45:54.580]   We do this week in tech Sunday afternoons, 230 Pacific, 530 Eastern, 2230 UTC.
[01:45:54.580 --> 01:45:56.580]   It's always a lot of fun.
[01:45:56.580 --> 01:45:57.580]   You can watch us do it live.
[01:45:57.580 --> 01:46:01.580]   There's a few ways, as I mentioned, we have a studio that's open to all.
[01:46:01.580 --> 01:46:05.580]   Our studio audience is always very welcome.
[01:46:05.580 --> 01:46:11.580]   If you want to be here on a Sunday afternoon, if you're in the Petaluma area, it's in Northern
[01:46:11.580 --> 01:46:14.580]   California, just email tickets@twit.tv.
[01:46:14.580 --> 01:46:16.580]   We'll put a chair out for you.
[01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:20.580]   Anywhere in the world you can watch or listen to a live stream of Twit.tv/live.
[01:46:20.580 --> 01:46:23.580]   But of course, you know, I know, you got a life.
[01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:24.580]   We all have a live.
[01:46:24.580 --> 01:46:26.580]   So listen to the on-demand version.
[01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:31.580]   They call that thing a podcast and you'll get all of our shows either from our website
[01:46:31.580 --> 01:46:36.580]   .tv, in this case, Twit.tv/thisweekintech.
[01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:41.580]   I actually just go to Twit.tv and click shows because that's the one URL that's complicated.
[01:46:41.580 --> 01:46:42.580]   You can also subscribe.
[01:46:42.580 --> 01:46:44.580]   In fact, you would do me a favor.
[01:46:44.580 --> 01:46:48.580]   Subscribe to your audio or video on your favorite podcast player.
[01:46:48.580 --> 01:46:52.580]   That way you'll get it every week and they'll get a little signal that, "Hey, maybe this
[01:46:52.580 --> 01:46:53.580]   show isn't dead."
[01:46:53.580 --> 01:46:55.580]   So, you know, that's always good.
[01:46:55.580 --> 01:47:01.580]   So that was a little more negative than I planned.
[01:47:01.580 --> 01:47:03.580]   Subscribe in your favorite podcast.
[01:47:03.580 --> 01:47:05.580]   We would love to see at Bourbon and Branch on Wednesday.
[01:47:05.580 --> 01:47:08.580]   And I don't think anybody needs to wear a mask.
[01:47:08.580 --> 01:47:10.580]   No, it's just a nice bunch of people.
[01:47:10.580 --> 01:47:12.580]   But keep your hands off.
[01:47:12.580 --> 01:47:14.580]   They have very nice food.
[01:47:14.580 --> 01:47:15.580]   Please use talks.
[01:47:15.580 --> 01:47:16.580]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:47:16.580 --> 01:47:17.580]   We'll see you next time.
[01:47:17.580 --> 01:47:20.580]   Another Twit is in the can.
[01:47:20.580 --> 01:47:21.580]   Yeah!
[01:47:21.580 --> 01:47:26.580]   Yeah!
[01:47:26.580 --> 01:47:31.580]   Do the Twit.
[01:47:31.580 --> 01:47:35.580]   All right, we got my personal physician on the line.
[01:47:35.580 --> 01:47:37.580]   Dr. Mom, Lillian Banshek.
[01:47:37.580 --> 01:47:39.580]   Hello, Dr. Mom.
[01:47:39.580 --> 01:47:40.580]   Hey, Leo.
[01:47:40.580 --> 01:47:41.580]   Hi, guys.
[01:47:41.580 --> 01:47:42.580]   How's everybody doing?
[01:47:42.580 --> 01:47:43.580]   Are we all staying safe?
[01:47:43.580 --> 01:47:44.580]   Yes.
[01:47:44.580 --> 01:47:45.580]   Yes.
[01:47:45.580 --> 01:47:48.580]   Now, you're not an epidemiologist, but you're a physician.
[01:47:48.580 --> 01:47:49.580]   Correct.
[01:47:49.580 --> 01:47:52.580]   And you've been, you know, trained in all this stuff.
[01:47:52.580 --> 01:47:53.580]   Are they preparing at the hospital?
[01:47:53.580 --> 01:47:59.580]   Do they prepare for influx of new patients and things or what?
[01:47:59.580 --> 01:48:01.580]   They're prepared for any kind of epidemic.
[01:48:01.580 --> 01:48:06.580]   What happens is they go into what's called an emergency mode.
[01:48:06.580 --> 01:48:08.580]   They have special triage centers.
[01:48:08.580 --> 01:48:12.580]   Somebody comes, if you go into a hospital right now and you're coughing and you have a fever,
[01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:15.580]   they're going to ask you, have you been in an international airport?
[01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:17.580]   Have you been around people who've been overseas?
[01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:19.580]   Have you been in an international airport?
[01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:20.580]   Yes.
[01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:21.580]   You're being stuck in a private room by yourself.
[01:48:21.580 --> 01:48:22.580]   Although, isn't that about to change?
[01:48:22.580 --> 01:48:27.580]   Because it has been contained up to now in a few locations.
[01:48:27.580 --> 01:48:32.580]   But as time goes by and those people travel and stuff, it's leaking out.
[01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:35.580]   And I know, are those questions even germane anymore?
[01:48:35.580 --> 01:48:37.580]   Oh, they are.
[01:48:37.580 --> 01:48:42.580]   I have a friend of mine who's worked with the CDC and WHO in the past and she travels internationally.
[01:48:42.580 --> 01:48:46.580]   And she's got a head cold right now and she's terrified because she's coughing.
[01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:49.580]   And the rascal, have you been in an international airport?
[01:48:49.580 --> 01:48:51.580]   Yeah, three times in the past month.
[01:48:51.580 --> 01:48:53.580]   Do you know people have traveled overseas?
[01:48:53.580 --> 01:48:54.580]   Yeah.
[01:48:54.580 --> 01:48:57.580]   She's afraid she's going to get stuck in a slammer for two weeks.
[01:48:57.580 --> 01:48:58.580]   Well, maybe she should.
[01:48:58.580 --> 01:49:00.580]   Are she sure it's a head cold?
[01:49:00.580 --> 01:49:04.580]   Yeah, she sure it's a head cold because the same one I got, she gave it to me.
[01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:06.580]   Are you sure it's a head cold?
[01:49:06.580 --> 01:49:07.580]   How do you know?
[01:49:07.580 --> 01:49:08.580]   That's for sure it's a head cold.
[01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:13.580]   How could, couldn't it be the first signs of COVID-19?
[01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:14.580]   Where's my life so?
[01:49:14.580 --> 01:49:16.580]   I got a term on my account.
[01:49:16.580 --> 01:49:18.580]   We can't get it through Skype, right?
[01:49:18.580 --> 01:49:19.580]   Sure.
[01:49:19.580 --> 01:49:25.580]   No, but I will tell you, I flew up to San Jose on Wednesday and came back yesterday.
[01:49:25.580 --> 01:49:26.580]   Yeah.
[01:49:26.580 --> 01:49:29.580]   And I went through the San Diego airport, which is where they brought in all the patients.
[01:49:29.580 --> 01:49:30.580]   Yes, yes.
[01:49:30.580 --> 01:49:31.580]   Who were on that ship.
[01:49:31.580 --> 01:49:34.580]   Plus there were some airports in San Jose too.
[01:49:34.580 --> 01:49:38.580]   Yeah, the airport smelled of Clorox and Lysol.
[01:49:38.580 --> 01:49:39.580]   Yes.
[01:49:39.580 --> 01:49:41.580]   And everybody was wearing masks improperly.
[01:49:41.580 --> 01:49:43.580]   I had one guy wearing it.
[01:49:43.580 --> 01:49:46.580]   The mask is below his nose, which of course, as you know, good whatsoever.
[01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:49.580]   And they're wearing gloves and everybody is paralyzed.
[01:49:49.580 --> 01:49:52.580]   I want to buy, tell me if I should buy this mask.
[01:49:52.580 --> 01:49:54.580]   This mask has a respirator.
[01:49:54.580 --> 01:49:56.580]   It has eye protection.
[01:49:56.580 --> 01:49:59.580]   No virus is going to, it's $180.
[01:49:59.580 --> 01:50:03.580]   No virus is going to get in with this, right?
[01:50:03.580 --> 01:50:05.580]   No virus is going to get in, but I'll be very serious.
[01:50:05.580 --> 01:50:07.580]   People should not get that.
[01:50:07.580 --> 01:50:10.580]   Do you go scuba diving or have you ever gone scuba diving?
[01:50:10.580 --> 01:50:11.580]   Yes, I have.
[01:50:11.580 --> 01:50:14.580]   Okay, that's like breathing through a mouthpiece.
[01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:15.580]   Ah.
[01:50:15.580 --> 01:50:16.580]   It's very difficult.
[01:50:16.580 --> 01:50:17.580]   People have felt really--
[01:50:17.580 --> 01:50:19.580]   You wouldn't want to wear it for too long.
[01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:20.580]   Yeah.
[01:50:20.580 --> 01:50:21.580]   No, you got to suck the air in and stuff.
[01:50:21.580 --> 01:50:22.580]   It's hard work.
[01:50:22.580 --> 01:50:26.580]   A properly fit medical grade N95 works.
[01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:28.580]   That gloves.
[01:50:28.580 --> 01:50:35.580]   So I found, from the fires, I found a box of 3M N95 masks.
[01:50:35.580 --> 01:50:40.580]   But you point out that N95 is kind of, this is what I have.
[01:50:40.580 --> 01:50:42.580]   I bought these a while ago.
[01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:43.580]   Well, I sent you the link.
[01:50:43.580 --> 01:50:47.580]   I can shoot it over to you again of the CDC standards for what constitutes an N95.
[01:50:47.580 --> 01:50:49.580]   But it's got the check mark.
[01:50:49.580 --> 01:50:50.580]   It says it's N95.
[01:50:50.580 --> 01:50:53.580]   Yeah, there's N95 and there's N95.
[01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:55.580]   Well, that sucks.
[01:50:55.580 --> 01:50:57.580]   We were just talking about that.
[01:50:57.580 --> 01:50:59.580]   There's gold plate in there, there's gold plate.
[01:50:59.580 --> 01:51:00.580]   So is this--
[01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:01.580]   That's right.
[01:51:01.580 --> 01:51:04.580]   This is really for people who are doing a lot of sanding.
[01:51:04.580 --> 01:51:06.580]   It's designed to-- yeah.
[01:51:06.580 --> 01:51:09.580]   It's designed to keep the dust and all that stuff out of your--
[01:51:09.580 --> 01:51:12.580]   Will it help if I fit it right?
[01:51:12.580 --> 01:51:18.580]   If I put it over my nose and make sure there's no leakage on the edges, will this help?
[01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:21.580]   Yeah, but where are you going to go to get the fit test?
[01:51:21.580 --> 01:51:26.580]   When I was working in the hospital every six months or if we lost more than 10 pounds,
[01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:29.580]   had dental work, anything like that, we had to go get remasked fit.
[01:51:29.580 --> 01:51:30.580]   Well, okay.
[01:51:30.580 --> 01:51:31.580]   All of those things will change.
[01:51:31.580 --> 01:51:32.580]   What about this?
[01:51:32.580 --> 01:51:34.580]   Oh, Dr. The beard goes.
[01:51:34.580 --> 01:51:37.580]   You can't have a beard with N95, even if it's blue.
[01:51:37.580 --> 01:51:39.580]   No, you can't.
[01:51:39.580 --> 01:51:40.580]   It won't fit.
[01:51:40.580 --> 01:51:43.580]   Hey, I'm prepared to rip this thing off.
[01:51:43.580 --> 01:51:44.580]   This is a strap on beard.
[01:51:44.580 --> 01:51:45.580]   You guys understand.
[01:51:45.580 --> 01:51:46.580]   I'm totally prepared.
[01:51:46.580 --> 01:51:47.580]   What about--
[01:51:47.580 --> 01:51:48.580]   Whatever I need to do.
[01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:55.580]   What about this N95 mask that has your face on it so that you can still do face recognition?
[01:51:55.580 --> 01:51:57.580]   Which better not work.
[01:51:57.580 --> 01:51:58.580]   That strikes me.
[01:51:58.580 --> 01:52:00.580]   That strikes me as a joke.
[01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:01.580]   It is kind of a joke.
[01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:02.580]   I mean, yeah.
[01:52:02.580 --> 01:52:08.580]   The bottom line is if you're really serious about worrying about N95 and you're working
[01:52:08.580 --> 01:52:12.580]   a hospital emergency room anywhere where you're going to have people coming in who are coughing
[01:52:12.580 --> 01:52:16.180]   and sick and it may potentially have been in contact with this, you want to mask the
[01:52:16.180 --> 01:52:17.180]   fit properly.
[01:52:17.180 --> 01:52:18.180]   You don't want to joke.
[01:52:18.180 --> 01:52:19.180]   No.
[01:52:19.180 --> 01:52:20.180]   But we're not in the hospital.
[01:52:20.180 --> 01:52:22.180]   We're just normal people who are worried.
[01:52:22.180 --> 01:52:25.580]   I've got to go to a conference on Wednesday, the RSA conference.
[01:52:25.580 --> 01:52:28.580]   Already, mobile world conference was canceled.
[01:52:28.580 --> 01:52:33.780]   The GDC, which is coming up, the Game Developers Conference, Sony and Facebook have pulled
[01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:34.780]   out.
[01:52:34.780 --> 01:52:37.420]   Sony has pulled out of PAX East.
[01:52:37.420 --> 01:52:41.580]   I feel like the conferences are just as risky.
[01:52:41.580 --> 01:52:42.580]   Are they?
[01:52:42.580 --> 01:52:43.580]   We start to show.
[01:52:43.580 --> 01:52:44.580]   They absolutely--
[01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:45.580]   Sort of.
[01:52:45.580 --> 01:52:46.580]   Think of--
[01:52:46.580 --> 01:52:50.380]   Well, if you think about it, every time you go to CES, you get convention cred.
[01:52:50.380 --> 01:52:53.580]   Now, did you hear Venice canceled Carnival?
[01:52:53.580 --> 01:52:54.580]   Really?
[01:52:54.580 --> 01:52:55.580]   Now it's--
[01:52:55.580 --> 01:52:56.580]   It's part of--
[01:52:56.580 --> 01:52:57.580]   Now this is serious.
[01:52:57.580 --> 01:53:01.180]   Everybody's wearing those plague doctor masks.
[01:53:01.180 --> 01:53:02.180]   Isn't that good?
[01:53:02.180 --> 01:53:07.580]   Isn't that kind of a medieval N95 mask?
[01:53:07.580 --> 01:53:11.100]   Yeah, they used to stop them full of straw thinking that that would get away the evil
[01:53:11.100 --> 01:53:12.100]   vapors.
[01:53:12.100 --> 01:53:13.500]   I'm waiting for Brazil to cancel it.
[01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:15.580]   The Tokyo Olympics may get fried.
[01:53:15.580 --> 01:53:16.580]   What?
[01:53:16.580 --> 01:53:21.980]   But no, the president says once it warms up, we don't have to worry anymore.
[01:53:21.980 --> 01:53:22.980]   Isn't that true?
[01:53:22.980 --> 01:53:26.780]   But the president doesn't believe in global warming, so it's never going to warm up.
[01:53:26.780 --> 01:53:30.500]   No, seriously, doesn't this stuff go away in the summer?
[01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:32.100]   It's only a winter phenomenon.
[01:53:32.100 --> 01:53:34.100]   This is the problem we don't know.
[01:53:34.100 --> 01:53:35.500]   Oh, we're screwed.
[01:53:35.500 --> 01:53:39.300]   If you're going to compare it to classic flu season, that's October through June.
[01:53:39.300 --> 01:53:40.300]   OK.
[01:53:40.300 --> 01:53:42.260]   Maybe it's going to go away.
[01:53:42.260 --> 01:53:46.940]   Maybe it's not-- the catch is-- remember I told you on the tech guy show.
[01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:53.940]   We know that it came most likely from the pangolin, which is a Chinese animal that people
[01:53:53.940 --> 01:53:55.100]   eat over there.
[01:53:55.100 --> 01:53:56.700]   It has a shell like an armadillo.
[01:53:56.700 --> 01:53:59.820]   They use it for making things out of it.
[01:53:59.820 --> 01:54:03.140]   Once it got to humans, they were hoping it would jump from human to human.
[01:54:03.140 --> 01:54:05.220]   Well, it's jumping from human to human.
[01:54:05.220 --> 01:54:07.060]   And that's why we don't know what's going to go on.
[01:54:07.060 --> 01:54:10.620]   Much like the pangolin jumps from tree to tree.
[01:54:10.620 --> 01:54:12.100]   Exactly.
[01:54:12.100 --> 01:54:17.980]   But if it can jump from human to human and it keeps spreading, there you go.
[01:54:17.980 --> 01:54:18.980]   There's your pangolin.
[01:54:18.980 --> 01:54:19.980]   Don't eat that, folks.
[01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:20.980]   Stop eating.
[01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:22.980]   No more pangilishes.
[01:54:22.980 --> 01:54:30.940]   I don't-- so, Dr. Mom, for a normal person who may be planning to go to a tech conference
[01:54:30.940 --> 01:54:37.500]   this week, i.e. me, what should I do?
[01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:39.220]   A lot of Purell.
[01:54:39.220 --> 01:54:40.740]   Carry your hand sanitizer with you.
[01:54:40.740 --> 01:54:42.580]   Oh, I don't have to worry about airborne particles.
[01:54:42.580 --> 01:54:44.540]   No, no, I'm just giving you a list.
[01:54:44.540 --> 01:54:46.780]   Oh, you should wear a mask.
[01:54:46.780 --> 01:54:47.780]   I should wear a mask.
[01:54:47.780 --> 01:54:48.780]   What kind of mask?
[01:54:48.780 --> 01:54:51.380]   Make sure it fits an N95.
[01:54:51.380 --> 01:54:54.020]   What you need to do is put it on your face.
[01:54:54.020 --> 01:54:57.300]   Suck in and cover the vent.
[01:54:57.300 --> 01:54:58.300]   And it should go--
[01:54:58.300 --> 01:54:59.300]   Make sure it sucks.
[01:54:59.300 --> 01:55:01.300]   It should be a seal.
[01:55:01.300 --> 01:55:02.300]   Yeah.
[01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:09.580]   So, Dr. Mom, I'm on the FDA.gov website and they are suggesting N95 respirators for use
[01:55:09.580 --> 01:55:11.180]   by the public.
[01:55:11.180 --> 01:55:16.500]   And they have listed out 3M particulate respirator and then they have some numbers behind them.
[01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:17.500]   So that's the one I got.
[01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:18.500]   I can wear that.
[01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:23.500]   Maybe not though, because I'm doing just a general search on Amazon right now and I can't find
[01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:27.540]   the one that specifies the number, which is 80, 70 F.
[01:55:27.540 --> 01:55:28.540]   They're all sold out.
[01:55:28.540 --> 01:55:29.540]   Maybe what?
[01:55:29.540 --> 01:55:30.540]   Yeah.
[01:55:30.540 --> 01:55:34.420]   So, the numbers-- do yours have the number 86, 70 F or 86, 12 F?
[01:55:34.420 --> 01:55:36.140]   No, mine's 85, 11.
[01:55:36.140 --> 01:55:37.140]   So you say and that's not good.
[01:55:37.140 --> 01:55:38.140]   That's not what I'm saying.
[01:55:38.140 --> 01:55:39.140]   That's not--
[01:55:39.140 --> 01:55:40.140]   Oh!
[01:55:40.140 --> 01:55:41.140]   That's not--
[01:55:41.140 --> 01:55:42.140]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:55:42.140 --> 01:55:43.140]   Nope, that's so good.
[01:55:43.140 --> 01:55:44.140]   Yeah.
[01:55:44.140 --> 01:55:45.140]   So, I can't wear this.
[01:55:45.140 --> 01:55:49.780]   If I'm going to RSA, I have to put my head in a saran bag or something or--
[01:55:49.780 --> 01:55:52.420]   Or just go find that particular--
[01:55:52.420 --> 01:55:53.420]   I thought masks--
[01:55:53.420 --> 01:55:57.780]   I thought masks were more effective for those-- the people who already have the disease
[01:55:57.780 --> 01:56:00.180]   and the risk of spreading it rather than--
[01:56:00.180 --> 01:56:01.180]   No.
[01:56:01.180 --> 01:56:04.980]   Well, since you almost touched your face four times there, no.
[01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:06.980]   The whole idea is we think--
[01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:07.980]   Fair.
[01:56:07.980 --> 01:56:12.180]   We think on you, people will touch the surfaces with the viruses on it.
[01:56:12.180 --> 01:56:13.180]   Right.
[01:56:13.180 --> 01:56:14.180]   You shouldn't touch your face.
[01:56:14.180 --> 01:56:17.780]   And when you were in surgical training, you were taught, you were not too.
[01:56:17.780 --> 01:56:19.980]   But do you ever touch your face now, Dr. Mom?
[01:56:19.980 --> 01:56:21.500]   You're a force of habit.
[01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:22.500]   No.
[01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:25.740]   I'm either walking around with my hands up in the air like this or you learn to walk around
[01:56:25.740 --> 01:56:26.740]   like this.
[01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:27.740]   Okay.
[01:56:27.740 --> 01:56:28.740]   So--
[01:56:28.740 --> 01:56:29.740]   That's a good idea.
[01:56:29.740 --> 01:56:30.740]   I'm going to wear a--
[01:56:30.740 --> 01:56:33.620]   So Black people aren't going to get sick because we're used to walking around like this is
[01:56:33.620 --> 01:56:34.620]   a cop all the time.
[01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:35.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:56:35.620 --> 01:56:36.620]   Oh, God.
[01:56:36.620 --> 01:56:37.620]   You're good.
[01:56:37.620 --> 01:56:38.620]   I'm not going there.
[01:56:38.620 --> 01:56:39.620]   I am not going there.
[01:56:39.620 --> 01:56:40.620]   All right.
[01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:41.620]   I can go there, Dr. Mom.
[01:56:41.620 --> 01:56:42.620]   Oh, Dr. Goode, you don't have to.
[01:56:42.620 --> 01:56:43.620]   I already wear it.
[01:56:43.620 --> 01:56:44.620]   All right.
[01:56:44.620 --> 01:56:46.380]   Well, Lillian, thank you.
[01:56:46.380 --> 01:56:48.500]   You've really not encouraged me at all.
[01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:51.620]   Your advice in the chat room was you should not go.
[01:56:51.620 --> 01:56:52.620]   Yeah.
[01:56:52.620 --> 01:56:57.460]   Purell and a properly fitting N95 because unfortunately you're going to have people
[01:56:57.460 --> 01:57:00.180]   from all over and you do not know who's been exposed to what--
[01:57:00.180 --> 01:57:01.180]   Right.
[01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:03.740]   --and we don't know how transmissible this thing is.
[01:57:03.740 --> 01:57:06.580]   That's the problem is there's a lot of unknowns right now.
[01:57:06.580 --> 01:57:07.580]   Yeah.
[01:57:07.580 --> 01:57:08.580]   Exactly.
[01:57:08.580 --> 01:57:12.380]   So-- but I can't-- I'm not going to be able to find an N95 mask because they're sold
[01:57:12.380 --> 01:57:13.380]   out.
[01:57:13.380 --> 01:57:14.380]   The hospital--
[01:57:14.380 --> 01:57:19.420]   Well, if you don't go on Amazon, maybe you can find it in a better, you know, like something
[01:57:19.420 --> 01:57:21.940]   more like medical specific or something like that.
[01:57:21.940 --> 01:57:23.700]   No, that's your problem.
[01:57:23.700 --> 01:57:28.980]   As I said, I have friends who work with the CDC, WHO and such and one friend of mine who
[01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:33.900]   actually used to go into the caves and Kazakhstan and smuggle in vaccines to the kids.
[01:57:33.900 --> 01:57:37.220]   And she says, "You can't get the real ones right now for lover money."
[01:57:37.220 --> 01:57:38.220]   Oh, wow.
[01:57:38.220 --> 01:57:41.140]   And then the hospitals have them, they are hoarding them.
[01:57:41.140 --> 01:57:42.140]   Wow.
[01:57:42.140 --> 01:57:46.100]   So the hospital puts you into a negative pressure room where you sit in the room and all the
[01:57:46.100 --> 01:57:49.620]   air is sucked in and then out through a HEPA filter.
[01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:53.420]   So anything that you breathe in there doesn't get out to the rest of the people.
[01:57:53.420 --> 01:57:55.260]   So you go into a negative pressure.
[01:57:55.260 --> 01:57:56.260]   Wait a minute.
[01:57:56.260 --> 01:57:59.140]   My 8511 is OK.
[01:57:59.140 --> 01:58:03.300]   I just found that on the CDC website.
[01:58:03.300 --> 01:58:04.300]   It says--
[01:58:04.300 --> 01:58:05.300]   Okay.
[01:58:05.300 --> 01:58:06.300]   It says yes.
[01:58:06.300 --> 01:58:07.300]   Okay.
[01:58:07.300 --> 01:58:08.300]   Yeah.
[01:58:08.300 --> 01:58:09.300]   Okay.
[01:58:09.300 --> 01:58:10.300]   Good.
[01:58:10.300 --> 01:58:11.300]   Yeah.
[01:58:11.300 --> 01:58:13.540]   I can't get seriously where that mask there.
[01:58:13.540 --> 01:58:15.940]   Anytime you're going to a group--
[01:58:15.940 --> 01:58:18.180]   Now on the other hand, I don't listen to my own advice.
[01:58:18.180 --> 01:58:22.780]   I was just in a knitting convention where there were people from all over the world.
[01:58:22.780 --> 01:58:25.380]   And we're all sitting there coughing and sneezing and talking to each other.
[01:58:25.380 --> 01:58:26.380]   None of us will wear a mask.
[01:58:26.380 --> 01:58:29.380]   You can't get coronavirus from knitters.
[01:58:29.380 --> 01:58:31.980]   You've been surprised.
[01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:33.540]   All right.
[01:58:33.540 --> 01:58:34.540]   Here's the instructions.
[01:58:34.540 --> 01:58:35.540]   I'm going to read these.
[01:58:35.540 --> 01:58:37.940]   I'm going to-- you think they're going to mock me?
[01:58:37.940 --> 01:58:42.180]   We're having an event at the last pass event on Wednesday after RSA.
[01:58:42.180 --> 01:58:43.180]   They think they're going to--
[01:58:43.180 --> 01:58:45.300]   Put a last pass logo on the front.
[01:58:45.300 --> 01:58:46.300]   I'll do that.
[01:58:46.300 --> 01:58:47.300]   There you go.
[01:58:47.300 --> 01:58:48.700]   And how about shaking hands?
[01:58:48.700 --> 01:58:50.460]   Probably shouldn't do that.
[01:58:50.460 --> 01:58:54.500]   I would-- do you have a lot of Purell or other hands?
[01:58:54.500 --> 01:58:55.860]   Yeah, I have hand sanitizer.
[01:58:55.860 --> 01:58:58.220]   Is that good enough?
[01:58:58.220 --> 01:58:59.220]   It's very good.
[01:58:59.220 --> 01:59:00.220]   As long as you use it.
[01:59:00.220 --> 01:59:01.940]   Now listen, it has to dry.
[01:59:01.940 --> 01:59:02.940]   Don't--
[01:59:02.940 --> 01:59:03.940]   It's not good wet.
[01:59:03.940 --> 01:59:04.940]   So--
[01:59:04.940 --> 01:59:06.940]   In other words, put it on, rub it around, but then you have to let it dry.
[01:59:06.940 --> 01:59:07.940]   Then hold your hands like this.
[01:59:07.940 --> 01:59:08.940]   First, be effective.
[01:59:08.940 --> 01:59:09.940]   And let it dry.
[01:59:09.940 --> 01:59:11.420]   And hold your hands like this or like this.
[01:59:11.420 --> 01:59:15.580]   They say it has to stay wet for 30 seconds to kill the virus.
[01:59:15.580 --> 01:59:16.580]   Right.
[01:59:16.580 --> 01:59:19.900]   But the point is, it's also not effective while it's wet.
[01:59:19.900 --> 01:59:21.900]   It's once it finishes drying that you know you're good.
[01:59:21.900 --> 01:59:22.900]   OK, so folks--
[01:59:22.900 --> 01:59:24.180]   And make sure you really rub it in.
[01:59:24.180 --> 01:59:27.740]   If you come to our last pass party, expect an elbow bump.
[01:59:27.740 --> 01:59:28.940]   That's all you're going to get.
[01:59:28.940 --> 01:59:31.740]   I'll be the guy with a bane mask on.
[01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:32.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:33.740]   And brilliant.
[01:59:33.740 --> 01:59:34.740]   And brilliant.
[01:59:34.740 --> 01:59:35.740]   Upwards.
[01:59:35.740 --> 01:59:36.740]   Yeah.
[01:59:36.740 --> 01:59:39.540]   John's giving me-- I'm going to take my Purell with me,
[01:59:39.540 --> 01:59:41.540]   so I'm ready at all times.
[01:59:41.540 --> 01:59:43.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:59:43.540 --> 01:59:45.540]   You're going to be drinking that up.
[01:59:45.540 --> 01:59:48.940]   Yeah, how much that you have to drink before you're really?
[01:59:48.940 --> 01:59:51.260]   Thank you, Dr. Mom.
