[00:02:50.120 --> 00:03:07.120]   tech news it's our annual year end edition of this week in tech and actually it's a good way to begin a new year here we are in 2022 2021 was a piece of work a piece of work we didn't know what it was going to be like we still don't know frankly
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:19.120]   what it was going to be like but I think at the beginning of 2021 we were kind of getting ready for the roaring 20s
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:29.120]   our standards have really changed for what we consider entertainment during all of this I'll just watch somebody's living room I'm in my living room you're in your living room
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:43.120]   so I gotta say some of the best music has come out during the pandemic of people just recording in their homes covering a song and then releasing the video you know just them playing it on the internet
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:56.120]   there's a bunch of really excellent music out there as a result of this and you gotta wonder how that's going to change the music business you know when when as you say once we get it come out of this
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:08.120]   I think my favorite topics is what's going to persist and what's not going to persist for instance weirdly last year hardcover book sales were up 18%
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:20.120]   so I don't think that's going to continue well I think that's like a that's because of the pandemic that's a blip audio books also up I think 16% and ebooks which have been dying
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:36.120]   they've been down every year for the last few years were up as well in the double digit percentage but none of those trends I think will continue on the other hand streaming services gained about 50% overall in customers
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:51.120]   and that I think is is going to hasten the end of cable television and is going to really move us to the over the top world that we've been slowly moving to it's going to hasten it so it's interesting in some cases
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:05:07.120]   it makes changes that won't last but I think things like zoom will continue for a long time I think streaming tell I mean Disney plus had a huge year because of it
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:23.120]   usually on New Year's Eve my wife and I will go out clubbing or raving as I believe it's known in the year and so three years ago for example we were watching one of our favorite bands in Glasgow and yeah it was a great night out and this year they did a paid stream
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:34.120]   we listened to it at home I didn't have anyone let you on the wife I could have a cup of tea when I wanted to it was actually a pretty good night you missed the energy of a club but I think those kind of streaming services are really going to take off
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:41.120]   and I think that's what I wonder I mean there are certain in person things we do like conferences and concerts
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:06:01.120]   I mean I have to feel I have to imagine that live performers are suffering mightily because of this and I am will they come back they say that the 1920s the roaring 20s was part of the reason was the roaring 20s is because people were so burned out from the pandemic of 1918 and being
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:30.120]   masked for so long that when they finally came out it was the roaring 20s do you think we'll have our own roaring 20s you think so yes without a doubt if you there's that there's a book I've been recommending pale writer which is about the the Spanish flu pandemic and in it they talk about kind of the changes in society as a result of that and yeah I think we're just going to have an explosion of people traveling going to parties
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:44.120]   concerts I think every band in the world that's a name will get out and tour I mean I think it's going to be like a frantic golden age when this is all done oh I hope you're right
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:59.120]   because if you look on so many media like all of my friends on Facebook and Instagram all they talk about is with this is over here's where I'm going you know and they post pictures of countries they've been to that they love
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:14.120]   what my wife and I fantasize about practically every night is where do you want to go first what do you want to do first yeah right yeah and remember the roaring 20s wasn't just about people going out and partying it was people changing what they've come to expect from society
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:28.120]   after such a prolonged time of not being able to do what you want to do suddenly you're changing how you consume you're changing what you consider to be success you're changing what you consider to be stable employment or stable housing
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:43.120]   we could do the same thing and if you do that the companies that latch on to that and start feeding that appetite they're going to make a mint it's going to be it's going to be a free for all once the damn breaks
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:59.120]   and that's mostly analog you think analog companies experiences experiences yeah yeah physical experience I mean the one comment I'm getting again on social again and again on social media is when this is over some people so many people are going to get hugs
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:23.120]   no one has been able to hug everyone else knows me I'm just going to be a man's baby boom yes nine months after this ends yeah yes absolutely it's a huge kissing yeah I think if we really want the roaring 20 20s to duplicate the 1920s we should ban alcohol as well let's just do that too
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:44.120]   let's just repeat it let's repeat the whole thing now we remember how it ended with a great depression so maybe we could skip that part but well that's good I mean yeah the prohibition of alcohol did have a huge social influence on on the United States because men and women started drinking together for the first time for example different races started mixing together that's a good point
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:09:03.120]   so I mean it was an enormous social driver albeit in it incredibly stupid policy but you know I mean it was an enormous driver for social change and you saw women's hand lams going up and they were started smoking and okay so it was all good but I mean you know men and women mixed I might start smoking I might I might next year
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:22.120]   I survived years to keep it up I've never taken this week in smoking no I promise I'm not I'm not going to start smoking I played for a job in a magazine in the 1990s and they had a cigar reviewer and that was his job what a great job
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:35.120]   let me start with you Alex is meme stock it's a little bit of a put down like these people are real investors this is just a meme is that a fair characterization
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:51.120]   I don't think it's as pejorative as we might think on the surface I think it's almost one of those negative things you kind of take on as a joke that you then begin to enjoy yourself so meme stock to me just describes the group of stocks that are trading not based on fundamentals
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:10:05.120]   or long term value but based on kind of current market sentiment amongst the retail crowd so by the way the sentiment may not be driven either by market fundamentals it may be driven and it seems to be somewhat driven by let's screw the hedge funds right
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:14.120]   yeah yeah yeah there's a lot of annoyance amongst retail traders about their position in the market if you have a lot of money you have access to better information better tools
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:23.120]   and faster trades if you're a retail investor like you know us here kind of regular folks you don't and so it feels like the market is a little bit set up against you and it is
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:31.120]   and so what you're seeing here is a combination of greed social interest kind of people banding together on the internet to bring something together
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:41.120]   and also annoyance with the way things are set up and I think a lot of people are still pretty peeved about 2008 2009 and how things kind of worked out there and how people didn't go to jail and how
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:52.120]   we the taxpayers spend a lot of money to keep these big banks alive and so when these social traders on Reddit and other places noticed that GameStop is shorted more than a hundred percent
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:11:01.120]   a hundred forty percent so I don't even know how that can happen by the way that's a failure of regulation but the hedge funds have bought more GameStop stock than exists
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:10.120]   and sold it short and so people knew that if they took advantage of this they could never have a bit up make it good right there's not enough stock to buy
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:21.120]   how do they know how do they know that it had been shorted a hundred and forty percent somebody must really someone sophisticated must have looked at that and figured it out
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:35.120]   no so so filled the short interest is periodically available before this show I was googling around a little bit and you can find data on that and with more sophisticated tooling like a Bloomberg terminal you can definitely find out
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:43.120]   but what's really interesting and you really point by the way that some of some people characterized this is 4chan with a Bloomberg terminal
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:12:02.120]   and that's what it is. It was just exactly. Well wait a minute now I gotta point out and by the way Elizabeth Warren AOC and others in Congress have called for an investigation the S.S.E.C. which moves like molasses woke up late last week and went oh wait a minute
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:16.120]   I gotta point out it is not obvious you know this this is the superficial description of this but it's completely possible that it wasn't just retailers that maybe other hedge funds were intentionally short squeezing their competition
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:30.120]   we don't know exactly right what's really going on here do we know I mean I think that what happens you know when the the squeeze started and when you did have people like like roaring kitty and some of the other big Wall Street
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:59.120]   kids are kidding is deep a deep effing value. It's his YouTube band L. We'll call him or I'm kidding from now on that's probably right yeah so so when you have this guy who is you know $250,000 investment into $31 million or whatever and he's an actual I mean he's incredibly clever and incredibly smart when you have people like him who made those moves I do think that those were people who saw a you know a glitch a hole in the system and we're able to take advantage and then we're able to propel this into other things
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:10.120]   the thing is that once the stock started rising and once everybody started kind of staring at it like slackshot what's happening and it went up and up and up obviously you're going to have
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:25.120]   like non retail and investors who are interested in it too right like so I think that it becomes at that point you know people who are doing high frequency trading and who are trading based on you know having you know watchlist and algorithms and are doing all the ways that
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:41.120]   you know most professionals trade now which is not the way that retailers retail investors trade were obviously going to be getting in on it and I wouldn't be surprised if this is usually not uncommon where some of the hedge funds will have a position to backstop against like their short position
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:53.120]   failing right so I don't think we know exactly what it is I'd be curious to hear Alex's thoughts my thoughts just based on what we know now and so much of it we're still figuring out as he said the news cycle has moved so quick
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:14:08.120]   my gut tells me that while most of the interest has been led by retail investors once things shifted past a certain point then you did start to see traditional investors whether they be hedge funds or you know just
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:23.040]   you know high frequency traders or whatever starting to get in on the action too which is only going to continue to keep this frothy and I mean I look I expected the crash I've already happened I was very clearly
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:37.040]   wrong on that but I think this is one of those things where we're all expecting the inevitable crash we don't know when the bottom is going to drop but the completely nuts of thing about this is that we don't know how how high this is going to go until
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:52.040]   things presumably regulate themselves assuming they do and maybe this is one of those weird things where it won't I think the game stop as a company is in such a poor position that I don't see how it can continue to you know stay at these at these levels
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:15:03.040]   but yeah I did your point I don't think it's definitely I think that it started and was largely led by retail investors but if people are making money in this like the game is rigged
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:16.040]   it is I mean I think anybody who's followed anything and has anything to do with finance understands and like accepts that you can't expect the billionaires to be sitting on the sidelines and seeing regular people making money and not wanting to get in on some of the play too I mean
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:38.040]   it's just bizarre roaring kitty and this is what you do on Wall Street bets you post pictures of your you know losses and your gains and so forth took to fit his he posted and nobody can verify this but he claims he invested $53,000 and at some point it reached $48 million dollars whether he sold I don't think because I think he's saying hold
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:55.040]   on the phone which I think Alex is nuts because isn't this bubble gonna pop at some point here's a picture of a kid 10 year old Jaden Carr his mom gave him 10 shares in game stop in 2019 is a quanza present
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:19.040]   he's happy she wanted to teach him about investing but what lesson did Jaden learn really about investing that's one of the concerns I have I see people like my own son naive investors who say oh you know I'm gonna get me that Robin Hood and I'm gonna put some money in here because this is a great opportunity
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:35.040]   but but what do you think Alex is the bubble about to burst is it what I guess it's not because more and more people are coming along saying I got to get in on this right even though now you're buying game stock game spot stock at like 300 bucks I don't know what the current price is but
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:56.040]   225 so yeah that's crazy Leo if this is the year to date graph it was it was it was yeah January 5th it was $17 it is now 325 dollars and there was a sell off on Thursday
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:18.040]   I'm sure there's some market you know markets off market share as trading going on right now it's insane it's insane so are people gonna but don't you think people are gonna get hurt by this Alex or no they are gonna get hurt by it I mean the hedge funds got heard Melvin Capitol had to go borrow money from Stephen Cohen
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:29.040]   to the tune of several billion dollars so the billionaires bailed out the billionaires we didn't do it which is super important to note no one knows how long this can stay up because no one thought this was going to happen
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:44.040]   and when you discuss people posting their trades on Wall Street bets and other forums what they're doing is sharing with a large crowd and it's not like the old days where you had to go on CNBC to talk about your positions to get people to pay attention now you can kind of rally
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:59.040]   an army of individual traders who have access to things like options and more exotic investments than they didn't used to have and so now you can really marshal a lot of buying power behind you people are buying billboards and ads to encourage more people to buy and hold game stop game
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:17.040]   stop stop yeah that you know deep effing value posted hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold of course he wants you to hold he in fact he wants you to buy more because his value is going to go up you have to at some point you have to start wondering about these people's motivations
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:22.040]   and and maybe not buy into this
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:42.040]   but I think I'm not sure what's going on and I don't think we fully know what's going on here's but there's a lot to me there's a larger thing at play here that actually ties into the events of the last few years
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:57.040]   I was in a mob when I was a kid I was protesting against the Vietnam War with a big group of people we did things that I would never have done by myself you know we blocked the freeway we rocked police cars stupid things
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:16.040]   that I would never have done but when you get in a mob you lose your mind and you start acting as a single brain in a mob and we've seen this before we saw it January 6th in a way to me what's happening in the stock market with game stop is similar to what happened in the
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:34.040]   capital is similar what happened I guess you could say the Arab Spring and again and again what I think we're seeing is how social media these messaging platforms like Telegram and Discord WhatsApp empower the formation of mobs
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:20:02.040]   when I was a kid you only became a mob because everybody said let's go down and protest the war in Vietnam on a certain day we all went and that mob never got much bigger because there wasn't this mass medium but social media has in my mind weaponized the mob and while this seems benign to me I you know this is great I'm glad some hedge funds suffered they should but that's today tomorrow it could be less benign
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:13.040]   I think the comparison to the January 6th is a little bit tenuous because that was a rally that the leader of America had called people to show up to so it was much more centralized to this sort of Reddit
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:37.040]   I'm not making deep effing value equivalent to President Trump but that's the point but I'm saying that President Trump not had Twitter and Facebook had the org had the organizers not had these social media platforms to me it looks like these social media platforms are ripe for this kind of thing and this is what we're going to see and I think we're going to see it a lot more often
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:48.040]   just to add to that point there's currently a new meme amongst the same trading groups to squeeze the price of silver and I have not looked into this because all my money is in boring index funds because of journalism rules
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:21:03.040]   but you know this is not going to stop people have now found a lever and they're going to keep trying to move the world as long as they can and you know we saw a lot of issues with Robin Hood and stability to stay up and so forth but they'll figure that out they'll get that sorted out and then once those pathways are open
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:17.040]   there's not going to be the same kind of like slows to the system and so I don't know where this goes but as a person who cares about the financial markets in general I'm going to be fascinated to see what the next couple years look like if we do actually see the revenge or retail traders
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:28.040]   against the professional money it will be an inversion of trends that have been going on for decades you know and people are going to get hurt Leo but it's going to be really fun to watch the financial carnage either way
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:44.040]   I'm Diamond Hands still holding on to that Game Stock Game Spot stock going to be rich someday I know I am coming up the other big fad of 2021 NFTs but first I would like to talk a little bit about something that's not a fad
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:58.040]   podium oh man podium is actually the future for small businesses and I know it because every time now I leave my dentist's office my hair cutters and what the ice cream parlor down the street
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:06.040]   I hear from them I get a text message I you know sometimes it says your next appointment sometimes it says would you like a coupon for your next visit
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:23.040]   sometimes it says would you like to leave us a review on Yelp or Google and in every case that's podium podium is the way to do business in this kind of modern era friction free it's what your customers want they like getting that

[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:35.040]   there was a lot to talk about when it came to NFTs and blockchain and early in the year we had the expert Kevin Rose to join us and explain what all this madness is all about watch
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:43.040]   good to see you Leo thanks for having me venture capitalists with true ventures he's got a brand new podcast I want to give you a plug right up front
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:59.040]   maufai the modern finance podcast you're only in your you've only done three episodes only two published so far but the first one is a must listen I listen to it immediately because I am completely baffled by this whole crazy NFT thing
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:15.040]   we've spent a lot of time talking about the beeples 69 million dollar art jpeg sold at Christie's but you explained all very well with I am DC investor off top
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:35.040]   of the same who was it was you know I knew I guess you're also an investor you bought some NFTs yeah I mean I was definitely dabbling way back when crypto punks first came out which was probably well that was before the standard was actually defined so two they weren't they weren't actually NFTs at first were they
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:54.040]   that's right yeah the standard was based on the work done with the crypto punks project oh interesting so they were so you're smart I heard you say that you sold this is these are the crypto punks they are 25 by 25 pixels yeah they're icons of zombies right
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:26:20.040]   on the other things on the is one at attribute type yes and aliens zombies and yeah they all have different mohawks and glasses and beard types and I mean but you bought but you buy these which I don't understand because I see them all right here I have them all you buy them so that if I if I click on the smiling zombie which apparently you own
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:44.040]   I can look at it I could print it I could do anything I want with it but you own it that's right yeah you could do the same thing with the get a high res copy of the Mona Lisa and printed out that's true house but you don't have it that's true so it's like you've got the Mona Lisa of smiling zombies is that it yeah I mean it's basically just a way to use the blockchain to prove that someone actually has ownership over something that makes a lot of sense
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:56.420]   that makes a lot of sense that's a real problem with artworks with baseball cards with a collectible is attribution and who owns it but also is it real is it and so blockchain
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:13.040]   yeah and the third piece that's really important is how many were made I mean one of the things that that happened in the the 90s around baseball cards and collectibles and comic books is you know there's a there's a great story we all of course know the the very famous franchise of the Wolverine
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:37.040]   and the very first Wolverine comic is still a hundred and fifty dollars and I would I dug into this I'm like how this was made in the 80s how can this possibly be and it turns out they printed like something like 300,000 of them and didn't tell anyone so as many as they could and which makes sense as a business but as a collector's you didn't know that you know and so the blockchain gives you a way to say proven scarcity
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:56.040]   right ownership so that's that's nice so there is another way a biological way to to barcode and to track authenticity in that's DNA so you can spray custom DNA on just about anything it's odorless it's colorless it leaves no residue it leaves no mark
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:25.040]   and then you have physical so blockchain is great but you know it's not physical way in fact yeah I mean yeah the crypto punk is not in the blockchain right the image itself is not in the blockchain Kevin just the URL right that's not true because with crypto punks it was only a 25 by 25 oh they're so small you could put it a hash of the yeah exactly you can put it right in any modern like the peoples all that stuff it is just a pointer to like an IPFS type
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:46.040]   you know asset right well at least it's a problem go ahead I was gonna say I think all of that works well as long as you have a ton of redundancy built in but yeah because if it's just one of the cool things if we're a web URL it could you know the server could go down at least with IPFS is a distributed file system and so in theory it's not going to go away
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:29:13.040]   you could spray DNA fragments so I'm not gonna ask you it's probably it's not the traditional method of spraying DNA I'm assuming it's some other I know that's not what I was talking about okay it's somewhere in my mind when it's a sneeze right you sneeze on it I'm sure if you think about it that probably a few van goes have his DNA on them but you're not talking about that
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:27.040]   no I'm not talking about that I am you know one of the really cool things that's happened one of the positive after effects of the virus is that messenger RNA which has been around forever it finally found a use case a business case
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:47.040]   to make the vaccines in this case that's right and mRNA is a pretty cool technology that has some knock on effects and one of which is looking at RNA and DNA and sort of a new light so you can DNA is like nature's hard drive you can store a ton of stuff in it
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:30:00.040]   and it doesn't go anywhere and likewise you can use DNA as a tracking system so if you've got a really valuable collection of comic books not Wolverine but something else more valuable
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:09.040]   you know one way to physically mark products like that artifacts that you cannot authenticate in the future is using DNA fragments
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:30.040]   one of the advantages of blockchain in this regard is it's distributed and everybody has a copy there's no with DNA you'd still have to have some registry somewhere of what that what's what's in that RNA if I mean it doesn't have to be RNA it could be any encoding method for encoding a long digit
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:39.040]   right I mean it's like a you can encode spores too it's just like a barcode but yes you would still need or you would still need a registry that should be distributed
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:48.040]   that works great for like individual objects but if you're going to do something like say a fractional ownership of a digital object or you can't do that if you possible
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:59.040]   you know smart contracts enable things like artworks to change over time based on rulesets like like really kind of fun things like that as well are pretty cool with some of the NFT stuff
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:16.040]   I think people and I include myself in this get distracted by trying to wrap their mind around well people made a JPEG which is infinitely reproducible and then was able to sell it for $69.3 million
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:27.040]   but to somebody who now can claim ownership in some abstract way and we get wrapped around this notion of collectibles physical versus virtual objects and all of that
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:38.040]   and you know you can go either way on that I mean I'm kind of of the opinion it's pretty speculative but so is so are collectibles I mean you don't buy a
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:52.040]   honest wagon or baseball card because it has any intrinsic value you buy it because you think either you're really a big fan of the Pittsburgh Pirates or you think it's going to have more value down the road and you can sell it it's a way of storing value just like
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:32:07.040]   unfortunately a lot of artworks now are ways of storing value they're not hung on any wall they're stored in a locker at some airport to avoid customs and taxes but they're a store of value and you know you'll be able to sell them at some point
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:21.040]   that's probably for more than you paid for it. Right. So I acknowledge that this is a good way to this is a better blockchain is a better way to store value but I think people like me get all tied in a knot over this.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:30.040]   Well what are you kids doing this is this is silly. There's also and let me ask you about this Kevin because you didn't address this in modern finance.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:40.040]   There's also an environmental concern isn't there I mean there's a lot of energy being used to create these things and every transaction uses a lot of energy.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:59.040]   I think the energy consumption of proof of work blockchain has been known for for quite some time I mean there's there's it's horrible and so I mean that's why there's a lot of work and effort going into making these chains just eco friendly I mean if you take a look at all the layer to scaling solutions for a theater
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:12.040]   everything is they're doing with optimistic roll ups these are like very lightweight ways to do cryptographically proven transfers without affing to write it back to the main chain.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:26.040]   So without spending a lot of resource power until we get to something that is proof of stake which is not proof of work which is not using very intensive CPU or GPU is to do all these transaction processing, which is on the Ethereum roadmap
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:41.040]   I mean this stuff is coming in for a long time though. Yeah I know but you're also talking about you know how many billions of dollars you have to be very careful when you're when you're changing directions of a plane of that size right like you
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:47.040]   if you're if you're setting a new destination like you don't want you want to really battle and harden the code.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:54.040]   And so you know there's been some you to is like there's they've crossed a couple major milestones and staking is the next big one.
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:34:09.040]   And that will eliminate the grotesque energy expenditure. Yes and and and there's already other chains out there that like are getting a lot of traction that are already green from the get go chia Graham Cohen the creator of BitTorrent just launched his coin here just
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:19.040]   four or five days ago you actually use him for the efficient green for the podcast you just interviewed him for the podcast. Yeah. Yeah it's a very efficient super green cryptocurrency.
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:23.040]   It's going to have support for smart contracts and other things on top of it.
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:33.040]   Solana super like talk about high bandwidth high throughput they can do 50,000 transactions a second and it is super efficient and green.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:47.040]   So you know these these are all problems that are being worked out but I certainly acknowledged that today it sucks. And of course like dependent upon where you're getting your energy from like there are a lot of minors that will go next to very cheap sources
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:35:00.040]   which can be hydroelectric they can be you know solar and they're mining those environments. Sure sure. In fact it only makes sense to mine where electricity is cheap because otherwise you probably not making a profit.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:11.040]   Right. It kind of brings up the issue of as I saw some wag tweet Elon Musk said Tesla now will accept Bitcoin to purchase a Tesla automobile.
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:26.040]   And of course some wag pointed out that you might as well just put gas engines in a meal on because you're all the benefit the environmental benefit of an electric vehicle is kind of abrogated by using Bitcoin to pay for them.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:39.040]   I mean yes and no I think that there's a couple things here like what are the payment rails behind the scenes if you're going let's say I don't know what they're using for on the on the merchant side to accept Bitcoin but let's just say it's it's Coinbase right.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:45.040]   If you're going Coinbase to Coinbase you're not doing any kind of actually writing to the chain right exactly.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:53.040]   I'm still wondering what I'm like so curious now what Nicholas got from the NBA on his on his NFT.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:58.040]   Open it. I can open it. Maybe in the background I can open it. Let's do an unboxing.
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.040]   Did you get a box?
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.040]   I guess a digital box.
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:07.040]   How can you how can you do an unboxing of a digital box?
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:10.040]   I don't know if I could show it on my screen. I can't share my I probably could.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:18.040]   Yeah you're on zoom. You can share your screen with us. You got to make him the the presenter on the on the zoom thing I think John.
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:27.040]   I'm waiting for the day now when like somebody does like a crazy dunk and like the kids are asking each other. Is that dunk on the blockchain yet?
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:33.040]   They've sold like I said two hundred million dollars of highlights NBA top shot calm.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:36.040]   You just did it for research. I'm sure Nicholas.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:45.040]   I have a friend who was who you know his mega into it. He's spending like hundreds of dollars. He's one of the speculators and I was like oh that's you know I had been reading about it.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:51.040]   So this is what you bought. You bought a pack. It's just it is. Yes. It's just like a baseball cards. Yeah. It's it's.
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:37:02.040]   Yeah. And so rising. Which ones did you get? I pre ordered the just the base pack. That's the other thing is that you know they they released these things in tranches.
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:10.040]   It's like if you want like the fancy fancy pack. Well you have to you know you have to wait in line. They're all sold out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Look at that.
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:19.040]   Wow. Very interesting how they kind of like forever sold out everything. They're so smart. Yeah. They sold out forever. They're so smart because they say this shocked them.
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:29.040]   They sold way more than what they expected. Wow. They were super smart. Okay. Just a little tip. They look a little bit like condom wrappers. You might want to change the size of that.
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:38.040]   Make it look more like baseball cards. But other than that. Oh I see I would go for this one. Deck the hoops. 230 bucks sold out.
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:44.040]   So you just bought a base set. Did you get? You don't actually get anything physical in the mail. Do you? No you don't get this package or anything.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:52.040]   That's what's hysterical about this. They make it look like you're going to get something. What you get? You get a link. You get an email. What do you get?
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:38:02.040]   No you get and it's funny too because they make you wait in a queue. Like I've been hit a couple weeks ago. I was in line with 150,000 other people trying to buy one of these.
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:09.040]   That's smart. You want to create this false sense of urgency and this scarcity. And the folks in the discord are like freaking out. They're like oh my God.
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:16.040]   There's a hundred thousand people ahead of me. There's no way I'm getting it. And you're waiting in this queue for hours. And you're just kind of like getting it.
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:21.040]   And with both of the things you've done. It's just because of the joy it took even longer for it to get to you. Right?
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:28.040]   Oh yeah. You didn't have to mail it. They don't mail it. Yeah. I don't know if I could open it live. I don't know.
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:34.040]   You don't have to. That's all right. I just thought it'd be good for our YouTube numbers if you did it on Fox.
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:43.040]   That's actually funny. Bring that up because that is like a burgeoning piece of content. Like people opening packs live and have like hype videos.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:50.040]   It's actually quite clever I guess. If I were smart, I would have promoted this. I would have said next week.
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:58.040]   Nicholas De Leon is coming on. He's going to open his pack. This is huge. I would have done four or five videos all week long building this up.
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:02.040]   See, I'm not good at this stuff. He could have been the Geraldo of Rivera.
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:09.040]   You're talking about Al Capone safe. Yeah. Which ended up having what? Nothing in it. It was like dust. Nothing in it. Nothing.
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:15.040]   Wow. That's always a risk. I won't open it. Maybe we'll coordinate and I can open it live.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:23.040]   Well, I would understand. I don't know. Maybe there'll be something in there that I don't think there would be that would give away like your credit card number or something.
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:30.040]   I don't think so. I don't think so. It's just what it shifts. Yeah. What happens if you can tell the dollars for it between now and the next show?
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:35.040]   I find that unlikely because it's a standard pack or it's a base pack, whatever they call it.
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:41.040]   But only 5,000 other people have it. Yeah. It's probably not the best gifts in this one if I had to guess.
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:49.040]   Yeah. But we'll see. Just so that we can prepare for this next time, give me the shock look that you do on YouTube, Nicholas.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:55.040]   So like, oh my God. I just opened it. It's amazing. Give me that look. Come on. You could do it. Oh my God.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:40:01.040]   No, no, come on. But yeah, there you go. There you go. Stick out your tongue. Yeah. Yeah. That's it.
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:06.040]   And then I get that. And I run around. Yeah. Yeah. We know we got over. We got it. There's your.
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:11.040]   That's your. That's the thumbnail. That's the thumbnail right now.
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:18.040]   You know, Leo, you should you should make an NFT out of the first episode of Twitch. I have them. Right.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:23.040]   So I have I would buy that. Somebody would buy that. Would you buy it?
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:30.040]   I might actually buy that. I remember where I was sitting where you guys recorded the first twin actually. So, but what would that mean?
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:36.040]   You'd hit the copy right with that mean that the person who bought it would own the copyright or just we don't copy right on their creative.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:42.040]   They're creative comments. We don't we don't do anything. I would just it would basically be me signing it digitally.
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:48.040]   Authenticating that this is the first episode of Twitter. I mean, somebody I give it to you.
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:57.040]   Oh, the first edition. So they own the the one of a kind digital copy or the digital original essentially of it.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:04.040]   And then all other versions are are copies of it, right? Except I don't know if I could do that because I don't really know if I have the original.
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:10.040]   Well, it doesn't it doesn't. So that's the thing. It becomes the original tweet. You designate one.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:17.040]   No, there is where is it? So John has gone through our old hard drives and he is actually he has this concept.
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:24.040]   John I think wants us to make money. Big mistake there, John. So he's given me a list.
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:36.040]   These are pre show clips from 2008. Me and Paul Thorett pre show Windows Weekly. Me and Meghan Moroni pre showed jumping monkeys.
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:41.040]   A live stream we did on building the ultimate game machine with Colleen Henry and Ryan Shroud.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:51.040]   Security now pre show. These are all from 2008 from August 2008. And that daily Gizf is from 2008. It's on here.
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:58.040]   So these are now I I those are the originals. I just blessed them.
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:02.040]   So then what do I do? I don't know. I need I need to met a coven.
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:11.040]   I need to use them to tokenize them. Leo, I bet if you sold the first episode of of Twit as an NFT. Yeah.
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:17.040]   And took the proceeds and put it in Bitcoin. Yeah. And held it for $10. Yeah.
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:24.040]   I bet you that would be worth a million. I would lose my password and you know I have eight Bitcoin in a wallet.
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:29.040]   I have eight Bitcoin right now in a wallet that I can't get into because I don't remember the password.
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:33.040]   I felt worth that you got from like Mt. Gox back when it was no.
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:40.040]   I when Bitcoin first started. I downloaded a Bitcoin core like the software that the Bitcoin Foundation had.
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:48.040]   And that created a wallet. And at some point I was smart enough and dumb enough to password protect it, but not record the password.
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:54.040]   Oh, so you've got it in cold storage and I have the wallet that that file and then yeah.
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:43:00.040]   And then we put up a QR code with the with the account on the website as part of our tip chart.
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:04.040]   Because if for a while we are I think we still have a tip chart. I just know and knows where it is.
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:09.040]   And people were and people gave me a tenth of a Bitcoin or whatever and it ended up being 7.85 Bitcoin.
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:15.040]   I know because I can see the wallet and I know how much is in it. I know all the transactions, but I just can't unlock it.
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:21.040]   So what is that worth? That's $480,000 right now. Wow. Yeah. That's right. It's amazing.
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:30.040]   I'm an idiot. Will you ever be able to recover that value? Yeah. My feeling is if I had been able to unlock it at any time in the last five years, I would have sold it.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:37.040]   Right. When Bitcoin was a hundred bucks, I would have sold it. So all I've done is gain value.
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:41.040]   I figure not being able to sell it is the best thing that ever happened to me.
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:47.040]   If you were flying for a loan, could you use that on your financial statement as part of your network?
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:55.040]   You're not working on access. So I'm figuring here's my plan. This is my long range plan.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:44:01.040]   Some day, quantum computers are going to happen and there'll be a computer fast enough to crack this wallet.
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:06.040]   To crack that password. By then? You're probably right. Yeah. By then it'll be worth millions.
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:10.040]   You're right. Maybe worth a hundred million. We'll have more in just a little bit.
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:16.040]   In fact, we're going to talk about because one of the big stories of the week was the year I should say was about Congress investigating face-play.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:22.040]   Some of Facebook's plans for Instagram coming up in just a little bit.
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:30.040]   Our show today brought to you by Noreva, complicated and costly.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:35.040]   That's been the state of audio conferencing for big spaces for a long time.
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:48.040]   Choosing a traditional system could entail a difficult software design issues, selecting from a kind of dizzying array of separate mic speakers, DSPs and more.
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:58.040]   You've got to get a company to come in, map the space, then you bring in technicians to install often very invasive and certainly very expensive.
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:04.040]   And that can take your meeting room, your huddle room offline for days.
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:11.040]   Really, I think this is a good example of an industry that was just primed for a leap in technology.
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:17.040]   It's the same kind of one that's changed so many other sectors, especially during COVID.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:22.040]   That's why Noreva has really come at a time that we needed.
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:27.040]   Noreva created the revolutionary microphone missed technology.
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:38.040]   It's a patented technology that make one or two integrated microphones and speaker bars work for a giant room fill the room with thousands of virtual microphones.
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:43.040]   It is a perfect, affordable solution for today's bigger meeting rooms.
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:45.040]   No dead zones.
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:52.040]   Everybody can be heard anywhere in the room, no matter where they're facing, no matter how they're socially distancing.
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:46:02.040]   Frankly, I think this is going to be the future of conference rooms where it's a comfortable, engaging space and you don't have to pay attention to the microphone.
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:06.040]   That's the best way meeting participants classes.
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:13.040]   It's great for schools can simply talk and move naturally in the space and they'll be heard clearly by remote participants.
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:23.040]   It's just a more natural way to run conference audio and thanks to continuous calibration, your rooms are instantly and always ready with optimized audio.
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:31.040]   No outside technician required, no matter how the configuration changes, no matter how many people or how few people in the room.
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:33.040]   Noreva works first time every time.
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:35.040]   And man has a simplified installation.
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:40.040]   No installers coming in, running wires everywhere, drilling holes in the wall.
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:43.040]   It's a 30 minute job you can do yourself.
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.040]   I've done it simple.
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:46.040]   It's just like installing a sound bar.
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:50.040]   It means big savings and time and cost compared to traditional systems.
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:53.040]   So it works better and it costs less.
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:55.040]   Seems like a no brainer to me.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:57.040]   Simplified management too.
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:03.040]   You get the Noreva console, which gives IT the power to monitor, manage and adjust the systems from everywhere.
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:06.040]   No need for IT to move from room to room.
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:11.040]   So it means you can have many Noreva connected rooms and manage them all from a central console.
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:12.040]   It's just great.
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:24.040]   So I guess it's time to ask yourself, do you want to go with a costly, complicated, traditional system or make the leap to simple and economical Noreva.
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:26.040]   And you are EVA.com.
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:27.040]   Noreva.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:30.040]   N-U-R-E-V-A.com.
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.040]   It's simple.
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:34.040]   It's just the right way to do it.
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:39.040]   Noreva, we thank you so much for supporting our special Best of Episode.
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:42.040]   We really appreciate that.
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:47.040]   Boy, there was a lot to talk about with Facebook and Instagram this year.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:49.040]   Here's a plan at the time.
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:51.040]   It seemed like a bad idea.
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:53.040]   They've backed down since.
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:55.040]   Instagram for kids.
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:57.040]   What could possibly go wrong?
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:04.040]   Internal Instagram post obtained by BuzzFeed News says, "We have identified youth work as a priority for Instagram.
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:07.040]   I've added it to our H1 Priority list.
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:10.040]   Youth work."
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:11.040]   You know.
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.040]   Youth.
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:15.040]   Like, you know, when there were miners and stuff.
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:22.040]   Now instead of exploiting children by sending them on the ground, we exploit them with ads.
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:29.040]   Yeah, this is Vishal Shah, who is Instagram's Vice President of Product, writing on an employee message board.
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:31.040]   But of course, nothing is private these days.
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:38.040]   We will be building a new youth pillar within the community product group to focus on two things.
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:42.040]   This is, I think, informative about how they think about these things.
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:49.040]   Accelerating our integrity and privacy work to ensure the safest possible experience for teens and building a version of Instagram
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:54.040]   that lets people under the age of 13 safely use Instagram for the first time.
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:55.040]   For the first time.
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:49:02.040]   Actually, Instagram, like almost everything else because of COPPA, the Child Online Protection and Privacy Act,
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:05.040]   will not allow you to join if you're under 13.
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:07.040]   But of course, I don't think that stops anybody.
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:10.040]   They don't make any real effort to verify that.
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:14.040]   This makes me think about cigarettes when they used to advertise to kids.
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:20.040]   So I understand that if you don't start at a certain age, then you're not going to continue on.
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.040]   So get them young.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.040]   Yeah.
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:24.040]   Get them young and doctorate quickly.
[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:28.040]   And people will, once you're used to an ecosystem, you're comfortable.
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:30.040]   You're going to stay and keep on using it.
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:32.040]   That's their thought, that's their hope for it.
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.040]   Even though, no, this is not good.
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:40.040]   Social media is not great for kids because most kids don't understand what they're doing, what they're posting.
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:43.040]   Not everyone has Owen as a dad, let's just say it.
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.040]   Owen, you have to be all of our dads.
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:46.040]   He's a good dad.
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:47.040]   You'll be all our dad.
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:50.040]   And you should be there.
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:53.040]   This has nothing to do with indoctrinating them.
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:55.040]   This has to do with TikTok and Snapchat.
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:58.040]   They are losing the youth at an alarming rate.
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:06.040]   They need to do something to bring the youth back because, again, sending a kid to Instagram
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:09.040]   is like sending them Facebook or a letter by pigeon.
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:10.040]   You can't go there.
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.040]   You know what I mean?
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:13.040]   Like, it's not a TikTok.
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:15.040]   It's not real.
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:18.040]   Now, maybe this is not the audience.
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:23.040]   But when I watch TikTok, a lot of TikTokers say, check out my Instagram account.
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:24.040]   Like, they do both.
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:27.040]   But that's like people trying to be influencers, you're saying.
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:31.040]   It's also the fact of, check out my YouTube channel.
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:33.040]   Check out my Twitter, check out my whatever.
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:36.040]   If you're already here and you love me, I need you to love me on other platforms.
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:39.040]   I need you to do a platform, build up.
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:41.040]   Maybe I can get you here and get you there.
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.040]   So that's why they do it.
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:46.040]   But everything you, 90% of what you watch on Instagram anymore, this interesting, has a
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:48.040]   TikTok name flow surrounded.
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:50.040]   They've already posted it on TikTok.
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:51.040]   And then they put it on Instagram.
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:55.040]   But at the time I look at something on Instagram, my daughter's looking at me like I'm a 92-year-old
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.040]   man.
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:57.040]   She's like, I was laughing at that two weeks ago, bro.
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:58.040]   Like, come on.
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:50:59.040]   Like, you know what I mean?
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:02.040]   Because I don't have the same algorithm she has on TikTok.
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:05.040]   So she's in the cool hip from the future TikTok.
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:10.040]   I'm in the, hey, let me sell you some socks and a good, a dead joke.
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.040]   Now this I would buy.
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:13.040]   And it has all the cool fun stuff.
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:14.040]   This I would buy.
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:18.040]   If I could say to TikTok, I would like that cool hip younger algorithm.
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:21.040]   Can I trade my silver hair and algorithm in?
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:23.040]   I would buy that, wouldn't you, brother?
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:29.040]   All you have to do is give a 17-year-old, give your son the TikTok for like a week and it'll
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.040]   fix it.
[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:31.040]   It'll change everything.
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:34.040]   It'll fix the algorithm because it learns really quick what you're into, bro.
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:35.040]   It'll fix my real quick.
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:36.040]   Oh, that's disappointing.
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:39.040]   When I think about what I see on TikTok now, I maybe.
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:40.040]   Yeah.
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.040]   It's all my fault.
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:43.600]   It's the way the internet works, right?
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:50.920]   So the internet, if you look at my Twitter or my Facebook, they think that I'm a 71-year-old
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:54.080]   white man that lives in Los Angeles or New York City.
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:56.680]   I get asked for old dating sites.
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:57.680]   I get asked for a.
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:00.600]   Is that because you do that on purpose, or is that just who you are?
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:03.960]   Oh, I did that because I don't want them selling things to me.
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:05.320]   I like to know what they're selling me.
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:08.880]   So when they're selling me old stuff, I know that they're going by my age and by location.
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:09.880]   You know what I mean?
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:13.000]   They think that I'm a wan from actually here.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.040]   I have to say it works because I really enjoy TikTok.
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:18.920]   So they're obviously picking the right videos with me.
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:22.760]   I might not enjoy Henry's TikTok because it would be for a young guy.
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:24.400]   Yeah, their algorithm is impressive.
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:26.280]   It is impressive technology.
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:28.720]   Is it the best?
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:29.720]   Scary.
[00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:30.720]   What?
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:32.320]   And how is Snapchat still in the game?
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:36.840]   Didn't Instagram kick kick, Snapchat's butt with their stories and all that?
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:38.840]   It's not for the old.
[00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:39.840]   For the old.
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:42.440]   Did you see this on my phone?
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:43.440]   What?
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:44.440]   Wait, what?
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:45.440]   Didn't see it, right?
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:46.440]   That's the point because that's why I snapped.
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:47.440]   You know, cool.
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:50.120]   The kids are on there because they're putting up stuff that didn't want people to see.
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:51.640]   Ah, it goes away.
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:52.640]   Okay.
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:55.880]   And TikTok's exact opposite and stuff you want everybody to see.
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:56.880]   Yep.
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:57.880]   Yep.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:00.360]   So I should never go to a second location.
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:01.360]   Is that the rule?
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:02.360]   That's the rule.
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:03.920]   I mean, I'm learning.
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:04.920]   I'm just learning.
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:06.920]   That's the rule.
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:15.640]   Jeff Bezos retiring, stepping down as CEO is going to be the chairman of the board but
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:17.960]   less focused on data, data operations.
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:22.560]   He's handing over the reins to Andy Jassy.
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:29.040]   Kind of maybe this is another one of the, it seems like the whole show has been about
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:32.240]   corporate spin and PR.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:33.960]   And maybe this is more of the same.
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:39.120]   In the letter, he says, if you've read some of the news reports, you might think we don't
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:42.680]   care about our employees.
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:46.200]   Well, we do.
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:48.440]   But maybe we ought to do better.
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:49.920]   He's coming off a victory.
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:57.880]   Of course, the Alabama warehouses voted against the union, fairly substantially voted against
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:00.320]   the union.
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:03.920]   He says, while voting results were lopsided in our direct relationship with employees
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:04.920]   is strong.
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:09.480]   It's clear to me we need a better vision for how we create value from employees, a vision
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:15.480]   for their success.
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:19.320]   I'm sure Amazon will continue to fight unions.
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:24.800]   On the other hand, there are things they can do to make it better to work at Amazon.
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:31.040]   He said, our employees are sometimes accused of being desperate souls and treated as robots.
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:32.840]   That's not accurate.
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:37.880]   Remember the, was it a book that said that if you didn't cry at your desk once a day at
[00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:44.680]   Amazon, you really weren't working hard enough.
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:51.360]   If any shareholders are concerned that Earth's best employer and Earth's safest place to
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:53.160]   work, that's his goal.
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:56.360]   Like to loot our focus on Earth's most customer-centric company.
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:57.640]   Let me set your mind at ease.
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:54:58.880]   Think of it this way.
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:03.840]   If we can operate two businesses as different as consumer e-commerce and Amazon Web Services
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:09.200]   and do both at the highest level, we can certainly do the same with these two vision statements.
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:12.840]   I'm confident they will reinforce each other.
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:21.960]   Spin or do you think he genuinely is being a little affected by all of the blowback and
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:25.240]   wants to do something and make it a better company?
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:29.480]   This is Jeff Bezos' last letter to shareholders as CEO.
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:33.360]   What he's thinking when he's writing this is legacy, legacy, legacy.
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:35.240]   For him, he's reading the news.
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:41.120]   He's seeing what happened with the high-profile Twitter battle that led employees to end up
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:46.080]   sharing photos of the bottles that they've peed in and letters telling them to stop pooping
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:48.040]   in bags with the press.
[00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:53.040]   He's like, "Amazon is under fire for the way that it treats employees."
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:57.120]   It's on its way to becoming the biggest employer in the US.
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:01.720]   It's added a million employees in under a decade.
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:05.280]   It just keeps adding 100,000, 200,000 a year.
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:09.160]   This is going to be Jeff Bezos' legacy because at the end of the day, he's going to be the
[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:13.680]   person who's going to be responsible for the state of the American worker because the American
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:18.840]   worker is largely moving from places like the factory, which produce things to place places
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:22.800]   like the fulfillment center, which distributes things.
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:26.520]   Bezos is going to continue to grow.
[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:30.560]   Amazon added 50 million prime members in the last year, up from 150 million.
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:31.560]   That's stunning.
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:32.560]   33% growth.
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:33.560]   First, Jeff Bezos.
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:37.720]   We heard that number, by the way, 200 million prime subscribers.
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:41.840]   I think Bezos is thinking when people look back at him, they're going to look back at
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:45.560]   the e-commerce company he built, but they'll also look at the broader transformation that
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:49.200]   he led in terms of the economy and the way that work is structured.
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:51.760]   Of course, there were other factors that were involved there.
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:54.200]   That's why I think we heard so much about the worker there.
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:55.480]   I'll just Amazon care.
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:57:01.040]   Actually, I think Amazon cares a lot more than we end up hearing in the press reports.
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:03.520]   I don't think it's a miserable place for so many people to work.
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:06.560]   It can be really tough.
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:11.800]   I do think that the reality there is somewhere in between what we hear in some of the worst
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:17.760]   is not like everybody goes in and brings their bottle to work in piecing it twice a day.
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:25.280]   There are good jobs at Amazon, but they definitely have room to improve.
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:29.720]   Amazon was freaking out when people were talking about the way that their employees
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:32.480]   are treated.
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:35.280]   There is some right to stick to indignation that they can have.
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:38.840]   The United States politicians are the ones that signed trade deals like NAFTA and encourage
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:43.480]   China to join the WTO, which ended up having us trade those production jobs with women
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:44.480]   jobs.
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:52.480]   Amazon pays $15 minimum wage, where the federal government has a $7.25 minimum wage.
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:58.400]   I see Amazon side a little bit when they're looking at these politicians from the US government
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:00.600]   saying, "You got to treat workers better."
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:03.680]   Amazon is like, "You're supposed to be looking after the workers."
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:08.160]   In America, of course, Amazon, we talked about has lobbyists.
[00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:12.320]   There have been decades where our politicians have had a chance to make the situation better,
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:13.320]   and they've failed.
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:18.560]   You can also make the case that voting down the union in Alabama was a vote of confidence
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:21.120]   from the workers saying, "We prefer Amazon management.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:22.120]   We don't need a union."
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:28.720]   Yeah, I'd buy that more if Amazon didn't go through the painstaking union busting process
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:29.720]   that it did.
[00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:37.160]   If Amazon had that vote be fair and didn't compel people to go into education systems
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:43.160]   and start getting the post office to have this mailbox in that might have made some people
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:47.880]   think that they were going to read their ballots, that might be one thing.
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:51.200]   If you really think that you can stand up based off of the merits, you don't need to
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:53.120]   bring the union busting firm in.
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:57.200]   You obviously have a right to defend yourself against unionization if you don't want it,
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:00.680]   but to just go through such effort and to be so against it.
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:06.040]   I don't think this was entirely the workers standing up and saying, "We don't want a union."
[00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:09.440]   Amazon had a role in it, and Amazon's like, "This wasn't a victory for us.
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:10.960]   It's what the workers wanted."
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:13.120]   But Amazon corporate, it was definitely a victory for them.
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.120]   They had a side.
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:15.120]   They picked a side.
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:18.920]   They pushed it real hard, and then we saw the impact of it.
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:23.000]   It's an interesting goal to become Earth's best employer and Earth's safest place to
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.680]   work.
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:30.960]   A lot of this letter was talking about how we already are great, so I'm not sure exactly
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:37.280]   what he plans to do to make it the best employer and the safest place to work.
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:39.920]   There's a couple of things here.
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:48.320]   Number one, Bezos is doing what Bill Gates did 15 years ago.
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:51.160]   Andrew Carnegie did before him.
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:57.400]   Andrew Carnegie did back in several generations ago.
[00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:04.280]   People were skeptical about Bill Gates walking away from a day-to-day role with Microsoft,
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:05.720]   and yet that's exactly what he did.
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:08.280]   He became a philanthropist, one of the-
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:13.480]   Has really become his primary focus there.
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:19.960]   I guess like Andrew Carnegie, some of that was to renovate his reputation.
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:25.520]   I think to a large extent, but there was also, I think people who know Bill will say that
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:31.480]   there was some genuine personal transformation that happened along the way.
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:37.360]   I think the other thing about the whole union vote, there's two factors there that we really
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:40.000]   need to keep in mind.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:47.480]   One is that this vote took place in probably perhaps the worst possible place to have a
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:48.480]   union vote.
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:50.360]   This is one of the reddest states in the country.
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:57.400]   One of the reddest states with one of the most powerful so-called right-to-work traditions.
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:03.880]   I just get angry when I have to use the phrase right-to-work because it's the exact opposite
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:06.760]   of what it should be.
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:13.160]   Right now, the United States is one of the most anti-union countries in the world.
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:23.320]   Basically Bezos is operating as the kinder, gentler face of what every corporation is doing.
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:25.480]   They don't have to bust unions anymore.
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:29.880]   The unions are in shambles.
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:37.240]   They're in shards on the ground.
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:45.680]   With an NLRB that isn't able to really influence the course of the election very much, this
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:52.080]   one seemed kind of preordained.
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.040]   It's a country that's anti-union.
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:58.800]   It's a state that's aggressively read and anti-union.
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:01.640]   I guess this didn't surprise me at all.
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:06.040]   For Bezos to come back and say, "Well, thank goodness that our employees love us so much.
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:08.840]   I don't think that's what it means."
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:14.680]   He quoted 94% of our employees say they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:15.680]   work.
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:19.400]   He says, "We want to make that 100%, but 94 is not bad."
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:21.200]   This is better than Wendy's.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:25.360]   Well, and it pays better than Wendy's, I might add, and pays better than Walmart, I might
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.360]   add.
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:27.360]   There are plenty of-
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:30.480]   At the end of the day, the workers did vote.
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.560]   They did get to vote.
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:32.560]   They got to vote.
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:35.720]   I can't just count their choices even though Amazon is one of the most-
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:42.240]   This is Jeff Bezos' farewell.
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:50.120]   Do you think this is his attempt to leave on a high note and just kind of walk away,
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:52.760]   watch his hands of the whole thing?
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:56.560]   How well will Amazon do without Jeff Bezos at the helm?
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:04.720]   I think for whatever you don't like about him, you have to say strategically he's amazing.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:05.720]   Right?
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:07.120]   I mean, he's brilliant.
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:08.120]   Or no.
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:10.520]   I mean, the culture- Go ahead.
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:12.440]   Alex, you first.
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:18.040]   I would just say that the culture that he's built, when you start to look at it upfront,
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:22.000]   and of course there's an element of how workers are treated, I think could be better.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.920]   I think there's a different scene that the experience in the warehouse and the experience
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.560]   in the executive suite, right?
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:29.560]   Two.
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:30.560]   Different jobs.
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:31.720]   Very different jobs.
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:38.240]   No doubt, but there are some constants where both workers in the fulfillment centers and
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:43.720]   workers in the corporate offices can have their jobs automated away.
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:44.720]   We'll have to adjust.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:49.880]   In fact, this past week on the big technology podcast I had, one of the people who worked
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:55.760]   in Amazon's corporate offices, a woman named Elaine Kwan, who had her job automated away.
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:04:00.120]   She was on the phone with Gucci and Versace, stocking the fulfillment centers, and all of
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:03.360]   the sudden that was handed over to machine learning.
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:08.200]   Everybody inside that company needs to be able to adapt and embrace change.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:11.800]   You look at most big companies and they just kind of make something and they stop.
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:15.320]   This was the case with Microsoft for a long time, where they made Windows, they were the
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:18.800]   desktop operating system, and they stopped.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:22.360]   Only after we moved to mobile and the cloud did they actually have to catch up and they've
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:25.760]   done a good job, although they were pretty late to the game.
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:30.080]   But you look at Amazon and they're always one step ahead of what's going on.
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:33.480]   You know, bookstore, then selling everyone through a first party marketplace, to build
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:38.240]   a third party marketplace, logistics and fulfillment, voice computing, hardware manufacturing,
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:42.080]   with something like the Kindle, not to mention the fact that they're a grocer, an Academy
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:45.360]   award-winning movie studio, and now they're moving it to healthcare.
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:49.720]   And you don't excel at all that stuff unless you're a culture, your leadership, and your
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:53.080]   processes and internal technology are locked in.
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:56.760]   And I don't think there's anybody on the planet right now that's done a better job at that
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:58.080]   than Bezos.
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:01.840]   So I think the company will be able to survive, and the big question is whether they're going
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:07.520]   to be able to keep that mentality that Bezos has instilled from his position at the top
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:08.520]   after he leaves.
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:13.480]   Jesse, of course, has shouted him as his technical advisor back in the day before he built AWS.
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:17.040]   He's done a good job with AWS, built it into a massive business.
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:20.200]   But you never quite know until the person at the top leaves.
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:24.200]   And we know with Microsoft, Bill Gates left and they put Steve Ballmerin, who was just
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:26.400]   there to, you know, ended up making money.
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:30.080]   And they needed to make another leadership change to get back to their more inventive
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:31.080]   ways.
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:32.080]   So that'll be a question with Amazon.
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:38.280]   But I think Bezos' legacy as somebody who's been able to build a powerhouse company, I
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:42.600]   don't think that's ever going to go into question in the long term.
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:45.120]   I'm now sleeping on an eight-sleep bed.
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.120]   Nice.
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:49.520]   Yeah, that is a wealth of information on stuff like that.
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:53.840]   They just pushed a new update to their app, which is terrible.
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:58.560]   If anybody at eight-sleep is listening, please, please, please fix the jankiness.
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:01.440]   It was good before and now it is challenging.
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:05.080]   This is the problem with IoT mattresses.
[01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:06.560]   Yeah.
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:09.800]   The mattress succeeds, lives on, but the software...
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:10.800]   Yeah, it fails.
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:11.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:18.560]   I will tell you, though, I sleep great with a thermal regulation.
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:20.680]   That's cooling is very important, isn't it?
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:23.160]   And heating, I cook myself awake.
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:25.000]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.160]   So you chill yourself to sleep and you cook yourself to wake.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:29.160]   I do.
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:35.480]   And I haven't woken up to an actual alarm in months, so I'm up at 5, 4, and every morning.
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:36.480]   So the software...
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:42.980]   So the whole idea of these mattresses, eight-sleep.com spell that, lets you control the
[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:47.680]   temperature in the mattress and with...
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:49.600]   It has heating and cooling coils.
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:51.040]   So the software you're saying...
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:55.000]   The software Amy says, "Okay, when you want to sleep and it cools the mattress and then
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.760]   when you want to wake up and it heats it up."
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:02.240]   But it gives you a bunch of other metrics like what your REM cycles were, what your
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:04.840]   respiration is, what your heartbeat is, makes it...
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:05.840]   Wow.
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:06.840]   How to get more restful sleep.
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.640]   It's actually up until this...
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:11.000]   I'm sure they're going to fix whatever the problem was.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.360]   And actually, they would be a good advertiser for this show because I'm sure everybody listening
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:15.360]   is...
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:16.360]   I know.
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:17.360]   This is their kind of...
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:18.360]   And you don't have to buy the mattress.
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:19.360]   You can just get a part of our cover.
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:20.360]   No, no.
[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:21.360]   It's mattress.
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:22.720]   Oh, so you didn't get the mattress, you got the cover?
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:24.840]   No, we just have a cover.
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:27.000]   That's a lot more affordable, I'm sure.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   It is.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.760]   And if you've got a mattress that you really love, you don't need the whole thing.
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:31.760]   Holy cow.
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:33.760]   I love my Casper.
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:38.200]   I'm not sure I'm going to spend $1,895 for a mattress pad.
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:42.120]   But I guess you need it because it's got to be heating and all that stuff.
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:43.640]   My husband and I both...
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:46.840]   He has a weighted thermal blanket and I just have a...
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:49.320]   I sleep under a 20-pound blanket.
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:51.040]   I'm sleeping better than I've ever slept.
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:52.040]   And I had chronic insomnia.
[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:53.040]   Wow.
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:54.560]   What is it worth to sleep well?
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:55.560]   I mean, absolutely.
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:56.560]   Yeah, definitely.
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:57.560]   Any price, right?
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:59.880]   Sleep tech is under...
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:04.960]   If you're in the know, then you become a super geek overnight.
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.400]   But you spend...
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:09.760]   How hot do you have to get it to be to wake up?
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:11.480]   So I have mindset to plus eight.
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:14.600]   I don't know what the actual temperature is, but I think it's a little warm.
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:15.600]   It's not like...
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:16.600]   115 degrees.
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:17.600]   Okay.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.040]   So it's eight above your body temperature.
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:21.960]   It's not about making you so uncomfortable.
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:23.160]   Oh, you do get hot.
[01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:24.160]   Yeah, no, no.
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:26.440]   I get so uncomfortable that I don't know the...
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:27.440]   It might be 120.
[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:28.440]   I don't know.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:31.920]   But no, no, it's like you want to be up because you're...
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:32.920]   It's too hot.
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:36.840]   Yeah, but you wake up and you're like, "I'm awake.
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:38.080]   I'm ready.
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:39.080]   I'm well-rested."
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:40.080]   Very tense.
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:43.480]   Versus like jolting awake to an alarm clock when your body's not quite...
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:45.720]   You know, you haven't gradually come out of your sleep.
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:47.320]   I hate alarm clocks, yeah.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:48.320]   Yeah.
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:51.920]   So this was the number one way you got rid of your insomnia or there were other.
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.800]   No, no, no.
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:55.480]   Years of cognitive behavioral therapy.
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:56.480]   Yeah.
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:57.480]   Also...
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:08:58.480]   My son is going through this.
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:08:59.960]   He cannot sleep all night.
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:00.960]   He cannot.
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.520]   He lies awake a long, long time.
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:05.200]   And I feel like he's suffering because of it.
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:06.200]   So anything else...
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:08.200]   So, bows make some...
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:09.200]   I have those.
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:11.880]   Those ridiculous earbuds that make sounds.
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:12.880]   Yeah.
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:14.640]   I also use those.
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:18.280]   I work with brown noise during the day and I sleep with pink noise at night.
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:19.280]   So...
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:20.640]   See, I found the trick.
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:23.960]   The way I hacked my insomnia because Amy, I'm exactly like you.
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:26.720]   I just have fought it for years.
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:31.280]   Is I found out if I get an odd book that I really, really, really know well.
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:35.280]   Like something I've read so many times, I kind of can guess what the next sentence is going
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:36.280]   to be.
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:37.280]   Like the expanse, yes.
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:38.280]   Like the expanse.
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:39.960]   This is why I've listened to it so much.
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:42.720]   What I do is I crack an audible file.
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:44.560]   I hope I can say that on here.
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:46.400]   I own it legally.
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:50.160]   And then turn into an MP3 and I put it on an iPod touch.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:56.280]   And then I get earbuds and I listen to this novel again and again all night long.
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:02.480]   And the way that reason the hack works is because when you get busy brain, like three
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:06.040]   in the morning, it's because you're thinking like, "Oh, I've got to do this tomorrow.
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:07.040]   I've got to do this tomorrow.
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.720]   I've got to do this tomorrow."
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:14.200]   But if it's a story you've listened to a ton, then you can kind of follow it.
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:18.080]   But you can also drift off and just start thinking about random things.
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:21.080]   And this has been the magic bullet for me in Sombia.
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:23.400]   I think that's like a linguistic.
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:26.240]   But I don't want to miss anything.
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.560]   So I love that idea.
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:29.320]   Listen to something you already heard.
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:30.320]   Yeah.
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:31.880]   It's linguistic counting.
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:32.880]   Right?
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:35.000]   Counting sheep you mean?
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   Right.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.840]   Most people who count already know how to count.
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.720]   You already know sequentially what's coming next.
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:40.720]   Right.
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:44.040]   It's reducing the processing power.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:50.640]   And when you're focused on a single thing, all of the chatter gets quiet.
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:52.360]   Chatter is the problem, isn't it?
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:53.360]   Chatter is the problem.
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:54.360]   Yeah.
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:57.160]   I find as I get older, my mind is just an empty slate now.
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:58.160]   So I just...
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:10:59.160]   I got it.
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:02.160]   Hey, Leo, before we go, can I ask you one last question?
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:03.160]   Yes.
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:05.960]   So, have you NFTED?
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:06.960]   Is there a NFTED?
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:07.960]   I have never NFTED.
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:08.960]   I am proud to say...
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:09.960]   Are you going to?
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:10.960]   Are you going to?
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:11.960]   Never going to.
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:15.040]   Well, I'm glad Amy Webb's sleeping well.
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:17.120]   Thank you, Amy.
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:18.120]   We love Amy.
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:19.120]   She's going to be back, by the way.
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:24.040]   In a couple of weeks, we're going to do a very special looking forward version, a future
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:25.040]   version of Twitch.
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:26.040]   She wanted to do this.
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:27.960]   She's a futurist, as you know.
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:31.600]   And she said, "Why don't we do an episode where we just talk about kind of thinking about
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:32.600]   the future of tech?"
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:34.440]   We thought, "This is a great idea.
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:35.440]   We're going to be joined.
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:36.960]   I'm very happy to say."
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:44.280]   My favorite science fiction author, Daniel Suarez, the author of Freedom, TM, and many
[01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:47.320]   other great books, it's his job.
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:50.320]   It's especially to think about the future.
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:51.320]   And we're going to get a scientist.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:53.880]   We haven't decided yet who, but we're going to get a scientist to join us.
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:58.880]   So, a futurist, a sci-fi author, a scientist walk into a room, and there will be an amazing
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:11:59.880]   twit.
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:00.880]   Is that next?
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:02.800]   I think it's next week, isn't it, Jason?
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:03.800]   That will be...
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:05.440]   Is it two weeks from now?
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:06.840]   Jason's checking the calendar.
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.360]   Anyway, that's next week.
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:09.360]   Next week, the night.
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:10.360]   Okay.
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.320]   That'll be a very special twit.
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:14.840]   So, this week we're looking back.
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:17.360]   Next week, I'll look forward.
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:20.320]   Should be really, really fun.
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:24.240]   But I'm thrilled about this because I've been a customer for a while.
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:26.720]   We're talking about balloon land.
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:31.240]   You know, Lisa and I have been really trying to cut back on our use of plastics.
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:37.600]   It's estimated five billion plastic hand soap and cleaning bottles are thrown away every
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:38.600]   year.
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.840]   We've turned to water bottles instead of plastic bottles.
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:44.080]   I've stopped using plastic shave razors.
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:46.120]   I really want to cut down our plastic.
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:48.120]   We don't use plastic bags anymore.
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:51.720]   All of that just goes in the landfill and it never degrades.
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:55.720]   It's just there forever, not to mention all the fossil fuels it uses to make it.
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:13:00.080]   That's why when we found blue land, we were really excited.
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:06.240]   It's not just by the way, fossil fuels, these bottles are also made of water.
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:09.400]   So that's another thing we don't have enough of.
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:14.160]   People it's 2022, stop wasting water, stop throwing out plastic.
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:21.080]   What you want is blue land, a great revolutionary refill cleaning system instead.
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:24.840]   Blue land was founded on the belief that a cleaner planet starts by eliminating plastic
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:26.400]   waste.
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:31.200]   We talk a lot about cleaning up the plastic waste in the ocean, but the best way to get
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:35.920]   rid of plastic waste in the ocean is never to create it in the first place.
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:41.320]   Blue land makes a great powerful, effective cleaner, range of cleaners for your entire
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:44.000]   home that eliminate waste.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   The idea is simple.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.960]   Buy the bottle once, refill it forever.
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:49.360]   No more plastic waste.
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:55.280]   Of course, the only thing you'll need to do is get rid of all that outdated eco-friendly
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:14:00.520]   stuff that's more expensive and less effective because blue land works.
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:03.440]   Just fill blue lands, beautiful, Instagrammable bottles.
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:05.040]   That's what they call them.
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.040]   They are beautiful.
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:07.800]   They're blue with warm water.
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:12.480]   You pop in one of the hand soap or spray cleaner tablets.
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:14.160]   That's all the factories doing, by the way.
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:19.000]   They're shipping all that water with just a little bit of cleaning product in there.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.840]   Why do that?
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:21.840]   Why do that?
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:25.240]   Within minutes, you just add the important ingredients to the water.
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:28.560]   The water from your own house, you didn't have to ship it.
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:32.160]   You got a powerful cleaning product and the most incredible, by the way, the smells are
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:33.160]   amazing.
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:37.480]   There's agave, there's perine lemon, lavender eucalyptus.
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:47.360]   It's just they smell great and most importantly, they work.
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:51.440]   We all want to make the planet a better place, but we also don't want to sacrifice to do
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:52.440]   it, right?
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:54.920]   We don't want to use ineffective eco-friendly products.
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:58.040]   Well, this is an effective product that's better, that works.
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:02.600]   Uses less water, doesn't use the plastic and cleans great.
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:07.360]   Check out their Clean Essentials kit, their hand soap duo, the plastic-free laundry and
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:09.200]   dishwasher tablets.
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:12.920]   Blue land has something for every inch of your home.

[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:24.880]   The problem was it sold out.
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:26.920]   Get it now before it sells out again.
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:31.320]   Blue Land's stunning high quality forever bottles start at $10 when you buy the kit.

[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:36.560]   that water.
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:37.720]   They don't have to make the bottles.
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:38.720]   It's just $2.
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:41.320]   Just they started $2.

[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:26.560]   Thank you so much for supporting our holiday episodes of This Week in Tech.
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:40.600]   This was the year that the world's most famous internet meme hit 1 billion views.
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:46.600]   Rick Astley got his billion views.
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:50.720]   I am not going to Rick roll you fear not, but the Rick-
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:52.640]   He remastered it in HD.
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.120]   It's wonderful.
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:55.120]   Yeah.
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:17:02.720]   So, the official video for Rick Astley's 1987 hit, "They're going to give you up," is
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:09.000]   now a 1 billion view video on YouTube because of Rick rolling, right?
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:16.240]   I don't think without Rick rolling, there would be, in fact, anybody watching this video.
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:21.600]   Furthermore, in case you don't know, Rick rolling is, of course, punking somebody by
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:23.560]   sending them a link to something they really want.
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:26.160]   Instead, they get a video of Rick Astley.
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:30.200]   "Never going to give you up dancing like they danced those days."
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:31.920]   He's really young in that.
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:34.640]   He was very grateful, by the way.
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:39.920]   Did he know, when did he learn that what Rick rolling was?
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:43.200]   I think it's when he got Rick rolled.
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:50.560]   Someone probably sent him his own video.
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:53.840]   He is very grateful.
[01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:58.400]   His career obviously got a little kick in the butt.
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:03.280]   Oh, his parents are explaining to their kids who he is.
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:04.280]   Yeah.
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:05.280]   Yeah.
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.280]   Yeah.
[01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:07.280]   Exactly.
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:09.160]   Here he is expressing his gratitude.
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:10.160]   Rick Astley.
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:11.160]   He's streamed a billion.
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.160]   Let me go back.
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:16.200]   He's told that "Never going to give you up" has been streamed a billion times on YouTube.
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:18.280]   That is mind-blowing.
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:20.480]   The world is a wonderful and beautiful place.
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:24.720]   I am very lucky.
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:30.560]   And now you know why we use sound engineers when we record audio.
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:31.720]   And we don't record on a lake.
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:32.720]   Yeah, what is he?
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:33.720]   A boat?
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:34.720]   What the hell is he doing?
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:35.720]   He's not a boat.
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:40.160]   He missed an opportunity to start off saying they was thinking and then cut into the record.
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:42.000]   He should have actually cut to it.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000]   That's right.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.000]   Yeah.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   One billion views.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000]   That's nothing.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.880]   I mean, Oppo Gangnam Style.
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:51.880]   Where are we now with Oppo Gangnam Style?
[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:53.960]   There are many multi-billion.
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:54.960]   It did.
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:59.000]   But there are many, many multi-billion views.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.680]   What is the most viewed YouTube video I wonder?
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:02.760]   Let me see.
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:08.280]   I always think he kind of looks like you in this, by the way, Oppo Gangnam Style.
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:09.280]   Father Robert.
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:13.600]   I feel like it's kind of Father Robert singing this song.
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:15.920]   I danced to this thing enough.
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:16.920]   Yeah, I know.
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:20.120]   We had fun with this song.
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:25.320]   This song single-handedly, it proved the concept for the studio, for the brick house,
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:28.600]   because there was so much entertainment that wasn't in the show.
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:29.600]   Yeah, we would actually.
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:30.600]   It was between the shows.
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:35.760]   And you mastered that strange dance that he does with his ride in the horse.
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:38.600]   You actually were quite good at that.
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:42.800]   There are 4.1 billion views on Oppo Gangnam Style.
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.040]   But I don't think that that's the top.
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:48.360]   I think there are 7 billion views on songs now.
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:50.320]   So 1 billion is an all that great.
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:51.320]   I suppose if I went to-
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:52.760]   But, okay, look, you know what?
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:56.160]   That song, never going to give you up, is actually a good song.
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:57.160]   It's an 80s song.
[01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:58.600]   I mean, it's a period piece.
[01:19:58.600 --> 01:19:59.600]   It is.
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:00.600]   It's not just a meme.
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:02.600]   It's not just a role.
[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:06.240]   Actually, I think Baby Shark might be the-
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:09.240]   Oh, my God.
[01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:11.240]   Oh.
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:12.240]   Most viewed.
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:13.240]   9 billion views.
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:14.240]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:15.240]   9.
[01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:16.240]   9 billion views.
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:17.240]   Also Korean.
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:18.240]   Also Korean.
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:20.240]   There's something going on.
[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:21.240]   There's something in the water.
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:23.240]   Should we just play a little?
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:25.240]   Actually, let's just play a little bit of that.
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:26.240]   Oh, no.
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:27.240]   Just drive away all the-
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:29.240]   You'll get a copyright strike for sure.
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:30.240]   Will you?
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:31.240]   If you play it?
[01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:32.240]   Yeah.
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:33.840]   Actually, Ali Spagnola broke this down.
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:36.240]   She explained why that song is so addictive.
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:38.320]   It's because it ends on a minor chord.
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:40.240]   And any time we hear that, we want resolution to-
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:41.240]   So you play it again?
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:42.240]   You play it again.
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:43.240]   And it never happens.
[01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:45.840]   Please, Mommy, give me a major chord.
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:46.840]   Please!
[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:47.840]   Oh.
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:53.560]   I was completely blissfully unaware of this song until we were in Dubai a year ago.
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:57.880]   And you know, in Dubai, they have the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building, was the tallest
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:00.440]   building in the world, and has lights going up and down.
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:06.040]   And in front of it, they have a fountain display, kind of like in Vegas, in front of the Bellagio,
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:07.040]   where it fires.
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:09.840]   And they play music on the hour and they do the thing.
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:13.240]   So we're staying there waiting for the fountain display and there it goes.
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:14.760]   Baby shark.
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:17.120]   And I had never heard this song before.
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:18.240]   But you know what?
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.640]   It ended on a minor note.
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:21.480]   That really bothered me.
[01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:22.480]   You wanted to play it again.
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:23.480]   I had to play it again.
[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:24.480]   Yeah.
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:25.480]   That actually makes sense.
[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:26.480]   Again and again and again.
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:27.480]   That makes sense.
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:30.280]   Big birthday this week.
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:31.280]   I love the register.
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:33.680]   The registers are so good at headlines.
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.640]   Beige against the machine.
[01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:39.680]   The IBM PC turns 40.
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:42.800]   5150, not just a medical emergency.
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:45.680]   Also the beginning of the office.
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:46.680]   Brick.
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:52.400]   It was on August 12th, 1981.
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:56.760]   Big Blue released the first IBM PC.
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:58.240]   We didn't call it the 5150.
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:01.040]   We call it the PC.
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:05.880]   And it transformed an industry because up until then there were lots of personal computers,
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:08.800]   Commodore and Atari and Apple.
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:12.600]   M-Sci, Mitz, all had made personal computers.
[01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:15.280]   But they were very hobbyist focused.
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:20.560]   When IBM arrived, it gave it a serious business cache.
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:27.040]   And remember the full page ad that Steve Jobs took out in the Wall Street Journal saying,
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:29.640]   "From Apple, welcome IBM.
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:30.640]   Seriously."
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:34.880]   They might have underestimated the impact IBM would have.
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:38.920]   Do you remember Mike, the first PC when it came out?
[01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:40.160]   Do you have a memory of that?
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:42.160]   Maybe you're not old enough.
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:47.480]   I was not super paying attention at the point where that came out.
[01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:51.560]   It was more like the mid-80s when I started really getting into computers and stuff like
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:52.560]   that.
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:58.640]   By 1990, I started editing a computer magazine that very quickly became Windows Magazine.
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:08.200]   And that whole magazine thing in the '90s was 100% a direct line to this very event that
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:11.800]   you're talking about, the creation of the IBM Model 5150.
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:17.720]   And so of course, we were always writing about the history, the ancient history of the,
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:21.320]   you know, during the '80s of the IBM PC.
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:26.080]   And you know, it really, it really, there are very few things that changed the course
[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:28.840]   of technology the way this did.
[01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:34.120]   It could have gone in whole different directions, but because they use open components, because
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:40.920]   they had a reverse-engineerable BIOS, because they idiotically went, got in bed with Bill
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:41.920]   Gates.
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:45.320]   That's a great story, by the way.
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:49.880]   That set the tone for everything to happen for the next 20, 25 years.
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:51.400]   So it was open.
[01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:53.600]   They chose off the shelf parts.
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:55.760]   The only thing that was proprietary was the BIOS.
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:24:00.720]   I don't think they designed it to be reverse-engineerable, but it didn't take very long for compact
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:08.120]   and others, Phoenix and others to say, "Oh, we can make a PC compatible BIOS," which meant
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:11.120]   that within a year, compact was selling a compatible.
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:13.400]   It would run the same software, run the same opera.
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:15.600]   Well, that was the other smart thing.
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:21.560]   And the dumb thing that IBM did, they were looking for an operating system for the PC.
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:28.320]   They came out to Monterey, California, because DR-DOS was a very popular operating system
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:30.560]   in the CPM days.
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:38.560]   And Gary Kildall was a creator of DR-DOS Digital Research, founder and president, was famously
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:44.040]   flying his private plane and declined to meet with IBM.
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:49.320]   So they flew up to Redmond, Washington, where there was another young upstart company, Microsoft,
[01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:52.760]   known for its basic, not for an operating system.
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:56.320]   They met with Bill Gates and said, "We need an operating system for the PC.
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:57.320]   You got one?"
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:02.040]   Bill said, "Yeah, he didn't.
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:07.600]   But he knew of a company called Seattle-DOS, which had a DOS that would be compatible with
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:11.680]   IBM's 8088 chip, the chip that they were putting in there.
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:13.280]   It's an Intel chip."
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:20.280]   And he, without telling the owners of Seattle-DOS, went across the street, said, "I'd like
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:22.320]   to buy Seattle-DOS."
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:28.720]   Didn't mention that there was another company interested, bought it for a song, and then
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:33.160]   turned around and sold it to IBM as PC-DOS.
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:39.960]   The other thing that Gates did, it was probably the single biggest business move in history,
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:40.960]   he made a deal with IBM.
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:44.280]   And I don't know why IBM agreed to this, not to give it to them outright, not to sell it
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:49.160]   to them outright, but to retain the rights to it.
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.960]   And he looked like he was 12 at the time.
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:55.480]   Yeah, we got an operating system.
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:26:01.040]   Yeah, I mean, but to me, and actually, that's funny because Seattle-DOS came from Seattle
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:03.560]   Computer Products, which was staffed by high school students.
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:09.800]   So remember, in the early days, this is in the late '70s, early '80s, this was a hobbyist
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:10.800]   thing.
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:11.800]   Nobody was serious.
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:12.800]   Exactly.
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:13.800]   Yeah.
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:15.440]   I mean, he set the tone, I think, as a historian of Silicon Valley.
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:18.000]   He set the tone for the industry.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:26.000]   So you had these well-meaning companies actually producing good products that were, you know,
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.520]   they were sort of relaxed about things.
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:37.560]   And then you have this bare knuckle aggressive liar come along and just have this hyper-aggressive
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:43.160]   attack on IBM, saying that he had things he didn't have, and then a massive work ethic
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:44.160]   to go with it.
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:45.520]   We'll need to just do whatever it took.
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:47.400]   I mean, he did the Altair basic.
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:52.440]   You know, he lived in a trailer in a strip mall and worked, you know, he dropped out
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:55.200]   of Harvard and worked night and day to make that deal happen.
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:56.200]   It's not like he's lazy.
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:57.200]   Oh, God, though.
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:02.440]   It's just a combination of massive work ethic, lots of brains, no ethics.
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:04.560]   And being a predatory businessman, basically.
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:05.560]   Exactly.
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:09.200]   And that set the tone for the Silicon Valley we know and love today.
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:16.200]   He bought PC DOS from Seattle Computer Products for $25,000, like the same month that IBM
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:19.560]   came to him and he didn't have anything.
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:26.480]   Just prior to the launch of the PC on the August 12th, on July 27th, he went to Seattle
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:31.640]   DOS and said, "I'll give you another $50,000 for full rights."
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:33.240]   And they didn't know anything about the PC.
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:34.240]   They said, "Okay.
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:38.920]   So for $75,000, you bought an operating system," which basically made Microsoft.
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:42.400]   And then he made a deal with IBM, saying, "Well, we'll keep the rights.
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:44.440]   We'll just license this to you."
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:49.280]   And I don't know why IBM agreed to it, but what it made possible is the compatibles,
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:56.360]   because then he was able to sell MS DOS to Compaq and all these other makers of PC compatibles.
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:01.000]   And it made it completely 100% IBM PC compatible.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.640]   Which is good for us.
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:03.640]   Right, exactly.
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:08.920]   This is the thing that among the hobbyist market, software was just nothing and hardware
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:11.080]   was everything.
[01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:15.720]   The hobbyist, like the Chaos Computer Club that Steve Wozniak was part of, they would
[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:19.080]   just write software and hand it around and it was free, it was no big deal.
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:22.880]   And then the computers were the thing that monetary value.
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:26.320]   And Bill Gates had the vision to understand, no.
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:30.600]   It's just that everyone's software has all the power.
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:35.080]   Don Estridge, a skunk works project out in Boca Raton.
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:39.680]   You know, IBM was up in Armock, New York, up your way, Tim.
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:41.200]   Not quite so far north.
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:42.600]   Not too far away.
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:44.280]   Not too far away.
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:47.720]   So they said, "Look, we're known for mainframes.
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:52.560]   Let's send a small team of engineers down to Boca Raton and they're going to design
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:53.560]   something.
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:55.360]   What was the code name for the original IBM PC?
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:57.440]   I'm trying to remember.
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:02.160]   Had a good code name.
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:04.520]   Project, let's see, project chess, according.
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:08.240]   But I don't know if that was the code name for the original PC.
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:10.160]   Anyway, they designed it.
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:14.360]   You may remember the ads for the IBM PC?
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:16.320]   Acorn was the...
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:17.320]   Acorn.
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:18.320]   Yup.
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:19.320]   Yup.
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:20.320]   Thank you.
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:23.680]   Charlie Chaplin, remember these for the first, let me see if I can find one.
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:25.720]   Yeah, the beautiful ads.
[01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:30.200]   While you're finding that, it's interesting that the low end model of the IBM PC had 16
[01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:31.200]   kilobytes.
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:32.200]   Kilobytes.
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:37.600]   I just bought an iPad that has 16 gigabytes of RAM.
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:38.600]   I know.
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:39.600]   I know.
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:43.080]   And some consider that low.
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:46.400]   Charlie Chaplin with some of the original IBM PC ads.
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:48.440]   They were going after business.
[01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:54.000]   It didn't, the base model, which was 1,500 bucks, did not have floppy disks or a hard
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000]   drive, heaven for fend.
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.880]   It had a cassette interface.
[01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:05.080]   And you would save your programs and your files out to cassette.
[01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:07.880]   They did offer, if you were only to spend more, you could configure it all the way up
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:08.880]   to $5,000.
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:10.640]   You could get dual floppies.
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:11.640]   No hard drive.
[01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:13.240]   There it is with the dual floppies.
[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:15.000]   That big old CRT.
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:20.240]   You could either get it in color, kind of a hideous, I can't remember how many colors
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:26.040]   it had, 256 colors, or you could get it monochrome, green on black.
[01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:28.720]   The IBM personal computer.
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:29.720]   Try one on.
[01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:31.440]   I have a store near you.
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:32.440]   Yeah.
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:33.440]   Wow.
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:34.440]   1981.
[01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:35.440]   40 years ago.
[01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:37.280]   It's not that long, really.
[01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:38.280]   No.
[01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:41.280]   But boy, the world has changed, thanks to that.
[01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:42.280]   Yeah.
[01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:43.280]   So we have to change this then.
[01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:44.280]   Yeah.
[01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:46.760]   Interesting alternative history.
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:55.640]   Gary Hildall, who started digital research in the Monterey area near where Tim Stang, says
[01:30:55.640 --> 01:31:00.640]   in his unpublished memoir, which is actually available via the Computer History Museum,
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:04.240]   that he and Bill Gates had talked about merging their companies.
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:05.240]   Oh.
[01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:09.800]   And in which case, Microsoft, which at the time was in Albuquerque, New Mexico, would
[01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:11.280]   have moved to Pacific Grove.
[01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:13.160]   Oh, that would have been wonderful.
[01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:16.600]   I think that would have been a very different history of Silicon Valley.
[01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:19.520]   I used to live on Lover's Point in Pacific Grove.
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:20.960]   I love that area.
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:33.000]   But Hildall thought that he called Bill Gates "opinionated" and was always uneasy around
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000]   him.
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.000]   Yeah.
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:39.600]   And by the way, I think he has said that that's apocryphal that he was flying around
[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:43.040]   in an airplane.
[01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:46.400]   Maybe that's an urban legend, but it's a great urban legend.
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:49.720]   For whatever reason, IBM didn't do a deal with him and went to a company that did not
[01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:53.480]   in fact have a PC DOS and bought it from them.
[01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:59.040]   Bill Gates didn't even have a tie when he went to the meeting and he had to borrow one.
[01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:00.040]   Is that true?
[01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:01.040]   Oh, wow.
[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:02.040]   Oh, that's a story like that.
[01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:05.120]   We had to buy one in the airport or something like that.
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:06.960]   I'm going to see if I can find it.
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:08.960]   I don't know, maybe because I'm an old timer.
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:12.080]   I just love these.
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:15.200]   Here's the welcome seriously ad I think.
[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:17.520]   Let me see if I can find it here.
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:24.040]   It was in the Wall Street Journal, cleverly positioning the upcoming battle as a two-way
[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:30.040]   contest between the spunky and rebellious apple and the establishment Goliath.
[01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:33.200]   Here's an image of it from Inc.com.
[01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:34.200]   Welcome IBM.
[01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:35.200]   Seriously.
[01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:39.640]   The most exciting and most important marketplace since the computer revolution began 35 years
[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:40.640]   ago.
[01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:45.520]   Congratulations on your first personal computer.
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:51.760]   When we invented the first personal computer system, maybe a little hyperbole on that, we
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:56.200]   estimated that over 140 million people worldwide could justify the purchase of one if they only
[01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:58.160]   understood its benefits.
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:03.640]   Next year alone, we project that well over a million will come to that understanding a
[01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:05.560]   million people.
[01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:12.040]   Little did he know what IBM was going to do and just dominate the space.
[01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:14.040]   To this day, still PCs dominate.
[01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:18.360]   IBM is, of course, completely out of that business.
[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:20.680]   No, they don't do it anymore.
[01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:25.760]   Although they do have a two nanometer chip, so they're not sitting on the rest and on their
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:27.360]   laurels.
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:35.520]   price for a $51,000, $51,565 fully loaded system, more than $3,000.
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:37.960]   You could have monochrome or CGA.
[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:38.960]   That was the one.
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:42.000]   CGA did not have many colors at all.
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:46.280]   16 or 64 kilobytes of RAM.
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:50.040]   The processor and Intel 88 chugging along it.
[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:53.600]   And I do remember this 4.77 megahertz.
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.080]   Mega blistering.
[01:33:55.080 --> 01:34:00.080]   So did Apple have the last laugh?
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:03.480]   They're still in the personal computer business 40 years on.
[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:05.680]   Yeah, they beat IBM.
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:10.760]   If anything, IBM's mistake was making it so easy to clone.
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:16.720]   But if you're talking about the platform, that's why they were so successful.
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:18.320]   You could clone a PC.
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:23.520]   And so there are thousands of people to this day making what is essentially an IBM PC compatible
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:24.520]   still.
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:27.160]   And Microsoft even makes them.
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:28.640]   That's right.
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:29.640]   That's a good point.
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:33.080]   Happy birthday 40 years ago, August 12th.
[01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:37.400]   The IBM PC was born.
[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:40.640]   Carl Bodie has his body, right?
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:42.640]   Yeah.
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:43.640]   Not Tom Bodet.
[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:46.680]   Carl Bodie wrote an article saying, this is great news.
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:49.640]   More communities are building their own broadband.
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:51.280]   Why?
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:53.280]   Because of COVID?
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:55.280]   How is that happening?
[01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:59.280]   Well, you know, everybody, most people don't like their regional telecom giant, whether
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:03.400]   it's, you know, Comcast or whoever it is, you know, and most people only have the choice.
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:04.600]   It's about 83.
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:06.200]   A doable million American.
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:07.200]   Yeah.
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:11.840]   83 million Americans live under a broadband monopoly here in Seattle, which is, you know,
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.480]   Silicon Valley North.
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:15.920]   I have the choice of one provider, Comcast.
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:17.440]   Isn't that terrible?
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:19.280]   It's awful.
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:21.840]   And this has been going on for 25 years, literally.
[01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:24.960]   We've thrown billions and billions and billions of dollars at this problem.
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:28.480]   And it just, so I think a lot of these local towns and cities have just gotten incredibly
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:29.480]   frustrated.
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:35.520]   So there's about a thousand different communities that have in the last decade or to build their
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:40.800]   own broadband access that routinely winds up being cheaper, faster, more reliable.
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:45.560]   The money that the locals spend on this service goes back into the community.
[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:49.160]   The people who work for these providers tend to live in the communities they serve.
[01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:54.040]   So unlike a lot of these regional monopolies, the money is staying there and they're more
[01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:55.320]   accountable to the locals.
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:36:03.080]   So I'm surprised because I know that when Philadelphia tried this, that they were immediately sued
[01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:08.640]   and state legislatures across the country started passing bills prohibiting municipal
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:10.640]   broadband.
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:12.440]   This is despite those bills.
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:13.440]   Yeah.
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:18.800]   There's 17 states that currently have passed laws restricting towns and cities from getting
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:22.760]   into the broadband business or building their own broadband networks or expanding those
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:24.920]   networks.
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:29.080]   But I think COVID really showcased when you saw toddlers like sitting on the sidewalk
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:32.920]   outside of Taco Bell, try and get online for class.
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:36.560]   This has always been a problem, but COVID really accelerated the awareness.
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:38.760]   So it really is driven action.
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:39.760]   Good.
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:43.480]   And so those 17 states forget it.
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:44.480]   It depends.
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:46.200]   Each state has a different variation.
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:49.360]   Because it'll be an outright ban on building your own local network.
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:53.720]   And sometimes it'll be worded in a very convoluted way to make it as difficult as possible to
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:59.280]   raise funds or to expand or you can't mark it in this zone or you can only, if it's like
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:02.720]   a lot of these networks are built on the back of the local power utility.
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:03.240]   And so well,
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:04.240]   You can't do it.
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:05.240]   Do that, right?
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:06.240]   Yeah.
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:07.240]   Yeah.
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:08.240]   Yeah.
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:09.240]   Yeah.
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:10.240]   One of the fastest and cheapest fiber providers in the nation.
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:11.240]   They have gig at one.
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:12.240]   Yeah.
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:13.240]   Yeah.
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:14.240]   Yeah.
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:15.240]   But what a lot of people say you can't expand.
[01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:19.320]   And this network outside of the local utility footprint, you know, some of the laws will
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:20.320]   say something like that.
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:25.040]   And there's no real reason for it outside of the fact that the regional telecom monopolies
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:29.080]   who literally ghostray most of these laws just told the state representatives that they
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:30.080]   didn't want that to happen.
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:32.600]   And there's no stuff is super popular.
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:33.600]   It's bipartisan.
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:36.320]   There's no excuse for the failure that I've seen.
[01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:42.600]   And then the ideological argument is that, well, you wouldn't want government to compete
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:44.600]   with private industry.
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:45.600]   Yeah.
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:48.680]   But the counter argument is that, you know, a lot of these companies have had 20 years
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:52.040]   to wire these areas and they don't want to because the return on their investment is
[01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:53.040]   low.
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:56.600]   But at the same time, they don't want anybody else building their own broadband networks
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:58.600]   because they might want to go back there someday.
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:37:59.600]   Yeah, we may someday.
[01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:00.600]   Yeah.
[01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:03.200]   It's a very, it's a very cake and eat it too kind of thing for these companies.
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:04.600]   Oh, what a surprise.
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:05.600]   Yeah.
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:10.000]   I'm just thinking about when I ran for Congress, I got to know so much about local budgeting,
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.360]   like more than I ever would have thought.
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:19.520]   And like here in Dettum, where a friend of the show, Paul Thoreau used to live here too.
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:25.040]   We canceled our trail this year, like a just walking trail because COVID has destroyed our
[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:26.400]   municipal budget.
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:32.400]   If you go over to poor areas of Massachusetts, like Brockton, I can promise you the Brockton
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:38.040]   tax base is not going to like go for a bunch of broadband development right now.
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:42.880]   So I kind of, I'm for you, I'm with you in principle.
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:47.120]   But I'm also thinking about the people that need it most and thinking about towns like
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:51.200]   Whitman where they're like, Hey, we're just going to have our library open for three days
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:53.240]   a week because we have no money.
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:56.040]   You know, we're going to have a four day a week police department.
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:57.040]   Yeah.
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:03.720]   You know, I'm thinking about like, is it really a feasible thing all through the United States?
[01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:07.040]   Like COVID affects our local revenues for years.
[01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:10.920]   Yeah, it's not like a silver bullet where you could just do this in every nation.
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:14.960]   And there's also like multiple varieties of different types of ISPs that are built out
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:15.960]   of this model.
[01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:17.960]   You know, some will be on the back of the local power utility.
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:19.680]   They won't use taxpayer money at all.
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:24.440]   Some will be a private, private, public partnership that, you know, just works with a local provider
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:27.480]   like Google fiber or somebody to deploy to the area.
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:31.200]   So it's not all, it's not all just tax based driven models.
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:33.600]   I mean, there's a wide variety of models that can.
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:38.440]   Here in this little town of Petaluma, about 60,000 people, there was a big initiative about
[01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:41.200]   five years ago to put in community Wi-Fi.
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:44.960]   Initially, Comcast was going to help, but then they bowed out.
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:47.560]   Then another provider was going to help they bowed out.
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:49.360]   They put some stuff up, but it didn't work.
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:50.360]   It's gone.
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:51.360]   Yeah.
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:54.240]   And I think it's just a hard thing to do.
[01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:58.680]   And there isn't a lot of support from the incumbents, of course.
[01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:03.760]   So you really have to have a leader, a civic leader who's going to really push it through.
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:04.760]   Yeah.
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:07.960]   It's like any, you know, I mean, one of the things the telecom companies will do is they'll
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:11.760]   just say that these are automatic taxpayer boondoggles and you should never try it.
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:14.960]   But I mean, they're just like any other business plan and they require a good leader and a
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:15.960]   sound plan.
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:20.960]   And, you know, look at Chad, look at Chattanooga that built its own fiber network when Comcast
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:23.000]   refused to.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.560]   They've been ranked consistently one of the most affordable, fastest internet providers
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:27.560]   in the country.
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:32.640]   And the other good reason to do it is this evidence shows everywhere that incumbents were challenged
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:38.440]   by fiber, whether it was Google fiber or others, that prices went down, that, you know,
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:39.600]   speeds went up.
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:45.560]   And even in some communities where there's fiber up to this road, you could see the prices
[01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:48.360]   go up as soon as the fiber from the other companies not available.
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:49.560]   It's like no competition.
[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:50.560]   Great.
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:52.120]   We're going to raise the prices.
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:59.040]   And the thing that's frustrating is like, you know, the approach to ban these entirely,
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:03.360]   we've spent literally about 25 years where the US ever since we broke up mob, all the
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:08.720]   US telecom policy has basically been to do whatever the dominant regional monopolies
[01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:09.720]   want.
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:12.720]   I mean, with some exceptions occasionally, you know, like net neutrality was an effort
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:16.960]   to say, okay, maybe we should apply some very basic rules to these companies.
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:21.000]   And anytime anybody tries to do that, the companies get Congress to freak out, you know,
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:24.560]   rank something different, we'll destroy the internet, you know, you know, that's basically
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:25.560]   their life.
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:27.840]   But good news is we live in this great country.
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:31.400]   We have the best internet in the world, right?
[01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:32.400]   Incorrect.
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:33.400]   I'm afraid.
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:38.960]   I'm afraid we rank pretty much mediocre on every metric that matters whether you're looking
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:43.960]   at the country that invented the internet 14th place globally.
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:44.960]   Yeah.
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:45.960]   And speed.
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:46.960]   Yeah.
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:51.480]   We're both 14th in fixed line broadband and 14th in wireless.
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:57.040]   And I think the market's actually we actually got a little worse in fixed line broadband
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:59.400]   despite a lot of fiber.
[01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:04.560]   Wow, we're slower than Canada, Italy, Saudi Arabia.
[01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:11.040]   The argument I hear when I mentioned this is well, those countries have federally supported
[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:16.720]   or federally owned government owned internet companies or telecom companies.
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:17.960]   Is that always the case?
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:20.920]   No, no, I don't think Canada has too many of those.
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:24.480]   I mean, well, no, Canada's got the worst tele, it's funny because Canada's got the
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:25.800]   worst telecom companies.
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:27.600]   Yeah, they're very similar.
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:29.080]   They're all very similar to us.
[01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:33.880]   They're regional monopolies that have been allowed to write laws for literally 20 years.
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:37.520]   And then people stand around with the silly look on their face wondering why things are
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:39.160]   spotty and expensive and slow.
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:40.160]   Okay.
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:42.280]   I really support just anything.
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:46.640]   It seems logical to allow these little niche solutions to thrive so that we have any kind
[01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:47.640]   of competition solution.
[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:48.640]   Yes.
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:50.120]   100% common sense.
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:55.080]   And hey, at least we may only be 14th in terms of speed, but we are the least expensive,
[01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:56.080]   right, Carl?
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:57.080]   No, very much.
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:01.520]   One of the most expensive countries for both wireless and wired.
[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:04.360]   You're telling me we pay more and get less?
[01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:07.520]   Yeah, and then there's that customer service, which is.
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:09.760]   Oh God, I love them.
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:13.600]   I think I saw a survey once people would rather have a heart attack than call Comcast
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:14.760]   customer service.
[01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:17.320]   These companies are literally, yeah, yeah.
[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:20.840]   These companies are literally ranked worst in customer satisfaction and service than pretty
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:22.400]   much any industry in America.
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:26.680]   And when you think about the fact that includes banks, that includes insurance, that includes
[01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:30.640]   airlines, I mean, that's a feat and it's been pretty consistent.
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:34.280]   There's been some minor improvements from some of these companies in the last few years,
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:36.240]   but it's not great.
[01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:38.600]   I don't think I think we're still in 14th place.
[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:41.240]   I don't think maybe we're in 15th place.
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:42.240]   I don't know.
[01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:43.240]   I don't think it's gotten much better.
[01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:44.240]   All right.
[01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:49.040]   I'm going to wrap it up with a look at the 20th anniversary of the iPod and big changes
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:50.600]   in China.
[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:54.760]   But first I want to talk to you about the food box we got the other day.
[01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:59.120]   Okay, you've probably heard about imperfect foods.
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:03.400]   And I'm sure like me, you thought, well, they're going to be really, you know, imperfect.
[01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:04.400]   They're not.
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:05.400]   They're great.
[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:08.920]   This is the best food box I've ever received.
[01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:12.800]   How about this for a three in one new year resolution?
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:14.640]   Let's reduce food waste.
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:20.600]   Let's save time on grocery shopping and let's eat more fresh and delicious food.
[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:22.240]   That's imperfect foods.
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:29.520]   Here's a, you really want to feel bad, a cringe-worthy stat to start the year every year.
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:41.560]   Thirty five percent of the food supply in this country goes unsold or uneaten, wasted 35%
[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:45.800]   This is food in the grocery store shelves that gets thrown out because nobody bought
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:48.040]   it.
[01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:50.760]   Imperfect foods is working to turn this around.
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:56.080]   And I'm really happy to be part of this as a customer by sourcing foods that would otherwise
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:45:00.760]   fall through the cracks of our food system, not imperfect foods, just foods that are not
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:05.040]   going to be sold because they're too small, right?
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:09.520]   Or the kind of avocado that brews is easily doesn't look good on the shelf, but they're
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:10.520]   great.
[01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:13.800]   They look great and I'm so happy to have them.
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:17.120]   I know, you know, we look, we all want to combat climate change, but that feels like
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:18.760]   what can we do?
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:20.120]   What can one person do?
[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:22.840]   This is a great way to make an impact.
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:26.800]   It's just let's eliminate some waste imperfect foods.
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:27.800]   Let me explain what it is.
[01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:29.480]   I suppose I should explain.
[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:31.160]   We get a box every Thursday.
[01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:35.160]   You get a different day, I'm sure, but this is when we get ours every Thursday.
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:38.120]   The box, it's a grocery delivery service.
[01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:40.280]   It's not just vegetables.
[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:41.280]   It's everything.
[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:46.240]   An entire line of sustainable groceries, they taste delicious, they reduce waste, and they
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:51.720]   save you time because they come to you and all you have to do is accept that it's not
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:54.000]   going to be perfect except it is.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.560]   It's perfect.
[01:45:55.560 --> 01:45:57.440]   Go to imperfectfoods.com.
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:45:58.680]   See if they deliver in your area.
[01:45:58.680 --> 01:45:59.920]   If they don't, I'm sorry.
[01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:01.000]   I really am.
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000]   I'm so thrilled they do here.
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:09.200]   Once you sign up, you personalize your weekly grocery order with fresh seasonal produce.
[01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:14.880]   You can actually get pantry staples, yummy snacks.
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:17.920]   Really a lot of the stuff you would just go shop for anyway.
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:21.880]   Plus your order arrives on the, you get to choose on the same day every week so you can
[01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:25.840]   just make this part of your stress free routine.
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:28.040]   On Thursdays, that's my job.
[01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:29.520]   The imperfect foods box arrives.
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:30.800]   I put it in the fridge.
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:31.960]   I unpack it.
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:36.880]   I have to say, again, not imperfect.
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:38.880]   Perfect really looks good.
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:44.560]   On average, you can feel good about this because on average, imperfect food customers
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:49.000]   save six to eight pounds of food with every order.
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:52.240]   Food that would not be sold otherwise.
[01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:53.480]   It's great.
[01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:59.200]   Unlike on demand delivery companies, imperfect delivers weekly by neighborhood.
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:00.360]   That's reducing emissions.
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:01.480]   That's another goal of theirs.
[01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:06.800]   25 to 75 percent fewer emissions than you drive into the grocery store.
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:07.800]   It was on the way.
[01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:10.840]   They dropped it off on the way and they consolidated.
[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:12.200]   That's why we have Thursday.
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:14.480]   Your day will be different probably.
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:20.000]   You can also say, and this is a big thing for me, say goodbye to packaging guilt.
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.920]   They're the only national grocery delivery company that makes it easy to return your
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:24.800]   packaging after every order.
[01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:27.320]   They also use minimum packaging.
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:31.880]   Instead of a plastic bag full of oranges, then a plastic bag full of grapefruit and
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:36.480]   plastic bag full of apples, they're just in there.
[01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:38.880]   I'm telling you again, perfect.
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:43.200]   Okay, maybe it's a little smaller than you'd see in the grocery store.
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:44.200]   We got artichokes.
[01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:45.480]   They're a little smaller.
[01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:46.920]   The grocery store won't stock them.
[01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:47.920]   I want them.
[01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:48.920]   They're great.
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:50.560]   They're better, frankly.
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:52.080]   Zucchini, broccoli.
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:53.240]   I've never had a fresher.
[01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:54.680]   You had a broccoli in my life.
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:56.680]   It was incredible.
[01:47:56.680 --> 01:48:01.160]   I'm sincere in saying I highly recommend you try this.

[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:24.000]   I don't care if my squash has Nixon's nose on it.
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.160]   I don't care.

[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:41.400]   I just think that's so great.
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:45.800]   I think I can probably thank my wife for that because she really cares about this stuff.
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:47.280]   Imperfectfoods.com.
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:48.280]   Promo code TWIT.

[01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:54.520]   foods.
[01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:55.680]   We're super happy.
[01:48:55.680 --> 01:48:57.160]   Imperfectfoods.com.

[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:01.880]   Thank you, imperfectfoods.

[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:05.640]   China's central bank.
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:16.720]   China has been really clamping down on a lot of digital stuff, including the latest, well,
[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:18.960]   when we did this show, cryptocurrency.
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:21.600]   Boy, did we have a good panel that day.
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:22.600]   Listen.
[01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:25.800]   I'm going to give you a chance.
[01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:28.480]   Think of all the things China has been able to do.
[01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:36.440]   They've been able to shut down and curtail the ultra growth in some of their more consumer-focused
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:37.440]   technologies.
[01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:43.920]   They get kids to only video game three hours a week on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:44.920]   holidays.
[01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:51.400]   Now they have said all cryptocurrency-related activities are illegal.
[01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:56.720]   Wouldn't it be nice if we had a totalitarian government and we could just come on in and
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:49:57.720]   say, "Facebook?
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:49:58.720]   It's going to be fixed."
[01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:06.840]   It would stop the Winklevoss twins all thrown around.
[01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:11.560]   We actually talk about, obviously, I'm a little bit tongue-in-cheek, so you don't have
[01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:13.720]   to come down too hard on it.
[01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:17.120]   But it is interesting that they're doing a lot of the things that people say here in
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:18.120]   the United States.
[01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:19.120]   Well, exactly.
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:20.120]   Beware.
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:22.040]   We can see where it goes.
[01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:23.040]   It goes toward China.
[01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:25.760]   I've been screaming that for years.
[01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:26.760]   You're right.
[01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:34.280]   Some would like that level of authoritarianism, but that ain't my country.
[01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:41.600]   I think, Jen, you probably follow this fairly closely given your interest in Asia.
[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:47.040]   The question that I've heard a lot of people say is this because the Chinese, the CCP
[01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:53.080]   has decided to focus more on infrastructure technology and infrastructure and less on
[01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:55.080]   consumer technology?
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:58.880]   I don't know.
[01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:10.280]   I think there's a case that a couple of things are going on, including the regime's incredible
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:14.880]   zeal to be a dictatorship and to clamp down and control everything.
[01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:22.760]   A free and vibrant consumer technology sector is not helpful to that.
[01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:25.240]   What's been amazing to see?
[01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:26.240]   I'm sorry, I did it down.
[01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:28.760]   I was supple you from finish up.
[01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:29.920]   There was just one other thing.
[01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:37.320]   On the clampdown on cryptocurrencies, I'm not sure that there's...
[01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:39.440]   Let me reverse it.
[01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:48.800]   I think there's probably another mode of there in addition to just general control for degree
[01:51:48.800 --> 01:52:00.720]   and related to that because the economy and in particular real estate is grossly overheated
[01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:02.760]   in China.
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:13.280]   They're in a major bubble on property values and have totally overbuilt and have had companies
[01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:21.000]   that are wildly over leveraged, knowing hundreds of billions.
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:28.720]   It may be that on banning cryptocurrencies, they're trying to control or at least slow
[01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:36.240]   down the flight of capital that tends to happen from countries that are perhaps heading
[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:40.240]   toward economic, really serious trouble.
[01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:46.640]   Of course, the whole world would be caught in that if it does happen.
[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:49.080]   That seemed pretty plausible to me.
[01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:55.920]   I don't remember where I read that, but that struck a chord as maybe that is part of the
[01:52:55.920 --> 01:53:02.360]   motivation to just prevent too much money from fleeing the country.
[01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:04.960]   Is it more cultural than that too?
[01:53:04.960 --> 01:53:09.840]   Isn't it a matter of control?
[01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:14.600]   If the regime could stay popular by everybody getting more money and growing and having
[01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:18.520]   bigger homes and buying more stuff, fine for the long that lasted.
[01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:25.440]   But then when trouble comes, they have to put the hammer down and we're almost headed
[01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:28.120]   to an economic cultural revolution.
[01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:30.480]   Is that going overboard?
[01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:33.120]   No, that makes sense.
[01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:38.720]   I think these are intertwined.
[01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:44.600]   If we're looking for some specific thing, because I thought this cryptocurrency ban
[01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:52.280]   was very sudden and I had not, there were some things that happened that were perhaps
[01:53:52.280 --> 01:53:58.000]   in retrospect leading up to it.
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.080]   This is a surprise to me.
[01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:09.080]   When we look in our own country and other countries about cryptocurrencies, I think people who
[01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:15.560]   are speculating in those areas who are not the insiders who are already profited and
[01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:20.400]   will stand to profit even more, be careful.
[01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:23.040]   I think there's a couple of things going on.
[01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:26.800]   These are great points about these real estate companies.
[01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:32.160]   The people say this could be another subprime that affects the rest of the world.
[01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:38.360]   In the last year, I've been really surprised to see how hard China is coming down against
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:48.120]   the entrepreneurs like Jack Ma, who were once celebrated as successes of the whole Chinese
[01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:50.120]   system.
[01:54:50.120 --> 01:55:00.320]   It's almost reminiscent of what Putin did to slam down the oligarchs in Russia.
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:06.040]   Maybe that's not the greatest way to build a global internet business, to take your most
[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:14.000]   glory to entrepreneurs and founders and charge them with crimes or remove them.
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:22.720]   I think certainly it shows that the control that China shows, it just can't be trusted
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:24.120]   as a global brand.
[01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:28.520]   You see, obviously we don't trust Huawei.
[01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:37.320]   And TikTok was sort of teetering in the Trump era.
[01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:42.800]   It's still the most popular download among social network apps.
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:48.960]   More engagement than YouTube, longer viewing times.
[01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:57.960]   But I would say that stands as an anomaly before the curtains come down on big private
[01:55:57.960 --> 01:56:00.080]   internet in China.
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:01.080]   They were the only companies.
[01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:05.760]   I mean, all these companies that are so popular and so universal and necessary in China that
[01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:10.000]   didn't break the border, isn't TikTok the only company that really did?
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:14.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:17.640]   Some people said that was going to be the dawn of this new era.
[01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:24.800]   But then you see what happened with Alibaba and Diddy now is under great pressure and
[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:26.920]   China's clamped down on them.
[01:56:26.920 --> 01:56:30.880]   The huge success, the company that beat Uber, right?
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:37.280]   And it's not just in China, but they're the main presence and ride sharing in some other
[01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:38.280]   countries.
[01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:44.920]   So it's really interesting to see how what looked like China's participation in a global
[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:50.000]   internet by nurturing these companies has done 180.
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.680]   China was even cracking down on WeChat.
[01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:58.920]   You were talking about these Chinese-only companies that are completely dominant in China.
[01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:03.840]   I don't know what's the status is today, but in last July, WeChat had stopped signing
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:04.840]   people up.
[01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:15.080]   Yeah, and there's another aspect to the clampdown on the social media type companies is that
[01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:23.400]   the China regime is basically saying, you know, companies, corporations, you may not
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:24.840]   spy on everybody.
[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:25.840]   We will.
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:26.840]   That's our job.
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:27.840]   The government.
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:28.840]   It's our job.
[01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:29.840]   Right.
[01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:30.840]   And you'll help us.
[01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:35.680]   But when it comes to who really is in control, it's us and don't forget that.
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:39.920]   I wonder if there's a subtext of the American government crackdown.
[01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:40.920]   Yep.
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:41.920]   Yep.
[01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:42.920]   I think so.
[01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:47.040]   I do have one thing to say about this rule that the kids can only play video games for
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:48.800]   like three hours a week.
[01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:55.000]   If these kids have not managed to figure out the hacker way has that, then China really
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:56.000]   is dead.
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:00.000]   Maybe they're trying to create a hacker class.
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.800]   That's probably one good way to do it.
[01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:05.600]   Teach kids how to get around the government crackdown.
[01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:06.600]   That's got to be.
[01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:08.040]   That's got to hurt.
[01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:10.400]   Three hours a week.
[01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:12.000]   Wow.
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:20.960]   20 years ago today, Steve Jobs taught the band to play put a thousand, a thousand songs
[01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:21.960]   in our pocket.
[01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:25.000]   Connie, you were at that event.
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:26.000]   I was.
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:34.240]   It was a notable day, not just because Steve Jobs was really good at doing presentations
[01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:40.920]   and keeping the audience enthralled, but because it was such a big risk for Apple at the time,
[01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:43.600]   it was primarily known as the maker of the Macintosh.
[01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:50.000]   It was 2001, so Jobs had been back five years and they were still in financial struggles.
[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:57.160]   They had had the new candy-colored iMacs before, but they still weren't solvent, I would say.
[01:58:57.160 --> 01:58:58.920]   They were still struggling to make money.
[01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:07.640]   For them to take a risk on the consumer electronics market was a big move.
[01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:13.480]   Jobs started out his pitch that day with an emotional appeal, which was everybody's into
[01:59:13.480 --> 01:59:14.480]   music.
[01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:16.440]   This is a market that's never going to go away.
[01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:17.440]   People love music.
[01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:18.440]   We love music.
[01:59:18.440 --> 01:59:19.880]   You should do what you love.
[01:59:19.880 --> 01:59:27.400]   He really did a good job of keeping the audience following along with him and his logic.
[01:59:27.400 --> 01:59:29.600]   There were other music players on the market.
[01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:34.080]   Apple is typically not the first into a new space, but he sold them on how it was going
[01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:35.080]   to be.
[01:59:35.080 --> 01:59:43.640]   Apple was going to make it elegant and easy and really fast to upload music to this very
[01:59:43.640 --> 01:59:45.440]   cool looking device.
[01:59:45.440 --> 01:59:49.440]   I have to admit, this is my original iPod I got at that day.
[01:59:49.440 --> 01:59:51.160]   It's pretty good shape.
[01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:52.800]   Not because Apple gave away a case.
[01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:55.400]   I actually asked Jobs about that.
[01:59:55.400 --> 01:59:57.520]   I said, "Have you thought about making cases?"
[01:59:57.520 --> 01:59:58.520]   He said, "What for?
[01:59:58.520 --> 01:59:59.920]   It fits in your pocket."
[01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:01.600]   I was wearing a skirt with no pockets.
[02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:04.760]   I'm like, "Because some of us carry stuff in our bags."
[02:00:04.760 --> 02:00:07.280]   I went home and I sewed my own little case.
[02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:08.280]   I found it.
[02:00:08.280 --> 02:00:10.080]   Oh, it's a little cow.
[02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:13.040]   It's a gateway case.
[02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:18.000]   With yarn from my kids plaything.
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:21.560]   Apple's kept this thing in pristine condition.
[02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:23.200]   It was a notable moment.
[02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:24.200]   It was a risk.
[02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:27.080]   It took a while for the iPod to be a success.
[02:00:27.080 --> 02:00:28.320]   I don't think people realize that.
[02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:29.960]   It was not an instant hit.
[02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:35.120]   It took them four or five years to really sell in the millions of devices.
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:40.640]   By then, they'd introduced the iTunes store and had taken on the music labels, as all
[02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:41.640]   of us recall.
[02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:46.320]   It was one of Steve Jobs' famous open letters to the industry and talking about why you should
[02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:52.120]   be able to buy songs individually rather than buying a whole CD.
[02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:53.400]   It was just cool.
[02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:54.760]   The silhouette adds.
[02:00:54.760 --> 02:00:57.240]   They had a U2 iPod.
[02:00:57.240 --> 02:00:58.520]   Bono was there for the launch of that.
[02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:01.880]   I actually got to meet Bono on the edge of that day.
[02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:02.920]   Very cool.
[02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:05.840]   There was a lot of good marketing hype.
[02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:10.960]   Of course, a thousand songs in your pocket was quite a great tagline.
[02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:11.960]   It was.
[02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:12.960]   We still remember it.
[02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:17.920]   Of course, it's trivial to put a thousand songs in your pocket now.
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:19.760]   What is on your iPod?
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:21.880]   Do you have the original music still on there?
[02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:23.760]   I do.
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:25.840]   Jobs gave away 20 albums.
[02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:29.520]   Everybody in the audience had to go home with a shopping bag with all the CDs.
[02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:31.040]   Otherwise, it would have been music piracy.
[02:01:31.040 --> 02:01:32.520]   You're kidding.
[02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:33.520]   To get them.
[02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:34.520]   I have all 20.
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:36.080]   I wrote a story about it on CNET.
[02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:38.440]   You can see a photo.
[02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:42.000]   There were a couple of Beatles, Hard Day's Night, Abbey Road.
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.080]   There was Two Simon and Garif Uncle.
[02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:45.880]   This is Steve Jobs' playlist.
[02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:49.320]   CNET put together a Spotify playlist if you want to hear it all.
[02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:52.600]   Yo-yo, Ma, Glenn Gould, BB King.
[02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:54.400]   Of course, Bob Dylan.
[02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:57.160]   Jobs is into Dylan.
[02:01:57.160 --> 02:02:02.560]   Just Sarah McLaughlin was the first bit of music played.
[02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:05.840]   The thing that I remember about that event, aside from people going, "Well, that's kind
[02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:07.840]   of cool."
[02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:11.960]   They had Firewire, which was their fast file transfer.
[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:14.600]   I still have the Firewire cable.
[02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:17.760]   Yeah, you and I both, in order to charge it, had a Firewire.
[02:02:17.760 --> 02:02:18.760]   Yes, Firewire.
[02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:24.200]   And the Firewire official Apple Firewire charging brick.
[02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:25.200]   Wow.
[02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:27.040]   It was fast.
[02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:29.360]   Watching him load music off of his...
[02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:32.240]   He had a Mac computer on stage.
[02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:33.720]   You had to connect it.
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:39.520]   You had to rip the CDs and then into iTunes and then you had to connect it to your computer
[02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:44.880]   and then you had to copy it over, synchronize it over, and it was carefully done so that
[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:48.520]   you couldn't easily steal the songs later.
[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:50.760]   But it was also Auto Sync, which was very cool.
[02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:52.240]   We could rip a lot of music.
[02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:58.840]   If you ripped 10 CDs on Tuesday and then you went back on Friday and you ripped others,
[02:02:58.840 --> 02:03:03.840]   it knew that what to sync up was, which is something that we take for granted now.
[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:07.360]   But that was a big deal in those days, honestly.
[02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:11.840]   And yeah, it was the start of Apple moving into this consumer electronic space.
[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:16.640]   And it was cemented in 2007, obviously when they introduced the iPhone.
[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:21.480]   A lot of people don't maybe not remember this, but on the day they introduced the iPhone,
[02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:24.120]   too, we've had the iPod and all the iterations.
[02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:27.920]   The iPhone kind of subsumes the iPod, right?
[02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:31.000]   Because the iPhone is a phone and it's a music player as well.
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:35.560]   And that was the day that Jobs changed the name of the company from Apple Computer Inc.
[02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:37.080]   To Apple Inc.
[02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:38.080]   And recognition that was happening.
[02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:39.080]   Oh, that was when that happened.
[02:03:39.080 --> 02:03:40.080]   The computer company.
[02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:42.640]   Yeah, on the day they introduced the iPhone, not the iPhone.
[02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:44.120]   Oh, yeah, the iPhone, yeah.
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:45.120]   Yeah.
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:46.120]   So it was the start of that whole path.
[02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:47.120]   Sure.
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:52.680]   And of course, $2 trillion valuation later, it was obviously the right call.
[02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:55.880]   Yeah, this was before the iPhone.
[02:03:55.880 --> 02:04:00.240]   This was the most successful consumer product of all time, I think.
[02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:02.200]   I mean, it really was dominant.
[02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:06.600]   You know, I have one story that I wanted to tell and that is, and no disrespect to Microsoft
[02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:10.000]   here, but at some point I, you know, was speaking at an event and someone gave me a
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:14.040]   Zoom and I still have the Zoom.
[02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:20.000]   It still powers up, but I came home and I had two kids and I gave my daughter, you know,
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:23.560]   this iPod to use and I gave my son the Zoom.
[02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:25.880]   Did he say, why do you hate me, Mom?
[02:04:25.880 --> 02:04:26.880]   He did.
[02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:27.880]   Do you love?
[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:28.880]   Do you love Laura?
[02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:29.880]   I'm loving.
[02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:31.480]   So you can have a Zoom.
[02:04:31.480 --> 02:04:32.480]   It's a Zoom.
[02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:35.880]   We had to, we had to, we had to, we got him an iPod after that.
[02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:41.400]   So a shuffle, by the way, that was the years of the iPod shuffle, even smaller with more
[02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:42.400]   capacity.
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:43.400]   Yeah.
[02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:44.400]   Anyway, yeah.
[02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:49.440]   How many iPods, I mean, we all have owned probably most of them.
[02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:56.040]   I even bought my sister the U2, the black and red U2 iPod, was loaded with U2 albums.
[02:04:56.040 --> 02:05:01.600]   They come to think about, there's been a long heritage of love between Apple and Bono,
[02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:02.600]   for some reason.
[02:05:02.600 --> 02:05:04.600]   I'm not sure I really understand that.
[02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:06.600]   Well, it wasn't just the U2.
[02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:07.600]   Who doesn't love Bono?
[02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:08.600]   Everyone loves Bono.
[02:05:08.600 --> 02:05:09.600]   Yeah.
[02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:11.400]   It wasn't just the U2 iPod.
[02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:16.160]   It was the first time that Bono and U2 had licensed their music digitally.
[02:05:16.160 --> 02:05:17.160]   Right.
[02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:18.160]   Big deal.
[02:05:18.160 --> 02:05:20.280]   Unlike a lot of musicians, they own a catalog.
[02:05:20.280 --> 02:05:21.520]   So that's why it was a big deal.
[02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:22.520]   That was a big deal.
[02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:25.880]   Getting them to say, okay, you can sell it digitally.
[02:05:25.880 --> 02:05:29.040]   Remember that, God, people, it's moved so fast.
[02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:33.920]   You forget bands did not allow digital copies of their music.
[02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:36.280]   They were terrified by the whole thing.
[02:05:36.280 --> 02:05:38.600]   Napster boy, line wire.
[02:05:38.600 --> 02:05:39.680]   Yeah.
[02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:46.280]   This was the other thing that is, I mean, this was a early MP3 player.
[02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:48.200]   This was for a car, obviously.
[02:05:48.200 --> 02:05:50.880]   But this is a laser disc.
[02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:51.880]   Was that an AT&T?
[02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:53.240]   I know hard drive in it.
[02:05:53.240 --> 02:05:54.240]   This is a real.
[02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:55.240]   That's a real.
[02:05:55.240 --> 02:05:56.240]   Exactly.
[02:05:56.240 --> 02:06:00.720]   And I had the little small portable Rio as well, the diamond Rio that was predated the
[02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:01.720]   iPod.
[02:06:01.720 --> 02:06:06.600]   But the thing that all of these did wrong, we even did many shows on the screensavers
[02:06:06.600 --> 02:06:08.360]   about building your own.
[02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:10.160]   Put a computer in your trunk.
[02:06:10.160 --> 02:06:13.000]   And MP3 is on a hard drive.
[02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:16.640]   But the thing was hard about all these is navigation.
[02:06:16.640 --> 02:06:17.920]   It was miserable.
[02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:20.120]   Finding your music and playing it was miserable.
[02:06:20.120 --> 02:06:23.280]   And it was a brilliant insight.
[02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:27.840]   Tony Fadel came up with the designer of the iPod to have that click wheel.
[02:06:27.840 --> 02:06:29.320]   These actually are sold.
[02:06:29.320 --> 02:06:32.040]   They actually turn.
[02:06:32.040 --> 02:06:33.960]   But they held up.
[02:06:33.960 --> 02:06:37.600]   That click sound is one of the things you could just play.
[02:06:37.600 --> 02:06:38.600]   You know.
[02:06:38.600 --> 02:06:39.600]   People know.
[02:06:39.600 --> 02:06:40.600]   You know exactly.
[02:06:40.600 --> 02:06:41.600]   People know it.
[02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:42.600]   Yeah.
[02:06:42.600 --> 02:06:45.880]   A lot of Britney Spears on this one.
[02:06:45.880 --> 02:06:49.120]   I'm just going to say it must have been my daughters.
[02:06:49.120 --> 02:06:51.800]   Or she was the last one to have it.
[02:06:51.800 --> 02:06:54.280]   I'm going to defend the zoom.
[02:06:54.280 --> 02:06:56.440]   The first brown zoom, not great.
[02:06:56.440 --> 02:07:01.680]   But at the end of the zoom, the zoom HD was actually a really good music device.
[02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:07.120]   And I was kind of sad that Microsoft having finally perfected that device gave up on it.
[02:07:07.120 --> 02:07:11.560]   But I was going to say by the time it got good, they were already they had already lost.
[02:07:11.560 --> 02:07:12.560]   Yeah.
[02:07:12.560 --> 02:07:13.640]   I guess that's what it was.
[02:07:13.640 --> 02:07:14.640]   You couldn't do.
[02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:16.560]   There was too much headwind.
[02:07:16.560 --> 02:07:17.560]   Yeah.
[02:07:17.560 --> 02:07:18.560]   It's funny.
[02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:19.960]   There's actually a huge following.
[02:07:19.960 --> 02:07:21.640]   If you go check out Reddit, there's a huge phone.
[02:07:21.640 --> 02:07:23.000]   People still love that device.
[02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:24.000]   The HD.
[02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:25.000]   Yeah.
[02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:26.000]   Yeah.
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:27.240]   I think that was in every wrist.
[02:07:27.240 --> 02:07:32.320]   It was kind of the windows phone of music players because it had a great interface.
[02:07:32.320 --> 02:07:34.440]   It had a big screen.
[02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:38.560]   It was kind of in every way superior to the competition.
[02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:41.120]   But it was too late.
[02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:42.840]   Just like the windows phone.
[02:07:42.840 --> 02:07:44.080]   It was over.
[02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:45.600]   Yeah.
[02:07:45.600 --> 02:07:46.600]   I was kind of sad about that.
[02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:50.240]   Shortly after Microsoft gave up its music, you could use to be able to buy music from
[02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:52.680]   Microsoft and all of that.
[02:07:52.680 --> 02:07:55.720]   They gave up all of that.
[02:07:55.720 --> 02:07:59.480]   Hard to believe 20 years ago.
[02:07:59.480 --> 02:08:02.640]   And does your son still think you like your daughter better?
[02:08:02.640 --> 02:08:06.200]   No, he has got we bought him iPhones.
[02:08:06.200 --> 02:08:07.200]   Yeah.
[02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:09.000]   He's been redeemed.
[02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:10.000]   Yeah.
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:11.000]   Yeah.
[02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:12.000]   That's good.
[02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.560]   Hard to believe 20 years ago.
[02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:15.560]   The iPod.
[02:08:15.560 --> 02:08:16.560]   You'll have it right here.
[02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:19.880]   The original as I showed on that episode.
[02:08:19.880 --> 02:08:21.880]   What a great fun time this has been.
[02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:30.880]   I really love going back through time with you through the year 2021.
[02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:33.720]   Only surpassed in weirdness by 2020.
[02:08:33.720 --> 02:08:35.240]   Another wonderful year in the books.
[02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:39.680]   We're going to see if 2022 can be any better, but we are going to immediately start collecting
[02:08:39.680 --> 02:08:42.960]   best of segments because it's always a lot of fun.
[02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:44.560]   Thank you so much for joining me.
[02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:46.880]   Again, next week we look ahead.
[02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:50.800]   We look to the future with a futurist, a sci-fi author and a scientist.
[02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:52.640]   It's going to be very, very exciting stuff.
[02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:54.480]   I think you're going to enjoy it.
[02:08:54.480 --> 02:08:58.280]   And I just want to thank you so much for your support all year long.
[02:08:58.280 --> 02:09:04.200]   A special tip of the Ho Ho Ho hat to our club twit members.
