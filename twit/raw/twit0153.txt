[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.020]   That's quite good.

[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.420]   No.
[00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.380]   No, actually I stopped drinking Dr. Pepper,
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.620]   started drinking Diet Coke, and gave up Diet Coke
[00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.220]   for the better part of a year before I started
[00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.620]   working in Revision 3.
[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.620]   So what do you drink now?
[00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.620]   You're not in Pepper stock.
[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.620]   Heh.
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.620]   There's always in Coke stock.
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.620]   Selling mine.
[00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.620]   Yeah, get everybody.
[00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.340]   I should sell, you know, short Dr. Pepper.
[00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.340]   Yeah.
[00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.180]   So, tell us, Patrick, what do you drink now?
[00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.820]   I drink a drink of coffee, and with the occasional Diet Coke,
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.580]   and I'm trying to cut the Diet Coke back out again.
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.380]   Basically, there's so much, I want to say phosphoric acid
[00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.180]   in both Diet Coke and regular Coke.
[00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.180]   True.
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.940]   Phosphoric acid is not the problem.
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:08.940]   What's the problem, John C. Devorak?
[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.060]   It is, John C. Devorak, because what it does is it basically
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.300]   sucks the minerals out of your digestive system
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.300]   before they can get to say your body.
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.780]   Can you give me a brain, Tonic?
[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.660]   Because I'm just thumbed this thirsty as hell.
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.980]   After all that, that's what we drink over here
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.980]   at the Twit Cottage Patrick.
[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.740]   And if you had come to get your copy of Anithym,
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.980]   the new Neil Stevenson novel, which is only available
[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.780]   to a select few before September 9th.
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.180]   And by the way, wow, I loved it.
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.500]   He's back to sci-fi.
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.500]   Oh, really?
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.500]   Yeah.
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.500]   Interesting.
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.300]   There's aliens in this one.
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.900]   And we don't drink Dr. Pepper, Coke, tea, or coffee here.
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.100]   We drink brain, Tonic, with an IQ at the end,
[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.620]   because it's good for your IQ.
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.460]   No caffeine, no grirana, just carbonated water,
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.980]   organic agave nectar, natural flavors,
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.300]   and eulethricococcus extract.
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.180]   That sounds almost like an advertisement.
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.020]   It almost is.
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.420]   If I were getting paid for it, it would be.
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.820]   Just do at least have a look.
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.420]   I was going to hit brain, Tonic.
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.820]   I was going to shut up and not say anything.
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.100]   I'm like, oh, he's reading an ad right now.
[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.460]   We're just that close.
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.780]   It was so smooth.
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.220]   Now, the deal was that they did want to get on Twit Live
[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.900]   on the live thing.
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.060]   And I said, well, I've never had it.
[00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.700]   I can't advertise some of that.
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.500]   So they sent us a case, and everybody here
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.660]   has become addicted to it.
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.660]   It's kind of creepy.
[00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.340]   You know, people come in and then I give it to the guests
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.260]   and they get addicted to it.
[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.700]   It's so--
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.100]   You notice I didn't try it.
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.780]   Yeah, did you not have some?
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.540]   I refuse.
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.660]   I'm like Kevin, I'm a tea drinker.
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.740]   You are.
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.180]   Well, you know what he did.
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.860]   He said, well, no, but do you have any giverts?
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.140]   Yeah, well, that too.
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.820]   So we said Colleen had to get some giverts
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.820]   from me in her wine.
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.060]   So he drank that.
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.660]   Well, actually, that's not actually accurate.
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.660]   I never said, do you have any giverts?
[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.460]   What we said, do you have any wine?
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.940]   And they said, what wine do you want?
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.140]   And I was thinking it was so boiling hot
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.580]   because we're out in the middle of boiling hotville.
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.580]   And it was like, it seemed like a good idea
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.940]   to have something refreshing and kind of white.
[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.820]   And so I thought giverts would be cool
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.340]   because I know they grow good ones up there.
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.740]   They do, and it was a good givert actually.
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.980]   You're all invited anytime you want to come by the cottage.
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.140]   You can have any beverage you want.
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.340]   You do not have to drink brain tonic.
[00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.060]   Although it's surprisingly delicious.
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.620]   That's my motto.
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.900]   It's unsurprisingly good.
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.300]   We have a lot of news.
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.660]   It doesn't suck.
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.100]   Yeah, it sucks less.
[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.660]   We have a lot of news stories to get to,
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.500]   and I want to get to them in a second,
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.340]   but we can't put Kevin Rose on the show.
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.060]   And I promise not to do this to you every time, Kevin.
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.260]   It seems like every time.
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.940]   Yeah, but you wouldn't be a problem
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.260]   if you'd show up more often.
[00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.260]   Sorry, sorry.
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.340]   He sent me a note saying he'd like to be on Twitter more,
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.820]   so I'm going to take them up on that.
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.100]   We'd love to.
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.420]   Kevin, you're always welcome here,
[00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.740]   but I know how busy you are because
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.460]   Dig is a big deal.
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.380]   You've got dignity and you do that every weekend.
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.380]   You sometimes you have to fly.
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.220]   Right?
[00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.780]   We were in Chicago this week doing it.
[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.580]   Yeah, we had to dig me up out in Chicago.
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.540]   And yeah, that was fun.
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.380]   It was crazy.
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.740]   It's good to move around and go to different cities
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.500]   and have people come out and meet the community
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.820]   and get the feedback.
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.140]   I wish we could do that.
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.940]   Sounds like a little mama.
[00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.420]   Yeah, did you have 200,000 people
[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.820]   in the start of the victory column in Chicago?
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.020]   Not quite that many.
[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.780]   But you get a lot when you were in London, it was 1,000, right?
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:31.780]   Yeah, it was like 1,500 or so.
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:32.660]   It was pretty crazy.
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.020]   Amazing.
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.860]   That's really cool.
[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.900]   No, you know what, Kevin, we all,
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.220]   you know, we all Josh, she a lot,
[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.540]   but we're really, well, I'll speak for myself.
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.100]   I'm really thrilled at your success.
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.460]   I think it's really great.
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.580]   Yeah, we totally hate Kevin for his success.
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.180]   Well, I hate him when he's not here.
[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.700]   (laughing)
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.540]   When he's not here, I hate him.
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.700]   I hate his guy.
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.020]   But when he's here, I can't help it.
[00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.220]   He's so cute and he loves the tea.
[00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.060]   Well, thank you, Leo.
[00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.180]   No, I'm really, and I'll be honest with you,
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.300]   every time Mike Arrington makes up this rumor
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.140]   that you're gonna get bought by Google,
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.300]   I'm going, yeah, because then Kevin's gonna be worth like,
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.380]   you know, what with the last room.
[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.220]   Yeah, I'll be buying.
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.380]   You'll be able to back it up a minute
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.780]   and tell the listeners out there
[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.420]   what's going on with this rumor.
[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.660]   All right, so this rumor has surfaced.
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.660]   Mike Arrington has published the same rumor,
[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.740]   at least to my knowledge, three times over the last six months.
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.860]   And it has not once come true,
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.740]   the rumor that Google was gonna buy Dig.
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:26.740]   And at one point, they said,
[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.580]   "A Marissa Meyer said, 'Now we don't want it,
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.460]   then she did the latest one.'"
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.060]   And I'm starting to, I'll be honest with you,
[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.740]   I think it's hurting Mike's credibility,
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.940]   but the fact that he keeps bringing it up,
[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.660]   he must know that it hurts his credibility
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:38.820]   when the thing doesn't happen there.
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.380]   He must have a source somewhere
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.180]   who is so credible that Mike has to publish this.
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.580]   Otherwise, it's just a dumb thing for him to do.
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.860]   So the latest one, and by the way, Kevin,
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:51.980]   you could just go silent.
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.660]   You don't have to say anything.
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.460]   I know that if you don't have to confirm it,
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.300]   you don't have to deny it.
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.460]   I don't want you to feel uncomfortable,
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.620]   but it is, it would have been that
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.260]   whether you were here or not, it's a big story.
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.420]   The rumor was that Google was doing due diligence
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.180]   on a possible $200 million acquisition of Dig.
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.540]   Mike publishes this, it's the same rumor.
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.260]   This time though, instead of just letting it drop,
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.340]   he actually comes back and says,
[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.060]   "No, they changed their mind."
[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:17.980]   Which as far as I'm concerned,
[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.820]   he could be making up to protect himself, who knows?
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.980]   But it didn't happen.
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.420]   So I guess, Kevin, here's the point where I would say to you,
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:27.740]   you want to confirm or deny,
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.900]   you want to say anything about it?
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.260]   - Well, I mean, about, I don't know, a year ago or so,
[00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.100]   we decided to, as a company,
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.500]   just like when any of this stuff comes up,
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.500]   just to never comment on anything.
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:43.100]   - Jay denied it once, like vigorously denied it.
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.580]   - He did, he was really pissed when that came out,
[00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.420]   and we did a blog post about it.
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.340]   But, you know, it's funny,
[00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.100]   'cause these rumors can come about in so many different ways.
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.020]   It's, I remember one time I was on the Yahoo campus,
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.140]   and I was just there, we were doing some biz dev kind of work
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.940]   and forming a partnership with them,
[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.540]   and someone sees me on the campus,
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.020]   and all of a sudden, they have an ear with whoever
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.380]   the tech news publisher is,
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.820]   and then all of a sudden, there's a rumor
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:08.900]   that we're gonna sell the company.
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:13.820]   So, you know, we have, I'm friends with Marissa
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:14.780]   and everyone over at Google,
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:15.780]   I think they're a great group,
[00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.900]   and we're always working on stuff together, so.
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.220]   - Is Allen and company shopping you around?
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:22.220]   - No, they are not.
[00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.540]   - Okay, there you go, that's all I wanna hear, that's great.
[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.540]   That's it.
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.020]   And I, and be honest with you,
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.820]   I've even said on the show, this is Mike again,
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.660]   this is the same rumor, I don't know if I buy it,
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.780]   I keep hearing this rumor, nothing ever happens.
[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.460]   But-- - But, I mean, I would say that,
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.380]   you know, we've worked with Allen and company in the past,
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.380]   we're friends with them as well,
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.940]   and so it's like, I see how all this stuff comes together.
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.340]   You know, it's not crazy that people would speculate.
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.780]   - Right. - But, yeah,
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.700]   we're just happy continuing to work on Dig,
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.580]   when we had our biggest-- - Oh, come on, no.
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.460]   - I don't know, honestly. - Wouldn't it be fun
[00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.700]   if somebody wrote you a big check,
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.180]   and you could just, what would, I mean,
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.260]   you would get, what, 50 or 60 million dollars,
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.900]   I'm guessing, I don't know what your percentage
[00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.540]   still left is, but you could just walk away,
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.580]   what would you do, what would you,
[00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.180]   if somebody gave you 50 million,
[00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.260]   what would you do, Kevin, with the rest of your life?
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.140]   - I honestly don't think that,
[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:14.580]   that I'm at the place where I wanna be yet,
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.060]   until, you know, we have so much more building to do,
[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.020]   I don't think now's the time to just,
[00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.860]   the only time we've entertained any type of acquisition
[00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:26.940]   type stuff in the past has been if, like,
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.540]   the two companies combined are gonna create
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.780]   something even bigger, and, you know,
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.100]   I'm happy working at Dig, like, I don't,
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.580]   when people say, like, oh, you'd have, you know,
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.340]   20, 30, however many million dollars,
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:39.580]   what would you do with it?
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.220]   I think I'd be doing the same thing I am today,
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:43.660]   and that's continuing to work on the product,
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:45.380]   like, I'm not gonna retire, I'm too young,
[00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.500]   I enjoy working too much.
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.100]   - You like what you're, you enjoy Dig,
[00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:49.980]   and you like what you're doing.
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:51.460]   - It doesn't feel like work, you know,
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.340]   like, I can put the honest everything.
[00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.180]   - I know the amazing thing.
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.860]   - You know exactly, yeah, exactly,
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.580]   like, we're all doing what we love,
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:59.100]   and when that's the case, it is crazy as it may sound,
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.780]   like, you wanna get up in the morning,
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.580]   and you're excited to go into the office.
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.140]   - I'm basically doing this for free,
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.220]   because seven days a week.
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.380]   The only thing I get paid to do is the radio show,
[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.180]   the rest of it I'm doing, 'cause I love it.
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.020]   - Exactly.
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:11.860]   - I mean, I hope to be.
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:12.860]   - So when you wake, well, let's stop a second,
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.220]   now I'm gonna get this quote straight,
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.100]   and when you wake up in the morning, you're excited, what?
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.500]   - Just going to the office.
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.740]   (laughing)
[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:22.420]   Interesting.
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.700]   - You don't buy that, John?
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.940]   You're John's office is three feet away.
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.380]   - My office is not too far away from where I live,
[00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:31.540]   so it's easy for me as well.
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:32.900]   - I know, 'cause I just watch you on Twitter,
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:33.740]   and you say I'm hoping--
[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.540]   - I'm excited to go into the office.
[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.380]   I mean, I hear this all the time from guys like,
[00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:38.420]   well, Kevin, not so much,
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.860]   but you hear from Michael Dell and the Gates,
[00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.060]   who are excited to go into the office.
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.460]   Well, you know, when my office is like two doors down
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.700]   from my bedroom, even then I'm not excited.
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.380]   I mean, I might be happy that I don't have to go any further,
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.420]   or I can look out at the freeway and see people,
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.740]   oh my God, these poor guys are sitting there for hours
[00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.860]   on end to get in the San Francisco or whatever,
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.700]   but I'm not excited necessarily.
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.500]   I'd rather have some breakfast.
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.340]   (laughing)
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.220]   - Now that I could get excited about.
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.820]   I will say this, and I think this is more because,
[00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.700]   and I bet you, Patrick, you would,
[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.180]   well, maybe you wouldn't, Patrick.
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:16.340]   I know Kevin would, but maybe 'cause I'm more of a performer,
[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.780]   I miss not being on the air, so I do get excited
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.420]   about coming in here, turning on the cameras,
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.460]   and performing, that's really fun.
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.500]   So, but that's a little different.
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.700]   - But I mean, it's also there's a, you know,
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.220]   do you miss being on the air,
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.300]   do you miss being on the air five days a week
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.820]   doing live television with a full studio crew?
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:36.660]   You know?
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:37.500]   - I don't miss that.
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.500]   That's why I really enjoy what I'm doing right now
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.540]   because I am the full studio crew.
[00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:43.380]   - Right.
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:44.540]   - And I'm sure you don't miss that old commute,
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.380]   you used to have to take down the tech TV.
[00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:47.420]   - But you know, I do miss.
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:51.340]   Did any of you go to the anniversary party at CNET
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.940]   on Thursday?
[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:53.860]   - It was my--
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.980]   - You know, I wasn't even invited by the way,
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.060]   despite the fact that was--
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.380]   - Everybody was invited.
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.280]   No, no, no, you were invited,
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.960]   you just not on that Parello's tech TV mailing list.
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:02.800]   You gotta get on that list.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.680]   - I was not invited.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.520]   - You were invited, I, in fact,
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.880]   I almost forwarded it to you knowing
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.480]   that you would say that.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.800]   Everybody wasn't invited.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.880]   - You did, you didn't forward it.
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.520]   - It wasn't free, you have to pay 30 bucks.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.520]   Why didn't forward it?
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.800]   - Oh my God, what are they trying to kid us?
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.040]   - It was 15-- - CNET's got no money,
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.040]   they're owned by CBS.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.640]   Why are we paying 30 bucks?
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.200]   - All right, first of all, first of all,
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.480]   Gillespie put it together
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.440]   'cause he wanted to get a bunch of people together.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.000]   It was $15 to cover the drinks.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.360]   And why should CNET or CBS pay for, you know--
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.400]   - But Gillespie could.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.760]   - I would have.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.080]   - Gillespie's loaded.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.760]   - I was gonna-- - I'll tell you what, Leo.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.160]   - I was gonna, I was gonna, two years ago,
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.720]   I was gonna, and we just, it fell through,
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.880]   well, we're just gonna foot the bill at,
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.080]   'cause it was like a $5,000 advance.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.640]   I was gonna use Twitch money to foot the bill,
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.320]   but then it kind of fell through.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.360]   - Hey, I do parties all the time,
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.600]   and I've done them for years.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.760]   I don't do as many as I used to,
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.360]   but I have never required anybody,
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.080]   and I never will, to put up money.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.880]   - Oh, but you had like your high school job.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.640]   - Hey, you got five bucks for gas?
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:03.480]   - You had sponsors.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.640]   - It's lame.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.360]   - Oh, who cares?
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.920]   It was a bunch of people getting together.
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.880]   - So you went, did you go back?
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.120]   - No, it was my wedding anniversary.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:12.960]   No way.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:13.800]   - Hell, I was coming to the wedding.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.640]   - You know why I didn't go?
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.600]   'Cause revision three was having a party,
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.800]   so nobody from revision three was gonna go.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.360]   And those are the, I really wanted to see you guys.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.800]   Of course, we see, I talked to you all the time,
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.160]   so I guess it's not really, that's silly.
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.400]   But then I watched David Sparks' video, right,
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.080]   on his blog, and I was sad.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.400]   'Cause there was Alison Tom and Dan Kerman,
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.840]   and just all these people, and I was made me sad,
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.000]   'cause I wish I'd gone.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.800]   You guys have no nostalgia whatsoever, do you?
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.680]   - I actually do Chicago that day,
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.240]   so I haven't even had a choice.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.840]   - Yeah, I have nostalgia, but I do not,
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.920]   and I don't care what Patrick says,
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:52.640]   I do not appreciate being charged money
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.240]   to go to a party, and it's the principle of the thing,
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.200]   Patrick, not that I can't afford the $15, yeah.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.520]   I can give you the $15, it's the principle of the thing.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.520]   - Saying I'm unprincipled, John.
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.720]   - Yes, he's saying Joe Gillespie is our principal.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.240]   - If anybody should be pissed, it should be Patrick,
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.840]   'cause he's the one that doesn't drink.
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.680]   - Yeah, I know.
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.120]   - So you just pay 15 bucks to pay 15 bucks.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.320]   - For black coffee, that's a lot for black coffee.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.320]   You have to drink a couple of gallons.
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.480]   - We're not gonna be charged for the drinks,
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.320]   that's normal, right?
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.560]   You walk into a party, you pay five bucks for a beer.
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.760]   - Well, that's what we would have done.
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:21.600]   That's what we would have done.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.840]   I would have put up whatever the 5,000 minimum,
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.880]   and then the bar would not be open,
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.640]   and then if the bar didn't make back its five grand,
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.800]   then they keep whatever the difference is.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.480]   That's what I was gonna do.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.440]   Anyway, who cares, it doesn't matter.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.480]   - It's beside the point, the point is why people are like,
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.400]   "I just encharge people that come to it."
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.560]   - All right.
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.640]   We were talking though about nostalgia missing.
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.760]   Well, actually, we were talking about loving our work,
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:45.800]   and I think that that's one thing
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.840]   about doing live television, kind of,
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:48.680]   that's the thing you look.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.400]   But I can see, Kevin, that you would say,
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.600]   "Look, you in a way, you are performing,
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:57.880]   you've got 27 million uniques a month at gotodig.com.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.080]   You have an audience, you're creating something
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.200]   that a vast number of people use,
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.080]   that probably has somewhat similar kind of buzz to it.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.160]   - Well, he also does a weekly video show.
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.880]   - Yeah, but you're saying you like to go in the office, right, Kevin?
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.000]   - Yeah, I mean, I think that when people look at dig,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.280]   it's not just because of the stories
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.240]   or the digging or all that stuff,
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.040]   it's kind of the stuff that we're doing in R&D
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.200]   that gets me so pumped.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.040]   - Right.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.160]   - You know, when we rolled out that story,
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:24.240]   we would suggest feature the recommendation engine last month.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.840]   You know, digs were up 40%.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.560]   We had friends adding activity
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.720]   and go up like 20X or something like that.
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.280]   And it's just that kind of thing
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.960]   where we're connecting people to each other,
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:34.880]   they have similar interests.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.080]   Like that gets me really excited about the future of news
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:37.920]   and kind of what we're building
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.000]   and what we're eventually providing to other sites.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.240]   So, you know, that's what gets me pumped.
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.840]   - I get excited by the idea.
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.880]   You know, this streaming video that we're doing now,
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.080]   live streaming video.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.360]   - Oh, I love it.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.200]   - It's fascinating, isn't it?
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.560]   - I love the stick 'em stuff that you guys are doing.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.000]   - I think that the, I wonder,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.480]   why isn't CNN doing this?
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.680]   Why isn't MSNBC?
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.080]   And then I realized it was the same deal with tech TV.
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.200]   They have contracts with the cable companies
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.960]   that keep them from doing it.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:04.960]   So now I'm wondering,
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.200]   where is the Ted Turner of the 21st century?
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.040]   Maybe it's you, Kevin, who comes along and says,
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.800]   "Why aren't we doing a 24-hour news channel on the internet?"
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.240]   - Well, you also gotta be careful, Leo,
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.120]   that you're not trading.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.040]   And this is one of my favorite phrases
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.320]   from somebody at one of the big networks,
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:25.040]   is trading analog dollars for digital sense.
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.360]   You know, and in terms of,
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:27.400]   you gotta remember something,
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.720]   they're not looking to recreate the television experience.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.880]   They're looking to generate advertisements.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:38.120]   - And new revenue, not steel revenue from the old medium.
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:38.960]   Yeah.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.000]   - And let's make a note of what Patrick said,
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.680]   which is dollars for sense, because that's the ratio.
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.680]   - Yeah.
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.720]   - On the other hand, the costs are so low,
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.800]   for what I do, it's the cost of virtually nil.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.560]   - Well, they're being eaten by like stick AM
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.960]   and other companies are paying these extremely crazy bandwidth
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:56.880]   bills for you, right?
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.720]   - Yeah.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.720]   - Shh.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.200]   (laughing)
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.040]   - I don't know how long that's coming from.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.560]   - 'Cause to do it yourself costs a lot of money.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:07.040]   - Oh yeah, I did the math on the 24 hours of iPhone.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.760]   And we were, you know, even right now,
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.400]   when we have, I don't know what it is,
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:15.120]   2,600 people watching, it's more than a gigabit per second.
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:15.960]   - Right.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.240]   - I couldn't afford a gigabit stream.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:20.520]   And sometimes it could spikes up to five or six gigabits.
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.600]   - Right, exactly.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.320]   - I don't know how much that would cost, but.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.560]   - The raw line either, it's about the fact
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.960]   that you have to have a cluster of servers.
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.040]   That's gonna be able to spread this out
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.840]   and handle that load and those spikes.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.840]   And you know, that hardware is extremely expensive.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.480]   The financial term that you're looking for Leo is a lot.
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.920]   (laughing)
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.360]   - Well, so am I just skating on somebody else's charity?
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.280]   - Of course.
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.920]   Yeah, but the cool thing is we can jump around.
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.000]   Like when we'll go out of business
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:46.840]   'cause they'll run out of money
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.560]   and then you jump to the next free field provider.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.440]   They're all over the place.
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.760]   But by the way, you know, the thing is called
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.560]   Most Favorite Nations, which is the thing
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.600]   that restricts certain companies
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:56.840]   from streaming on the internet
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.920]   while at the same time selling to cable.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:18:59.760]   - Right.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.520]   - And it's really, I thought at the time
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.200]   that the tech TV was in business,
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.320]   they probably could have made a business out of it
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.080]   if they could have done a deal of some sort,
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.800]   although it was apparently impossible.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.480]   - Well, we were desperate to get on cable
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.560]   and we couldn't make that,
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.520]   we didn't have the strength to make that kind of deal.
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:17.880]   But I always said from day one,
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.640]   why are we building a brick and mortar business
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.760]   in the internet era?
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.880]   - Because that's where the money was.
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.320]   - Yeah, the money for the cable companies.
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.680]   How many hundreds of millions of dollars
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.640]   do we pump it in the pockets of Comcast and the like?
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.280]   - Yeah, and how much audiences you really have.
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.360]   I mean, you have an audience now,
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.960]   just on this show alone, that is probably 10X,
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.960]   what you had on screen savers.
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.200]   - Well, I don't know about that.
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.520]   - I'm telling you, I looked at those numbers
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.920]   when they came through and if you have a half a million
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.320]   right now, you're 10X, what you were getting there.
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:53.760]   - We do, last month, 3.6 million views.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.040]   So I think we're getting close
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.000]   and the main point is that tech TV was spending,
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.680]   what however many tens of millions a year to do it.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.200]   - Well, yeah, the staff just support just one show.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.040]   How many people?
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.120]   - Yeah, well, I counted once,
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.200]   it was like 22 people do the screen savers
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.640]   behind the camera and I have zero people behind the camera
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.480]   to do this.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.320]   - You got two girls.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.720]   - I was also looking back there, give them credit.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.960]   - I do, I have Dane, Colleen and Tony.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:20.800]   - Yeah.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:21.880]   - I mean, that number, 22 people,
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.760]   that number went down a lot.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.080]   - Well, hair and wardrobe alone,
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.080]   I had four people doing my hair.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.720]   - And well, they should.
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.640]   - That's all that was gone.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:35.360]   - Speaking of hair, I got a message for you, Kevin Rose.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.440]   (audience laughing)
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.360]   - All right, everybody, it's Gary Vaynerchuk
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:42.000]   from Wine Library TV and it's really interesting
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.800]   is that they shave my head, right?
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.320]   And I think when you do something with that,
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.560]   you need to be some worthy cause behind it.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.600]   So I'm starting the Shavier Head for Charity Challenge.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.880]   Here's how it works.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:56.920]   I am going to give $200 to my favorite charity.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.720]   If the person I call out right now,
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.480]   shaves their head and then they will do the same thing.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.480]   You've got to give at least 100 to charity.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.040]   That's the rule, I'm gonna give $200.
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.440]   I'm gonna give $300.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.280]   Ready?
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.400]   So, the person that I'm gonna call out right now,
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.960]   I'm gonna post this video,
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.200]   or anybody who sees this as a seventh pepper,
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.520]   some pressure of that person,
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.000]   and then they've got a shaver head,
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.800]   the name give charity to give a charity,
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.440]   some money when they call somebody out
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.720]   and we go on forever.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.960]   So this space can do something positive.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.440]   So the person that I'm gonna call out,
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.720]   Kevin Rose, shave your head.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.520]   - Oh, he's sitting right there.
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.200]   I like my hair.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.960]   - Oh, you're sitting right there.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:41.280]   So, I guess you already heard that.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.320]   - I did, and I don't know what to do.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:46.560]   I'm thinking about it, but if I know what to do,
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.080]   I wanna call Leo out.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.680]   I wanna call Leo out if I'm gonna do it.
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.760]   - Oh, I have to shave my hair.
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:51.600]   I can't shave my hair.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.320]   - Oh, now do it, Kevin, do it.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.280]   - I agree to do it, Leo, I'll do it.
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.200]   - I'll do it if the Vorac does it.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.720]   - No, you've got a loser there
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.760]   because I figured this is the last head of hair
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.600]   I have before I'm too old and bald, forget it.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.000]   - Yeah, I'm with the Vorac on that one.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.560]   - I shared that there's children dying.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.360]   - What, you didn't even say what charity?
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.360]   - I'll send them a check.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.440]   - What charity?
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.360]   What charity?
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.400]   You didn't even say.
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.240]   - It's just insane.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:20.280]   - The guy's a promotion artist.
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.840]   Let's face reality here.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.120]   Let's face a couple of realities.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:28.120]   One inch by one inch button on the Twit homepage
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:34.840]   or a small little bitty dinky ad on the dig home page
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.680]   would generate probably, you know,
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:37.520]   - Tens of thousands.
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.680]   - Hundreds of thousands of dollars for a charity
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:44.680]   and some is gonna shave their head for a $200 call out
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.120]   by some unknown guy who we don't even know
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.400]   is gonna give them money and who cares?
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.840]   It's only a cup of under a bunch.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:50.680]   - That's too much.
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.400]   - You guys can generate hundreds of thousands.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.680]   - That's Gary Vaynerchuk.
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:55.520]   - Gary Vaynerchuk.
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.840]   - I really will know.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.960]   (laughing)
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.160]   - Well, I'm just saying like, okay,
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.600]   let's say we get a bunch of founders
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.240]   and a bunch of tech celebrities to do this.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.600]   - This could generate some decent price.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.200]   - I'll shave my Vaynerchuk.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.800]   - That's over share.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.120]   If you shave your Vaynerchuk.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.280]   - And send the hair to China to be made into wigs, I'm in.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.120]   - That's not that much hair.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.880]   - I'm sorry, I missed all that.
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:21.720]   - How would you know?
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.720]   - Can somebody run that back again?
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.440]   - Sorry, I am so sorry.
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.080]   Edit this out, please.
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.720]   Okay, so we're gonna move on now.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.720]   It was the brain tonic talking.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.560]   - It's a card.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.280]   - Oh man.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.120]   Anyway, it's an interesting idea,
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.640]   but let's face it, Kevin, 200 bucks, 300 bucks.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.480]   That's not enough.
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.360]   It should be thousands.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.800]   - We'll see, I'm gonna think about it.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:44.640]   - Are you gonna do it?
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.640]   You're gonna think about it?
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.760]   - I mean, it's nice to have a change
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:49.760]   ever once in a while.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.440]   - You know, you're young guys.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.120]   I'm with Devorak.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.000]   I may never see this hair again.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.240]   I totally see shaving it off and it doesn't grow back.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.320]   (laughing)
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.160]   - Would that be awful?
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.840]   - What an attitude.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.320]   - My son, my 13 year old son,
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.160]   'cause he, when you're young,
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.680]   he had a big bush head of hair.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.160]   He and his friends got into the Clippers one day.
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.680]   He was at a friends house.
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.960]   Mom wasn't home.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.600]   And instead of shaving their heads totally,
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.280]   they shaved bald spots.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.760]   They made themselves look like 50 year old men
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.400]   with like padmail pattern baldness
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.000]   and then went downtown walking around.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.920]   - It was the creepiest thing I ever saw.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.400]   - Let's go with these kids today.
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.480]   - It was creepy.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.720]   So I'll do that.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.400]   - I'm doing drugs and stealing movies off the internet.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.920]   - Yeah.
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.360]   - All right, let's get to some news stories.
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.200]   Although this is fun.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.040]   I have to say, see, this is what people were asking for.
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.840]   They were asking for the camaraderie of Days Gun Buy.
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:44.160]   I have to say, Kevin, though, I was really,
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.920]   you may not have been fantasizing about all that money,
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.160]   but I was fantasizing on your behalf.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.000]   - Well, thank you.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:52.840]   - I really was.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.680]   I was thinking, God, wouldn't you know, just think.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.280]   He could buy a yacht.
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.600]   - 50 million in the bank,
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.200]   he could buy a house in San Francisco.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.880]   - A house in San Francisco with two bedrooms and a kitchen.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.920]   - I don't know.
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:05.760]   - I'm mad.
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.080]   - It's a fun thing to fantasize about.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.960]   If you don't, do you get any money?
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:13.200]   I mean, do you have to sell the company to make the big bucks
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.320]   or can you get a draw out of the thing?
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.280]   I mean, it's not like you're poor, right?
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.640]   The last time we talked, you couldn't afford a couch.
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.120]   - He's poor.
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.600]   - You couldn't afford a couch the last time we talked.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.440]   - I'm doing all right.
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:25.280]   I'm doing fine.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.040]   I mean, I take a standard salary from the company
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.960]   and I'm doing great.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:29.920]   What's the standard salary?
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.560]   Let's tell us.
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.000]   - You tell me how much you make and yeah.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:34.840]   - Yeah, yeah, okay.
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:35.680]   Well, let me bring up,
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.800]   do you know what Sarah Lacey said about you?
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.720]   - Oh God, let's not start with her.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.040]   What'd she say?
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.160]   (laughing)
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.000]   - I just threw it out.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.360]   - I have no idea what she said.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.240]   - Oh, she said, she believes,
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.960]   and you can get by the way, jump on her about this,
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.520]   but she did say it, she said it publicly.
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.760]   She believes that you, Kevin Rose,
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.840]   will cash out in some huge amount of money,
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:02.120]   be a rich kid and end up like MC Hammer.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.120]   - Oh, that's such BS.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.240]   - No, no, she did say that it's not BS.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.080]   - Oh, and she said that's not,
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.160]   it's true that she said that, what she said was BS.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.560]   Do you think Patrick, he's not gonna become an MC Hammer?
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.200]   Kevin's a smart guy.
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.000]   - I mean, I don't face any of my money pretty much.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.720]   - Do you have an entourage?
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.560]   - No.
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:22.640]   - Do you have to be a dance?
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.160]   - Do you have no credit card debt?
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.080]   I don't, you know.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.680]   - Do you have blue pants?
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.280]   - I do have a pair of blue pants for a special day.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.400]   - Yeah, I mean, you finally bought a car, you know,
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.240]   what, like a year after.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.440]   - He's not extravagant, but more than that,
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.080]   Kevin's really smart.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.240]   - I want a log cabin in Oregon, you know, 20 years from now.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.080]   That's what I want.
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.120]   - We'd be island, go up to a, we'd be,
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.040]   or maybe Fort Angeles. - That's not an Oregon.
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.880]   - No, I know, maybe up where you are, Fort Angeles.
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.720]   I like we'd be island.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.480]   - Yeah, if he wants a log cabin, I know what he's after.
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.480]   - He's cut some wood.
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.840]   - No, he's talking one of those Lindel Cedar homes.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.080]   Actually, no, there's, you know,
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.400]   the fine things I looked into those kinds of homes,
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.000]   and there's like about 50 companies that make those things,
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.120]   and Lindel is not one of the best.
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.000]   They're one of the good ones,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.600]   but they're not, there are really some amazing
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.360]   log homes out there. - There's high-end stuff.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.960]   - There's some real high-end stuff.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.800]   - So, Kevin, you drove a Tesla, surely that got your mouth
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.400]   watering.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.680]   - Teslas are fun.
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.000]   They're definitely fun cars.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.240]   Yeah, I mean, zero to 60 in like 3.9 seconds, let's say.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.680]   There's a picture on Dane Golden, the president of Twit,
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.600]   has a website, hey.com.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.920]   By the way, that's his retirement plan.
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:34.720]   He owns hey.com, and he's holding out
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.960]   for millions and millions of dollars.
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.960]   But anyway, if you go to hey.com,
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.000]   he's got a picture of the first Tesla crash in San Francisco.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.200]   - I saw that.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.280]   - Oh man, that's gotta hurt.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.400]   - Did the thing just blow up in a million pieces?
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.360]   - No, no, no.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.640]   It's actually, it's a, you know what?
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.120]   It was a good advertisement for Tesla.
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.800]   The guy plowed into the back of a Mercedes.
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:56.480]   And he lifted the Mercedes,
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:57.960]   the Mercedes has lifted up in the air
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.480]   onto the hood of the Tesla.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.120]   And the Tesla looks pretty good.
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.400]   - It's hey.com.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.680]   I get a service temporarily unavailable.
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:09.160]   - We crashed your server again, Dane, sorry.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:12.040]   - We crashed pretty, this is pretty normal when you,
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.800]   when you get, you know, people who maybe have never driven
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.040]   anything remotely with this kind of horsepower to be.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.520]   - Oh, I think so.
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:20.720]   - 'Cause if it goes to zero to 60, 3.9 seconds,
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.160]   so the guy reruns the guy,
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.080]   'cause he says all the speed up a little bit,
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.000]   taps the accelerator.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   (grunts)
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.400]   It's like a rocket.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:28.400]   - Flies.
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.240]   - Absolutely.
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.920]   - It is first Tesla crash in San Francisco update.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:35.720]   - How was the crash coming to your head?
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:36.560]   - Yeah, he went underneath the guy,
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.440]   but I think that it didn't fall apart.
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:39.280]   I think it bodes well actually.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:40.360]   - If he had been going faster,
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.840]   that guy's rear bumper would have been right through his head.
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.520]   He would have been decapitated.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.360]   - Ooh.
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.520]   - I had a guy, I was parked up and I was back
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.000]   into a parking space in North Beach
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.840]   and this couple of kids in a Honda Civic
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.480]   were trash talking to a couple girls on the side
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.880]   of the street, you know, whistling
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:58.200]   and just trying to get him to join them for the evening.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:00.200]   And the guy was so not paying attention.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.840]   He actually drove his front end of his Civic
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.840]   underneath the back of my pickup truck.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:08.600]   Just to say, it happens a lot actually, especially
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.560]   in stop and go traffic and urban and stuff.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.800]   - Actually, they're telling me in the chat room
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.360]   and I'm looking a little closer to the picture.
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.200]   It does look like the Tesla was rear ended
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.360]   and then went into the back of them Mercedes.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.200]   - Ah.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.240]   - It's a pretty heavy. - There's no evidence
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.440]   of that, I don't see anybody.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.280]   - Look at them, look at them.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.840]   - There's not one dent in the back of that Tesla.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:24.720]   - Yeah, it looks kind of messed up.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.920]   - No, but the other car, yeah, you're right, looks like it.
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.080]   Well, actually it does look pretty good for the Tesla.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.600]   - Yeah, I think the Tesla did well and that was,
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.000]   that's not a light Mercedes, is it two set, two 30?
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.200]   See two 30?
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.680]   - It's the lightest one.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:38.280]   - Okay, it's not a, it's not a 500
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:40.480]   but it's lifted in the air.
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:44.720]   - Well, any wedge would lift the thing in the air.
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.360]   - So, come on, can you?
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:47.760]   - Are they told, are you gonna be on the list?
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:48.720]   - Tesla.
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.080]   - No, I'm not on the list.
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.560]   Jay is, don't get one.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.080]   But yeah, I'd.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.800]   - No, what I wanna get on the list for is the four door.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.320]   The sedan they're gonna build.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.680]   - It's a cliche.
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:02.440]   - What do you mean, cliche electric car is the future?
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:06.760]   Why do you say it's a cliche?
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.360]   - Oh, I know why.
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:11.160]   I know why 'cause Calicana strives one.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.160]   - No, he doesn't, he hasn't gotten his yet, has he?
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.120]   I don't even know for the fact that he's on the list.
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.360]   I think Calicana's is a big blow hard.
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:20.440]   We know that, but he is number 16 on the list.
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:22.240]   This is actually probably the four guys
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.800]   who hate Jason the most right on this show right now.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.280]   - Actually, I don't, I'd like Jason.
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.120]   - We love him.
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.320]   - I'm just teasing.
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.920]   - No, I mean, Calicana's just like everybody
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.440]   went to college with, you know?
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.440]   - He's, yeah, he's a, what is it?
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.240]   He's almost like a Jersey kid, except he's not.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.240]   He's a Brooklyn kid.
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.320]   - Yeah, he's a Brooklyn kid.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.720]   - Mostly the guys I went to college with her from Brooklyn.
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.080]   - It's a Brooklyn kid.
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:45.880]   No, I think, Jason's, to me, Jason grows on you.
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.000]   Same with Gary.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:47.840]   Gary grows on you.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.040]   - Like that tumor.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:54.040]   - It's that, it's that, it's that brash East Coast thing.
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:55.160]   They're brash. - We're gonna talk
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.520]   about tech stories, right?
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.760]   - Well, that was kind of a story.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.400]   That was the Tesla story.
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.240]   - Okay.
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.800]   - That was kind of a tech story.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.160]   - Anyway, Dan Golden is a senior producer at Twit.
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.160]   - Yeah, he's the president of Twit.
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.040]   - That's Dan, the guy who I've seen him.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.240]   - Yeah.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.600]   - Oh, he's the one who owns Hay.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.880]   - Yeah.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:13.720]   - I don't know.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.400]   - You think he, you know, that's his retirement account.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.760]   Don't give him a 401K.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.040]   So let's talk about Steve Jobs,
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.560]   'cause we did quite a bit on Steve Jobs
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.880]   and the Whipple procedure that he received.
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.800]   And now the New York Times has finally said,
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.920]   told the truth, John Markoff and Jonah Sarah
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.560]   and The Times writing the story that, you know,
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.800]   that's why Apple stock tanked last week
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:36.280]   despite having the best quarter it's ever had.
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:40.000]   And then Jobs calls No Sarah.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.680]   You know, it's kind of funny,
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.480]   'cause Joe, I would have led with that
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.920]   at the top of the story, but Joe buries at the bottom.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.640]   Thursday afternoon after I've gotten my final Steve's
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:52.640]   health is a private matter from Apple PR
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:53.800]   and much to my amazement,
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.120]   I'm reading from Joe's article in The Times,
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:58.120]   Mr. Jobs, that's how you know it's The Times,
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.420]   they call him Mr. Jobs, called me.
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.440]   This is Steve Jobs, he began,
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.640]   "You think I'm an arrogant bleep
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.280]   who thinks he's above the law
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.200]   and I think you're a slime bucket
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.000]   who gets most of his facts wrong."
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.160]   Steve Jobs talking.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.640]   That sounds like,
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:16.480]   "Can you be..."
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.160]   What a great way to start a conversation with a reporter.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.920]   You're a slime bucket who gets most of his facts wrong.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.920]   Then he offers to tell him the story,
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.040]   but only off the record.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:29.440]   - So he told him the story off the record?
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.120]   - He did, he said, after that, he was...
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:31.960]   - Did they tell you anything?
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.520]   'Cause I know the story, by the way.
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.680]   - Well, good, I'm gonna ask you in a second,
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.360]   I'll tell you what, you do know the story,
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:39.640]   but you're not off the record, are you?
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.000]   You heard it from a friend who heard it from a friend.
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.720]   (paper rustling)
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.920]   - Go tell me everything you know
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:46.760]   and then I'll tell you the story.
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.720]   - All right, you could confirm or deny.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.840]   This is good, we're gonna call this show Confirm or Deny.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.160]   - Great, a name for a show we should do that show.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.000]   - Hey, that's great.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.680]   That could be the successor to the ill-fated triangulation.
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.920]   (laughing)
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:02.760]   After that...
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.320]   We're good at names, John.
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:06.920]   You and I come up with names, that's all.
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.680]   - We should just be a naming company.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.640]   - Because name shows, don't do 'em, or do one.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.000]   After that rather arresting opening,
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.840]   no Sarah goes on to write, he went on to say
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.240]   that he would give me some details
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:18.760]   about his recent health problems,
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:22.160]   but only if I would agree to keep them off the record.
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.840]   I tried to argue him out of it, but he wouldn't talk
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.440]   if I insisted on an on-the-record conversation,
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.120]   so I agreed, boy, that's a tough position
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.040]   to be in as a reporter.
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.280]   - I would never do it.
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:34.000]   - I would just, well, yeah, but he's gonna hang up.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.440]   - So?
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.040]   - It's a tough position, you wanna,
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.800]   wouldn't you wanna hear what happened?
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.200]   - Yeah, you would, you would.
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.240]   - It's a tough position.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.600]   But now, okay, so now no Sarah knows the story,
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.160]   but he's off the record.
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.920]   In fact, I'm surprised he could even say
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.560]   that that call happened.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.920]   - Exactly, I think that's a mistake.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.400]   - So here's what he goes on, he says more.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.400]   Because the conversation was off the record,
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.920]   I cannot disclose what Mr. Jobs told me,
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:04.480]   suffice it to say that I didn't hear anything
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.400]   that contradicted the reporting
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.520]   that John Markoff and I did this week.
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:09.680]   Among other things that reported
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:13.120]   that Jobs had had another procedure earlier this year,
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:16.680]   that the procedure was a success, there was no cancer.
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:18.040]   So that's confirmed apparently,
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.480]   while his health problems amounted to a good deal more
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.040]   than a quote, a common bug,
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.680]   that's what Apple said after WWDC.
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:27.760]   They aren't life threatening,
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.320]   and he doesn't have a recurrence of cancer.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.880]   After he hung up on the phone, it occurred to me
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.040]   that I had just been handed by Mr. Jobs himself
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:38.160]   the very information he was refusing to share
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:41.240]   with the shareholders who have entrusted him with their money.
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:45.840]   - So what was the point of that commentary?
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:47.560]   - Well, I think he's really what he's saying,
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.120]   and I think it was probably Steve's intent,
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.520]   is he doesn't have cancer.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:54.320]   'Cause that's why the market went down.
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.160]   By the way, after this article came out,
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:57.440]   the market started to research,
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.640]   the Apple stock price started to go back up.
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:03.320]   People really were worried that Jobs was off,
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.560]   you know, would be leaving the company.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.280]   - Now, Apple has said consistently,
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:11.680]   Jobs, health is not a matter of public record,
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.640]   and we're not gonna talk about it.
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.480]   Who's right?
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:19.520]   - I think in this case, Apple's right, and Jobs is right.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.320]   I don't think, in lessons interfering
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.880]   with his daily activities as CEO of the company,
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:26.040]   he shouldn't have to answer to anyone.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.520]   - So if you had erectile dysfunction.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:30.760]   (laughing)
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:31.600]   - No need to--
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:32.440]   - No need to--
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.280]   (laughing)
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.880]   - I'm not even gonna touch that one.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:35.720]   - No need to--
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.360]   - Well, tell us, Leo, what do you do?
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.720]   - No need to confirm or deny.
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.280]   - I'm 31, please.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.840]   Give me some wisdom in this area.
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.760]   (laughing)
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.880]   - No, I agree with you, Kevin,
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.080]   and you see, here you are,
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:52.480]   you're a major executive, a major tech firm.
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.520]   So you're kind of, you understand what's going on.
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.960]   It is private, but don't you think
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.680]   the shareholders have a right to know
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:02.680]   since it does have a material impact on Apple
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:06.160]   and how it's gonna do going forward if Jobs leaves?
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:10.480]   - Yeah, it's absolutely, but they have the right to know
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.120]   when it's interfering with his work.
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:13.600]   If he's starting to undergo chemo
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.800]   or he has to leave the office or he can't attend meetings,
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.160]   that's when the shareholders need to know that.
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.000]   - Yeah.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.600]   Yeah, I guess you're right.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.760]   Although in this case, they didn't tell
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.160]   the shareholders that Jobs had pancreatic cancer
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:29.360]   or was having surgery until the surgery was a success.
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.120]   That was several years ago.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.720]   I mean, Apple is not known for their forthcomingness.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:38.920]   Anyway, I'm glad, actually, you know,
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:42.200]   let's, I'll be really, stop being so flippier.
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.960]   I mean, I'm glad that Steve's feeling better.
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:49.320]   The procedure that he had, apparently,
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.520]   is not uncommon with people who've had a Whipple
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.240]   to address the malnutrition issues
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.800]   that do sometimes come up with a Whipple.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.440]   That's what I've been told by.
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.160]   - He has male absorption, technically.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.240]   - Right.
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.400]   So what did you hear, John?
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.360]   - Well, now that you brought all this up,
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.520]   I want to make a couple of comments.
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:08.240]   One, you know, you say, well, Apple's trying to,
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:12.520]   Apple is addressing this for the shareholders
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.600]   by saying that he hasn't got cancer.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:18.520]   Now, I would suggest that he probably doesn't have cancer
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:21.400]   or they wouldn't be making a public proclamation
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.880]   because they could really get themselves
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:26.560]   into a lot of trouble in so far as shareholder lawsuits
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:28.240]   are concerned, if in fact he did have cancer.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.840]   But the word is he doesn't have cancer.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:33.440]   But he does have this, you know, male absorption.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.640]   You know, it's just typical, you know,
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.680]   it's like an old woman who can't really digest a lot of food
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.040]   and he's forced to eat, you know,
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:41.120]   things he didn't like before
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.280]   'cause he's always been a vegan.
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.840]   I'm not going to go on the whole thing
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:45.880]   'cause I want to write this up for market watch.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:49.440]   But I have to get a confirmation on this one fact.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:51.000]   And I'll kind of beat around the bush about it,
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.840]   but you'll get the idea.
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:57.560]   There was a guy who is kind of an enemy of Steve's
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:01.160]   at the Allen and company meeting in Sun Valley
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.400]   or right away wherever it is that they have this,
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:06.560]   you know, yearly confab of all these hot shots
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:08.280]   who essentially is a drinking club.
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.120]   - Kevin was there.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.560]   - But they get to get, you know, the Allen company thing.
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.080]   - You're not allowed to say that you went though, right?
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.760]   Kevin, if you go, you can't say that you were there.
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:15.960]   - No, J went, I didn't go.
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:16.800]   - Oh, okay.
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:19.640]   - Okay, J went?
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:20.480]   - Yeah, of course you do.
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.600]   - I should talk to him.
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:22.440]   - Yeah.
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.280]   - Because I need one,
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.440]   if I can get one person to tell me this,
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.400]   then I, 'cause I already have the second confirmation.
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:29.120]   I just need the one.
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.440]   This one guy floating around the thing,
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.600]   everyone who would listen, he told,
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.400]   said that Steve has cancer
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.880]   and he's gonna drop dead any minute.
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.720]   - Oh dear.
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:38.960]   - And the fact of the matter is
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.120]   that's what triggered the stock run off.
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:41.960]   - Oh dear.
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.080]   - 'Cause all these guys are big shots.
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.200]   And so they all called home,
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.520]   "Hey, get out of Apple, Steve's dying."
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.600]   And so the thing apparently was because of a grudge
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:54.560]   by this one guy who was very famous
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:55.760]   and he doesn't like Steve.
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.360]   This is why I don't buy stocks.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:00.480]   - You gotta tell me when this story hits Mark and watch,
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:01.320]   I wanna dig this.
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.880]   Are you gonna name who the guy is?
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:03.720]   - Oh, absolutely,
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.880]   but I need one confirmation,
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.440]   'cause I already know who it is,
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.720]   but I already have the second confirmation
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:13.520]   who won't give it up unless I have a confirmation in front of it.
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.920]   It's a real weird journalistic thing,
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.000]   you gotta prove it.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.760]   I mean, I could just go out and do it.
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.080]   But to do it, 'cause at Mark and watch,
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:21.440]   we have a bunch of, you know,
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.720]   pretty, these guys are sticklers for these rules,
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.600]   and I'm not gonna just do something
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:29.200]   unless I have the second backup.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.760]   So I have the two confirmations and the guy's name comes out
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.200]   and I talk about the whole thing
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.720]   and how you have to be careful with stocks like this
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:37.000]   and Steve's fine.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:37.920]   - So Jay didn't hear anything
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.600]   'cause he definitely would have told me that if you'd--
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.000]   - Okay, well then Jay's not one of the guys,
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.240]   but I have a laundry list of people that went to that thing
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:46.040]   and I brought the contact one of them that'll tell me.
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:48.000]   - Well, we'll put the word out.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.080]   - Well, I think we just did.
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.320]   - Yeah, a lot of those people listen to this one.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.840]   - John@devoreck.org.
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.040]   Can they do it anonymously?
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.880]   - No, I need a name, I need somebody,
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.880]   no, but they're gonna be anonymous in the article.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:39:59.720]   - Right, but you--
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:01.720]   - I'm not gonna mention them, I don't care to mention them,
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:02.840]   it's not a big deal.
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.960]   I just need, 'cause I got the other guy,
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.920]   I just need one guy, and of course the guy,
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.960]   sure the number of people that went to the
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:12.520]   Allen and Company Cotton Fab that listened to Twit
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:13.920]   is like five.
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.280]   - That's all you know, and--
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:18.240]   - Well, maybe, maybe it's none.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:19.880]   Whatever the case is, I get the one thing,
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:22.000]   boom, it's done, I got the guy's name, it's out there,
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.360]   and then when you say, that's what caused the down,
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.840]   the down, that little slip.
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:27.680]   - Right.
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.520]   - But it didn't work.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:30.360]   - Well, that's--
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.200]   - But I thought it was sleazy.
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.040]   - It is.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.320]   - Do you guys own Apple stock?
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.160]   - No.
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:35.000]   - No.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.720]   - That's, that's a good case.
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:37.560]   - Patrick?
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:40.520]   - I don't know, 'cause I review products, I don't know.
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:43.520]   - Yeah, we're not, we kinda, can't do that.
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:45.280]   - You have to own, Neil, you guys, John,
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.400]   you guys must own some tech stocks, right?
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.280]   Well, actually right now, nothing.
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.200]   - I don't hold 'em directly, I may,
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:54.000]   and I have a 401K with mutual funds,
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.280]   but I don't even know what stocks those funds buy,
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.760]   and I don't hold 'em directly.
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:01.000]   - At the moment, I have zero tech stocks, period.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.560]   - When Warren Buffett and the guy that founded
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:05.760]   like Vanguard Fidelity basically says,
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:08.080]   everybody should be in index funds,
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:08.920]   that's good news for me.
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:10.000]   - Yeah, that's pretty much what I try to buy
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.240]   is index funds, exactly, yeah.
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:13.840]   Although, you know, Buffett said,
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.880]   don't buy Berkshire Hathaway, it's not gonna do very well.
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:19.800]   - Well, there's also a lot of interesting new derivatives.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.240]   Andrew Horowitz and I are pretty good friends,
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:23.920]   we talk about some of these things.
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.760]   And there's some wild ones out there,
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.880]   they've created all kinds of weird vehicles
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:29.680]   for people with 401Ks.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:31.720]   There's one in particular, there's an interesting game
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:34.640]   in particular that are like these kinds of,
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.800]   they're like, it trades like a mutual fund,
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.000]   it trades as a regular stock,
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.200]   but it's essentially a fund of shorts,
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.760]   because when you have a 401K
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.760]   and you wanna short the market, you can't do it.
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:46.600]   - Right, right.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.160]   - You cannot sell into your 401K,
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:53.160]   but you can buy long one of these crazy investment vehicles.
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:55.120]   - By long on a short.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:59.080]   - By long on a short, and it's like the wild, wild stuff.
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.200]   - I get really nervous about that stuff.
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:03.200]   It seems leveraged, it seems like a great way
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.040]   to lose a lot of money.
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:06.480]   - It's totally leveraged, especially these little devices
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.120]   called Altras, which are extremely leveraged.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.800]   But anyway, it's not a stock show,
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:12.960]   we'll talk about something else.
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:16.640]   - Free Software Foundation kind of going off the handle,
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.400]   Free Software Foundation was founded by Richard Stalman,
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:22.320]   who's never been known for his polytesce.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:27.880]   Defectivebydesign.org is calling for geeks
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:32.560]   to make an appointment at every Apple store in the country.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:35.200]   There are currently 217 Apple stores in seven countries
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:39.440]   they point out, they wanna book up every Apple genius
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:44.300]   and challenge them with a 10 minute iPhone challenge.
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:47.560]   Basically as a way to kind of underscore
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:50.120]   why they don't like the iPhone 'cause it ain't open.
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:52.600]   And this is, I have to say,
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:55.480]   this is the most childish thing I've ever heard of.
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:56.880]   - I've heard worse.
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:58.880]   - Here are the questions they want you to ask your genius.
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.680]   - The ball shaving your head is worse.
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.640]   (laughing)
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.080]   Don't hate on people that still have hair.
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:06.320]   - Hair haters.
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:09.440]   I think about shaving my head, Kevin, let's think about it.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.280]   - All right.
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:12.520]   - It's gotta be more money than that though.
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:13.920]   We gotta get Gary to stand up.
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:16.360]   You know, the thing is he already did it.
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:17.200]   - Right.
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.720]   - You know, it's easy for him to say.
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.760]   We should give him a challenge, something he hasn't done yet.
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:27.000]   You know where I'm going with this, don't you?
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:27.840]   - No.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:28.680]   (laughing)
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.520]   - I think, are you suggesting that he shave his nuts
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:32.360]   or something?
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:33.520]   (laughing)
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:35.320]   - I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:39.960]   Why do all developers have to submit their applications
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:42.280]   to Apple before they can be loaded on an iPhone?
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.120]   They wanna know.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.960]   Then the genius is supposed to answer.
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.680]   This poor genius.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:49.400]   And then they say, why does iTunes still contain
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.520]   so much DRM-laden music?
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:52.840]   Why, why, why?
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:56.320]   Then the iPhone 3G has GPS support,
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:59.040]   but how can users be sure that GPS cannot be used
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.600]   to track their position without their permission?
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.960]   - And on and on and on.
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:07.400]   I mean, it's just silly stuff.
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:08.480]   And what is the point?
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:09.320]   - Next.
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:12.240]   - Well, I, all right, I just wanted to call them out on that.
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.200]   Maybe they shave their hands.
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:15.760]   - Sure.
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:19.080]   - Or whatever part of their body they would choose to find.
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:21.320]   - So I might be able to shed a little bit of light
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:22.880]   on some of this stuff.
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:25.280]   I've heard that the reason why Apple is doing a lot of this
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:30.080]   is because for QA purposes and for something that I had to do
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.680]   with like bandwidth, they're making sure
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:34.760]   that certain applications don't eat up too much bandwidth
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:36.040]   through AT&T.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:37.720]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.680]   - I heard that, it's really interesting.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:42.160]   I talked to a guy that works at Apple
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:45.320]   that, shall remain unnamed, but he was telling me
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:48.760]   about the new fix that's coming out in the 2.1 software
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:50.320]   that's gonna fix somebody's crashing issues.
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:51.680]   - Oh, I can't wait.
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:56.680]   - And he mentioned that the actual firmware
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:00.680]   that's going in the phone has to be shipped to AT&T first
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:01.520]   for approval.
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:02.640]   - Oh, that makes sense.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:03.880]   - Which I thought was really interesting.
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:05.760]   They have to go through it and make sure, you know,
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:08.160]   it complies with everything they want done on their network.
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:09.520]   - Oh, that's very interesting.
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:11.080]   - Oh, no, no, it's weird.
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:13.680]   It's the old days of, remember the old of the phone company,
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:16.440]   you say you can't attach any equipment to our network
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:19.200]   unless we approve it, i.e. rent it to you?
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.600]   And then the Carter phone decision?
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:23.040]   - I mean, given the amount of,
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:26.720]   given the amount of, you know, the number of customers
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:30.240]   and the amount of digital traffic this is, you know, generating,
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.400]   I can see where they might be a little uptight about.
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:33.240]   - I'm loving it.
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.520]   I'd say I put, I put, I put four or five pages
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:37.320]   of applications and I have to say,
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:39.200]   I love the location based app.
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.640]   Kevin, you have a new iPhone.
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:42.480]   - No, not yet.
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:45.320]   - Oh, you upgraded it to two, oh, I'm sure.
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:50.000]   - I kind of, I have a version of the,
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.120]   - You have the pre-release version,
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:55.960]   which actually was probably a smart thing to do.
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:59.960]   I put the pre-release version on my iPod Touch.
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:00.800]   - Oh, you did?
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:01.640]   - Yeah, it worked fine.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:03.720]   Not the phone one, there was a touch version as well
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:04.960]   that leaked out.
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:05.800]   - Right.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:06.640]   - It worked fine, but I have to do phone.
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:10.400]   I have to say, I have all the same complaints I had
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:13.160]   about the old phone except that third party applications
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:15.320]   changes everything, these are amazing.
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:18.000]   Some of the games are fantastic.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.280]   - You use Shazam, right?
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:22.040]   - Yeah, I like Midori a little better,
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.280]   but we, you like Shazam, so these are the programs
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:25.880]   that you get to hold up to the radio
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.960]   and you want to know what the song is.
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.840]   - Or just anything, you could be music playing
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:31.560]   in a friend's house over iTunes,
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:32.880]   it doesn't have to be the radio, it's great.
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.920]   - Shadori, you could sing too.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:35.760]   - Oh, really?
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:36.600]   - Yeah.
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.440]   - All right, I'm gonna try that out.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.360]   - Did we do this on the show the other day?
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:40.640]   I can't remember if I, or was this on,
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:41.960]   I think it was on Mac Break Weekly here,
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:43.960]   I'll do it for you, or Madomia, not Midori,
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:46.240]   oh, I don't have Madomia on here anymore.
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:48.640]   Madomia was very cool, you would sing to it.
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:53.560]   And if you sing halfway, if you can carry a tune,
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:56.120]   it was amazing.
[00:46:56.120 --> 00:47:00.600]   - You try to ever know it, right?
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.400]   - Oh, I'm a never note fanatic.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.240]   - Okay.
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.080]   - Jot's cool too, you can record your notes
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:06.360]   and Jot will transcribe them,
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:10.240]   some poor woman in India has to write down everything I say.
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:11.600]   I say hi to her and stuff.
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:14.320]   I say, what are you wearing, you're wearing a saree right now?
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:17.400]   You know, I'm listening to my wife make a hairline
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.920]   reservation, and she says, where are you right now?
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:20.920]   And the woman says, India, she says,
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:23.680]   is it hot right now, and she has this long conversation.
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:25.640]   She says, are you wearing a saree?
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:28.560]   The woman says, no, no, we don't wear sarees, we're jeans.
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:30.080]   Finally, she says, well, you know my address,
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:31.560]   come visit us anytime.
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.600]   My wife invites the woman on the other end of the phone
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:38.200]   to travelocity in India to come visit us.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:41.800]   She said, well, she was very helpful.
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:44.160]   - She, what if she comes and visits?
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:45.000]   - Anyway, that's another.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.760]   - We'll see how helpful she is when she won't leave.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.080]   - Very helpful.
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.760]   - Maybe she, oh no, you said I could stay for as long
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:52.760]   as I wanted.
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:55.640]   - I love, I loved this in an outburger.
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:57.080]   Can I have another?
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:59.200]   - Oh my God, trash talk like,
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.400]   she, it's--
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:02.240]   - Why should be cheap?
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:04.000]   - I got a good reason for it 'cause I was--
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.040]   - You guys are never getting, okay, you got one,
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:07.520]   you guys should never get to export again.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:09.920]   Two, oh my God, that was obnoxious.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.120]   - No, I call up and I say hello.
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:13.400]   - Oh, are you?
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:14.920]   - No, I'm talking, let's talk--
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:16.920]   - Patrick's always been very--
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:17.760]   - Yeah, Patrick's always been very--
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:18.920]   - Patrick's off the deep pan,
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:20.480]   he's like a liberal nutball.
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:22.880]   - First of all, I'm not liberal.
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:23.920]   - He's not. - Second of all,
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:25.480]   nutball can actually be a compliment
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:26.680]   depending on the crowd you're at.
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:28.200]   (laughing)
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:29.720]   - Pandora, awesome.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:34.000]   AOL radio even is pretty awesome.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.880]   Do you use Pandora, Kevin on the iPhone?
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:37.160]   - I use Last FM.
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:39.040]   - Last FM, great, same idea, right?
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:42.800]   I was pleased 'cause I could put classical music in there.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:45.680]   I was looking for a classical composer,
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.240]   I actually put it in Pandora and all of a sudden,
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:49.040]   I get this great classical channel.
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:50.680]   I thought, oh, it must be pop music,
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:52.400]   but no, they do classical as well.
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:56.800]   - Okay, and do we getting paid for this commercial?
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.760]   - No, but I do have a commercial we could get paid for,
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:48:59.800]   would you like to?
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:00.880]   - Go for it.
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:02.680]   - You know, this show brought to you by
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:06.360]   those good folks at Visa with every purchase.
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:10.440]   Visa prevents detects and resolves online fraud.
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:12.960]   I recently had a little issue,
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:14.840]   I know you all know about it where I bought
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:18.440]   a video camera online didn't use my Visa card
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:20.680]   and I'm out 2,000 bucks.
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:21.920]   Wouldn't happen with Visa.
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.840]   When you go online to shop,
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:25.840]   you should be thinking about, you know,
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:30.000]   do I want the brown clippers
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.880]   or do I want the Norelco clippers?
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:36.080]   You shouldn't have to worry about fraud,
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:37.360]   about am I gonna get ripped off?
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:38.880]   And when you use your Visa card,
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.040]   you don't have to.
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:42.360]   All the purchases you make are safe and secure with Visa,
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:44.440]   they've got many ways to prevent, detect,
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:45.880]   and resolve online fraud,
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:50.000]   including very sophisticated business intelligence-based
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.880]   fraud monitoring, this stuff is amazing.
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.800]   We've talked about this, John.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:54.680]   You trigger it, what was it?
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:56.120]   You trigger it by going out by--
[00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:57.840]   - Yeah, they all have these algorithms
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:00.320]   and you can trigger a card stop
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:02.360]   by making a series of purchases
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:04.920]   that match some sort of a typical series
[00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:07.200]   that somebody who steal a card would make.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.720]   - So you buy two pair of Adidas
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:10.440]   and you fill up two tanks of gas simultaneously?
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:13.680]   - No, two tanks of gas and then you buy shoes.
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:15.480]   - And then it'll do it every time.
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:17.760]   Very sophisticated stuff that detects this stuff
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:19.440]   so that you don't get ripped offs
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:22.760]   and the best part is zero liability.
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:25.200]   You are not liable for unauthorized purchases, purchases.
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:27.480]   Somebody asked, is that true for a Visa debit card?
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:28.480]   - You bet.
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:32.000]   Peace of mind, safe, secure, Visa.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.400]   That's why I use my Visa and why you should use Visa too
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.400]   when you go shopping online.
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:39.840]   We thank Visa so much for their support of
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:41.480]   dis-veeek and tech.
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:45.120]   All right, moving on, another story, Scrabulous.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:47.720]   Kevin, you seem like the kind of guy
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:48.920]   who plays Scrabulous on Facebook.
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:50.760]   - I do indeed. - Love it.
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:51.600]   - Yeah, that's great.
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:53.440]   - I actually had to stop when I had like eight games
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:54.280]   going at once.
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:55.840]   What's the most games you've had at the same time?
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:57.240]   - Like four or five.
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:58.400]   It's fun, isn't it?
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:01.160]   - It is, especially the multiplayer games.
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.840]   - Wait a minute, you mean more than two people?
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:03.720]   - Yeah.
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:05.200]   - Wow, how do you do that?
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:07.440]   - Have you done that, the turn-based?
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:08.680]   - Oh, no, I have it.
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:10.520]   Of course, it's just like a real Scrabble game.
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:11.360]   - Yeah.
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:13.920]   - Except, says Hasbro, no, it's not.
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:15.960]   It's, I feel sorry for these guys.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:18.960]   Two guys, very, I think, are they brothers?
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:22.700]   Yeah, Rajat and Giant are Goala.
[00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:25.820]   They're software company RJ Softwares.
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:29.760]   You know, they've been going back and forth with Hasbro.
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:33.760]   Hasbro says, "Look, we own the rights to Scrabble.
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:36.120]   "Your game, it's not called Scrabble,
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:39.280]   "but it's the same board, same rules, same scoring.
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:40.240]   "It's Scrabble."
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:43.560]   And I guess they never came to an agreement, finally.
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:46.080]   Hasbro's gone to court.
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:48.680]   They filed lawsuit in US District Court in New York City.
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:49.600]   They took their time.
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:52.840]   I think they were probably trying to work something out.
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:54.920]   I mean, it's been since January that they mentioned this.
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:59.920]   Now they want Scrabble's to pull the game off Facebook
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:04.240]   and pay them an undeclared amount of damages.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:05.720]   You know, this isn't the way to handle it.
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:08.800]   I'm actually surprised to hear that they're doing this.
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.880]   Maybe the brothers weren't willing to go along,
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:11.880]   but don't you think the right thing to do
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:12.960]   is buy the company?
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.640]   They've got a great implementation of Scrabble.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:17.880]   Just buy the company and brand it.
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:18.840]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:21.160]   It depends on what the brothers were asking for though, right?
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:22.640]   I mean, if you come in and say,
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:24.600]   "Hey, we really appreciate all the work you've done.
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:25.600]   "You have a huge following.
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:27.440]   "You've wrote a lot of great code here.
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.000]   "Here's a million bucks."
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.360]   Like those guys should take it.
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:31.800]   They shouldn't try and fight and say,
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:34.440]   "No, actually, this is a different game."
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:36.840]   Because it is a clear ripoff.
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:40.000]   - Right, we don't know that happened though.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.600]   And I want to bring up another example of this sort of thing.
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:45.800]   Some years back, and I don't remember the name of the product,
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:49.640]   but there was some company that developed a methodology
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:52.080]   to take Sony PlayStation One games
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:53.880]   and run them on the PC.
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:57.040]   And it became quite a popular little game
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:00.200]   because you could put a PlayStation One game in the PC
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.960]   and you could run it on your PC.
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:05.120]   And Sony sued them into bankruptcy.
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:07.560]   When it seems to me that Sony should just get set here,
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:08.800]   how much money do you want?
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:11.600]   It was a pretty good job you did here 'cause they did.
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:15.760]   And here's, take the money or we'll sue you.
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:17.280]   I mean, we don't know the story here,
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:20.800]   but it seems to me that I'm always of the impression
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.280]   that these companies don't do that.
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.720]   They just decide to sue.
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:27.760]   Do we know they ever made them an offer?
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:28.880]   - It's been going on since January.
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:31.200]   You gotta figure something happened between January and July
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.920]   between the two of them.
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:34.320]   They must have been talking.
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:35.920]   - Somebody's gotta find this out.
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:38.560]   - It just, you know, they've got, I don't know how,
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:41.440]   I mean, this is, if not the most popular application
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:43.880]   on Facebook, it's gotta be one of the most popular
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:45.280]   applications on Facebook.
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:49.120]   You would think that it's worth something and,
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:50.480]   you're right, maybe the brothers said,
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.320]   oh, we need a billion dollars.
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:53.320]   You know, it's worth a billion dollars.
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:55.200]   - You know, they're, unfortunately that's a possibility,
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:57.680]   but I would hope one of them gets a hold of us
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:59.120]   and tells us the facts here.
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:02.600]   - Maybe they will.
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:04.960]   RJ Softwares, give us a ring.
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.560]   I promise not to make fun of you with strange voices.
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:10.400]   Another story, "Delicious."
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.120]   Finally, it looks like "Delicious" again
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:13.640]   from Mike Harrington, consider the source.
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:15.520]   You like Mike, though, right, Kevin,
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:18.760]   you're not resentful of the stories that he publishes.
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:21.440]   - No, I mean, I know Mike.
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:23.320]   Yeah, I don't hate the guy.
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:26.440]   - You wish he'd lay off?
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:27.280]   - I don't hate the guy.
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:28.280]   - It's his job.
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:29.120]   - It's his job.
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:29.960]   - I don't hate the guy.
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:31.200]   There's a ringing endorsement.
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:32.040]   - I don't hate it.
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:33.880]   - No, I mean, I think that Mike writes,
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:35.880]   you know, he's got a lot of really good posts
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:38.960]   on, and I follow his side as well, so.
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:40.000]   - They're saying in the chatroom
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.800]   that you are very patient with me.
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:44.880]   Deb says, "You're very patient, Kevin.
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:46.760]   "Thank you for being so patient."
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:49.000]   - No problem.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.120]   (laughing)
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.080]   He's never coming back, is he?
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:55.960]   I'm gonna chase him away, and they're never gonna come back.
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:57.800]   - Yeah, you're making his life miserable.
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:59.160]   - So I haven't seen Delicious 2.
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:00.520]   I've seen screenshots.
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:05.520]   Your friends with Joshua Shactor, who did it.
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:07.840]   - Yeah, I just sent him and I am.
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:09.720]   I said, "What do you think of the new Delicious?
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:11.200]   "I'm on this week and take podcast.
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:12.040]   "They wanna know."
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:13.520]   And he hasn't wrote back yet.
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:15.120]   - Cool, well, let us know what he says.
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:18.520]   He left Yahoo just a few weeks ago.
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:19.680]   - Yeah, like a month, month and a half,
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:20.520]   go something like that.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:21.760]   And what's he doing now?
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:27.200]   - He's just working on all this stuff, just playing around.
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:28.000]   - I love Delicious.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:28.960]   I mean, we use Delicious.
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:31.200]   I know it's not really a dig competitor.
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:32.400]   It's just a very different thing.
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.120]   We use it for our bookmarks.
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:35.040]   - Yeah, totally.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:39.000]   - And so you can actually see what stories we talk about
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.400]   ahead of time if you know the show number.
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:41.320]   This is 153.
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:43.880]   Just go to, by the way, finally, delicious.com.
[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:47.480]   I don't have to say d-e-l-dot-i-c-i-o-dot-us.
[00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:49.200]   Delicious. - I like the old one.
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:50.640]   It's just a lot of dots.
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:53.080]   - Delicious.com/twit/theshownumber.
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:55.440]   In this case, 153 is see the stories
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:56.800]   that we're gonna talk about.
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:57.640]   It's very handy.
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:56:00.200]   I didn't get it until we started doing Twitch.
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:03.440]   And then I realized how valuable and useful it is.
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:04.280]   - I use it all the time.
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:05.120]   - What's 2.0?
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:07.000]   What's it gonna be, do you know?
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.120]   - I've played around with it about six months ago.
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:10.920]   I don't know how much they've changed it since then.
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:12.440]   So I don't know.
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:14.440]   There were changes from the navigation
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:16.120]   and there was a graphics refresh.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:18.480]   And I don't know, feature-wise, what's changed though.
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:19.320]   - Yeah.
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:22.480]   - What would you do with it?
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:25.680]   - That's a good question.
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:27.960]   - Do you sometimes look at sites and think,
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:30.440]   well, you know, 'cause you always look at it.
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:31.680]   All your energy's going to dig.
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:33.520]   And what am I gonna do next with dig?
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:34.360]   - Right.
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:35.440]   - But would you ever look at other sites and say,
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:36.680]   what would I do with this?
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:40.080]   - Well, I think that Delicious has been pretty much the same
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.040]   for a long time.
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:42.880]   And it's a great utility.
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:44.360]   One of the things that happened,
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:46.920]   I know that slowed things down for them
[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:49.840]   was that once they were acquired by Yahoo,
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:53.400]   Joshua was forced to port them over to PHP.
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:55.640]   And originally it was all written in Perl.
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:58.440]   And that process just took forever.
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:00.440]   And I guess they couldn't get the right engineering talent.
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:03.560]   And, you know, he was scaling fine
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:04.800]   before that started happening.
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:07.120]   And then all of a sudden, they started working on 2.0
[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:08.360]   once the port was complete.
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:11.480]   And now it's just, you know, three years fast forward,
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:14.240]   three years and he's left and nothing's changed.
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:15.080]   So--
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:16.440]   - What's the reason for the port?
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:17.760]   - It's like, Perl works fine.
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.600]   - Oh, but that's Google.
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:20.440]   - But that's Google.
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:21.840]   - For Yahoo, I mean, yeah.
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:22.680]   - Well Yahoo--
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:24.440]   - Yahoo does that with everything.
[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:27.120]   - They would make everybody go to PHP since when?
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:30.000]   'Cause PHP's a fairly new initiative.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.800]   When did they start changing ever over?
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:35.760]   Or did somebody, some PHP nutcase, the CTO, and what's the deal?
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:37.440]   - I mean, they've been in PHP for a long time now
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:38.280]   for years and years.
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:39.120]   - For at least--
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:42.200]   - Yeah, but they weren't in PHP in 1994.
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:43.040]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:44.400]   - Microsoft is the same thing.
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:48.280]   I mean, Hotmail was running on Linux before they bought it.
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:50.920]   - But they need to do that because of the public relations
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:53.360]   fiasco if it was still running on Linux.
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:55.320]   - I don't know, you know, I just read that Yahoo,
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:58.800]   I mean, I'm sorry, Microsoft just pledged 100,000 a year
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:01.160]   to the Apache Software Foundation.
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:04.000]   They're actually one of the platinum partners for Apache.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.800]   Oddly enough.
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:08.640]   - That's so thing to be on the mailing list.
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:09.880]   (laughing)
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:11.520]   - Yeah, for them it's nothing, is it?
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:13.400]   Here's 100 grandkid, go away.
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:15.800]   - Don't bother me.
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:18.120]   They do get more than 100 grand worth of PR
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:20.080]   'cause they're supporting open source.
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:21.000]   - Huh.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.840]   - I mean, I think that's a good thing they did that.
[00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:25.440]   - Maybe that's for the money for all the guys
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:28.400]   that are going out to insult the Apple geniuses
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:29.320]   that's coming from.
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:33.320]   - No, ASF is not related to FSF.
[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:35.400]   They're different people.
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:37.440]   - I mean, I think Yahoo should buy a dig.
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:40.120]   (laughing)
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:40.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:43.120]   - I have to say this with, and Kevin's behalf.
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:47.200]   - When you look at what happens to companies like Jai Koo
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:49.360]   and Dodgeball when Google buys them
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:51.480]   or delicious when Yahoo buys them,
[00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:54.080]   it's very common for these innovative, small,
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:56.520]   nimble companies to get eaten by these big guys
[00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:58.000]   and just languish.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   - They should make Kevin stay there for three years.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:03.080]   - That's exactly what they do.
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:05.920]   And then just like Joshua, he'd leave.
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:07.200]   It's okay, thank you.
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:09.160]   Got my stock, see you later.
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:14.160]   - You must feel some sympathy for Jerry Yang
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:16.840]   and his fight against Microsoft, Kevin.
[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:18.680]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:20.200]   I mean, he wants to keep it his own.
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:21.760]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:26.320]   - Well, I mean, if you're a stockholder,
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:27.560]   you might think so.
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:28.640]   - Yeah, I think there's a lot of latest is,
[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:32.640]   of course, they got some patents that are worth billions
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:34.640]   that Microsoft wants to get a hold of.
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:36.040]   - Now, here's the deal, Kevin.
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:39.080]   Imagine Carl Icahn comes along and says,
[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:41.880]   I'm gonna take over dig.
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:44.000]   And you know, threatens, rattles his sword.
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.880]   August 1st, you're not public, so you don't have to worry
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:47.880]   about it, but let's say you were,
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:48.720]   and he rattles his sword,
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:50.080]   so we're gonna go to the shareholder meeting,
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:51.120]   we're gonna do it.
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:53.840]   So Yahoo says, okay, fine, we're gonna give you a board seat
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:56.240]   and three others, or three board seats.
[00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:59.160]   Now you gotta deal with Carl Icahn at every board meeting.
[00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:00.140]   Imagine.
[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:03.440]   That's gotta be hard.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.680]   - I mean, these are the challenges that,
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.520]   well, I don't have to deal with that
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.640]   because we're not publicly traded,
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:09.120]   so that's very nice.
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:10.360]   - Yeah, no kidding.
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:11.200]   No kidding.
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:14.040]   Do you,
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.200]   do you don't have to worry about,
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.240]   you have board meetings though, 'cause you have investors.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.080]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:22.000]   Yeah, there's a, we have two other board members,
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.840]   besides J and myself, Brett Boulington and David Z.
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:27.200]   - Oh, it's pretty small.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.480]   - Yeah, it's very small board.
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.920]   And you know, it's great.
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.480]   Our board meetings are fast and pretty painless.
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.000]   - Yeah, that's nice.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:36.840]   And an agreement.
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:40.200]   - It must be tough when you have a happy.
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:42.960]   Would you ever consider going public with thing?
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:43.800]   - I don't know.
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:47.680]   I mean, I think that we will be profitable very soon.
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:50.600]   And we're just happy kind of growing it
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.840]   the way we are right now.
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:55.000]   You know, when you go public, all of a sudden
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.600]   you give up a lot and you have to answer to a lot
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:01.360]   of people and it's just a pain in the ass
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:03.320]   with everything that needs to be filed.
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:06.560]   - Ball street's kind of cruel and fickle and random.
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:07.400]   - Yeah.
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.600]   - I mean, people beat their estimated earnings
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.240]   and Wall Street punish them
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:13.360]   'cause they wanted them to beat their estimated earnings
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:14.200]   by even more.
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:15.040]   It's like, huh?
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.960]   - Yeah.
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:18.960]   I don't know.
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.720]   The only reason I really see it to go public
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:22.920]   is if you need to raise an insane amount of money,
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:25.840]   you know, and we don't need that cash, so.
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:28.040]   - You took investments 'cause you needed to be,
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.800]   you need a lot of servers.
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:32.080]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.400]   - I remember that.
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:34.240]   - Man.
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:37.680]   - It was, I was running the entire company
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:40.880]   off my own personal life savings and that ran out.
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:42.720]   And so I needed to take some angel funding.
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:45.000]   So I took, you know, 50 grand from a friend
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.520]   and then some cash from a few other angels.
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.160]   That kind of ran out.
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:53.720]   And then we did a series A with Graylock
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:56.520]   and PR Omidyar's Omidyar Network
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:02:00.200]   and they invested 2.8 million and that helped us,
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:04.000]   you know, buy a ton of servers and people to help scale
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:04.840]   the site.
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:09.200]   And then that happened again with our series B
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:11.360]   just to buy more servers and add people.
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.640]   I mean, you need several DBAs.
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:15.120]   You know, what if one goes on vacation?
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:15.960]   - Right.
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:16.800]   - You need a backup.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:19.080]   You need a whole slew of developers
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.280]   and people that have the experience
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:25.280]   scaling, you know, large websites, which is hard to find.
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:27.800]   It's easy to find a lot of PHP developers, you know?
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:31.160]   We get applications from all types of people
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.720]   with varying degrees of experience
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:35.480]   that have worked in PHP for, you know, years.
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:37.240]   But you sit down with them and you say,
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:39.640]   okay, what large websites have you worked on?
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:41.560]   And, you know, what do you know about
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:45.400]   charting a database and writing very specific code
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:49.440]   to help you scale to hundreds and hundreds of servers?
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.480]   And that list is very small.
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:53.840]   And when you do find those people, they're very expensive.
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.520]   - And they work for Google, half of them.
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.400]   - Exactly. They work for Google and Yahoo.
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.280]   And so you have to be able to pull them out
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.440]   of these companies and that's hard to do.
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.600]   So it's getting easier with Yahoo.
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:07.760]   We do have a lot of resumes from people over there.
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:11.080]   But yeah, it's difficult to find talented people.
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:13.600]   What was this called?
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.960]   - Joshua just got back to me.
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:16.320]   You wanna know what Shactor said about,
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.160]   - Yeah.
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:20.080]   - Just said, I quote, "I hope this new system
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:23.240]   "puts them on a good footing for moving forward."
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:24.360]   - This is why.
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:27.560]   - Wow. He must have like a special non-disclosure thing
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:29.240]   or a contract that--
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:30.560]   - You could probably write a generator.
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:32.560]   - He's like, "I'm not ever ever ever ever ever ever."
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:35.560]   - He's like, "I'm never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever."
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:36.400]   - Yeah.
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:39.560]   - He's like, "I'm never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever."
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:40.400]   - Yeah.
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.560]   - He's like, "I'm never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever."
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:44.400]   - Yeah.
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:47.560]   - He's like, "I'm never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever."
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:48.400]   - Yeah.
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:51.560]   - He's like, "I'm never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever."
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:52.400]   - Yeah.
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:55.560]   - He's like, "I'm never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever."
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:56.400]   - Yeah.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.240]   - Yeah.
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:58.080]   - Yeah.
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:58.920]   - Yeah.
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:03:59.760]   - Yeah.
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.640]   - You know, the whole thing should be torn down.
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:03.600]   We should just shut down the internet.
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:04.920]   That'll take care of most of this problem.
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:06.080]   - My problem is I can,
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.880]   if I think something that comes out of my mouth,
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:09.200]   I cannot be diplomatic.
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.360]   I'm really bad at that.
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:13.440]   - Well, we've never noticed this, but--
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.760]   - You haven't noticed that?
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:15.680]   - Not really.
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:16.560]   - I think I say things.
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:18.520]   I get in trouble all the time.
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:20.560]   - Well, I'll give you an example.
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:22.080]   No, I'm not gonna give you things.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:22.920]   (laughing)
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:24.440]   - So Leo says we're talking about, you know,
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.960]   big main, you know, these guys who were running these systems
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.520]   like Kevin was describing,
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:31.240]   what is the story behind that guy in San Francisco?
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:33.000]   - That is a great story.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.920]   And there's more to it.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:37.440]   Okay, so we'll take you back rewind a couple of weeks.
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.440]   We talked about this on Twitter,
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:40.240]   I think last week or the week before.
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:41.880]   Guy is assisted men.
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.760]   He's hired by the city of San Francisco
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:45.200]   to set up a very important,
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:49.920]   wide area land for the city.
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:53.280]   This is how administrators and others are gonna be able to,
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.200]   you know, civil officials are gonna be able to log
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.160]   into the city's network remotely.
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:59.160]   Guy is apparently a brilliant engineer,
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:02.760]   maybe a little cranky as many assisted men's are,
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:05.200]   by the way, belated, happy, assisted men's day.
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:06.360]   We love cis admins.
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:11.560]   He won't give up the passwords to, you know,
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:15.760]   I guess a new guy comes in to monitor the security
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.560]   and the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:19.400]   the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
