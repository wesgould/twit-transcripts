[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.560]   because next week we're going to do a prerecorded
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.160]   holiday special with John Hodgman and Jonathan Colton.
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.360]   It should be a lot of fun.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.760]   And in the week following the last Twit of the year,
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.960]   we'll do a best of.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.960]   In fact, we encourage you, if you've got a suggestion
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.360]   for a moment to remember sometime in the past year of Twits,
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.600]   send it along to Tony@Twit.tv.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.400]   Tony will be assembling it from your suggestions.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.160]   So if there's a great moment, in fact, best if you could

[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.960]   but if not, we'll find it.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.960]   Just email it to Tony@Twit.tv.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.760]   We'll try to put together.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.160]   It may be a very short show, the best moments from 2008.

[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.160]   Hi, John.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.160]   Hello.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.160]   You were going to come, but the storm kept you from showing up here.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160]   Yeah, I was going to go up there.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.160]   I like doing it.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.160]   It's a nice little town, you know.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.160]   It is.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.360]   But it's rain and it's miserable out.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.360]   We serve you wine.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.360]   We serve you cheese.

[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.160]   We had peasants last time, and I thought that was really fun.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.960]   Coming out with torches to lead you to your car.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.960]   But no, no, the rain stopped him.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.360]   Didn't stop Sarah Lane, though, from driving all the way up here.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.360]   You get a new car yet?
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.360]   Maybe you get a Tesla.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.360]   This guy knows about that.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.360]   Mr. Jason Calicatus.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.360]   Hello.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.360]   Oh, no everybody.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.360]   Number 16.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.560]   And has it run out of batteries yet?
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.760]   Yeah, well, I have a big pack of the triple A's that you get a Costco, so I just change
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.760]   them out.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.360]   Actually, that's one of our stories is about batteries.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.440]   Energizer says at CES, they're going to show a new zinc air battery that they say is going
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.400]   to really transform laptops.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.400]   We've seen this is nothing new.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.280]   I mean, zinc air batteries have been around for a while.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.240]   I'm not sure why they think this is worthy of newsworthy, but maybe it's maybe they've
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.000]   made some huge breakthrough in battery technology.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.640]   John, you know, I think about that.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.800]   Curiously, I did an article for Forbes some years back on zinc air batteries.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.280]   Aren't those hearing aid batteries?
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.160]   I know not to mention.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.160]   You might be right.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.160]   I've used them.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.400]   I mean, I've used them in like I had a Timex watch.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.400]   Yeah, well, you have to once you break the seal, the next thing you know, they start working.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.440]   But they're also you can get these little packages of zinc air batteries and keeping
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.760]   your car and then they hook to your cell phone and you just you want your break the seal
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.640]   and the air gets in there.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.000]   The battery starts to work, which makes them kind of cool.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.440]   That's what's interesting about them is that they, you know, and they also can be recycled.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.440]   You can you can put the zinc through a process and then they can be reused.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.280]   Well, that's actually I didn't know that.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.680]   And that's a pretty compelling reason to.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.480]   And it's actually not really as much a battery as it is a fuel cell.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.480]   Right.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.160]   By that, the difference being, of course, is that you can take and you can reclaim the
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.400]   zinc and put new zinc in.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.080]   And the next thing you know, you have is you're up and running and you can't really do that
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.160]   with the batteries work differently.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.360]   Energy energizer says it's much thinner than current batteries will allow OEMs to design
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.800]   smaller devices that still provide longer run time.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.960]   You know, I bet they're aiming these at netbooks and things like that.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:47.840]   Maybe self-
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.040]   G one, the Google phone, I had to abandon it.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.440]   You know, I couldn't get it through a full day.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.040]   The iPhone for a long time.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.320]   You couldn't get it through a full day there.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.200]   Somehow they fixed that with a firmware upgrade.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.920]   I'm not sure how they did that.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.560]   Yeah, my iPhone doesn't make it through the day.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.800]   That's why I use it as a backup.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.000]   It's not good if it doesn't make it.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.960]   I mean, what's the point if it doesn't make it through the day?
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:05.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.560]   Of course, the one phone that has the worst battery performance has a CEO who doesn't believe
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.840]   in, you know, exchangeable batteries.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.880]   That's that's that's that's thoughtful.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:21.240]   They say no mention of how much the technology will cost since they don't mention it.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.920]   Shane McLaughan writing in ours Technica says he has to assume the battery is going
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.920]   to cost more.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.160]   I think a safe assumption.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.640]   Zinc is selling for 50 cents a pound.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.240]   Actually, zinc air technology is pretty cheap.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.400]   I would think it would be cheap.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.280]   It's certainly cheaper than lithium.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.480]   But do you just are these disposable or do you just keep you refuel them as like a fuel
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.480]   seller?
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.480]   Well, I don't know.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.480]   That's the question.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.480]   We don't know how this thing works.
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.640]   I mean, can you swap the zinc out?
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.040]   It just it's mystifying.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.760]   I think this is, you know, every year these guys is one company or another, announce some
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.440]   new battery thing at CES and you go there and there's nothing to it and never goes anywhere.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.040]   It's like the TV sets that they announced.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:06.280]   Although this year, Canon will in fact bring an SED set that lawsuit is over.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.200]   Applied nano tech, which claimed they own the SED patent dropped the loss of lawsuit in
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.840]   July dropped appeals just a couple of weeks ago.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.160]   Toshiba, who was their partners, dropped out of it.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.760]   So now Canon owns, and even really skeptical about SED, I know, John.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.760]   Yep.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.960]   Owns the outright SED technology.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.520]   So they in theory could make SED sets and they say they're going to show them at CES.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.040]   Yeah, I'm sure they will.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.040]   Big deal.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.640]   But you know, the thing about the battery power is we don't really appreciate how much
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:42.000]   batteries have gotten better because laptops and the phones have, you know, they draw
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.800]   more power.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:50.960]   And just to keep up with the laptop, you know, video chips and et cetera and the new peripherals,
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.440]   you know, you basically are just treading water.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.160]   But I can't figure out, I've been trying to find what is the Moore's law of batteries.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.800]   It ain't the same as Moore's law.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.800]   Obviously, yes.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.360]   I think it goes the other way.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.800]   It seems like seven to 10 years we can double battery efficiency.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.800]   Wow.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.800]   That's a big difference.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.960]   And so, well, I mean, Moore's law is 18 months.
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.280]   I'm getting over 200 miles of charge right now.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.160]   So yeah, but you've got probably hundreds of pounds of lithium ion batteries in there.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.360]   Yeah, there's a lot there.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.000]   I mean, that's a real problem because the weight reduces the range.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.960]   And so you can't just willy-nilly throw a lot of batteries in there.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.040]   So actually what they should do is they should have a dual battery pack in there where I
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:40.080]   could take out half the battery pack because almost every day I drive less than 100 miles.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.080]   Short trips.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.080]   I do 30 miles a day.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.480]   So either I charge the thing every fifth or sixth day or I, you know, just, you know,
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.480]   whatever.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.800]   I would say I think Andy Groves absolutely right.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.560]   Battery technology and maybe increasing efficiency of solar cells would also be another good
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.560]   direction to take this.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.760]   If you get solar power to be more efficient, efficiency is really the issue.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.800]   The amount of energy converted into power, I think it's like 5%.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:08.200]   If you can double it or triple it, which is still not a whole lot, that would make a
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.200]   big difference.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.080]   And you could put solar panels on the roof of the car and it could charge as it goes.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.080]   Things like that.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.920]   Yeah, the solar panels on the roof of the car is kind of a myth.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.920]   It's not enough.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.600]   It's nowhere near enough.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.840]   Like what people actually are using it for is to maybe run the air conditioner, you know,
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.360]   and secondary services like that.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.080]   It just would never charge the car.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.040]   Way too slow.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.880]   Didn't they, our challenge had a solar card, didn't it?
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.640]   But it goes like two miles an hour.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.160]   I mean, yeah, it's like one of those things like set it in the desert and, you know, like
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.320]   a week later it's going to go like it gets you there.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.320]   Exactly.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.320]   What's your hurry?
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.800]   Well, actually there's a, I got some inside information.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.800]   There are a couple of the owners of Tesla were, I have a mailing list of all the owners
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.800]   and we're talking about putting charging stations between San Francisco and LA and
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.240]   Mammoth and, you know, whatever, Vegas.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:03.320]   And so we started talking and it seems like the company is actually going to put these
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.560]   high speed chargers out.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.400]   They have chargers now that can charge the entire battery pack in under an hour.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:13.320]   So you stop for lunch, plug it in and they're going to make them free to start and then
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.840]   you pay like whatever $2 to plug it in down the road.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.440]   But it's costing $2 to charge my tank right now.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.760]   That's pretty cool for a 200 miles.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:22.760]   That's pretty cool.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.720]   I haven't been to a gas station in six weeks.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.640]   It's mind blowing.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.360]   This was not a big news week.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.920]   I'm sorry to say.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.840]   So I think a lot of what we're going to do since it is our last show of the year is
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.960]   talk about the year gone by, but you had, you, you brought a couple of stories to the table.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.400]   Jason relevant, in fact, a little bit to, to your own business.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.800]   Google, this is a shocker.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.040]   Now I consider the source.
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.040]   It comes from the registered.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.600]   I think this is a Andrew Louryłowski is not the most reliable.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.360]   Oh, he's very reliable.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.360]   Is he?
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.280]   He's just, he's snide, I think is what the, you know, I mean, he's nasty, but he's not,
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.040]   he's not, he doesn't make mistakes.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.760]   Well, he, he makes a very good point.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:10.560]   If this is accurate, he says Google this week admitted that its staff will pick and
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.080]   choose what appears in its search results.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.560]   He says it's an historic statement.
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.840]   He says it's a historic statement, but I know his British roots would like him to say it's
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:25.960]   an historic statement and no one has yet grasped its significance.
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.040]   I thought the whole idea, Google was that humans didn't get involved.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.400]   How is this what Google has been doing all along, which is human tuning of the results?
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.520]   Or is this actually Google picking results?
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.880]   Jason, do you know more about this?
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:44.080]   I know about a Google program called search quality where they have people look at results
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:49.720]   and say if this web page that came up in a result is clearly spam good content or somewhere
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.680]   in between, like it's like a triple flag, you know, so it just sort of takes out some
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.680]   bad stuff, but they don't have a large scale effort, at least not a public one.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.960]   But Marissa has been warming up to obviously the concept of humans being involved in search
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.880]   since they've launched the search wiki thing, which was really.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.240]   That's not Google staff, that's us.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.240]   That's us.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.360]   And then I think what they're saying is, you know, this is during a Mike Arrington interview
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.360]   at the web.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:19.320]   At the web, she says that editorial judges will play a key role in Google searches.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.320]   That's just historic.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.120]   I mean, Arrington says, Meyer also talked about Google's use of user data created by
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.520]   actions on wiki search to improve search results on Google in general.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:32.120]   For now, that data is not being used to change overall search results, she said.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:39.200]   But in the future, it's likely Google will use the data to at least make obvious changes.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.800]   An example is if thousands of people who are to knock a search result off a search page,
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.520]   they'd be likely to make a change.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.640]   Yeah, basically Google's moved to the center now.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.720]   They were saying absolutely no to humans.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.360]   Now they're saying humans plus algorithms.
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.560]   I've been saying from the beginning humans plus algorithms, but.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.120]   Well, Mahalo's all human.
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.120]   Yeah.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.120]   But it's not exactly.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.120]   It's not exactly.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.000]   It's not exactly search, but we default back to Google, but we've got some things we're
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.520]   going to show in the next couple of months that have a little more algorithm to them.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:10.560]   I guess part of the issue is it's easy to say machines are going to do it all, but then
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.000]   people game the machines and you.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   That's the problem.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.960]   I think it's the worst proxy.
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.200]   Voting is the worst proxy.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.520]   Well, you know, there's another thing here that's overlooked is that Google has not been delivering
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.520]   really.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.960]   I mean, talking about the batteries improving, I don't see any evidence that Google's improving.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.240]   Oh, the search results are getting worse.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.240]   Worse?
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.680]   The search results are getting worse than one of the problems that that always irks me
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.600]   the most is why am I going to Google?
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:43.440]   In fact, this was pointed out on the last cranky geeks bike, a Cade Metz.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:49.680]   You go to Google and you put in some search term and then you get back a bunch of Parker
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.680]   sites.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.480]   You know, these that used to be a big problem.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.800]   It's not so much a problem anymore.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.840]   I'm still getting them all the time.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:01.520]   Cade Metz brings up the point that Google makes money on those Parker sites.
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.080]   And so why would they discourage it?
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.960]   Because it hurts their larger business.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.960]   It's a bit of interest here.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.480]   No, but it's their larger interest.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.320]   His searches that make money because of AdSense ads on there.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.280]   But really, there are actually something through that, Leo.
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:18.200]   A lot of their revenue comes from these cool landing sites.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.560]   Some people estimate 20%.
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.880]   Yeah, but it hurts their overall business.
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.880]   It's not worth it.
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:23.880]   How so?
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.960]   I mean, if you go to a search results aren't as good.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.920]   I don't see people flocking away from Google.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.320]   It's like, where are they going to flock to?
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.320]   Exactly.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:37.200]   And if it's only three out of the 10 results are bad, yeah, you're going to find what you
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.200]   want eventually.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.280]   But if you had a perfectly efficient search engine, the problem is the ads would never
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.280]   get clicked.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.280]   Well, all right.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.480]   I'm going to search for turpentine.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.960]   That's a good point.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.520]   I'm going to search for turpentine on Google.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.120]   First result is Wikipedia.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.600]   Second result is OSHA.gov.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.080]   Third result is answers.com.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.760]   I'm going down dictionary.
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.000]   Wildlife Refuge.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.880]   I haven't found a single link farm yet.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.240]   Give me another word.
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.240]   You'll be another one.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.760]   Once you click on each one of those things, you know, I've seen a lot of them come.
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.000]   It looks like a real good site.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.240]   You click on a boom.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.240]   Apparently it's--
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.040]   Type in Paris hotels.
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.040]   Paris hotels.
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.040]   All right.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.040]   That would be a better one because--
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.040]   No, that's all link sites.
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.160]   You're not even going to find anything decent there.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.160]   Yeah.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.520]   Here's the first link is to ParisHotels.com, which seems like a sensible.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.080]   No, it's just a--
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.080]   Link Farm?
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.600]   It's Paris Las Vegas, which is real.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.960]   Paris Las Vegas, which is real.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.880]   Hotels and Paris at booking.com, which is real.
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.960]   GTA Hotels, that's a real booking site.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:41.160]   Paris Las Vegas, Expedia, Hotels.com, TripAdvisor.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.680]   Maybe I'm using some different version of Google.
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:48.120]   Well, I have like France-Hotel-Guide, which is a spam site.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.120]   Hotel-pass.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:53.240]   Even the Paris Hotels.com, the insider's guide to Paris since 1996, looks like a real
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.240]   site.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.960]   That's not-- I mean, what you have to realize is what's missing from here.
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:03.280]   Where is-- like the New York Times travel section where they have a lot of information?
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.400]   Well, if you want that, you write Paris Hotels reviews.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.320]   Yes, but the question is, are there better--
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.720]   I'm going to write that in and see what I get.
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.720]   I am not seeing one farming site on here.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.720]   There is photos.
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.720]   Where is photos?
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.720]   Fromers?
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:21.040]   Lonely Planet, Concierge, New York Times, and the official tourism site.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.040]   They're not listed there.
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.040]   No, because I think--
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:27.680]   I think Google made the right choice, which is it shows bookings in Paris Hotels.com.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.840]   Paris Hotels, if I write Paris Hotels reviews, what did you get, John?
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.840]   Not--
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.840]   Well, this one here--
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.480]   Tripitvisor, which is right.
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.480]   Here's one.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.480]   Check this out.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:41.080]   I don't know what you think, but if you go down, if you look Paris reviews, you get
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.800]   some ads and you get the Tripadvisor, which is legit.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:45.800]   Which is very legit.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.800]   Go to travellibrary.com.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:51.200]   That looks legit, but when you click on it, it's a Parker site.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.920]   Only it happens to be one of the newer styles.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.640]   It looks like a real site, but it's not.
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.160]   I don't see travellibrary.com.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.760]   Yeah, I'm looking at it now.
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.760]   Paris, are you signed in to Google?
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:01.760]   Are you running out?
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.760]   I'm signed in.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:03.760]   He's really trying.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:07.360]   You're never going to get the same results if you're signed in.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.280]   Well, anyway, if you--
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.720]   So sign in, folks.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.680]   Create a Google account and sign in and you'll get good results.
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.440]   No, no, you'll get bad results that way, too, but you won't get the exact same bad
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.440]   results that I--
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.160]   Well, I'm not signed in and I'm seeing travellibrary.
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.840]   All right, I'm not signing out right now.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:29.600]   But if you want to review about a Paris hotel from New York Times, the first thing I would
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.960]   do is type in Paris hotels and I see.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:32.960]   Exactly.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:33.960]   And that's the first thing that comes out.
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.960]   Exactly, or photos or-- yeah, exactly.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.680]   You know, just that's-- your search terms are actually--
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:42.640]   I hate to be the one that's in total agreement with Jason on this deal.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:47.240]   Well, it is the holiday season.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:52.520]   The question is, it's sort of like pollution, like 20% pollution you may not notice, you
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.520]   know?
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.840]   You may be able to find stuff, so you've hacked around it.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:01.080]   But, you know, if you see a page that has absolutely no spam on it, it looks a lot better.
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.640]   Trust me, we make them every day.
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.400]   All right, I'm seeing travel library now.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.520]   Why would logging in or logging out make a difference?
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.960]   Makes a huge difference and it makes the biggest difference it makes is when you and
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.760]   like you and me and we're both trying to find something together and one person's logged
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.680]   in and one person isn't.
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.760]   And you know, you say, well, the third one down is this.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:20.760]   No, it's not.
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:21.760]   The third one down is this.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.760]   It's really confusing.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.880]   In my experience, I get worse results actually being logged in.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:31.080]   I have to say, though, travel library.com is the only bad result I got.
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.440]   Here's the New York Times result.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.360]   Not at the top of the page, but at the bottom of the page, looking for Paris hotel reviews.
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.080]   I get the New York Times reviews.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.080]   I don't, I.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.560]   Here's, here's an idea.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.920]   It used to be terrible three or four years ago.
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:43.920]   I'll grant you.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.920]   Go to go to mahalo.com/Paris_hotels.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.920]   Well, that's a human, of course.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.720]   And yeah, then look what it could be.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:54.120]   And then when you see what it could be, then you start saying, oh, okay, this could be
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.840]   better if you had content on the page in humans.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.880]   And that's, you know, if the top one third was selected by humans, you'd get rid of all
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.080]   the spam problem.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.840]   So, but, but, but then you'd have judgment involved.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.800]   Yeah, but you can hire people with a neutral point of view.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.040]   So like our top center.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.880]   Yeah, that's worked real well for American journalism.
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.680]   We're for man.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:18.200]   I mean, photos, framers, lonely planet, concierge.
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.080]   Those are really good content sites.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.480]   So if you're looking for Paris hotels, that's the best place to go.
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.400]   And those three don't even come up in Google's results.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.600]   If you type Paris hotels, you should get photos from us on lonely planet.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.680]   You're getting mostly booking it.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.520]   What you mostly get when you type in Paris hotels, even though you, maybe there's not
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.520]   as many Parker sites as there could be.
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.520]   Well, let's try.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:37.520]   All right.
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:41.520]   And you get a lot of these booking sites, which are kind of Parker sites in a, in a new,
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.160]   but they're a little more advanced.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.880]   I remember talking to Sergey Brannoni.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:50.040]   One of the things he said, and this was years ago is, I mean, look, even years ago,
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.320]   and this is when you still could talk to Sergey, he said, what I do is I, every day,
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:57.160]   I go down some, somewhere I look at the end of the internet.
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:01.480]   I look at the last of the results and he uses, he would look at what the last results were,
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.440]   and he was able to tune the algorithm every day.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.320]   He'd be tuning the algorithm based on that.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:08.960]   That's a form of humor intervention that, that makes sense.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.320]   It's, but it's, but it's not human editorial input.
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.680]   I, I get very nervous when hum, I guess I guess I could trust somebody to go through
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.400]   and say these are Parker sites.
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.400]   But otherwise, it's taking out the spam.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.400]   It gets tricky.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:24.440]   But also, you know, you, you trust humans to help you with picking a movie or picking
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.640]   a restaurant, right?
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.160]   Yeah, I'm not saying that, but you like Pandora.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.720]   I mean, humans, you know, so humans are different from things.
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.440]   But, but, there's a Yelp page for Paris hotels.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.440]   There you go.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.440]   But do you trust Yelp?
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.440]   Isn't there, aren't there people in their gaming Yelp?
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:44.040]   Yeah, no, but you know, you, but you can kind of deconstruct Yelp in such a way that
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.920]   is, it's, that is very valuable as a site.
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:47.920]   I love Yelp.
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:48.920]   Yeah, so good.
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.560]   When I read Yelp reviews for fun.
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:55.600]   Well, Yelp people are like, because it started in San Francisco, where people are a little
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.600]   bit crazy.
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:00.760]   They, they, you know, like at least in terms of like, I'm the customer crazy, like this
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:05.320]   sense of entitlement, like people are going into restaurants and like when they don't
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:08.080]   get their water filled, or is that a restaurant recently?
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.560]   The woman was like, I'm going to put this in Yelp.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.240]   She was like, I'm putting this on Yelp.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.240]   And this is ridiculous.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:17.440]   And she's like, her friend goes out with a Yelp t-shirt on when they go out to eat.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:22.560]   I just hope that the person knows, you know, who's serving them like, you know, but hotels.com
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:26.720]   has a whole television campaign based on that, which is actually a very funny campaign.
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.560]   You've seen it where they, where the guy goes to the hotel and then they like spray paint
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.640]   the tan on him or they're giving him extra special service.
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.840]   They gave him, you know, they spray it to hit the tan on and they give him a six pack.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:40.840]   So that he'll give them a good review on hotels.com, which if you ask me is probably promoting
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.640]   the wrong side of the business, but I agree with that.
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.680]   By the way, the problem I have with the up, if there is a problem is that is the enormity,
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:52.160]   there's a huge number of vegans or vegans.
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.360]   They're not vegans.
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.600]   That's from a, that's from a constellation far.
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:57.600]   Yeah, vegan.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:58.600]   Number of vegans.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.600]   At least 70%.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.600]   Sarah is almost a vegan.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.400]   I'm not, I'm not even a vegetarian.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.160]   I'm a Pescatarian, like a lot of other people in the world.
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.160]   What's a Pescatarian?
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.680]   It means I eat fish.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:10.680]   She's a Pisces.
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:15.440]   Oh, I had a really bad, but having some Mahi Mahi tonight.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.440]   Yum.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.920]   I think I'm going to have sushi when I get out.
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.880]   Are you going to sear that Mahi Mahi?
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:21.880]   Probably.
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.200]   Maybe coat it in a sesame seed crust, perhaps a little teriyabi.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.200]   You're not wasting your meat.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.000]   I usually based my meat later in the evening.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.840]   Well, I'll give you a chance to base it right now.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:33.840]   What do you say?
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.840]   We're going to come back.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:35.840]   Hey, hello.
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.840]   Hello.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.560]   I like to base my meat in the morning.
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:45.360]   We're going to take a break, come back and talk more about the news and then look back
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:49.040]   at the big stories of the year and kind of, I think it's always fun to do that and see
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:56.640]   in retrospect, for instance, in January of this year at CES Comcast announced in 2008
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.280]   we will offer 100 megabit service.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.320]   Well, yeah, thank you Comcast.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.000]   I can't wait for that.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.520]   But we'll talk about that in just a little bit right now.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:10.080]   I do want to mention our good friends at go to meeting, go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.320]   If you've ever used go to meeting, you know what I'm talking about.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:14.880]   If you haven't, you might want to give it a try.
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:21.920]   Go to meeting is the service that lets you hold a meeting online, eliminating all that
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:27.040]   painful travel, all that going about from here to there, hither and thither.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.160]   No more flying, no more driving.
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.480]   And by the way, it's not a conference call either because you know how it is with conference
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.480]   calls.
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.920]   So what a meeting makes them engaging, makes them visual.
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:37.920]   Here's what happens.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.920]   You set up a meeting ahead of time or you can do it on the fly.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.760]   You could say, while you're on a conference call, you say, "Hey, look, I got to show you
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.760]   this.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:45.760]   I got to show you."
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.160]   Like we were just doing with these search results.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.400]   You see, I didn't believe John if he'd say, if he'd go to meeting, he'd say, "No, no,
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.400]   look, see?"
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.400]   That's the kind of thing.
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.240]   So he says, "Go to go to meeting.com.
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.240]   Here's the meeting ID.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.240]   I go there.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.240]   I don't have the software installed or anything.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.640]   I just enter the meeting ID and all of a sudden I'm seeing John's screen on my computer.
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.520]   He could show me the website.
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.520]   Show me the PowerPoint.
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.520]   We could collaborate together.
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:06.520]   We could do training.
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.360]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.360]   Try it right now.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:15.600]   You get a 30-day free trial, a month of service, a month of unlimited online meetings, absolutely
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.600]   free.
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.600]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.600]   I'm a big fan.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.040]   I've been using Go at meeting for years and I want you to try it now.
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.200]   I'll tell you the way I use it.
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.200]   How do you use it?
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:29.480]   Well, you know, every time I have to do a press tour, like if I'm doing briefings, you
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:33.200]   know, I like to show people what we're doing, but I don't want to give them a log into the
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.200]   site necessarily.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.080]   I want to drive and walk them through the product, whatever we're launching.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.080]   So exactly.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.400]   You just get go to meeting.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:43.760]   You set them up on go to meeting and then put a headset on and I say, "Hey, let me just
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.400]   show you the five things we're doing."
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.040]   And then, you know, it saves me from having to go meet with them.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.800]   They like it because they don't have to leave their office.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.400]   Very efficient for press tours.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.760]   You're doing a press tour.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.760]   Very cool.
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.720]   Did you go to the web?
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:01.760]   You know, I was supposed to give a keynote and I canceled like a couple of weeks ago
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.840]   because I got a new product launching tomorrow.
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.120]   And so I just couldn't do it and have a board meeting this week.
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.120]   It's just the travel.
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.840]   Are you glad now having read all the comments that you didn't go?
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:11.840]   Yeah.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.600]   I feel like, look, I love Loi Clamour.
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:14.600]   Nice guy.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:15.600]   He's a really nice guy.
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.960]   Founder of C's, he puts this, how many years has Loeb been going on?
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.600]   This is the fourth, fifth.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.000]   He puts his heart and soul into it.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.960]   And the idea is it's in Paris.
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.720]   It's, of course, he's French, but he lives in Silicon Valley.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:32.080]   So I think the idea is to get kind of the best minds of Silicon Valley and Europe together.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.080]   Is that it?
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:34.080]   Is that kind of the point?
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.080]   And all of Europe and now he's got Asia coming.
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.440]   It's like 1700 people go.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.560]   I spoke at the first and the third.
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.960]   And I was supposed to speak this year.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.120]   And actually I invited me.
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.120]   He invited me.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.120]   But I'm going to Paris in two days.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.080]   I couldn't go there and come back and go there again.
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.800]   So you got engaged, you said?
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.880]   I got engaged at the first one.
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:51.880]   How romantic.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.160]   I took my wife to the top of the world, top of the--
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.160]   I have full towers.
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.040]   You know, Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes did that too.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.720]   He did it at the fourth floor restaurant.
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:00.880]   I did it proper.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.440]   Oh, see, he knows the details.
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.440]   He's like, no, no, no.
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.160]   You don't stop at the fourth.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.720]   The only reason people eat at that restaurant
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.480]   is to jump the line at the Eiffel Tower.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.600]   And I did it--
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.120]   isn't that restaurant on the second floor?
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.160]   And it's called the second floor?
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.000]   The Dusseum et Daj.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.640]   Well, somebody's going to go on Wikipedia now and tell us.
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.680]   But isn't there like a really good restaurant in the Eiffel Tower?
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.800]   Is it supposed to be?
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:22.760]   That is a good restaurant.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:23.760]   It is.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:24.600]   I got one star, maybe two.
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.800]   Oh, wow.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.320]   I have any event.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:29.760]   I felt sorry for Louis because boy, the complaints.
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.200]   And this is something that happens at conferences nowadays,
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.760]   because you've got this Twitter-backed channel.
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.760]   You've got all these people blogging.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.160]   And the market tense just come--
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:38.840]   now, I don't know.
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:39.320]   I wasn't there.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.720]   But first of all, they said it was freezing.
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.560]   They--
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:45.160]   Day one heating broke.
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.160]   Day two, it had heat.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:50.680]   The internet from Swisscom never worked.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.280]   Poor Louis.
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.640]   They didn't even have internet for the people demonstrating
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.520]   their products.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.000]   Ooh.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.320]   God, that's got to hurt.
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.680]   That's terrible.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.560]   There, the food, apparently, which has been traditionally
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.080]   very good.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.280]   And he said, I spent even more on the food this year.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.880]   Everybody was complaining.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.800]   The food was a split decision from what I understand.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.120]   Some people liked it.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.360]   Well, some people like ham sandwiches.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.520]   It just depends what you like, I guess.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:15.680]   Yeah, I was there last year.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.840]   I mean, they had foie gras.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.040]   I mean, it was ridiculous.
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.440]   The food off the chain.
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.400]   I felt bad for Louis.
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.520]   I mean, he pulled it off.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.440]   It sounds like there was--
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.400]   everybody was there.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.480]   I mean, Errington-- in fact, Errington was one of the people
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.560]   who was not too happy.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.440]   Scoble tried to defend it.
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.840]   I mean, it was just everybody was there.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.520]   And there was a lot of bitching and moaning.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:37.360]   Is this a bad trend, this kind of back channel
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.440]   bitching and moaning thing?
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.960]   Or is this just inevitable the way it is in everything?
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.320]   We've got two back channels on this show.
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.040]   And half the time, somebody in the back channel saying,
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.680]   change the subject this is boring.
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.720]   It's just the way it is.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.880]   But you know, I've been over at your place
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.760]   sitting there watching that back channel.
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.760]   And to people who are writing, we don't really
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.240]   read it that carefully.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.120]   I think Sarah's in there typing right now.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.600]   I'm watching it.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.920]   Battle Rail says, I hate all of you.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:09.600]   Listen to 935 says, this is boring.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.600]   Yeah, but these are the people complaining.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.360]   Is there anybody that likes what we're talking about?
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:14.920]   No.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:18.160]   Is anybody like themselves in the chat?
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.920]   You actually like yourself.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:20.960]   Yes, everybody say no.
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.520]   All right, well, leaving the lab.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.200]   Let's move on to another topic then.
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.160]   What's the--
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.120]   I figured out actually how to get Wi-Fi working
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.080]   at these events, Leo.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.120]   How?
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.920]   You run Ethernet cables?
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.360]   No, no, no.
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:34.800]   You know what?
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.320]   I'm sure that you run Ethernet cables.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.040]   This is a mess because Swisscom, he says,
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:41.840]   I paid 100,000 euros.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.800]   That's a lot of money to Swisscom.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:47.000]   He said they had Ethernet on the stage, didn't work.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.560]   That Wi-Fi to the room didn't work.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.600]   Well, Errington wrote a very interesting post.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.360]   And remember, Mike said lawyer by training.
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.720]   He said, if some company would come along
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.120]   and offer high-speed internet for conferences
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.000]   and back it up with a bond saying, if we don't produce,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.400]   if we don't perform, we'll give your money back
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.560]   and then some because there's a big loss to the conference.
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:08.840]   I mean, you've got entrepreneurs
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.400]   who paid a lot of money to get to this conference
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.560]   to demonstrate who can't because there's no internet access.
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.960]   We had problems at TechCrunch 50 and--
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:22.160]   I solved it by just running literally 250 drops.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.840]   250 ethernet drops.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.000]   Then the Wi-Fi has the pressure taken off of it
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.680]   because what happens is these are not normal people
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:29.520]   in the conference.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.320]   These are people with laptops with two other Wi-Fi devices
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.680]   with them and they're uploading video.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.000]   They're doing Victorian in the background.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:37.840]   I mean, these are hard.
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:38.520]   Scobles doing quick.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.440]   Everybody's got them.
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.320]   Scobles is like, I don't understand why this isn't working.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:45.600]   Meanwhile, he's uploading 50 megabyte raw files
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.240]   to his Flickr account.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:48.720]   Yeah.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.920]   Please.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:50.400]   Please.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.880]   Well, I feel for a Louis--
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:56.040]   You have to have multiple lines coming in, like a fiber line
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.040]   and then like nine DSL lines.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.880]   And then you split them, some to the stage,
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:01.720]   some to the press room.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.000]   That's when we did a TechCrunch 50.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.160]   And we had 2.5 days out of three of good internet.
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.960]   He actually-- now, this sign thing was a mistake.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.120]   Louis put up a poll saying, should I invite Mike
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:11.720]   Harrington back?
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:12.600]   He was mad at Mike.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.560]   I don't know if he's mad, but Mike apparently
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.320]   at one of the last presentations
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:19.400]   started talking about American versus European entrepreneurs.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.920]   He said, Europeans are too laid back.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.360]   They take two hour lunches.
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.560]   In America, you're calling entrepreneur.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:25.640]   You don't have small talk.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.040]   He says, what am I-- what do I need?
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:27.760]   John, you do this.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:28.800]   What can I do for you?
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:29.320]   What do you need?
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.320]   What do you want?
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:33.000]   And he said, this is why Americans are effective.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.800]   And this is why-- and of course,
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.160]   it infuriates the European audience.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.440]   And Louis had a poll.
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.640]   Should I invite Mike Harrington back two to one, no?
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.440]   Well, that's not--
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:41.840]   You know what?
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:42.640]   Other reasons.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.120]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:43.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:46.680]   That's pretty much his average.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:47.320]   I like Mike.
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.880]   And Mike, you have always had a standing invitation
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.040]   to be on Twitch.
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.120]   He's been on one of our shows once.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.280]   I've tried to get him on Twitch.
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.200]   And it's not easy because he's a very busy guy.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.920]   And I think he doesn't sleep normal hours.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.120]   So busier than you are.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:01.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.120]   I don't think he--
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.840]   Everyone's busy.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.760]   If you wanted to quit, you will.
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:10.200]   The Europeans might be upset about that comment.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.480]   But the fact is, the Americans now
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:17.000]   are way behind what's going on in Korea, Japan, China, and India.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.520]   We sleep too much.
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.600]   Compared to the same comparison you
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:24.480]   can make about America to Europe, which is true to a certain extent.
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.880]   Obviously, it's a broad brush.
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.440]   But yes, the companies here, people
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:30.200]   work more hours and put more effort in on average.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.160]   And then you compare it to India and Korea and Japan.
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.480]   It's the same comparison.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.480]   They're working harder than us.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.000]   They're going to eat it all.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.160]   I'll debate that.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.440]   Because one time somebody pointed this out to me,
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.520]   once you start thinking about it, you may realize it is the case.
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:44.960]   We do put in a lot of hours.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.800]   And we do a lot of hand-wringing.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.000]   And we do a lot of redundancy.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.280]   Somebody said to me once, he says,
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.760]   that's bold that the Japanese put in more hours.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.080]   Yeah, they're out all night.
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:57.280]   But they're mostly out socializing if you go hang out in Tokyo.
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:01.320]   His comment was, they don't work harder than we do.
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.480]   They work smarter.
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:07.080]   What do you think, Sarah?
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:08.560]   Are we smarter?
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:10.520]   Or are we saying they are working smarter?
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:11.520]   They're smarter.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:14.960]   The Japanese work smarter than we do.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.640]   By working smarter, do you mean they're a bit of organized?
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.000]   It could be an organization.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.280]   It could be getting other people to do stuff that you do.
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.480]   It could be a lot of different things.
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.400]   No, that's what we do.
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.880]   We sell our work to India and Russia.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.680]   We don't do the crazies.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.120]   I don't.
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:28.880]   I think it says--
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.640]   How do we all spending in this country?
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:31.840]   I think this is--
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:35.240]   My personal feeling about that kind of generalization
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.520]   is there are good companies in every country.
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.560]   There's innovation in every country.
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.640]   I don't know if one country has an advantage over it or not.
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:41.400]   I still can't be one.
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.760]   The innovation level in America--
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.560]   I mean, I was just in Japan and Korea.
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:47.200]   I think you guys were too, actually.
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.120]   John, you were in Korea.
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:51.520]   I mean, they are really catching up to us.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.800]   And they're producing a lot of serious talent over there.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.080]   And that talent is not coming over here the way it used to,
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:01.520]   because the Bush administration, which seems--
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.320]   I think they're leaving soon.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.000]   I've heard that.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:04.840]   But I don't know.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.340]   Yeah.
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:06.440]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.400]   Did you see that video over and over and over and over?
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.760]   I just watched it the once.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.040]   CNN's been airing it every 15 seconds.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.080]   I just watched on the internet.
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.440]   But I was impressed how nimble President Bush was.
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.760]   You know, I thought the same thing.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.640]   I was like, look at him.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.160]   He's clearly ducked shoes before.
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.440]   He's ducked a lot of things.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.080]   His press people said--
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.440]   Investigations.
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.200]   He said President Bush has spent a lot of time
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.800]   in the baseball business.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:30.800]   He's good at it.
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:32.040]   He's good at getting it.
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:32.560]   He was fast.
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:36.320]   But then the real question is, aren't the secret
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.680]   service supposed to protect him?
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:38.520]   And where were they?
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.680]   They weren't even on the stage.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.240]   Somebody's showing a throw in themselves
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.000]   in front of the object.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:43.840]   Aren't they supposed to--
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.800]   If a guy doesn't have a gun on, I'm like, what are you
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:46.320]   supposed to do?
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:47.200]   All the reporters?
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.800]   Yeah, I think people are stunned.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:51.560]   They make us do that.
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.440]   They're going on the airplane.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.680]   All press conferences are now going to be shoeless.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:57.400]   Coming next to me.
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.400]   That's the one I have.
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.040]   Shooless press conference.
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.960]   As they should be, take your shoes off.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.800]   Wouldn't that change everything and be very relaxed?
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:03.920]   It would be a press to be--
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:04.400]   It would be huge.
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:05.440]   Yeah, we'd make it more relaxed.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.000]   And it would make it cleaner.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.400]   Might make it a little smelly or I'd depend.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:08.880]   You'd become able to--
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:09.520]   Well, that's true.
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.200]   That could be bad.
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:13.280]   Reporters are not known for their foot hygiene.
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.800]   But that's actually part of the reason they threw shoes at him.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.960]   You remember when they took down the Sodom Hussein statue?
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.800]   They were banging with their shoes in the Middle East
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:21.800]   and their culture.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:22.880]   Shoes are very dirty.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.240]   You don't wear them in the house, et cetera.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.520]   And that is one of the biggest insults.
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.160]   It's like hitting some with the bottom of a shoe,
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.360]   because it's considered filthy in those countries.
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.040]   That's-- I remember going into mosques.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:32.720]   You wear booties.
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.480]   They take off your shoes and you wear booties.
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.560]   In India too, left hand.
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:37.560]   I think that's something that's--
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.080]   I think that's something that's--
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.080]   --precedented.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.320]   That's the bow right there.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.000]   It's a really weird way to end it.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.960]   But again, of course, we were talking about this
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:47.960]   with John Hodgman earlier.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:50.600]   And he said, look, nobody wants violence against the president,
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.680]   whether you agree with his politics or not.
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:54.440]   It's reprehensible.
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:57.280]   I was just impressed by his ability to dodge.
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:58.320]   I thought it was pretty good.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.320]   And I have to say, if the Secret Service is supposed
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.720]   to be there to take a bullet, I think
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.360]   the shoe is considerably slower moving.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.920]   I may be wrong.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.760]   I kind of-- it had to-- made me give it a little bit.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.360]   He saw the first shoe he docked.
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.680]   And he came up like, what are you doing, dude?
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:17.040]   He think he would be like, I better stay down.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.480]   Something terrible is going on.
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:21.240]   He was waiting for the next show.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.200]   Can I say this?
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:22.720]   Can I say this?
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:26.520]   And everybody knows the other shoe to come fly.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.560]   Politics-wise, I'm not a Bush fan.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.920]   But the last few months, he's been kind of likable
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:32.920]   in a weird way.
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:33.760]   Come on now.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.480]   Maybe it's because he's leaving, but he's been kind of cute.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.040]   And I thought it was really likable the way he dodged it.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.080]   And then dodged it.
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.680]   You found the dodging a likable straight?
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:42.520]   You dodged it?
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:43.880]   He almost screamed when he dodged it.
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:44.640]   He'd begin with it.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:46.000]   He popped up again.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:46.840]   They threw another shoe.
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:47.680]   He dodged the other way.
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.080]   This is the earliest thing that you've ever said in your life.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.880]   The Secret Service came running out
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.960]   and tried to-- they tried to wrestle him to the ground
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:53.880]   or drag him out.
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.200]   He waved them off, said, no, no, I want to watch
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.320]   as they wrestled the assailant to the ground.
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.000]   I mean, I think he's kind of a likable fella there.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.080]   Get some.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.320]   So actually, you know what this does is it's sort of like--
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:07.280]   remember when they hit Bill Gates in the face with a pie?
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.120]   I felt bad for Bill.
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:08.760]   Oh, it's terrible.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.200]   I mean, the problem with doing this kind of stuff
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.640]   is it just makes it open season.
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:15.080]   Like now there's a lot of crazy people watching going,
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.800]   oh, I can get to the president.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.880]   Oh, I can get to the strong limit.
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:19.920]   That's a terrible thing.
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.920]   That's a terrible thing.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.400]   It inspires the lunes to go out and do stuff like this.
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.240]   Right.
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.440]   That's a very good point.
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.000]   Bill Gates was never the same after that.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.080]   I don't know if you guys remember,
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:31.120]   but he used to come to conferences like in a rent a car.
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.360]   He would be hanging out.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.440]   I mean, it's not the same anymore.
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.280]   And rightly so, because when you're the richest guy
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.040]   in the world, I think you're a target.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:42.440]   That's why he wasn't until that guy pied him.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.160]   And that is sad.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:48.240]   In both cases, they're not lethal acts, but you're right.
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.120]   They open the--
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:53.360]   Well, the prize is just supposed to make him feel like a jackass.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.280]   You have to be humiliated.
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:55.640]   It sounds like you know.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.600]   You sound like you have some experience in this realm.
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:00.320]   I've never thrown a-- actually, that's not true.
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.120]   I've never heard that just pied guy.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.320]   Does anybody remember?
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:06.120]   I mean, this guy was famous, this pied guy who was pied.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.360]   It's friends.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.600]   What happened to him?
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.640]   That's just some absurdist troop of people.
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.120]   I forget who it is.
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:13.720]   Somebody's going to--
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:14.720]   Da-dies.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:15.480]   We all see da-dies.
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:16.880]   Hey, we're getting off topic.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.600]   Let's go back to the thing I got a note from someone.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.720]   See, you don't read the chatroom.
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.360]   That's my first recommendation to you.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:22.640]   All right.
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:26.640]   Let's take a look back at the year 2008.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:30.160]   It began at the beginning of the year with the announcement
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.880]   that Warner Brothers was going to stop making its movies on HD DVD.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:38.280]   Within a few days, HD DVD threw in the towel.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:41.120]   It was the end of the battle between high-def formats.
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:42.760]   Blu-ray wins.
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:44.040]   But was it a Pyrrhic victory?
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:46.640]   It seems like Blu-ray hasn't been able to make any headway ever since.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:47.000]   Well, wait.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.600]   Let's do one more-- let's take that start one more dimension,
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:53.880]   which is Paramount, which was a big promoter of Blu-ray.
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.480]   Just before that happened, they switched
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:59.120]   dropped Blu-ray and went to HD DVD,
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:01.320]   we believe probably because of a bribe.
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.240]   Right.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:05.000]   Boy, that was a mistake.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.560]   Maybe they knew that it was all-- and they
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.120]   were going to take the money and run.
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:11.080]   Well, that doesn't help to see this kind of mix up
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:12.920]   because the public doesn't go for it.
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.520]   Well, I think now, almost a year later, what we're seeing,
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.400]   really, is Blu-ray did not catch on,
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:21.800]   although now that they have sub $200 dries, maybe it will.
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:25.080]   I think the double whammy of the economic slowdown
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:28.920]   and widely available downloadable high quality movies--
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.320]   actually, it's a triple whammy-- and frankly, the fact
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.920]   that most consumers think DVD is just good enough is enough.
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.720]   I think downloads are--
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:40.600]   I think HD DVD and Blu-ray killed themselves by fighting.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:48.840]   Well, you also have to credit the 1080P line tripleers.
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:49.340]   Right.
[00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:50.080]   They look great.
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:52.120]   Those DVDs look great.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:54.320]   Not as good as Blu-ray, if you know the difference, but--
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.160]   But it's not that.
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:57.080]   I mean, they really look good.
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:00.040]   Good enough, I guess, is the point.
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:04.720]   And Nintendo surprised everybody in 2007
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.480]   with a great year in 2008, even better.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:12.280]   The Nintendo-- the number one console hands down.
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:16.440]   The Nintendo DS, the number one portable hands down.
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:19.600]   Xbox and Microsoft and Sony have to be wondering,
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:23.640]   what are we going to do to win here?
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:27.760]   Are you we play-- do you play the Wii at home, John and all?
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:28.520]   We have one.
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:29.040]   And--
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:29.720]   We fit.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:32.280]   Have you done-- have you done the hula?
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:35.120]   I've done a couple of things, but my daughter and her friends,
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:37.280]   when they get a hold of this-- when they get in the mood
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.960]   to go on the Wii, they'll be on it for hours.
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.960]   It's a Chick console.
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:43.200]   They really enjoy it.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.440]   There's a lot of guys playing the Wii Fit, though.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:45.960]   Really?
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:46.880]   What do they do the yoga?
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:47.360]   What do they do?
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:47.960]   The twist?
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.120]   Well, I mean, there's the one--
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:52.520]   see, I don't have one, so I'm just going to have to--
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:54.360]   it's kind of girly.
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:55.560]   I think it is.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.320]   And I mean, I'm a girl, and it's not like--
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:38:59.880]   there's anything wrong with girly stuff,
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:03.320]   but it seems like a weird way to exercise kind of in general.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.240]   I don't think it's very good.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:07.120]   And if you're a guy, it seems sort of girly to me.
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.320]   So you know guys who-- and they admit it.
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:10.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:11.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:12.600]   Look, you know what--
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.600]   I mean, I've watched guys go through the thing
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.240]   where they pretend that there's someone on stage,
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.520]   and everybody's clapping.
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:21.200]   They're clapping the fact that they can go up, down, up, down.
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:22.640]   And I just think, I know, too.
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.000]   I've seen a good exercise.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.120]   How is this different than rock band and all these other things
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:29.680]   where you're pretending to do something that's just a joke?
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.840]   Well, at least you're pretending to be a rock star instead of--
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.240]   Yeah, it's not like you're holding a magic--
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:35.160]   I think rock band's a little weird when it's all guys, too.
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.160]   Tarr.
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.760]   So you've got to have a girl in there or something.
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.120]   A girl-- seems a little silly.
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.800]   You know, my son plays rock band by himself, which is really weird.
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:42.360]   Is he singing?
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:43.160]   No rock band.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:44.040]   He plays guitar hero.
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:45.680]   Guitar hero.
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.760]   A lot of people play guitar hero alone.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.200]   You know what the problem with rock band is?
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.240]   That the singer always sucks.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:52.920]   I mean, it's like karaoke, you know?
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:53.480]   I mean, you sound terrible.
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:54.160]   You need a good singer.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:54.960]   You're not a good singer?
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:55.880]   Oh, the worst.
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:57.520]   We need a good singer because we have rock band.
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.760]   We just have a-- we need a singer.
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.000]   Well, shouldn't be me.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:00.560]   A lot of fun.
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.600]   Leo, you can sing at a party.
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:03.240]   It's fun.
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.440]   John's always fun at a party.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:07.200]   I finally realized John's secret strategy.
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.280]   You know, he eggs me on to do the voices.
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.800]   You can sing?
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.840]   He just wants me to make an ass of myself.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.760]   You're a vlogist or fantastic.
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:18.200]   You know what I've caught on to you, John.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.600]   Your secret is out.
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:23.160]   So Blu-ray won and, well, I don't know.
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:24.120]   Comcast--
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:24.480]   Oh, victory.
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.720]   Shower victory, exactly.
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:28.200]   Comcast announces its CES.
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:31.760]   Oh, yeah, we're going to do 100 megabit connections this year.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:32.680]   Did they really say that?
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.120]   I was going to get this year.
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.520]   Yeah.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.800]   They were going to roll out Doxys three throughout its network.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:40.040]   The company hopes to offer speeds of up to 100 megabits
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:43.680]   per second over the next two years.
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:46.120]   Not even close, but remember, their competition
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.280]   is Verizon Fios.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:51.440]   So they're really trying to say, hey, we can compete.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:59.520]   I think they've got a good product.
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.320]   I use Comcast.
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.080]   I use the bursts.
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:01.560]   It's fine.
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:03.680]   It's not as-- you know what we're getting?
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:04.800]   This is really interesting.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.320]   We're going to get this because we need
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:10.520]   to hire up speed bandwidth for our video empire.
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:14.680]   And whatever our local internet service provider, SonicNet,
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:20.320]   offers something called Ethernet over the last mile.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:24.240]   It's 700 bucks a month for 10 megabits symmetric,
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:27.760]   10 megabits up and down.
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:28.560]   That's not bad.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:29.360]   Not bad.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:29.680]   I mean, if it's--
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:31.080]   Is it work?
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.560]   I've been reading around, and I talked to Dane Jasper,
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:35.520]   who runs the company, and is a friend.
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:38.560]   You remember, Dane, we had him on the show a couple of years
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:43.480]   ago, and he said, no, it's as reliable as T1,
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.080]   as Rocksteady as T1.
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:48.480]   It's essentially-- it comes in over the copper.
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.400]   And because we're close to the central office,
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:51.680]   we can get 10 megabits.
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:53.080]   Cool.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:56.880]   And this is a YMAX trial going on right now that's crazy, right?
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:58.080]   What's the deal with the YMAX trial?
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.200]   I don't know about that.
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.040]   This is a YMAX trial going on somewhere that's
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:02.720]   like 3 megabit over--
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:03.840]   It's in Baltimore.
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:06.120]   It's in Baltimore that's supposed to be mind blowing.
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:09.680]   It's like 20 or 30 bucks a month, 3 megabit on your phone,
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:10.480]   on any device.
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:11.600]   Oh, I like that.
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:17.080]   And when you think about what that would do for internet usage--
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.960]   So YMAX works on the phone?
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.520]   You don't need a special phone?
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:23.160]   You need some sort of radio receiver for it specifically.
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:24.880]   Yes, special phones, but that would be the next wave
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:25.760]   of them that support one.
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.880]   There's YMAX in the San Francisco Bay Area.
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.960]   I mean, you can get it, but it's extremely expensive.
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.320]   It's very fast.
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.920]   So the idea is this would be 4G.
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:36.720]   This would be the next generation, right?
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.160]   No, YMAX isn't 4G.
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:41.880]   We'd be coming over right through the system.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:44.800]   We have a YMAX on the roof of our building as a backup.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.800]   So we put one on there for, I think,
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.760]   it was 800 a month for--
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:49.640]   It's really expensive.
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:51.920]   9 megabits, 8 megabits, something like that.
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:53.800]   So then we didn't need it anymore.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.240]   We got them talking down to 400.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:43:01.800]   And we use it as a backup to our 30 megabit fiber line.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.920]   Well, obviously Better Broadband is coming,
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:06.080]   but I don't know if it's coming from Comcast.
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:10.480]   The analog cellular network died in 2008.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.480]   People were most upset.
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:13.600]   I don't think many people had analog cell phones still,
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:14.840]   but people were most upset were people
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:17.480]   who had analog on-star.
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:21.240]   No, well, I had an analog.
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:25.000]   Track phone until the death of the analog phone.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.360]   The early track phones were analog.
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:28.080]   These are burners.
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:30.600]   Oh, you liked them, because the quality was really good, right?
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.640]   Oh, the quality and analog cell phone was never--
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:36.000]   Digital's never gotten to quality as good as us today.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:36.840]   That's right.
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:40.760]   My first Motorola would go back and forth,
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:42.240]   and you'd always-- it would get bad,
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.080]   and you'd look at it, and it would say digital.
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:45.960]   And then when it went back to analog, it would be better.
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.920]   You knew the quality was better on the--
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.040]   Well, when it went digital, it sounded under water
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.040]   a lot of the time.
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:54.360]   So we're suffering with crappy cell service.
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:55.840]   Could be better if we're still analog.
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:57.840]   Well, they can jam more signals in a small event.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.760]   An analog is almost always the answer.
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:02.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:05.160]   You would think that would something John would say.
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:07.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:09.160]   I don't know if you guys would still listen.
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:09.800]   Oh, you're answer.
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:11.480]   Good stuff.
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:15.520]   So I'm going to put it on my mom as in poppers right here.
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:19.480]   So Australia, early in the year--
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:21.880]   actually, it was in 2007 they announced it--
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:24.400]   that they were going to spend $89 million
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:28.280]   to offer free internet filters so parents could keep
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:30.000]   their kids from surfing porn.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.320]   The filters were cracked by kids in a matter of days.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:35.920]   This year, the Australian government
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:38.360]   declared the entire program to be a failure.
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:41.520]   This is around February.
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.880]   They said we thought 2 and 1/2 million households would
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:46.040]   buy the filters or use the filters.
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:49.040]   Only about 29,000 ended up being used.
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:54.440]   So now Australia, now Australia, the new government
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:58.360]   is planning to force internet service providers
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:00.520]   to ban websites.
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:06.800]   They're going to hold ISPs responsible for blocking all porn.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:09.520]   Mandatory filters that can only be surpassed
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:12.360]   by officially opting out effectively.
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:16.360]   You have to register to get a porn license.
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:18.720]   You have to show up in person and have your picture taken
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:19.720]   as well.
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:20.240]   I would--
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:20.960]   I'd make it.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.480]   I have needs.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:26.560]   And I really would like my internet to be unfiltered, please.
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.960]   Fantastic.
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:29.880]   Australia is weird.
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:30.600]   I mean, it's a great place.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:33.960]   But they don't have enough bandwidth coming in to begin with.
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:36.160]   I mean, they actually have bandwidth caps.
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:37.520]   Oh, it's so awful there.
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:38.080]   I was there.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:38.560]   I can't--
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.400]   Oh, it was painful.
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.720]   Streaming video, nothing.
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:42.560]   Nothing.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:44.120]   We have a lot of Australian listeners.
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:46.360]   We know that they listen.
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:49.600]   And I feel bad because we're offering richer and richer
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:53.440]   experiences using video and audio and so forth.
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:55.280]   And they can't do it.
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:57.080]   Because they'll hit their bandwidth caps.
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:59.400]   The Rudd Labor government--
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.240]   not Paul Rudd.
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:05.280]   Their Prime Minister Rudd says, if people equate freedom
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:07.120]   of speech with watching child pornography,
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:09.320]   then our government is going to disagree.
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:10.000]   Wait a second.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.640]   When a child pornography come in, Paul?
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.480]   It's all about-- this is what they always do.
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:14.360]   They say it's child pornography.
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:17.200]   And who can say, oh, no, I'm in favor of child pornography.
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:17.840]   Right, exactly.
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:18.760]   So they always do.
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.680]   I didn't realize this was child pornography.
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:21.200]   Oh, well.
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:22.600]   Not just regular pornography.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:23.200]   Oh.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.200]   Well, now here's a story.
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.320]   This is a modern story.
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:27.360]   We're jumping ahead a little bit.
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:31.120]   But the Simpsons-- did you see this?
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.080]   This is also Australia, isn't it?
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:36.920]   An Australian court ruled that child pornography
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:42.080]   with the Simpsons is pornography.
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:43.640]   It's equivalent of--
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.920]   OK, New South Wales, Australia $3,000
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:47.760]   fine two years of court supervision
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:53.920]   because of watching the Simpsons characters get it on.
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:56.720]   And apparently the Australian court
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:00.960]   said that even though it's a fictional cartoon character,
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:03.960]   it's a person within the meaning of the statutory offenses.
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:07.160]   There's a guy that was thrown in the slammer recently
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:10.360]   for collecting some Japanese comic books
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:12.880]   that have these androgynous characters in them.
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:15.800]   And he got busted for child porn for cartoons.
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.200]   They're cartoons.
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:21.160]   And then furthermore, one of your favorite writers
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:24.000]   is defending this guy.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.280]   What's his name up in Minnesota?
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:30.240]   Neil Gaiman.
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:33.680]   He got a whole website up about how ludicrous this is.
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:36.040]   But this guy's in the slammer.
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:36.480]   Oh, that's--
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:39.720]   What about the people who published the magazine--
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:41.720]   Well, I guess they'll be prosecuted as well.
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:42.220]   I guess.
[00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:45.240]   There in Japan, he collected this in the US.
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:47.320]   It's at-- what do you call manga?
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:49.240]   It's a manga comic.
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.000]   Is it manga or manga?
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.600]   Colleen, manga, or manga?
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.640]   It pronounced vegan right.
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:57.000]   Oh, so in the chatroom typed, M-A-N-G-A,
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.040]   as if that would help.
[00:47:58.040 --> 00:47:59.040]   It's Mr. L--
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:00.040]   Oh, it's manga.
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:02.800]   Colleen, who lived in Japan last year, said it's manga.
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.720]   Manga?
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.720]   I just want to make two points about the Simpsons thing.
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:07.720]   Yeah.
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:08.800]   They're not actually humans.
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:10.520]   They have four fingers.
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:10.720]   Two.
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:11.960]   And they're yellow.
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:15.240]   In the Simpsons movie, didn't they show Bart Simpson's--
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:16.560]   No, they didn't.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:17.480]   Well, they did.
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:18.320]   They did at one point.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:19.280]   They showed his thing.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:20.400]   They showed his wiener.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:21.560]   They showed his pee-pee.
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:22.360]   Well, they showed--
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.720]   Does that mean everybody who's just in the slammer?
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:26.000]   He is going to the slammer because I saw that movie.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.760]   I mean, has anyone even watched an episode of South Park?
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:29.520]   Oh, God.
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:32.400]   They're always worse than anything with Simpsons is done.
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:33.400]   Funny, though.
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:34.480]   Funny, but weird.
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.760]   But very-- I mean, very like-- whoa, really.
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:38.760]   I get queasy when I see my son watch.
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:40.080]   I have talked to some--
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:41.000]   I would, too.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.040]   Legal types about this.
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:47.520]   And if you draw a stick figure and put an arrow pointing at it
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:50.680]   and saying 11-year-old girl naked,
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:53.200]   that qualifies as child porn.
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:53.680]   You know what?
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:54.800]   It's like when you make a joke--
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:55.560]   What?
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:58.320]   --the security about having a bomb or something like that.
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:48:59.920]   Just they're trying to make a point.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.200]   Don't even joke about it.
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:03.200]   Don't even get close to the line,
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.480]   which is why it sounds so stazzy and whatever.
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:09.160]   It's just over zealous policing for--
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:10.400]   they have good intent.
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:13.200]   They just have no idea how insane it sounds.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:13.960]   The Simpsons.
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:17.240]   It's made from people.
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:19.480]   Google closed its acquisition of DoubleClick.
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:21.560]   I think this was the year that people stopped thinking
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:25.280]   Google was a benign, wonderful thing
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:29.160]   and started to think of Google as a potential privacy issue.
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:30.360]   It kind of lost its lust--
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:31.240]   Startup killer.
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:32.320]   Startup killer.
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:35.640]   Well, that was a few years ago when Google was just--
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:37.800]   everyone loved-- it was really cool to love Google.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:38.640]   We do know evil.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.440]   Yeah, but then they started ripping off every idea.
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:43.840]   Like they did Google No.
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:44.440]   Oh, that's right.
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:49.320]   Like Wikipedia, then they did Tech meme as Google blog search.
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:51.400]   She just ripped off the idea for Tech meme.
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:53.360]   I mean, that's where people, I think,
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:56.000]   where they started losing their constituency was the people
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.240]   in the valley are like, OK, there's a long tradition.
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:00.560]   Don't buy the startups.
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:01.600]   Don't knock them off.
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:04.080]   And now Google's like, yeah, we'll just copy that idea.
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:05.320]   Well, but that's insiders.
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:06.040]   Insiders believe that.
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:07.320]   I don't think people are--
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.920]   Well, but that's where the love of Google came from
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:10.120]   was the insider.
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:13.200]   The San Francisco, whatever, granola people.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:14.800]   You don't like us up here, do you?
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:15.440]   I don't know.
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:16.760]   What are you talking about?
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:17.400]   I understand.
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:17.920]   I know you're saying that.
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:18.600]   I did too.
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:20.240]   We both had granola for breakfast.
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:20.600]   Sure, good.
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:22.880]   And I'm wearing Birkenstocks, actually, right now.
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:23.240]   And you're--
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.240]   Are you?
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:24.760]   I have--
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:25.400]   Hey, Birkenstocks.
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:26.400]   That's a Birkenstock.
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:26.760]   That's a Birkenstock.
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:27.800]   He's sitting on a ball.
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:29.400]   I'm sitting on a ball wearing Birkenstocks.
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:29.920]   But it's true.
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:32.200]   And I'm going to throw my shoe at you, John, right now.
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.040]   It looks like you're about to throw it at it.
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:35.920]   I thought Birkenstocks have evolved.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:38.040]   I thought that they were the two buckle.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:39.240]   No, they've evolved.
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:40.200]   They're not sandals anymore.
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.560]   And he says Birkenstock right in there.
[00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:43.000]   Do they have any sandals?
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.120]   Yeah, they have sandals too.
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:45.720]   OK, they just have other choices.
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.480]   And I might add, I'm wearing a bacon scarf.
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:49.680]   Was that what that is?
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:51.360]   I thought it was like snowflakes.
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:53.840]   Well, look on.
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:57.960]   It says on the label 100% acrylic, do not eat.
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.920]   Bacon is like the new cupcake, I think.
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:02.240]   It's the new internet, cool thing to like.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:04.760]   Everyone there are a cupcake event in San Francisco.
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:06.480]   Cupcake camp.
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:06.840]   I didn't know.
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:08.280]   Did you go to cupcake camp?
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:09.520]   I'm not really into cupcakes.
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:10.520]   What's the deal with?
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:12.400]   Is it supposed to be like a bar camp only with cupcakes?
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:15.440]   Yeah, it's a cupcake themed event.
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:17.000]   And like all the other glitter dinger runny.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.360]   And you bring cupcakes and there's really interesting cupcakes made
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:23.640]   with jalapenos and that sort of thing.
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:24.480]   And then they're judged.
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:25.960]   And I think people just eat a lot of cupcakes.
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:27.120]   Does Kevin go?
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:28.400]   I don't think so.
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:29.080]   I think it's--
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:29.840]   Can he bake?
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:32.400]   He seems like he'd be a baker.
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:35.680]   I asked Kevin to be on the show by the way to apologize to him.
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:37.120]   If he's in the chat room, I don't know.
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:39.000]   He's not on IM.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.200]   But Adelson is.
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:41.120]   He says hello.
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:42.640]   Hi, Jay.
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:44.440]   Jay has a Tesla.
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:45.280]   He does.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:45.800]   And he loves it.
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:48.120]   He says he can't parallel park it yet.
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:50.280]   Because he's got too much torque.
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:51.000]   He puts it in reverse.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   Boom.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   He has one of the first 100, too.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.760]   Oh, wow.
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:57.800]   So what do we think is Google-- actually, I remember Eric
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:59.080]   Schmidt this year.
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:00.480]   And he was talking to somebody.
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:02.880]   He said, well, people take that a little too literally
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:04.720]   when we say our motto is do no evil.
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:07.680]   It's really a suggestion.
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:10.200]   He's probably the only one to come and it feels that way.
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:12.000]   It was pretty funny.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.560]   Well, now you don't have to do no evil.
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:14.080]   Just think of it.
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:16.520]   He said it's meant to so that you think about it a little bit
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:18.200]   before you did evil.
[00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:19.160]   Yeah, it's a guideline.
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:20.920]   It's a guideline.
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:21.920]   Luke's guideline.
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:25.320]   Is Google bad for our health?
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:28.040]   Should we be concerned about the size of Google, especially
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:29.800]   with the acquisition of DoubleClick?
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:32.800]   Does it make them really dangerous?
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:33.600]   I tend to think so.
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:34.800]   I personally don't think so.
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:35.840]   You don't think so?
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:36.360]   No.
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:38.280]   I don't think just because they bought DoubleClick,
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.880]   they are dangerous.
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:41.400]   I mean, the potential is greater.
[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:43.560]   Well, it gives them an incentive.
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.720]   Give them more incentive to be bad,
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:48.840]   to use our information in the various ways.
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:49.400]   There's double click.
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:50.240]   I feel double click.
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:52.080]   Well, maybe some people shouldn't be logged in all the time
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:53.360]   to Google.
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:54.640]   I locked down.
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:55.960]   They've pushed the line, basically.
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:57.840]   They weren't even close to the line
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:59.080]   because of market share issues.
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:01.120]   Now they're very close to the line of market share issues.
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:02.760]   And the Yahoo deal is proof positive.
[00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:04.720]   I mean, they basically had to cancel that deal
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:05.920]   because the Justice Department was going
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:06.440]   to stop them.
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:08.080]   So they're right up at the line.
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:10.040]   Stories said that the Justice Department was
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:12.280]   within hours of filing a lawsuit.
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:15.240]   They went right up to the wire and pulled back and said,
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:16.240]   I guess we can't do it.
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:20.080]   It is a good idea for Google to slow their role
[00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:21.160]   as we say in the business.
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:22.520]   Slow your role.
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:23.120]   What does that mean?
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:24.480]   Slow your role?
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:25.480]   Your role.
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:27.360]   You're rolling a little too hard.
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:28.200]   You want to slow down?
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.480]   Slow your role.
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:31.120]   You don't have to own everything.
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:34.360]   That Google wins all memo that Microsoft did.
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:35.320]   I will say one thing.
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:39.200]   I think Google did very well in the spectrum auction.
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:41.680]   Remember, they put up $4.6 billion
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:45.080]   so that they could participate in the FCC 700 megahertz
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:46.880]   spectrum auction.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:50.640]   They made as a precondition that whoever successfully
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:53.600]   won the auction would open it up.
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:54.680]   They kind of went back and forth.
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:56.920]   FCC granted some of it, but not all of it.
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:57.960]   But they made some--
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:01.600]   I think they made some serious concessions.
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:03.040]   The FCC did to Google.
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:05.720]   Google won their case, ended up not winning the auction.
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:09.640]   I think breathing a sigh of relief, no doubt, of Verizon and AT&T.
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:14.640]   The expected winners actually did get most of that C block.
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:15.960]   But they got what they wanted.
[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:18.440]   They were a happy loser because they got the openness
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:20.360]   they pushed for.
[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:23.000]   And I thought that was really nicely played, frankly.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.480]   They're not an evil company.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:26.360]   What I will say is I think that they
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:28.200]   lack a little bit of empathy sometimes
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:30.040]   because they're really intelligent.
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:32.800]   And they sort of talk themselves into our position
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:34.120]   as good because we're good people.
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:36.160]   And then some other people on the other side of it are like,
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.400]   yeah, but it doesn't feel good to the rest of us.
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.440]   The book thing, skinning in all the books.
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:41.880]   They're like, yeah, we're just going to do this
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:43.200]   because this is the way it should be done.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.920]   And then people who are on the books are like,
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:47.040]   but we own the books, shouldn't you ask us?
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.680]   And like, yeah, we should, but we're not going to.
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:52.280]   It's going to work to ask them.
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:52.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:55.800]   So it's that kind of behavior that gets interpreted
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:58.240]   as when you're that big arrogance.
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:00.200]   When they're small, it's like naivete.
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:02.160]   When you get big like that, it looks like you're a bully
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:02.560]   or arrogant.
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:03.560]   That's what happened to Microsoft.
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:04.720]   Microsoft--
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:05.720]   That's what people were saying.
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:07.400]   Yeah, didn't look like-- until the night Microsoft
[00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:09.520]   was a monopoly, nothing they did was that damaging.
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:11.400]   But as soon as they're a monopoly, it's a different matter.
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:13.680]   That's our trust to antitrust system.
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:14.280]   That's how it works.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:15.840]   That's why you have to slow your mind.
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:18.560]   All right, antitrust system sucks.
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:20.640]   Who should we bring down?
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:21.000]   Or no?
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.720]   I mean, I think it's already too late.
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:25.080]   I mean, everybody's-- they bought each other's--
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:26.760]   everybody keeps buying the competition
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:29.160]   and nobody cares about this.
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:31.640]   How about we-- how about they take down iTunes
[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:33.080]   and force Apple to--
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:34.360]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:36.640]   Allow you to use any MP3 player with it.
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:39.000]   There's a misuse of a monopoly.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.480]   There's an monopoly right there.
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:41.640]   I mean, I'll talk about it.
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:43.120]   How about opening up the app store?
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:43.880]   You know, come on.
[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:46.040]   Yeah, no, I agree with you.
[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:48.600]   That is clearly a misuse of its power.
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:52.280]   So since we were done that particular topic,
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:54.440]   since Jason brought up the scanning the books thing,
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:57.040]   you know, Microsoft was doing a parallel project scanning
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:00.160]   books, too, even though they didn't get as much flack for it.
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:03.400]   And Microsoft had scanned a lot of public domain books,
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:05.280]   more so than Google did.
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:07.840]   And they were all 100% searchable.
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:09.720]   It was very-- for about a year, anyone
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:12.720]   going to try-- trying to get a PhD or having to write
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:16.040]   a big thesis was in-- it was a gold mine.
[00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:18.560]   But for some unknown reason during this year,
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:21.520]   Microsoft pulled the plug on it, left all the scanning
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:23.120]   equipment at the various universities,
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:24.400]   including the University of California,
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:26.560]   where they were scanning books left and right,
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:28.720]   and then released all the books, saying, you know,
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:30.760]   we don't have any more claim to them.
[00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:32.480]   You can have them do whatever you want with them,
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:33.440]   all these PDFs.
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:35.120]   And then, of course, they shut down their server
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:35.920]   and their search engine.
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:38.160]   And so now there's all this stuff in limbo.
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:42.240]   Yeah, I was involved with a university that did that.
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:43.760]   They talked to both Google and Microsoft,
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:46.360]   felt that Microsoft was more reasonable,
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:49.240]   that they let them have more control over what they scanned in,
[00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:50.560]   you know?
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:53.000]   And it is a shame that that Microsoft project went away.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.200]   Book search is amazing.
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:56.720]   Like, do a search on Google Book Search
[00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:58.720]   or like, electric cars in quotes.
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:00.760]   And like, you start seeing these articles
[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:03.320]   'cause now they have magazines or like,
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:05.160]   this is information that's just not on the web anywhere
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:06.000]   but books.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.640]   I mean, it's pretty impressive to find like--
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:08.480]   Are they going ahead with it?
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:10.160]   I mean, are they still doing the--
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:11.080]   Oh, they sell them.
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:12.840]   A hundred million dollar settlement.
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:13.760]   Yeah, they're still doing it.
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:16.160]   But, you know, Microsoft, I agree, was doing a better job
[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:17.360]   and they were more magnanimous
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:18.920]   with the way the information would be used.
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:20.360]   And they didn't have all this weird stuff
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:22.520]   that was cut out and they did a lot of public domain stuff,
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:23.360]   which you need.
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:25.400]   You know, you could scan all those public domain books
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:28.040]   that were printed before 1927 or 2024,
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:29.280]   wherever the year is now.
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:32.600]   And you could make libraries and give them to other libraries
[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:34.920]   so they could have electronic versions.
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:36.360]   Google wasn't doing as much of that.
[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:38.360]   They were doing mostly newer books
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:41.120]   that they could push up against search engines.
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:43.720]   And, you know, I wasn't as impressed with what they have.
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:44.760]   And I'm still not as impressed.
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:45.960]   I've run into too many times.
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:46.800]   I've searched for something.
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:47.640]   I find it on Google Books.
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:51.000]   And then it's like, the part I want to read is like blocked off.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:51.840]   Right.
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:53.680]   Google has scanned seven million books,
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:54.640]   plans to do millions more.
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:55.880]   And now because they've settled,
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:59.280]   and by the way, that settlement happened at the in October,
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:01.720]   although it hasn't been approved by the court.
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:04.240]   So it won't go into effect probably till next year.
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:05.760]   They will be able to go ahead, right?
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:09.040]   And continue to make these scans.
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:09.880]   Yeah.
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:10.960]   Which is great news, I think.
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:12.520]   I don't think they stopped, have they?
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:13.360]   No, they haven't.
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:16.440]   The publishers tried to stop them.
[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:19.160]   And Google gave them some money and said,
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:20.120]   okay, we're going to keep doing it.
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:21.200]   Which is great news, right?
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:23.800]   You and I and Larry Lessig did a show on that,
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:25.800]   which was quite a good show actually.
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:29.840]   I wonder if the writers ever get any of this money
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:31.280]   that the publishers are getting.
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:31.840]   Most of them.
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:32.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:35.680]   Probably not.
[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:39.000]   Are you saying the little guy is going to not get screwed?
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   Please.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:45.240]   And by the way, Larry Lessig leaving Stanford to go to Harvard.
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:46.480]   Go back to Harvard.
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:49.320]   Okay. Wow.
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:49.680]   Wow.
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:51.720]   I think he's going to be into Obama.
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:53.280]   You watch, he's going to be working for Obama.
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:54.280]   Oh, I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:55.280]   You're radical.
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:59.080]   I'd love to see some IP reform with Larry
[00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:00.640]   at the helm would be fantastic.
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:02.520]   No, I mean, Larry Lessig's too radical.
[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:03.040]   Yeah.
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:04.840]   You know, I bet you the reason he's going back to Harvard.
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:06.480]   It's a little easier to commute back and forth
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:08.640]   to Washington DC from Harvard.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:09.480]   He could be in five.
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:11.680]   I don't see him as radical as you do.
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:14.320]   No, in fact, I'll tell you something.
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:16.720]   I saw Larry speak and I was actually impressed
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:19.200]   because he said, don't steal it.
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:21.880]   Don't violate copyright, lobby to change it.
[00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:24.880]   I mean, it was very clear that it should go through Congress.
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:27.320]   It should go through the legal process.
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:30.480]   He was really telling our listeners and people like me
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:35.080]   who usually flaunt copyright law not to.
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:36.800]   You do?
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:39.720]   No, but I could if I wanted to.
[00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:42.760]   You've got too much money to do that.
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:47.600]   I buy every book and then keep it in a special sealed container.
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:49.480]   Talking about books.
[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:50.760]   Yeah.
[00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:51.680]   Well, there's your lead.
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:53.880]   Oh, we already did we not do our audible commercial?
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:54.680]   Well, let's do it right now.
[00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:55.880]   You did the meeting right now.
[00:59:55.880 --> 01:00:00.280]   Yeah, let's do audible because this is a we have a special holiday deal from audible.
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:02.200]   Yeah, thank you for the smooth segue.
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:03.040]   I'm sorry.
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:04.320]   It's a little bumpy today.
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:05.560]   He's wearing a bacon scarf.
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.680]   Wearing a bacon scarf.
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:08.880]   Give me a break.
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.040]   We got two deals here.
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.320]   I'm going to start two URLs.
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.200]   You want to get your pencil out for this one, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.680]   Of course, you know about audible.com.
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:20.400]   You know what we're going to do at best of
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:21.680]   for the last show of the season.
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:27.640]   And one of the things I asked Tony to do is to collate all of Jason's moans and make
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:28.640]   a giant.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:29.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:32.920]   A moan montage and we'll make that be the audible ad.
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:34.600]   And I'll just have you as the background of the audible.
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:34.600]   I go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:41.600]   I go, oh, audible.com/twit749.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:45.400]   This is the audible deal we're going to do for you this week.
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:48.920]   If you sign up, go to audible.com/twit749.
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:51.760]   If you go there right now, actually, when is it?
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:55.960]   When does this go through the end of the month through December 31st?
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:59.000]   You go there right now, you sign up for an audible gold account.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.880]   You will get the first three books half price.
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:03.640]   So you know, sometimes we talk about the one book free.
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.360]   This is a better deal if you think about it.
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:09.320]   Three books for $7.49 for the next three months.
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.440]   That's that's that likes the holiday season.
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:11.440]   Just keep that.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.440]   That's real value.
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.440]   Thank you, Sarah.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:14.440]   Value for money.
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:15.440]   Do that.
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.160]   I just say that one more time.
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:18.160]   That was good.
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.680]   That's real value.
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.760]   Thank you.
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:24.600]   You got a challenger, Jason.
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:25.600]   I know I like that.
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:27.040]   I have actually a really good book.
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.040]   So please do.
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.040]   I'd love to hear it.
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:30.040]   This one is incredible.
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:33.080]   The post American world.
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:42.160]   It's basically a couple years old now, but it's just an incredible book about just how
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:46.720]   the United States is going to fare over the coming years in relation to China, India.
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:49.560]   A lot of stuff we talk about on the show.
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:51.600]   It doesn't exactly go exactly what you think it will.
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:56.720]   It's not like this is the end of the American empire, but it is what happens when America
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:59.960]   is not the sole superpower and doesn't have its position that it has.
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:02.800]   It's very pressing and given what's happened in the last three months.
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:04.400]   I love Fareed Zakaria.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:08.360]   He of course does a CNN show and he's a columnist in Newsweek.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:12.720]   I just really think he's one of the smartest guys out there.
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:15.080]   Mumbai native.
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:19.680]   It's sort of like Malcolm Gladwell, but of this globalization.
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:25.160]   It really has good anecdotes and backs it up with, they're sort of this formula that
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:29.280]   I guess some of these authors have now, which is like really compelling anecdotes that
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:33.520]   make you think about some overarching thesis with a lot of little...
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:35.920]   I think Tom Friedman kind of almost pioneered that.
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:38.360]   Yeah, Tom Friedman, this guy and...
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:40.160]   I'm Malcolm Gladwell, yeah.
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:42.920]   Well, we'll have the same sort of shtick.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:45.680]   The post-American world by Fareed Zakaria, really good.
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:46.680]   That's a great suggestion.
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:50.040]   On a bridge read by Fareed could be yours free.
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:55.280]   Actually, that could be 749, half off, and then you still get two half off books.
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.760]   Now I'm going to go us one better because we got a special holiday deal.
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:02:59.760]   And it's a different...
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:00.760]   Yeah, I know.
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:01.760]   I'm going to give away a book.
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:03.400]   You don't even have to be an audible member for this.
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.400]   Yeah, I know.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.400]   It's just free.
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:08.880]   You don't need a credit card, nothing.
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:09.880]   What was that?
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:10.880]   Jesus.
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:11.880]   What are you doing, John?
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:19.920]   I'm quickly opening up my thing to the postage stamp box so I can order this immediately.
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:20.920]   You don't need postage.
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:21.920]   That's the beauty of it.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:22.920]   Oh, you can use the web.
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:23.920]   It's called the Internet.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.920]   Go to audible.com/twits73.
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:29.200]   He's opening up the Internet.
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:31.480]   He's opening the Internet and you'll get this and it's free.
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:32.480]   You don't even have to be an audible member.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:33.480]   See that price?
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:34.480]   0.00.
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.520]   It is a series I really love and I want you to know about.
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.560]   And this is Audible called 33 and a third.
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:41.600]   They've got all of them.
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:46.240]   If you're a music lover, what this is is one book per album.
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:53.520]   And they cover all the classic albums starting with the Beastie Boys and...
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:56.520]   What are you laughing at?
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:57.520]   I don't know.
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.520]   I just the way you said Beastie Boys.
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:00.520]   Beastie Boys.
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:01.520]   It was so square.
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:02.520]   I am very square.
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.280]   I am lovably square.
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:05.280]   This is...
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.160]   Talking about Square, this is one of my favorite albums.
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:10.440]   Goes back to my youth highway 61 revisited by...
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.320]   It's the Bob Dylan album, of course.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:18.000]   Mark Paulizotti writes, "The making of cut by cut, they talk about shooting the album
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.640]   cover and fascinating.
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:26.520]   4.5 minutes, 4.5 hours, not 4.5 minutes, 4.5 hours, absolutely free.
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:30.240]   This is a great way to kind of get introduced to audiobooks.
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:32.480]   You don't even have to be an Audible member.
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:35.320]   Audible.com/twit33.
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:38.520]   Our gift to you in this holiday season, this offer good through December 31st.
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:40.280]   I got to listen to that.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:42.600]   That's got my favorite Dylan song, "Spout of a Thin Man."
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:43.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:46.160]   Walk into the room with a pencil in your hand.
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:49.320]   But see, we talk about how it was written in the story behind it and all that.
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:50.480]   See, this is the idea.
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:53.400]   And they have a lot of different albums.
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:59.200]   This is a very cool series that they acquired the rights to 33 and 33.
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:02.800]   I'm looking at this 33 and a third at the Wikipedia page.
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:03.800]   This is awesome.
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:04.800]   What a cool series.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.880]   They just basically write about the entire album.
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:08.880]   Yep.
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:11.080]   Paul's Boutique by the Beastie Boys.
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:14.080]   David Bowie's "Low", the Kinks Village Preservation Society.
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:16.560]   I think I've been 60 of them.
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:17.560]   Neil Young's Harvest.
[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:18.560]   Yeah, it's really neat.
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:19.560]   Oh, that's a great album.
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:20.560]   Isn't that a great album?
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:21.560]   Sure.
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:22.840]   I mean, what's neat is Meet His Murder.
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:23.840]   You'd like that one, Sarah.
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:24.840]   Ah, I want that.
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:26.920]   For the vegans among us.
[01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:31.200]   I'm wearing leather shoes, so I can't really go down that train.
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:33.640]   Go down that train too far.
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:36.480]   Songs in the Key of Life, The Velvet Underground and Nico.
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:37.720]   That's one of my favorites.
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:38.720]   These are all good albums.
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:39.720]   Good albums.
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:41.120]   So, normally $10, this is yours for you.
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:46.200]   Let's go to audible.com/twit33.
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:47.200]   This one is the Bob Dylan album.
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.400]   Once you hear this one, you're going to want to try some of the others.
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:51.040]   We thank them so much for their support.
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:54.000]   Audible wishes you and yours happy, happy holidays.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.840]   I also want to mention-
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.560]   Great gift for the holidays, actually.
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:58.560]   It is.
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:05:59.920]   You know what else is a great gift?
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:03.920]   I'm going to send you a, I'm going to send John.
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:05.440]   I'm going to send you this.
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:09.160]   A $100 gift certificate to Scottie Vest.
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:11.160]   I'm going to send one to you two, Jason.
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.160]   What?
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.160]   We're a hundred bucks.
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:15.880]   Yeah, I know you need the money.
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:18.000]   That's like a thousand shares of AMD stock.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.520]   I want to show you.
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:21.520]   What?
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:22.520]   What?
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:23.520]   I talked to-
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:26.520]   It's like everything's falling over over there.
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:29.520]   It fell off the ball.
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:33.200]   No, my hat rack fell over because I pulled my jacket over.
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.200]   I want to show you.
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:38.640]   Now, the quantum jacket, they're going to have a one-day secret sale for Twits.
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:39.960]   You're not going to see anything about this on the site.

[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:14.200]   I love this.
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:16.880]   Why don't you just get us a tiny URL and make it a lot easier for everybody?
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:17.880]   That is the tiny URL.
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:19.520]   tr.im/quantum1.
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:20.520]   Oh.
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:22.960]   I don't know how I can get more tiny than that.
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:24.880]   It's got 28 pockets in it.
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:25.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:26.880]   So cool.
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:27.880]   Now, here's the deal.
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:28.880]   Listen.
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:29.880]   You've fed off my gadgets.
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:30.880]   Yeah, it's normally $250.
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:34.480]   We're going to cut $75 off, but just today only.
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.480]   Okay?
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:36.480]   Here's the coupon code.
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:37.480]   Q5.
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:41.760]   John's doing it.
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:44.760]   Twit Q5 is the coupon code and then hit redeem.
[01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:45.960]   Free ground shipping.

[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:54.520]   You're going to have like 14 and a half hours to order this.
[01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:57.840]   And if you're listening to this twit on Tuesday, you should listen to it on Monday from now
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:58.840]   on.
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:01.840]   You guaranteed delivery by Christmas.
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:03.840]   Actually, the sale ends.
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:06.680]   Yeah, it's not going to sale on Monday, $11.59 Pacific time.
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:07.680]   $11.59.
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:08.760]   You know what you do?
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:15.400]   You get it one of these jackets and you put like a nice MP3 player in there with an audible
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:17.120]   gift card and you got a perfect gift.
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:18.120]   Oh, man.
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:19.120]   Geeks love the Scotty Vesta.
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:20.120]   Action.
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:21.120]   You got that under the tray?
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:24.680]   I mean, I'm wearing Scotty Vesta pants, the jacket.
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:25.680]   The bacon's card is not Scotty Vesta.
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:27.680]   What are the jackets the wrong size?
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:28.680]   That's what it's.
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:29.680]   20 pockets, you say.
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:33.440]   You know, the cool thing about Scotty Vesta, a really good customer service.
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:34.640]   You call them.
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:37.000]   We had somebody buy the twit hoodie.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.480]   The zipper was broken.
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:40.120]   They send you a box to send it back.
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.680]   I mean, they're very serious about getting this.
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:42.680]   That's the way it's binding.
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:43.680]   I don't have time to do it.
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:45.680]   So it's easy to return because that's what I mean.
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:47.160]   No, I agree with you.
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:52.160]   And companies like Zappos and Scotty Vesta really reinvented customer service.
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:54.760]   And that's what you got to do nowadays if you're going to compete.
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:56.120]   I bought my shoots on Zappos.
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.120]   Oh, me too.
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.120]   I love them.
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.120]   I could buy a jacket.
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:00.120]   Throw me one.
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:01.120]   It's going to be about signature system.
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:04.640]   Oh, the signature system is probably what you want because that's the quantum jacket
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.640]   and the fleece underneath.
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.760]   So if you go skiing or whatever, you put the two on.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:08.760]   And it's black.
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:09.760]   I can wear that.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:10.760]   Oh, it's beautiful.
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:11.760]   Beautiful.
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:12.760]   You're going to love it.
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:13.760]   So there you go.
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:16.040]   I'm just going to throw that in as an extra value proposition.
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.640]   The, I don't know why I said that.
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:18.640]   That's just.
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:19.640]   Boy, that was bad.
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:23.840]   I think I used to do an industrial advertising for HP.
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:25.760]   And I think I learned it there.
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:27.960]   It's your value proposition.
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.760]   Just use the coupon code.
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:30.760]   Ready?
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:33.440]   So, Twit Q5.
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:40.200]   It's only good through Monday, December 15th at ends at midnight.
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:41.200]   Okay.
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:43.280]   So just, you know, midnight Pacific.
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.280]   Okay.
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:50.760]   So you got to midnight Pacific on Monday to do this Twit Q5 and John and Jason, I'm going
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:54.160]   to send you that he gave me some gift certificates to give to the Twit.
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:55.400]   So I'm going to send you those gift certificates.
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:58.440]   Well, Charum saying that Scutty Vast's site is down.
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:09:59.920]   We've broken them.
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:00.920]   There is a Twit effect.
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:01.920]   It doesn't take much.
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:02.920]   In effect.
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:03.920]   We broke.
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:07.720]   Well, we got almost, as I have 4,234 people watching on the video and if half of them go
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:09.840]   there all at once it's it, it's over.
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:10.840]   Well.
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:11.840]   So that's what happens.
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:14.800]   I see it's got to have a fat, I'm a 2,000 people in it.
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:15.800]   It's ridiculous.
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:16.960]   It's pretty amazing, isn't it?
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:17.960]   It's so much fun.
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:19.480]   Can we give these coupons to the audience?
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:20.760]   Like in the IRC room or something?
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:22.080]   How do we do that?
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:25.600]   You just pick one randomly who just said something intelligent.
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:26.840]   I have an idea.
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:27.840]   What?
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:29.840]   Give away Jason's Tesla.
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.840]   I'm not just mean.
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:35.120]   I've been waiting for you to do something like that, John.
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:40.200]   I'm thinking about getting a second money, giving it away on Mahalo if we're in a contest.
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:44.440]   Would it be worth the company folds?
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:46.240]   Oh, please.
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:49.000]   150 electric cars on the road.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.560]   It's like nobody's done that in over 10 years.
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:53.360]   Can you cut them a break, John?
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:54.920]   Well, we are talking about this.
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:56.920]   They're asking for 400 million, not from TARP.
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:58.920]   We should make this really clear.
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:10:59.920]   Yeah, this is because--
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:01.640]   All part of energy loans, yeah.
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:02.640]   Right.
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:03.640]   Was it Randall Strass?
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:04.640]   I'm very happy for this.
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:06.240]   Was it Randall Strass who wrote the hit piece on them?
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:08.240]   Yeah, I'm writing a spell.
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:10.040]   I like your-- what do you call it?
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:11.040]   A fist?
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:12.040]   Fisking.
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:13.040]   Fisking.
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.040]   Fisking.
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:19.880]   It's a term that means line by line rebuttal that came out of blogging in the UK because
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:22.840]   there was a guy from something Fisk who you can look it up on.
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:24.080]   I just love that idea.
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:27.720]   Do you fist his article basically pasting line by line in a new--
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.680]   You said the thing that it's a concept car.
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:33.640]   And I'm like, OK, a concept car is something they show it at auto show that may or may
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:34.640]   not become available.
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:35.800]   They've delivered over 100 of these.
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:38.200]   That's libel, saying that.
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:40.920]   And he's saying it's not libel.
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:41.920]   Is it slam?
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:47.040]   And he said that technology is something woefully inadequate or something like that.
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.440]   It's like, I'm driving this car.
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.840]   It's not a concept car.
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.280]   And it goes over 200 miles.
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:53.280]   And it goes 0 to 60 in 3.9 seconds.
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.280]   It's woefully inadequate.
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:57.720]   Here's a question I have for you, Jason, because I'm thinking about this coupe.
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:00.520]   60,000 they say maybe for the coupe, right?
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:01.520]   Right.
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:02.520]   Foredoor.
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:04.160]   I like the idea of an electric car.
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:07.600]   Look, you're not going to make the money back at fuel savings on a $60,000 car.
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:08.600]   Certainly not.
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:09.600]   2,000 a year.
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:10.600]   You come about to sit in, Leo.
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:11.600]   Not the coupe.
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:12.600]   Sit in.
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:13.600]   Yeah.
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:15.040]   But I want to support it like you.
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:17.560]   I think it's a good thing to kind of seat it if you can afford it.
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:19.880]   And it is a great thing to do is to drive an electric car.
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:22.680]   And boy, if you ever saw the documentary, Who Killed the Electric Car?
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:23.680]   Do you ever see that, Sarah?
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:25.240]   Who Killed the Electric Car?
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:26.240]   Really dramatic.
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:27.880]   Must see it's on Netflix.
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:28.880]   Oh, no.
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:33.000]   Oh, it just really breaks your heart because sad.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   Who was it?
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000]   GM had an electric car.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   They killed it.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000]   The EV1.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000]   The EV1.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000]   And really, it's suspect.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000]   The whole thing is suspect.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000]   They could have been making these things.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.640]   Well, the question is why they grind them all up.
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:44.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:45.640]   They didn't want people to see it.
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:46.640]   And you know what?
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:49.480]   There's a rumor going around.
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:54.200]   I thought I have any inside information that Tesla is working with Mercedes in the smart
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:55.200]   car.
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:56.200]   And I just--
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:58.120]   Oh, I'd love an electric smart car.
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:04.120]   I just posted in the chat room a picture taken from outside the Tesla store that shows
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:07.640]   a smart car with no tailpipe.
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:10.640]   I would-- you know, I've ordered a smart car for my daughter.
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:12.680]   They-- for 99 bucks, you can pre-order.
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:16.440]   I think if you take a hard day, if you hit a curb, the tailpipe falls off anyway.
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:17.440]   Yeah.
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:19.440]   You're seeing a lot of people sitting in the car.
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:22.600]   Leo, you do not want to be driving around a smart car.
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:23.600]   All right.
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:24.600]   There's a whole debate on boy.
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.400]   They're really-- you know, as soon as I said, I did this.
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:30.120]   And it only cost me 99 bucks to get on the list.
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:31.120]   But I'm listening.
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:34.000]   That looks-- so there's no tailpipe on that.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.560]   But that could be photoshopped out.
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:36.560]   It's not.
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:37.560]   It's a whole bunch of reports.
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:38.560]   But anyway, the point is--
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:40.560]   I would buy that so fast.
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:43.560]   I'll appreciate all the portion of this sooner rather than later.
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:44.560]   So--
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:46.040]   And the mini's got the mini for $850 a month or something.
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:47.040]   So here's the question, Jason.
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:50.760]   We know I'm not going to make my money back as savings on gas.
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.640]   But will it last 10 years at least?
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:53.640]   I mean, that's the thing.
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:54.640]   I don't mind spending 60 grand in a car--
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:56.440]   They're less more.
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:59.320]   Because there's no engine in these other parts.
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:02.000]   So-- and they just keep upgrading the software and they take the batteries out.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.960]   So these things could last a long time.
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:06.640]   How long is the-- how long are the batteries last?
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:09.920]   Actually, that's something people don't really know because there hasn't been really real
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:11.120]   world tests yet.
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:13.400]   You would buy-- you're looking at buying a Prius.
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.720]   Why wouldn't you buy an electric?
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:18.640]   Well, the Tesla's a little out of my price range.
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:19.640]   Slightly.
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:22.840]   I've done the math and it just looks like I'm not getting a Tesla for this math.
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:23.720]   Yeah, I guess you're right.
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:24.880]   But--
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.240]   Would you, if you could?
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:27.000]   Yes.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:27.840]   100%.
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:28.920]   I'd buy it in a hot net.
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:31.440]   Or, you know, a biodiesel type of a thing?
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:34.000]   So do they have a chance of getting--
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.280]   I don't know about biodiesel.
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:37.240]   There's some question marks about biodiesel.
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:37.600]   Well--
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:40.000]   You're not going to be able to buy a car that doesn't have batteries in it
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:40.920]   in another five years.
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:43.320]   Every single one will have batteries in it for the first 50 to 100--
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:45.080]   They'll be hybrid at least.
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:48.440]   And they'll be like extended range vehicles, you know, like first 100.
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:50.280]   You plug it in, you know, and whatever.
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:52.280]   So whether you want it or not, it's coming.
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:53.760]   It just depends on how soon you want to get--
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:54.760]   I don't know of any cars right now.
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:56.320]   You can buy without a battery.
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:57.120]   Well, wow.
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:58.520]   This is battery.
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:14:59.160]   Good point.
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:00.160]   All right, battery.
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:01.680]   I got you up at the gallon.
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:03.640]   Battery powered.
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:07.200]   By the way, talking about technicalities, you know, talking about giving these guys
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:08.480]   some sort of a break.
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:11.720]   I mean, what part of the Tesla cars actually made in the United States
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:13.200]   the thing is assembled in England?
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:13.680]   Oh, really?
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:16.720]   Well, actually, that's an interesting thing that goes back to my audible suggestion
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:23.560]   earlier, John, which is there's a U-curve of where money is made in production of stuff.
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:24.560]   And it really is.
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:27.560]   Like if you look at the iPod, the margin of the people who make the iPod in China is
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:28.880]   like low single digits.
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:33.320]   The iPod, the selling of it here in the United States and the selling of the software and
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:36.920]   stuff like that, i.e., MP3, is incredibly high margin.
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:38.080]   All that money is captured here.
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:42.480]   So what you want to do is move the low margin businesses offshore and keep the high margin
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:43.480]   ones here.
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:48.480]   So what you want to do is move the low margin businesses on the other side of the market.
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:53.480]   And then you want to move the low margin businesses on the other side of the market.
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:56.480]   And then you want to move the low margin.
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:58.480]   So you want to move the low margin.
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:00.480]   So you want to move the low margin.
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:01.480]   So you want to move the low margin.

[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:18.480]   So you want to move the low margin.
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:19.480]   So you want to move the low margin.
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:20.480]   So you want to move the low margin.
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:21.480]   So you want to move the low margin.
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:22.480]   So you want to move the low margin.
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:23.480]   So you want to move the low margin.
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:24.480]   So you want to move the low margin.
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:25.480]   So you want to move the low margin.
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:26.480]   So you want to move the low margin.
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:27.480]   So you want to move the low margin.
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:28.480]   So you want to move the low margin.
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:29.480]   So you want to move the low margin.
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:30.480]   So you want to move the low margin.
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:31.480]   So you want to move the low margin.
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:32.480]   So you want to move the low margin.
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:33.480]   So you want to move the low margin.
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:34.480]   So you want to move the low margin.
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:35.480]   So you want to move the low margin.
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:41.480]   And you know, the weather changed and they went away.
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:42.480]   I just like the story.
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:44.480]   I just like saying Raspberry Crazy Ants.
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:46.480]   This is a very good year for Apple.
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:51.480]   Apple looks like almost got to double digits in market share, almost up to 10% market share.
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:52.480]   They made a lot of money.
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:18:00.480]   The iPod, the iPhone 2G, 3G rather outsold the first generation iPhone significantly,
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:04.480]   giving it significant market share, making it the number two smartphone
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:08.480]   in the business on its way to being the number one smartphone, a very good year for Apple.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:12.480]   Not such a good year for many of the other PC manufacturers, however.
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:15.480]   Also a good year for information loss.
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:22.480]   The Bank of New York, for instance, announced it had lost data from 4.5 million clients.
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:25.480]   No personal information gone.
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:27.480]   It was a good one.
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:30.480]   Aren't they losing information on the entire public of Great Britain?
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:31.480]   Great Britain.
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:32.480]   That's right.
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:35.480]   There's another good story.
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:40.480]   I guess the big story of the year, and I'm saving the worst or best for last,
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:45.480]   depending on your point of view, is the micro-hoo saga, which began really like in March
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:47.480]   when Microsoft made the bid for Yahoo!
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:49.480]   Yahoo! Turn it down saying we're worth more.
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:50.480]   Micro-hoo?
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:51.480]   Micro-hoo!
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:53.480]   That's the first time I've heard of that.
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:55.480]   That's the donkey of the year, boy.
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:57.480]   Donkey of the year, Jerry Yang.
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:58.480]   Yaw!
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:18:59.480]   Hee-haw!

[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:51.480]   Are you still twitting?
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:54.480]   I'll be up in a minute, honey!
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:56.480]   She probably got dinner upstairs.
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:58.480]   So, we're down to my basement.
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:25:59.480]   Many people don't know that.
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:02.480]   This whole operation is just down to my basement.
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:04.480]   It's weird, actually.
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:07.480]   I'm going to get lights on those back stairs.
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:08.480]   I know it's a little scary going down there.
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:10.480]   What about that musty smell?
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:11.480]   I can't- I tried.
[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:12.480]   I can't do anything about that.
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:13.480]   No, yeah.
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:15.480]   Some say a body was buried here, but I don't think so.
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:17.480]   It's- you know, window would be so nice.
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:18.480]   It's a basement.
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:19.480]   There's no windows.
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:21.480]   I can tell you that Patrick Norton hasn't been on the show before.
[01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:22.480]   He feels a little uncomfortable.
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:23.480]   Maybe it's Patrick.
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:27.480]   You know, I don't remember him leaving after that last time he was here.
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:29.480]   Ah, Patrick's dead in here somewhere.
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:30.480]   Oh, man.
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:31.480]   God, that's what that is.
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:33.480]   There was a little bit of a funk.
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:34.480]   Mustiness.
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:41.480]   So, apparently, I mean, you know, it's illegal to drive with a cell phone to you, but I see people do it every day in California then didn't do anything.
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:43.480]   I'm guilty of that.
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:45.480]   Did you get- have you got a ticket?
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:46.480]   No.
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:49.480]   I have been talking on the phone, seen a cop, and said, "Hold on," and dropped the phone.
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:51.480]   And then picked it back up again.
[01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:53.480]   Yeah, I've done that, too, Jason.
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:55.480]   I've also done the speaker phone, you know, put it on spit.
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:27:00.480]   I mean, I usually have my headset with it, but sometimes I use that jawbone, but something's a battery runs out or something.
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:01.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:02.480]   Yeah, I'm not trying to do it on purpose.
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:04.480]   I just kind of forget.
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:05.480]   It's hard to forget.
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:06.480]   You just cut it back.
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:07.480]   I got the first time in the Tesla.
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:12.480]   I can't to use the loud speaker that's built into most of these phones and just click on that.
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:13.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:19.480]   There is no law, though, against clicking while you're driving yet.
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:20.480]   You could do a video.
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:21.480]   I've done that.
[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:25.480]   What would happen if the guy said, "Well, you said I'm not holding it to my ear.
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:26.480]   I'm just videoing you off."
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:27.480]   Well, though, what I did was-
[01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:29.480]   Is it texting not-
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:30.480]   That's illegal.
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:31.480]   You can't type it on.
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:33.480]   You can't be distracted while driving.
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:34.480]   So they'll get you frickin'-
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:37.480]   I'm a quick videoing is a little borderline-
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:38.480]   I'm waiting.
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:40.480]   I've done it with my camera.
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:45.480]   I usually carry camera and I'll flip it on video and I see some maniac driving across the road
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:46.480]   and I'll video him.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:53.480]   Just because I figure maybe he gets into a pile up, I'll have a pretty cool YouTube video.
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:55.480]   You keep hoping, John.
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:57.480]   Citizens are rapped.
[01:27:57.480 --> 01:27:58.480]   Come on, crash.
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:27:59.480]   You crash.
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:02.480]   The real Dvorak/I'm trying to get members.
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:03.480]   Damn, I'm not gonna be that bad.
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:04.480]   The real Dvorak.
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:06.480]   That's what was that again, Jason?
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:07.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:08.480]   The real Dvorak.
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:09.480]   Yeah, people are on Twitter.
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:10.480]   They're on Twitter.
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:11.480]   Let's do a Twitter point to get out of here.
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:13.480]   This was also, by the way, the year of the Twitter.
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:14.480]   There's no question about it.
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:15.480]   Twitter was really took off to see it.
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:21.480]   Twitter started to run my life this year and I can't get it back.
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:22.480]   Are you a Twitter-holic?
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:23.480]   Yeah.
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:26.480]   I've been using Friend Feed a lot as a gateway to Russia.
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:27.480]   It's because you hate Twitter.
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:28.480]   I do hate Twitter.
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:29.480]   We brought this up last week.
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:30.480]   You don't hate Twitter.
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:31.480]   I don't hate- I love Twitter.
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:37.480]   I love hate- I hate the fact that they're named Twitter, which could- I met somebody last night at dinner
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:38.480]   and he said, "Twit?
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:39.480]   Is that Twitter?"
[01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:40.480]   And I said, "No."
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:41.480]   You must get that a lot.
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:44.480]   I get- now there's this new site called- Wait, wait, wait, back up.
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:46.480]   What do you mean at dinner?
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:47.480]   At your house?
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:50.480]   Yeah, we invite bombs in for dinner and the guy-
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:52.480]   Can you tell me, "Wait, let me get this straight."
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:54.480]   Somebody came to your house and said- What do you mean?
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:55.480]   You were eating dinner.
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:57.480]   You didn't know the difference.
[01:28:57.480 --> 01:28:59.480]   That's my point.
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:02.480]   My mother thinks I own Twitter.
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:04.480]   Now there's this new site called Twit Blogs.
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:06.480]   I don't even want to give them a plug because it's Twit Blogs.
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:08.480]   It looks just like our logo.
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:09.480]   It's Twitter.
[01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:10.480]   Has nothing to do with Twit.
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:11.480]   What is it?
[01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:13.480]   It's a blog for Twitter users.
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:14.480]   That's what- What?
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:15.480]   I think these- What?
[01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:16.480]   You're looking at it from the wrong side.
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:20.480]   This is giving you more publicity than they're getting from the other way around.
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:22.480]   I think this is a positive thing.
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:25.480]   I'm going to France, the hell with it.
[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:26.480]   That's it.
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:27.480]   It's over.
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:31.480]   Don't forget to get your free book from Audible, Audible.com/Twit33.
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:35.480]   Don't forget Twit's Q5 is the coupon code for the Scott Evest.
[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:39.480]   Sarah Lane is Sarah Lane with an H on Twitter.
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:40.480]   That's correct, Leo.
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:43.480]   John C. Devorak is the real Devorak on Twitter.
[01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:47.480]   But go to channeldevorak.com to get my real stuff.
[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:49.480]   Everything's on there, including your tweets.
[01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:50.480]   Yeah.
[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:52.480]   They're not Twits, they're Tweets.
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:53.480]   Whatever.
[01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:54.480]   We're Twits.
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:55.480]   They're Tweets.
[01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:57.480]   I don't think that's too hard.
[01:29:57.480 --> 01:29:59.480]   What's so complicated about that?
[01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:00.480]   And Twits.
[01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:01.480]   Come on.
[01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:03.480]   I'm going to just start saying, "Yeah, I own Twitter."
[01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:04.480]   From now on, what's somebody asking me that?
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:05.480]   Go for it.
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:06.480]   Yeah, I started Twitter.
[01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:07.480]   Yeah, sorry.
[01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:08.480]   What did I say?
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:09.480]   Like, I spun it off?
[01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:10.480]   Yeah, it was just been out.
[01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:11.480]   Yeah.
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:12.480]   Yeah.
[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:13.480]   Perfect.
[01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:14.480]   It came out of Twit Labs.
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:15.480]   Twit Labs, we did it a little thing.
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:17.480]   We didn't really think it was very valuable.
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:18.480]   We gave it to Evan.
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:19.480]   We said, "Come on, you could develop it.
[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:20.480]   We're fine with that."
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:21.480]   We're so awesome.
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:24.480]   It's like a Twitter power user spinoff.
[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:26.480]   We don't, we don't, don't any of the liabilities.
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:29.480]   But if they make any money, we get like half of it.
[01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:30.480]   Absolutely.
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:33.480]   Jason Calicanis is Jason Calicanis on Twitter.
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:34.480]   Or are you just Calicanis?
[01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:35.480]   Jason Calicanis.
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:36.480]   You're the full name.
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:37.480]   Me, me too.
[01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:39.480]   But I don't really care because I hate it.
[01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:41.800]   Oh yeah, you hate Twitter.
[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:43.560]   You just hate it so much.
[01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:47.480]   You don't ever look at how many followers you're getting every day, ever.
[01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:48.480]   Every day.
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:49.480]   Every day.
[01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:54.960]   It's a big plug if I could if people at midnight or 1 a.m. Pacific time wake yourself up and
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:57.160]   come see Project A at Mahalo.com.
[01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:58.160]   How would they get that?
[01:30:58.160 --> 01:30:59.160]   How would they get there?
[01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:00.160]   Just go to Mahalo.com.
[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:01.680]   We're going to open the doors at 1 a.m.
[01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:06.200]   And the reason we're not saying anything is because it's embargoed till midnight and
[01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:09.680]   we just, because we do this live in front of a live audience at live.twit.tv.
[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:11.200]   I'll talk about it enough, Tom.
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:13.680]   Yeah, we'll have you back and you can explain it all.
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:15.000]   Won't be next week because I am out of here.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.280]   We're going to France next week.
[01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:23.400]   A very special Twit prerecorded in front of a live audience with John Hodgman.
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:27.520]   I'm a PC and his buddy, Jonathan Colton of CodeMonkey fame.
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:29.880]   It's a special holiday edition.
[01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:31.680]   The Bacon Scarf edition.
[01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:34.080]   Look for it on your feed.
[01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:37.920]   If you're not yet subscribing to Twit, make sure you go to iTunes and type in Twit.
[01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:41.680]   You won't find, you'll find about 800 Twitter applications.
[01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:45.720]   And then in the podcast section, you'll find our shows including this week in Tech, the
[01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:47.520]   weekly news roundup.
[01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:50.400]   Subscribe to it because you definitely want next week's show.
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:51.760]   It's a KEEPA.
[01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:56.960]   I think the name is going to be a 10 ferret night, something like that.
[01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:59.000]   And then the following week, we're going to do a best oven.
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:04.440]   Again, don't forget, if you've got a favorite Twit memory from the last year to send it
[01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:08.520]   to Tony at Twit.tv, it would be helpful if you could tell us the show number and time.
[01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:09.520]   But if you can't, that's okay.
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:11.080]   We are looking for great moments.
[01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:12.080]   And we're going to do Jason.
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:14.480]   I really am going to push Tony to do that.
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:16.480]   The Mone Mone montage.
[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:17.720]   You don't need to have Tony do it.
[01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:20.960]   All you have to do is ask the Twitter army like they make all these crazy videos.
[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:21.960]   Oh, one of my videos.
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:22.960]   You're right.
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:23.960]   Audience can make it.
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:25.560]   They just sent somebody post the MP3 file.
[01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:26.560]   Twitter it to me and Leo.
[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:27.560]   No, that's incredible.
[01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:28.560]   Yeah.
[01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:32.440]   And make sure to send me a copy because I can use it on my tech five.
[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:34.440]   Go to the news.
[01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:38.480]   You do want to get just to one totally up to war act like being like, oh, come on.
[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:40.480]   It'll ever happen.
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:43.520]   No, we wouldn't do that.
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:46.280]   What's the dueling banjo thing from?
[01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:49.480]   Like the right versus the war act.
[01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:50.480]   Sorry.
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:51.480]   All right.
[01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:56.240]   So the people who do the funniest montages, whatever you feel like, I love the dueling
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:58.040]   banjo.
[01:32:58.040 --> 01:32:59.160]   The only thing you want to do, just send them.
[01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:05.160]   You can email it to totony@twit.tv and we'll include it in our montage.
[01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:08.240]   And I have the source audio for the shows, but it's okay if you, you know, you could
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:09.880]   download them at Twit.tv.
[01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:11.480]   All of them are there.
[01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:12.480]   Sarah, thank you for being here.
[01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:13.480]   We appreciate your coming up.
[01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:15.360]   John C. Devorek have a great holiday.
[01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:16.480]   Same to you guys.
[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:18.840]   You got any plans to travel for Christmas or going up to?
[01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:23.440]   I'm going to go up to Washington where it's snowing as we speak and probably have a white
[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:24.440]   Christmas.
[01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:25.440]   Hopefully they get out of there.
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:26.440]   Awesome.
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:29.040]   Jason, you're going to stay in Lachain-less.
[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:30.040]   Huh?
[01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:31.040]   What a Brooklyn.
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:32.040]   Brooklyn.
[01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:34.040]   That's the place to be in Brooklyn.
[01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:35.040]   You got a bar.
[01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:36.040]   I got a bar.
[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:37.840]   You got to see the spread my mom puts out.
[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:38.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:39.840]   Does she make the Sunday gravy?
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:40.840]   I got a bar.
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:41.840]   I got the gravy.
[01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:42.840]   Oh, I like that.
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:43.840]   It's so good.
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:44.840]   Fantastic.
[01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:47.000]   And make a sandwich.
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.480]   So the Baba Gull.
[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:51.560]   So actually, you know who Malakot?
[01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:52.560]   You know who's there?
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:53.880]   Also, that's where Hajman and Colton are.
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:55.880]   So say hi to them.
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:34:00.320]   And that heavy breathing is Sarah Lane.
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:01.960]   She's getting excited with the Baba Gull.
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:02.960]   You know what?
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:03.960]   That was my stomach.
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:04.960]   I'm not even kidding.
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:06.800]   My stomach is autably growling.
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:08.400]   She needs an audible.
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:09.400]   Audible.
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:13.560]   Another twist is in the cam.
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:25.840]   Yeah, Jason, I will send you and John.
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:28.640]   And a $100 gift certificate.
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:29.640]   Oh, it went up.
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:30.640]   But with 75.
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:31.640]   Now it's 100 bucks.
[01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:32.640]   Yeah, it was always 100.
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:37.560]   I think it's gone to now 2,000 shares of AMD.
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:40.000]   Thank you guys.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.160]   I really appreciate it.
[01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:42.160]   Really fun.
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:43.320]   We'll talk to you again in 2000.
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:45.320]   So we're completely collapsed.
[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:46.320]   So here's the deal.
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:47.320]   I'm just trying to get the thing off.
[01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:51.320]   But I have a hell of a time when blue screens forget it.
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:52.800]   I'm killing you.
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:55.040]   (laughing)
