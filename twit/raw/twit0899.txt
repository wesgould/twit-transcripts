[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480]   It's time for TWIT this week in tech.
[00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.560]   Ladies and gentlemen, I am the chief TWIT.
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.360]   I'm the chief TWIT now, and joining me,
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.640]   we're Philip Elmer DeWitt from PED30.com,
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.600]   Devendra Hardawar from Engadget,
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.720]   and from our own Floss Weekly and the Linux Journal
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.680]   and many places, Doc Searles.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.120]   Lots to talk about.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.600]   Elon, what's going on at Twitter,
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.600]   Apple's incredible earnings.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.840]   Here's an interesting question I want to ask these guys.
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.080]   Do you think the tech market is dumping
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.320]   just because they did so much in COVID
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.400]   and now it's a recovery?
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.360]   I don't know, we'll find out.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.880]   We'll talk about that.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.320]   Plus, an RIP for a legend in computing
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.240]   that nobody's ever heard of.
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.240]   But we will make sure you've heard of her
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.000]   when we do the show next on TWIT.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.280]   (electronic music)
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.080]   - Podcasts you love.

[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.160]   (electronic music)

[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.200]   And you know what?
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.000]   I've known you guys for almost all that time.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.480]   Let's say hello to Doc Searles.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.000]   He is the host of the Floss Weekly Show,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.960]   our free Libre and open source software show.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.400]   I've known Doc forever and ever,
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.120]   the co-author of the Clue Train Manifesto,
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.760]   one of the smartest guys out there.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.200]   Doc.Searles.com.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.840]   Great to see you, Doc.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.920]   - Good to see you too.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.680]   I think my reputation exceeds me if you put it that way.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.520]   - Oh, no, no.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.680]   And I've been trying to get you on the show for some time,
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.520]   but our schedules have not worked.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.280]   But I'm so glad to have you here.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.120]   - Me too.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.240]   - Great to have you.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.560]   You were the first person I called
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.240]   when we thought we need to get a host on Floss Weekly,
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.400]   and you were the first person I called.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.160]   And you have taken that show to the next level
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.400]   with some of the best guests ever,
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.040]   talking about the most important topics in open source.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.200]   We've got a few today, as a matter of fact.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.000]   But I also want to say hello to Devinder Hardwar.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.120]   He's a senior editor at Engadget,
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.120]   also long time Twit, I can't say Twitter,
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.160]   Twitter guy.
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.000]   (laughing)
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.920]   - I will say also longer time listener too,
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.360]   because I do remember when you started this whole thing, Leo,
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.720]   'cause I was coming off of being a fan of you on TwitTV
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.240]   and everything, the tech TV and everything.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.520]   - You always mention that,
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.360]   and you make me blush every time.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.320]   - I follow the journey.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.160]   - You also make me feel extremely old.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.560]   - I also want to say, it is, yeah,
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.440]   it is also nice to feel like the youngin
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.760]   in a discussion once again.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.600]   (laughing)
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.920]   'Cause I'm not getting that anymore.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.360]   - You're not at Engadget anymore.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.320]   No, there's a lot of, you know, this was,
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.160]   they always said, you know,
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.120]   when the cops seem like they're younger than you,
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.040]   then you know you're old.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.240]   And the cops are like, they're like teenagers.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.080]   Who are these people?
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.920]   - Oh yeah, absolutely.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.920]   - They're teenagers now.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.800]   He is a teenager in spirit, Mr. Philip Elmer DeWitt,
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.440]   wearing his Kangol cap 'cause he's so hip, P-E-D 30.com.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.600]   - 'Cause I'm so bald.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.480]   (laughing)
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.600]   - Keeping the head warm.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.160]   He is just down the road from my mom.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.560]   So wave at her in Cranston.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.320]   Good to have you on the show again.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.200]   - Great to see you.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.360]   - Yeah.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.880]   I think Philip's been on our show
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.960]   since you were with Fortune, I think.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.320]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.600]   I don't think we did it when I was at Time.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.880]   - I feel like we did, but maybe not.
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.520]   You know, it's easy to find out when you go to twit.tv.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.360]   Twit.tv.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.800]   Dot TV.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.920]   You can search for somebody's name.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.160]   Oops, if you do it right, you can search for somebody.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.280]   There we go.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.200]   Get in the search, Elmer.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.360]   - I love this feature, by the way.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.520]   - And then you'll find them.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.400]   You click their name, and then,
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.960]   this is the feature, view appearances.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.680]   So I can see every time you've appeared on our show.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.400]   By the way, the database is churning,
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.520]   so it's been a while here.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.600]   Let's go back in time.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.760]   I can find your first appearance was 2014.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.440]   No, that doesn't seem right, but maybe so.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.360]   Eight years.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.160]   Oh, and look who was on with you.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.880]   Nilay Patel.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.440]   I don't know who that other guy is.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.480]   - What a great piece he wrote about moderation.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.760]   - Okay, let's talk about that.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.520]   That was the best piece, wasn't it?
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.360]   Welcome to Hell, Elon.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.360]   I think, I mean, many, many things have been written
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.560]   about Elon Musk buying Twitter.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.360]   Who would have thought that, by the way, six months ago?
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.840]   He fought it tooth and nail.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.520]   He did not want to buy Twitter, right?
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.440]   - His joke went too far.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.960]   - Well, he did, and then changed his mind.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.400]   - Well, he did, like, for five minutes,
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.920]   agreed to it without any due diligence,
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.360]   and then almost instantly, back in April,
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.480]   was writing his lawyer saying,
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.040]   "Can we hold off on this?"
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.200]   His excuse then was, "Putin's gonna speak,
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.880]   "and I don't wanna own Twitter during World War III."
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.400]   - This is what happens when the troll
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.560]   faces their consequences.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.320]   It's a beautiful thing to see.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:55.200]   - But I think maybe even Elon underestimated the consequences,
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.520]   and now that he owns Twitter, it's gonna get real,
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.840]   as the kids say.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.320]   Nilay's piece, Welcome to Hell, Elon, subtitled,
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.160]   "You break it, you buy it."
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:32.600]   And I'm sure is doing very well.
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:33.920]   Yeah, and he has good sources.
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.720]   But it's one of those.
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.960]   People who in the know have said--
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:39.640]   Yeah.
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:40.520]   I mean, everything's a mess.
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:44.280]   Look at the people who are the jokers who are in front
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.240]   of the Twitter office, right?
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.320]   And CNBC and so many people.
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:52.560]   Raul Lingoma, which is a very poor Reddit joke
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:56.080]   that I am not going to explain.
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:59.160]   One thing is not a rumor.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:04.120]   Its certainty is if he has pissed off so many people who
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:07.360]   work for him, who work for the company,
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:09.920]   that's going to turn into a lot of results that
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:11.280]   are some of them competing.
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:18.760]   I mean, it's going to be a fabulously wide range of results
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:20.520]   that none of which he can control.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:21.040]   Yeah.
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:21.880]   That'll be really interesting.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.280]   And there's been a lot of people who hate him.
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:25.880]   There will be a lot of great engineers on the street.
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:26.480]   Exactly.
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:27.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.720]   That's the good news.
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:31.720]   I have heard, though, and I don't-- again,
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.640]   I have heard that there was a lot of deadwood at Twitter.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:36.920]   7,500 employees--
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:41.200]   he had said at 1.1 to fire 75%.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:44.600]   Then he backed down and said, well, when he went to Twitter,
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:47.560]   he said, ah, I'm not going to fire 75%.
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:48.920]   We don't know what he's going to do.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:49.880]   Just 7,500.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.480]   We don't know what he's going to do.
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:53.760]   How many people could you--
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:56.840]   how many engineers would you need to run Twitter?
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:59.040]   Engineers, not much.
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:02.640]   A good team, 2,500 people maybe.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:04.360]   Trust and safety?
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:05.720]   Thousands.
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.080]   Moderation?
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:07.840]   Thousands.
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:08.560]   Yeah, a zillion.
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:09.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.760]   Remember when, I mean, in the early days of Twitter,
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:15.960]   the failed whale was constant almost.
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.520]   Well, credit to Facebook.
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.160]   That didn't crash very much.
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:21.440]   There are some good engineers that at least made the place run.
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:24.000]   You don't see the fail whale much anymore, if at all.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.800]   No, no.
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.880]   Remember Leah Culver, who wrote a Twitter clone called
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:29.920]   Pounds, which I personally thought was better than Twitter,
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:31.360]   loved it, failed?
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:32.680]   She works at Twitter.
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:37.640]   And here she is, her tweet, holding your print out.
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:38.120]   Oh.
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:39.560]   So I don't know.
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:40.840]   Is she joking?
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:42.800]   Is she telling the truth?
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.200]   That's pretty thin pile.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:44.960]   I don't know.
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:49.040]   And notice this was July 26th.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.280]   I don't know.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:55.200]   Well, Leah, I think you might have some trouble with the Elon.
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.880]   She does-- let me see in her bio.
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:01.360]   I think she says she does Twitter spaces, yeah.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.320]   And iOS Twitter.
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:06.640]   So she's their iOS coder.
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.840]   Off the co-author of OAuth and OMBED.
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:10.160]   She's-- Leah's great.
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:14.360]   I don't know.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:18.320]   Maybe another great engineer on the beach, ready?
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:21.760]   Today, Elon deleted the tweet he posted earlier today,
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.760]   saying, espousing, I don't even want
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:28.240]   to repeat the lame-ass conspiracy theory from an even more
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:33.520]   lame-ass right-wing rag that Paul Pelosi
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:37.160]   was inebriated when he got attacked with a hammer, which,
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:40.640]   even if true, so what?
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:43.080]   It was an attempt to assassinate the speaker of the house,
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:46.720]   the number three in line for the presidency--
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:48.200]   two, I guess, if you include the president.
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:50.120]   Don't include the president.
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:52.920]   That's a bigger story than I think he even got coverage.
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.840]   That's an assassination attempt.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:55.360]   Yeah.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:57.320]   It was not the leading story in the New York Times.
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.120]   It was below the fold.
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:01.440]   Below the fold.
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:02.040]   What's happening?
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:05.400]   Unbelievable.
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:08.760]   Musk shared an article that was just garbage
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.680]   and said there is a tiny possibility.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.800]   There might be more than this story than meets the eye.
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:15.960]   That's a very trollish thing to say.
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:17.880]   Well, I don't know, but I hear--
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:19.880]   Yeah.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:21.560]   Responding to Hillary Clinton, by the way,
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:25.200]   who maybe has a little information about what's going on
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:25.800]   to you.
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:28.800]   Oh.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:29.760]   All right.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.240]   Enough.
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:32.760]   This is why I don't want to pay him Leo.
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.560]   I don't want to pay for Twitter blue with that idiot in charge.
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:39.800]   I don't think he's going to do anything with my $4.99.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:42.360]   That's what you think.
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:43.360]   I don't know.
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:44.960]   You think I should just not--
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:52.760]   look, as worried as I am and as doubtful as I am about this guy,
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:53.960]   I drove a Tesla.
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:56.440]   I'm pretty impressed with SpaceX.
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:58.520]   They've shown that you can commercial space
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:02.080]   can do what NASA could not do for a fraction of the money.
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:03.760]   On and on and on.
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.760]   I want him to do a good thing with--
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.640]   I want him to turn Twitter into something wonderful.
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:08.240]   Can he do it?
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:08.840]   I don't know.
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:12.200]   If he had just shut up, then we could have enjoyed.
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:15.320]   The fruits of Tesla and what the good things
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:16.120]   SpaceX has done.
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:19.680]   But unfortunately, I think so many people he cannot shut up.
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:22.360]   And Twitter is literally a platform for just spewing his
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:23.880]   garbage out to everybody.
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:24.960]   So it's sort of like--
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.960]   it is kind of like what happened to Kanye, isn't it?
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.040]   Just like--
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:28.480]   Yeah.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.360]   It's poor impulse once upon a time.
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:31.760]   Poor impulse control.
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:34.880]   I mean, that tweet this morning, you're the CEO of the company.
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:36.040]   You're not the chief to it, by the way.
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:38.640]   You're the CEO of the company.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:40.680]   I'm the chief to it.
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:43.040]   By the way, I'm masted on where we don't call them tweets,
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:43.960]   we call them toots.
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:45.240]   I call myself the chief toot.
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:49.200]   Tutor and chief.
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.120]   Tutor and chief.
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.680]   I'm just saying.
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:53.760]   Only for toilet toots.
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:54.240]   Yeah.
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:54.880]   But I haven't.
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:56.240]   By the way, I looked back.
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:00.040]   I was chief to it on Jaiku in 2007.
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.080]   It's been on my business card.
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:03.240]   I'll show you my business.
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:07.240]   It's on my business card for at least a decade.
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:08.880]   How does the law work?
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:09.760]   No one knows.
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:10.400]   It's a mystery.
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:11.840]   It's a mystery.
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:14.000]   We have the trademark for Twit.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.080]   I have had it since 2005, long before Twitter existed.
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:20.600]   I feel like I own Twit.
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.120]   But maybe I might be mistaken.
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.520]   Leo, Leo, Leo, he'll settle.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.600]   Oh, yeah, sure.
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:27.760]   To him and he'll settle.
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.560]   Sure.
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:31.560]   Sure, that'll go well.
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:35.680]   It's great to have you.
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:38.360]   I feel like we've got the brain trust here.
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:39.720]   It's so great to have Doc Serals.
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:41.160]   I've been trying to get you on for.
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:42.960]   You've been on before, but not in ages.
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:44.480]   A couple of times.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:46.400]   Host of the two-foot floss.
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:48.560]   You could come on as often as you want.
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:49.360]   You're always welcome.
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:50.400]   Same to you.
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.760]   The vendor of Harderwar.
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:52.680]   Love you.
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.800]   Senior editor and gadget.
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:55.680]   How old is your newborn?
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.160]   Your newborn is now seven months old.
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:57.800]   Oh my god.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.040]   It's doing really well.
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:01.520]   And we need to-- we know we need to get you out of here
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:03.520]   because your daughter's sprained her ankle.
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:04.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:04.640]   Yeah.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:05.720]   You've got daddy duties.
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:08.680]   So we'll get-- we'll move more quickly through this.
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.240]   And of course, the wonderful Philip Elmer DeWitt,
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:16.080]   who is a legend in the business, p-e-d-3-0.com.
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:19.960]   One of the analysts calls me legend whenever he responds to me.
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:20.760]   He says, legend.
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:22.640]   How are you doing?
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:23.920]   I like that.
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:25.720]   Michael Krasney, I did an interview with him
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:29.760]   who is 77 in a legendary broadcaster in the Bay Area,
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:33.720]   KGO, and KQED, said, he said, I once called Kirk Devlin's
[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:35.320]   a legend and he yelled at me.
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:36.680]   He said, legends are dead.
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:37.680]   Do not--
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:38.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:39.520]   Do not call me--
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:40.320]   I'll remember that.
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:41.000]   --a legend.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:41.800]   Yes.
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:42.320]   If it's--
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:42.880]   Well, yeah.
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:43.600]   And now he is.
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:44.280]   You can call him that.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:45.200]   Yeah, he's dead now.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:49.160]   So it's-- oh, god.
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:50.240]   That got really dark.
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:55.080]   Very fast.
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:57.200]   Let's talk about our fine sponsors
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:01.760]   because these are the people who make this show happen.
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:05.040]   And I am internally grateful to them, as always,
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:07.000]   for their great support.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:12.760]   Our show today brought to you by my beautiful eight sleep.
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:16.120]   And if I am at all coherent today,
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:20.040]   it is because I had a great night's sleep on my eight sleep.
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:22.440]   Eight sleep makes mattresses, but I have--
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:24.040]   I like my mattress.
[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:25.000]   We have a very nice mattress.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.040]   So I got the pod, which is a cover that goes over the mattress.
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:30.560]   And it does something very interesting.
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:32.520]   It both heats it and cools it.
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:33.600]   Go either way.
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:36.560]   As low as 55 degrees, which is chilly,
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:40.480]   or 110 degrees, which is hot, or anywhere in between.
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:42.120]   Why would you want this?
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:43.480]   Oh, you do.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:44.600]   Let me trust-- let me tell you.
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:45.320]   Trust me.
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:47.560]   In fact, normally, Lisa gets up early.
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:48.560]   She's a very early riser.
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:52.040]   She likes to get her coffee, go to the gym, work out,
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:53.720]   have some me time.
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:56.080]   So she's normally up 6 o'clock.
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:57.400]   I got up about eight.
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:58.720]   She was still in bed.
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:00.000]   I went and had my coffee.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.440]   She was-- she didn't get up till 9.30.
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:02.920]   I said, what happened?
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:03.800]   She slipped.
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:06.280]   She said, well, I woke up at 7.
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:08.880]   Turned my eight, sleep up a couple of degrees.
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:11.160]   Went back to sleep, all cozy.
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:12.120]   Woke up at 8.
[00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:13.520]   Turned my eight, sleep up a little bit.
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:14.240]   Went back to sleep.
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:14.720]   Walked out.
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:17.040]   She slept an extra three hours.
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.440]   And that's what the eight sleep does.
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:18.880]   But you know what?
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:19.520]   She needed it.
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:20.160]   It's her day off.
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:21.520]   I'm glad she did.
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:23.240]   I'm really glad she did.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:25.240]   Eight sleep is the only sleep technology
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:28.840]   that dynamically cools and heats each side of the bed.
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:31.120]   So her temperature was different than mine.
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:33.200]   She likes to sleep warmer than I do.
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:35.400]   But it maintains the optimal sleeping temperature
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:37.680]   for what your body needs.
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.200]   It knows the room temperature.
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.400]   It knows you.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.320]   It's got sensors to notice if you're sleeping well,
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:45.200]   if you're tossing and turning, to know how deep your sleep is.
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:47.680]   And literally optimizes the temperature for you.
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:49.760]   For instance, I like to start warm.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:50.240]   I get in bed.
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:53.280]   It's toasty and cozy, especially in the winter.
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.280]   But the eight sleep brings the temperature down slowly
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:57.440]   because I go into a deeper sleep as a result.
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:02.520]   That deep sleep is so important for your health.
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:06.280]   Sufficient deep sleep can reduce the likelihood of Alzheimer's,
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:07.920]   decrease the risk of heart disease,
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:09.840]   lower your blood pressure.
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:12.320]   Yet more than 30% of Americans struggle with sleep.
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:12.840]   I bet you do.
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:13.320]   We all do.
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:13.560]   Right?
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:16.640]   Feeling hot at night, one of the primary reasons people don't
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:18.160]   sleep well, waking up with a sweat.
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:20.120]   It's worth the worst.
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:22.040]   In the summer, we had a really bad heat wave.
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:23.000]   I had my hate sleep.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   And it did automatically cool me off.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:25.600]   It kept me cool.
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:26.800]   I never got hot.
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.680]   It warms me up in the winter.
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:32.320]   And it cools me off as I sleep so that I have the optimal sleep.
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:35.400]   Clinical data shows eight sleep users experience up to 19%
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:38.520]   increase in recovery, up to 32% improvement sleep quality.
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:42.200]   And for me, the big one, 34% more deep sleep.
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:44.680]   If you sleep an extra half hour of that deep sleep,
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:46.480]   that sleep that cleans the brain,
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:49.040]   you'll feel so much better.
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.440]   You will be sharper.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:52.160]   You will feel better.
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:53.680]   Everything is just nicer.
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:54.320]   Eight sleep.
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:55.880]   We have the original pod.
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:58.080]   They have-- actually, we have the pod too, I think.
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:00.680]   They just launched the next generation, the pod 3.
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:03.880]   More accurate sleep and health tracking double the sensors.
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:06.680]   It is the best sleep experience on the Earth.
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:07.720]   It's not magic.
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:08.920]   It feels like magic.
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:10.120]   It's incredible.
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:14.600]   Soft, comfortable, warm when you want it, cool when you need it.
[00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:16.320]   I can't recommend it more highly.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:19.160]   And I'll tell you, when we went on vacation last week,
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:21.280]   went to Vegas for a few nights, I really
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:23.600]   felt the lack of my eight sleep.
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:24.880]   We've had it for a year now.
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:26.320]   So I've been through a winter.
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:28.080]   In the summer, we're going through another winter.
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:29.800]   Maybe hotels will start getting eight sleep.
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:32.000]   Eight sleep.com/twit.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.360]   Sleep cozy this fall.
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:36.640]   If you're in Australia, sleep cozy this summer,
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:38.920]   you'll save $150 a check out on the pod.
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:39.640]   I apologize.
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:40.560]   That was terrible.
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:43.760]   Eight sleep currently ships in Australia and the US
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:46.160]   and Canada, the UK, and select countries in the EU,
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.400]   I should say.
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:49.320]   I really love this.
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:50.520]   It's something you should check out.
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:53.040]   Eight sleep.com/twit.
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:55.720]   And when you-- if you do, please use that address
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:56.840]   so that you know you saw it here--
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:00.920]   eightsleep.com/twit.
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:06.440]   We thank you so much for supporting the show.
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:07.440]   Let's talk about Apple.
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:09.080]   Philip Elmer DeWitt's here.
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:11.000]   This is the time.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.640]   Apple did two things.
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:15.800]   They said on Thursday their quarterly results came out.
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:19.040]   The best quarter, record quarter, did great.
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.760]   Don't count on next one.
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.400]   Explain this.
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:24.120]   Philip, you're muted.
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.080]   I don't know if that's us or you.
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:30.360]   It's always a record quarter.
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:32.360]   Yeah, I knew it would be a record quarter.
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:34.040]   Now, does this include iPhone 14?
[00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:36.280]   It does, doesn't it?
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:37.800]   Five days of iPhone 14.
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:38.320]   Oh, we're two.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:39.840]   So just a slice.
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:45.480]   So it's really the next quarter, which is their Q3?
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:46.760]   Q1.
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:48.240]   Q1 is the big quarter.
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:49.320]   This was Q4.
[00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:52.360]   They ended their fiscal year at the end of September.
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:55.160]   And what we got was the results for that.
[00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:59.880]   So we got the quarterly results and the annual results.
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:06.120]   If KAIS the tech guys to pull up the chart for--
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:08.640]   one of the charts I sent shows what
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:10.840]   Apple did compared to the other tech companies.
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:14.960]   Yeah, because this was a bad time for tech companies.
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:18.560]   Here's the performance from PED3.com.
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:19.080]   There you go.
[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:21.800]   This came from the Wall Street Journal.
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:27.000]   There's meta that lost a quarter of his value in one day.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.800]   One of my subscribers, he says, I should have shorted it.
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:35.160]   The day he changed the name, because I knew he was panicking.
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:39.440]   And then I finally shorted it just before the earnings.
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:42.640]   I shorted it at $135 and it went down to $99.
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:47.720]   So the guy made a bunch of money betting against this thing.
[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:48.720]   You know--
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.320]   Look at these steep declines.
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:51.880]   Look at Amazon.
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:52.600]   Oh my god.
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:53.320]   Amazon went down to--
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:55.800]   Look at Alphabet.
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:59.520]   And then Apple, which is exactly the opposite,
[00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:02.080]   is slow decline and then suddenly a jump.
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:05.080]   What you're seeing is the money pouring out
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:06.760]   of those other three companies.
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:09.560]   And into Apple, they needed someplace to go.
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:15.640]   And so it was only Apple's second best one day game.
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:17.440]   In January, they had another big--
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:20.760]   And that was after they announced their results.
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:22.200]   Wow.
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:22.680]   Yeah.
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:25.840]   But explain to me, because I do not buy tech stocks.
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:28.280]   And for good read, as a journalist,
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:31.320]   I don't want to have a dog in this hunt.
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:33.400]   And I have some interest in the stock market,
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:34.880]   but I'm not an expert.
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:38.880]   Explain to me, the tech companies had a big boon in COVID,
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:39.240]   right?
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:41.000]   They all did great.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:45.440]   Isn't this just somewhat of a correction after this growth?
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:50.000]   Are they below where they were before COVID?
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.720]   You'd have to look at individual stocks.
[00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:53.200]   Apple is down for the year--
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:54.280]   I know, Metas.
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:56.760]   Metas $700 billion off its--
[00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:58.760]   Yeah, it does speak.
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:04.080]   They-- $800 billion evaporated.
[00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:07.920]   Someone called it the greatest destruction of capital
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:10.080]   for a long time.
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:11.120]   No, the--
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:12.760]   But by the way, I would point out--
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:15.160]   I would point out, if you did short them,
[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:18.840]   execute because they're making a long bet.
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:21.760]   Metas saying, look, we know the social's dying.
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:24.160]   They're agreeing with what we said last break.
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:25.520]   We know the social's dying.
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:28.400]   We think the metaverse is the next big thing.
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:30.840]   And we're going to pour all our energies into that.
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:34.040]   If they're right, it's like it's just a startup.
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:35.440]   You're buying low.
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:40.120]   What could be the biggest company of 2028?
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:41.200]   A couple of things.
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:45.320]   Jim Kramer was on and literally cried,
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:49.320]   apologizing to having believed in Facebook.
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:52.240]   And he said, when I found out how much they were spending
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:54.960]   on meta, I thought there was an adult there.
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:58.480]   They could control this, but they're just out of control.
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:02.360]   So this is an important-- this is an influential guy,
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:05.760]   the most influential guy on CNBC, which all the investors
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:12.480]   watch, and he's saying, you know, carefully that I screwed up.
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:13.440]   To answer--
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:18.200]   Let me answer my question because I have the alphabet stock.
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:20.840]   Valentine's Day 2020, right before the pandemic,
[00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:26.440]   they were at their peak for the last many years of $76.
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:28.920]   Pandemic, they go down to 53.
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:29.920]   They've climbed back.
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:31.440]   This was, of course, of the pandemic
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:33.600]   was very, very good to alphabet.
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:38.160]   They've dropped since, but they're still well above their
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:39.320]   pre-pandemic peak.
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:41.000]   They're at $101.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:44.720]   So this is what I say when I-- or 90-- I'm sorry, $96.58.
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:47.320]   This is what I say when people say, oh, they're tanking,
[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:50.520]   is, well, they're just recovering from what
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:53.560]   was a big run-up because of COVID.
[00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:54.000]   Right.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:54.760]   That's true.
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:56.320]   That's true.
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:59.880]   What's scary about Facebook and Alphabet
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:03.360]   is that the cloud numbers are going down.
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:06.840]   It looks like they bet on the cloud and the cloud--
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:08.360]   the investment in the cloud seems to be--
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:11.200]   Amazon's eating their lunch, right?
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:12.600]   Is that what's really happening?
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:16.200]   A.W. Amazon Web Service is also--
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:18.080]   Is it down as well?
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:19.320]   But again--
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:21.480]   Anyway, I think you have to look at historic.
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:25.000]   Now, here's historic five years for Facebook.
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.880]   And yeah, they're well below their peak
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:30.320]   before the pandemic, which is $214.
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:32.960]   They're down to $99.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:33.800]   They screwed the pooch.
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:34.560]   They're done.
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:35.120]   They're done.
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:38.320]   They're cooked, at least for short term.
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:40.400]   I wonder if Amazon--
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:43.160]   Did Amazon get the results this week?
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:46.600]   Yeah, it was Friday morning, I believe.
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:48.520]   OK, so they're still above--
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:51.160]   well, OK, that's interesting.
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:53.520]   So they're right at their peak pre-pandemic.
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:55.120]   Their peak pre-pandemic was $104.
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:57.040]   They're now $103.
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:00.560]   So they-- look at-- I mean, this big--
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:02.920]   this devil's mountain here.
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:05.720]   It's COVID, right?
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:08.960]   It was inevitable that this wouldn't last forever.
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:12.960]   Right, and that's what was impressive about Apple.
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:16.640]   They got pushed up with COVID as well as everybody else.
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:19.240]   And they've managed with--
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:22.320]   the iPhone sales are down a bit, and services are down a bit.
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:28.640]   But they've got so many cylinders going that they--
[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:30.840]   I don't know, it's like printing money.
[00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:33.920]   Can we show another chart that I offered?
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:36.920]   It was the mountain of cash.
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:41.400]   They have as much cash as they've ever had now, right?
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:41.920]   No.
[00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:42.560]   Oh, no.
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:45.520]   They've been-- they made a commitment.
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:46.840]   Remember in 2016--
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:48.800]   Oh, they've been buying back stock.
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:51.840]   That Trump was going to let them repatriate all the cash
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:53.040]   that they had overseas.
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:53.920]   For reduced--
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:55.080]   all that irish money.
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:56.720]   I reduced tax bill, yeah.
[00:59:56.720 --> 01:00:02.000]   Yeah, so they started bringing their cash back and buying.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.400]   Everybody who works for Apple and especially the chief people
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.440]   have a lot of stock.
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:11.640]   And if they got dividends, they'd have to pay taxes on it.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:15.720]   But if they buy back stock, they don't pay taxes.
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:18.160]   And I should point out, some say--
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:20.640]   I don't know, again, I plead ignorance--
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:25.200]   that buying back stock is in a way inflating the stock,
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:28.000]   because you're reducing the pool of shares and--
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:28.800]   It's the opposite.
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:30.080]   It's the opposite.
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:33.640]   It's making each share of stock represent a larger part
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:34.800]   of the company.
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:37.680]   It's deflation, I guess.
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:38.240]   OK, well--
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:42.200]   They end up with more valuable stock if they buy it back.
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:43.960]   So it doesn't make that much--
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.120]   Let me put it this way.
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:47.520]   You're artificially improving your stock price
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.000]   by buying back stock.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:49.720]   That's right.
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:50.440]   That's right.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:52.880]   And the argument is, if you have all this money,
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.800]   can't you find something better to do with it?
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:58.760]   Invest it in new products and do some research, something?
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:02.000]   And IBM made the mistake of, rather than investing
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.200]   in the future, buying back their stock, and it hurt them.
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.000]   They're a shadow of their original shelf.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.880]   So Apple, they've got some very smart people--
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:15.480]   smart money people managing this.
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:20.000]   And I have to laugh when I watch the analysts second
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   guessing Timah Cook.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.600]   They have no idea what he's--
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:23.120]   No.
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:26.080]   That's why I say very clearly, I don't know what I'm talking
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:28.280]   about.
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:31.280]   Missing, by the way, in this chart of companies is Microsoft.
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:34.240]   And I was peeking at their earnings this week.
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:37.880]   And they also took a hit, but not as badly as everybody else.
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:40.920]   They kind of went halfway because Apple, Apple,
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:43.240]   Gate, but Microsoft took a smaller hit
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:43.960]   than most of these other--
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:48.200]   Pre-pandemic, Preak for Microsoft, 185, they are now 235.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.800]   So they're up almost 30%--
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:52.360]   They're a very well-managed company.
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.760]   And they've found their new fee.
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:56.160]   Well, Microsoft is great.
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:59.600]   If you look at the stock price over the total history
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:04.520]   of the stock going back to '86, was very flatline
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:09.440]   for a decade from 2000 to maybe 2015.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:10.520]   Just flatline.
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.800]   In 2000, it looked pretty darn good.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:16.040]   I mean, in retrospect, that doesn't look like much.
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.280]   But that was a good--
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:20.160]   But look what's happened in sense, since Satya Nadella
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:23.440]   and the focus on Azure and the cloud, which
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:26.960]   has, I think, been a very smart move in pandemic.
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:29.000]   Yeah, they're down a little bit now.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.920]   There's a little bit of a recovery.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:31.920]   Put Apple up.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:33.080]   Put Apple up over.
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:34.800]   Oh, I have all of them here.
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:35.440]   Let me see.
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:38.440]   Here's Apple.
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:42.020]   I'm going to do the max again for the full lifetime
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:42.520]   of Apple.
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:43.440]   You ignore this.
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:44.880]   I don't know even what that.
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:48.160]   But starting in 2008, they've been steadily climbing.
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.680]   It was really right about here.
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:51.520]   It gets hit.
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:54.080]   It's up and down, periodically.
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:54.960]   It gets hit worse.
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:03:01.280]   Like Microsoft was a smoother curve than this.
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:04.000]   I can't really understand it, but it's
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.240]   like the people fall out of love with Apple,
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:10.240]   or they find it--
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:11.080]   I'll tell you what it is.
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:12.360]   Apple is doomed.
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:13.360]   I tell you what it is.
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.520]   By the way, I should--
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:19.560]   behind the scenes, Philip asked me to join your crowd.
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:22.120]   You have some sort of broad thing you do.
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:27.120]   And I didn't understand that they were all Apple investors.
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:29.840]   So I'm joining, and I'm going, ah, you know,
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:32.000]   there's no way this company has a few.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.880]   And they're like, what are you talking about?
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:38.640]   And I was really the cheese in their gruel.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:41.640]   But I understand--
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.120]   That was a fun show, Leo.
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:45.040]   I enjoyed it.
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:48.920]   But I understand that what, from the outside,
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:50.160]   happens periodically.
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:52.800]   And I'm the poster boy for this, as you go.
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:53.880]   Well, they've saturated.
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:58.040]   They couldn't possibly find anywhere else to grow.
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:01.120]   And they consistently make me wrong.
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:03.240]   Now they've done it with services, right?
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:03.720]   You're right.
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:06.440]   They can't sell it anymore iPhones.
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:09.360]   They're going to sell the same number every year from now.
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:11.200]   But they're making money in services.
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:15.520]   This quarter, though, service is not so hot.
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:17.920]   I have to correct you about iPhones.
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:21.520]   They're growing market share while the others are losing.
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.240]   So that's where their growth comes from,
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:26.560]   is people stopping Android and going to--
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:27.360]   Right.
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:31.480]   Except in the US, they have a small market share everywhere
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:32.680]   else in the company.
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:33.320]   So there's a world.
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:34.320]   Yeah, there's potential--
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:36.880]   So there's money-- yeah, there's space to grow.
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:39.280]   And you know, the watches, it's unbelievable.
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:46.040]   I was in a hoop shoot with girls and boys 6 to 13.
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:49.080]   And half the girls had Apple watches.
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.840]   Where's that at?
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:52.480]   Well, that's the trick for Apple, right?
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:55.160]   They've got to find new product categories.
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:58.520]   Because I mean, OK, there's growth potential.
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:02.040]   And China kind of saved their bacon for the last few years.
[01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:04.200]   Because suddenly that market took off.
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:07.080]   But at some point, you sell an iPhone everybody's ever
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:08.000]   going to buy an iPhone.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.440]   You're not going to have that same kind of growth.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.920]   You want to find the next big thing.
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:15.280]   And it turned out watches, which at first were really kind
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:17.680]   of laggard, has turned out pretty well for them.
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:18.400]   Notice I'm wearing--
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:21.000]   Leo, $800 Ultra.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:21.880]   You have one there.
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:22.880]   Yeah.
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:24.920]   Leo, it's a monopoly.
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:25.640]   They have a monopoly.
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:26.560]   They have a monopoly.
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.000]   Apple ecosystem.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.800]   And to the extent that you're bought into it,
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:32.280]   you will-- you know, they've got you--
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:33.120]   They got me for life.
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:33.800]   And yeah.
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:34.320]   Yeah.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.720]   Which I hate.
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:36.520]   But it's true.
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:37.040]   It's a lot of the--
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:38.040]   You love it.
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:39.440]   I love it and I hate it.
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:39.840]   Yeah.
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:41.040]   But it's a walled garden.
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:44.480]   Devinder, are you captive to the Apple?
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:45.520]   Absolutely.
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:48.080]   I mean, I'm not reviewing phones and stuff anymore.
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:50.360]   But certainly once I started with smartphones,
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:52.760]   like the Apple ecosystem made the most sense.
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:54.080]   iPad was always the best--
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:55.800]   like, forget about Android tablet.
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:06:00.240]   So my god, for the past decade, if you wanted anything decent,
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:02.480]   the Apple ecosystem made the most sense.
[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:06.120]   And now I can imagine why parents would be buying young kids,
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:07.520]   Apple watches.
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:08.640]   My daughter is four now.
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:11.160]   But when she's six or seven, when she's going to school,
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:13.440]   having a lifeline to her, you know,
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:15.440]   being able to see where she is, that
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:17.920]   is something a lot of people would really
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.240]   be interested in having.
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:21.600]   So I can imagine that's being super successful.
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.160]   I'm also getting more into like,
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:25.040]   car tech and stuff these days.
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:27.600]   And I can clearly see like, why there have
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:30.200]   been all those rumors about Apple and car stuff.
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.600]   Because that is a whole platform where
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:35.480]   Apple is basically partnering with companies now.
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:38.320]   But having a total solution or having something
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:40.360]   with more of the Apple branding on it,
[01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:41.960]   that would also be another huge hit for them.
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:43.720]   So yeah, I'm in the ecosystem.
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:45.240]   And yeah, we'll see how far it goes.
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.840]   So they do need another product, right?
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:48.160]   I mean, services have been good.
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:49.720]   Services wasn't that good this quarter.
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:53.360]   Why do you think that was, Philip?
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:55.200]   I think it was a tough compare.
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:58.600]   It had grown enormously the year before.
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.880]   It's hard to sustain levels of growth like that year
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:02.080]   after year after year.
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:03.920]   Yeah, well, you know--
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.320]   It was the pandemic growth.
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:06.360]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:07.880]   There you go.
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:11.160]   And Apple's facing some headwinds on the biggest profit
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:15.040]   center in their services, which is the App Store.
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:16.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:21.960]   Well, there was some serious activity in Congress
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:26.680]   to crack down on Apple and take some of the APIs away.
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:28.560]   EU as well?
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:29.160]   Over the world.
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:31.720]   EU can get stuff done.
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:33.800]   Congress, it turns out, can not.
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:35.920]   So that thing died.
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:39.840]   I have to add one theory I have about Facebook.
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:41.320]   You know, the next product that we're
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:42.880]   supposed to get, according to Bloomberg,
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:46.040]   is coming in the spring, are these goggles.
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:51.400]   I have a very hard time seeing goggles as an Apple product.
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.000]   It just doesn't seem to have the mask.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.520]   Well, I thought that way about the car too.
[01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:56.960]   Actually, I was very surprised to hear you say you think
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:58.440]   the car de-vendre is a--
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:07:59.440]   Is it good?
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:00.960]   I'm just looking at what's ahead too.
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:03.840]   And also, hey, AR glasses, I just
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:05.440]   tried out the Magic Leap 2.
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:06.440]   Remember, Magic Leap?
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:08.720]   And how much money they raise?
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:10.280]   Their new headset is actually pretty good.
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:13.200]   But because of all the bad word of mouth,
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:15.680]   nobody's taking that company seriously anymore.
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:16.120]   So--
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:19.040]   If you tried, I bought the I-Set embarrassed admit,
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:21.880]   the $1,600 Quest Pro.
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:23.560]   I haven't tried them yet.
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:26.400]   We are in the-- we reviewed it in gadget.
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:29.040]   And our viewers are like, it's good.
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:29.760]   It's a good headset.
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:31.640]   I don't know who it's for.
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:35.040]   The bet on that market seems weird and maybe out of place.
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:38.000]   But the idea of having maybe something you slip on
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.680]   or maybe even your own current glasses,
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:42.160]   it could extend your displays maybe
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:43.200]   when you're actually sitting at your--
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:44.480]   Oh, I love that idea.
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:45.840]   That is a really interesting--
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:48.160]   It's hard to do though, isn't it?
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:50.680]   It's hard to do, but it does seem like the Quest Pro
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:52.200]   is doing it pretty well.
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:55.040]   This is like a five, 10-year problem.
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:58.240]   But the stuff I saw you, like the Magic Leap 2 stuff,
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:02.000]   and even a bit of the HoloLens 2, it can be magical.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.720]   The question is, who is it for?
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:05.880]   Will people actually want this?
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.960]   It still seems more like an industrial trend,
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.880]   like not really what Apple tends to do.
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:12.000]   Like they are former consumer focused.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.720]   But I could see it being a thing, eventually,
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:17.400]   at least for some people.
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:18.760]   Glasses for sure.
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:24.040]   If they could make the glasses that look like this,
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.480]   that would be a great product.
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:26.360]   The Quest Pro--
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:29.240]   My theory about the goggles is I just can't see it as an Apple
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:29.600]   product.
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:31.280]   I can't see it this spring.
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:34.480]   I have this theory that they're doing it
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:36.360]   to drive Facebook nuts.
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:38.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:42.000]   Oh, don't kick them when they're down.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.880]   That's mean.
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.320]   I think they may have no intention of doing what--
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:49.240]   Oh, that's a really interesting theory.
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:51.040]   Bloomberg says they're going to do.
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:55.160]   And Meta just keeps pouring money into the project.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:58.800]   The reviews of the people who actually went in that space
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:00.640]   where they don't have legs and you bump into the world.
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:02.080]   Horizon world.
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:04.280]   And they're mostly kids.
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.480]   Oh, that looked like such a loser.
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.400]   Yeah.
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:11.280]   But you know what so did the internet in 1996.
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:11.760]   You know?
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:13.120]   It's early days.
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:13.720]   I remember.
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:14.520]   I remember what that was.
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:16.160]   I remember I really wanted to watch
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:20.240]   the trailer for Mortal Kombat before that movie came out.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:23.280]   And I had to enter this long website, not a brand
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:24.800]   to donate, domain name.
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:29.440]   It was like a dash, Tilda, like 30 seconds later.
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:31.800]   Once I was done entering that URL,
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:36.840]   I had to wait 30 minutes for the 1996 grade web video to load
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:37.160]   too.
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:41.520]   So this stuff is really bad until there is a shift
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:43.160]   and there's something that kind of--
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:43.520]   You remember?
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:44.560]   --makes a big public hit.
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:46.040]   But remember real networks.
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:47.440]   Remember real networks?
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:47.940]   Yeah.
[01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:48.800]   You remember that?
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:49.140]   Yeah.
[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:50.040]   I remember real networks.
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:51.200]   It was real networks, actually.
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:52.520]   Yeah, it was a low quality real--
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:53.020]   It was awful.
[01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:54.360]   --real player thing.
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:56.960]   But Philip, to what you're saying,
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:00.120]   I test her out Horizon work rooms too before it launched.
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:03.640]   So I haven't seen the way normal people have used it.
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:05.360]   There is potential there.
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.680]   I'm living outside of Atlanta now.
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:10.000]   I'm not near my normal coworkers to be
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.960]   able to hop into virtual space and just have
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:13.160]   a meeting with people.
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:14.960]   Could be useful.
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:16.920]   I don't know if you guys have seen some of the footage
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:17.280]   from that.
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:21.160]   But I was also in a space where Zuckerberg's avatar appeared
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:22.000]   right next to me.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:22.480]   Yeah.
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:26.960]   And it was a very weird thing where it was like, oh,
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:29.080]   when people see this video, it's like,
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:30.640]   I'm sitting next to Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.400]   I should probably be really chill right now.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.000]   I should probably not to like--
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.440]   don't stare too much.
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:37.720]   Because it did feel like I was like, got to be cool.
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:38.560]   Got to be cool.
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.480]   Mark Zuckerberg is right there.
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:42.480]   If you look at playback of that video,
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.600]   my avatar is just doing crazy wild stuff
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:47.560]   because they're tech for managing my arms and everything.
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:49.600]   Just didn't work very well.
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:51.360]   So I both see the potential in it.
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.600]   It's clearly early days.
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:54.840]   Like it's early days and even they can't make it work
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.440]   when you're sitting next to Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:58.160]   Wait, I got to find this video.
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.000]   Look, there's video somewhere.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.320]   Yeah.
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:04.440]   Devindra, Horizon World Zuckerberg.
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:06.120]   Was that-- you think that's--
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.040]   That's probably there.
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:10.600]   I have a photo in my piece, but we didn't--
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:12.000]   like, I didn't do a video for that one.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.320]   I'm going to see the video of that.
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:15.840]   That's-- well, maybe better just to imagine it.
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:16.280]   Yeah.
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:19.520]   I have to say, I have the Quest Pro.
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:22.520]   And no one should spend $1,600 on this product.
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:25.120]   That's not what I would say at all.
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:28.520]   I mean, no review really should ever say this is a worthwhile thing.
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:31.840]   But I want to give VR a chance.
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:36.360]   I bought the first Oculus Rift on Kickstarter.
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:37.840]   I got HTC 5.
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:39.520]   It's never-- it's always been a cool demo
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:43.040]   that you lose interest within a day or two.
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:45.320]   And I don't see anything to change my mind on this.
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:47.680]   But it's pretty amazing.
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:49.920]   I don't think I'd want to be in a Teams meeting
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.880]   for more than 10 minutes on this thing.
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:52.880]   Sure, sure.
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:54.080]   That's part of the problem.
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:55.880]   I mean, we got a long way to go.
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:57.720]   There's-- I've talked about this before.
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:00.040]   There's a game called Richie's Plank, which
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:01.000]   is just-- it's very simple.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.320]   You go up in an elevator.
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:03.000]   The door opens.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:03.960]   You're at the 80th floor.
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:06.480]   You look down.
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.280]   And there's a little thin plank.
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:10.240]   And you're supposed to walk out along it.
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:13.520]   Now, I know in my brain that I am in my living room.
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:15.520]   I'm not going anywhere.
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:17.560]   I could-- my body said, no, no, no.
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:19.560]   You're not going-- no, no.
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:21.720]   And my brain said, OK, fine.
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:24.440]   I could not walk out on that plank.
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:26.640]   Much like you thought you were sitting in Mark Zuckerberg,
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:27.800]   next to Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:30.560]   I mean, in a certain reality I was.
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:33.120]   You look at video evidence, there I am sitting next to Mark
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:33.640]   Zuckerberg.
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.440]   So it is good enough--
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:35.920]   It is good enough.
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:36.720]   Let's put it this way.
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:39.120]   It's good enough to fool my body.
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:42.520]   And to overrule my rational mind,
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:45.680]   which knows I am completely safe and say,
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:47.320]   and my pulse rate's going up.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:49.960]   I'm sweating.
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:51.240]   I could not walk along the plank.
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:52.360]   Now, by the way, my wife--
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:53.360]   We got to separate the difference.
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:54.360]   What are you talking about?
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:55.720]   She walked right along and no problem.
[01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:57.400]   So she's got a better brain.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.600]   She's a much cooler cucumber than you leave clearly.
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:00.600]   Yes.
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:02.920]   But, Devendra, you got to separate.
[01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:03.800]   Yeah.
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:06.880]   Isn't the market games?
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:08.360]   Isn't there what you're here for?
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.480]   It is right now.
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:12.640]   But I've been covering VR stuff since the Consumer
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:15.360]   Institute, and I did Sundance.
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.600]   It has just some really good work in terms
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:21.320]   of getting an experience of the festival in VR
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:22.160]   with your headsets.
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:23.640]   And you can put that on.
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:28.600]   You can go look at some VR projects that people have created.
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:30.240]   And normally, you'd have to go to physical space
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:32.040]   and put on a VR headset to do that.
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:34.560]   Why shouldn't you just be able to do that from your own home?
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:36.960]   There are VR chats and stuff where you could go actually
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:38.880]   congregate and talk with other people.
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:41.640]   It gave me a sense of community that I really
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:43.880]   have missed from not being able to go to film festivals
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:46.200]   and things like that.
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:48.840]   Maybe conversely, Southby kind of did the same thing.
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:52.480]   And their VR interface was a ghost town.
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:55.840]   And it felt very lonely because I was there just staring
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:59.600]   at these towering virtual Austin by myself.
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:01.120]   And there was nobody with me.
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:02.120]   So there are like--
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:02.760]   Yeah.
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:05.760]   There's like costs and consequences
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:07.320]   of going VR in this way.
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:08.680]   But I wanted to say, we really need
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:11.800]   to separate the idea of AR and the idea of VR
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:14.040]   and what these two things can actually mean.
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:17.440]   Because the pass-through in the Quest Pro looks really good.
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:20.720]   Like it looks like you can actually see your desk.
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:23.040]   And I'm imagining like maybe someday,
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:26.320]   if I just want to throw up a 50-inch or 70-inch video
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.840]   above my monitor when we're watching the Apple Live
[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:31.520]   Stream or something, I'd love to be able to do that.
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:33.320]   And not to the whole corner window.
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:35.440]   With the Quest Pro, because they have cameras in its color
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:38.400]   now, but the real world looks like it's virtual.
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:39.720]   It's a little shaky.
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:41.880]   And the virtual world looks real.
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:44.480]   So I think they're up to--
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:45.480]   So weird.
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:47.920]   Magic Leap also has this thing that not many people
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:48.560]   have talked about.
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.440]   But those are AR glasses.
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:51.760]   So they're transparent and clear.
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:54.920]   But they've created a way to black out what you're seeing.
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:59.520]   So it's almost like a cloud enveloping your vision
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:01.080]   and just blacking out the real world
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:04.760]   to give the virtual objects more of a focus.
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:07.000]   But in a way, it was almost like semi-VR
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.880]   when it totally blacks out in area.
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:10.800]   And that just feels like an interesting space.
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:14.040]   Like being able to hop between an AR and VR-like experience
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:16.200]   could be cool, but it's not for everybody.
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:18.000]   It's not going to be a thing anytime soon.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.720]   But these companies are investing
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:21.520]   because it's going to be something.
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:24.600]   You don't ignore the internet in 1996 when it's terrible.
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:27.680]   You and I were in the internet, along with the vendor in 1996.
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:29.200]   We were a little older than the vendor.
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:30.320]   Me too.
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:32.200]   And you too, Philip.
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:34.840]   But we've seen-- we've been around a long enough
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:39.160]   to see products come along maybe with promise,
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:40.800]   but not delivering on that promise.
[01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:42.640]   And then years later, delivering.
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:45.840]   You think that's where VR is right now?
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.120]   I think it's almost all promise.
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:49.640]   But I have a lot of faith in it for industrial purposes.
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:51.280]   I think of it as like the segway.
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:52.480]   The segway was going to be--
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:53.480]   That's a great thing.
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:54.880]   It was going to be--
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:56.120]   When it was still-- what was it?
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:59.960]   Audrey or it had a fake name before it had a real name.
[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:01.520]   It was Ginger.
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:02.520]   Ginger, that's right.
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:03.680]   And Steve Jobs--
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:06.800]   Jobs, lots of people say this is just the most coolest thing ever.
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:08.200]   And what's it good for?
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:09.480]   Warehouse's.
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:11.160]   Yeah, they said it was going to be cities
[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:14.400]   that are going to be redesigned to accommodate this thing.
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:16.920]   I have two in my garage, by the way.
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:18.840]   Oh, really?
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:19.520]   There it is.
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:23.200]   I realized the problem with Ginger--
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:25.560]   on the screens every 20 years ago, we had Wozniak,
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:28.840]   who would play segway polo, brought in five of them.
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:30.680]   We all zipped around.
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:33.000]   The problem was you looked like a massive dork
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.880]   because you're like nine feet tall on this thing.
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:36.480]   And I think--
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:37.000]   Yeah, right.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.120]   It ended up being mall cops who we make fun of and industrial
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:41.640]   uses the--
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:42.480]   And you're a tourist.
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:43.440]   And things like--
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:44.440]   And tourists.
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:45.440]   Yeah.
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:47.280]   It's very handy in big warehouses.
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:49.200]   It's hugely handy in big warehouses.
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:50.400]   And there are lots of those going up.
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:54.200]   I mean, you go along, drive anywhere on an interstate,
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:55.240]   and there are these--
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:59.160]   it's all free forwarding all around you, in no longer woods.
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:00.360]   And those are full of segways.
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:03.160]   Some of them are-- I actually think an electric bike
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:04.240]   might be the future of--
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:05.800]   Electric bikes are huge.
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:07.760]   They're incredibly huge.
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:10.480]   Before we leave segway, I have to tell a segway story.
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:15.040]   John Heilman, who went on to become a big political reporter,
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:20.160]   came to time and said he could give us a cover story
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:23.360]   on this thing that Steve Jobs is going to be the next big thing.
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:26.240]   And they sent me up to New Hampshire
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:28.200]   to check it out, to kick the tires.
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:30.640]   And I went to their headquarters,
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:32.920]   and I took a little ride around the thing.
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:36.120]   And I heard their pitch was, we're
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:39.240]   going to solve China's problem.
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:40.920]   Everybody in China is going to want a car,
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:42.800]   and it's going to destroy the planet.
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.240]   We'll give them segways.
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:46.200]   But it just didn't make sense.
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:47.840]   The price plant was just--
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:48.400]   It was wacky.
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:50.760]   There's $7,000.
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:52.680]   And oh, by the way, we've had ours long enough,
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:53.960]   the batteries stopped working.
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:56.240]   So I looked into replacing the batteries.
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:58.880]   It's like $4,000 each.
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:18:59.400]   Yeah.
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:02.400]   Anyway, the question was, do we put this on the cover?
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:05.000]   And I came back and said, no, this is not a cover story
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:05.960]   for Time Magazine.
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:08.680]   You're probably going to run it inside.
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:11.280]   A lot of hype around that.
[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:12.560]   So we've seen that.
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:14.360]   We've seen technologies come along that
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:19.480]   looked like they might be world shaking, earth shattering,
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:21.560]   and they don't deliver.
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:23.160]   But then we've also seen the internet,
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:26.040]   which more than delivered, the iPhone.
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:29.920]   In 2007, only really Apple fanatics
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:34.200]   thought the iPhone was going to change the world.
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.440]   It did.
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:36.800]   In ways even less--
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:36.880]   Yes.
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:39.240]   Optimists could not have predicted.
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:40.920]   I waited a year before I bought one.
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:41.480]   But yeah.
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:43.280]   Yeah, I'm the same.
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:44.800]   Oh, I was in line for the first one.
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:45.520]   I vividly remember.
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:48.080]   Well, you always buy the first one.
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:49.960]   You put it right next to your segways.
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:50.520]   Yeah.
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:51.440]   It's your job.
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:53.400]   It's your job.
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:56.280]   When the iPhone came out, my wife, who's
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:20:00.760]   like a not a tech person at all, very retro about everything,
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:04.600]   took one look at the iPhone and said this, I can work with that.
[01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:05.600]   Yeah.
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:06.760]   And got one of the first ones.
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:08.640]   That was a hint right there.
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:12.520]   And I don't think Apple likes to make things that
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:14.720]   are inventions that mother necessity.
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:16.800]   You take one look at it and say I can use that.
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.240]   Yep.
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:20.640]   That's what we don't have that with the VR headsets yet.
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:22.640]   Maybe Apple will make one where you'll
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:25.280]   take one look at it and say, oh, I got to have that.
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:28.560]   But I can't imagine that.
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:31.360]   But I remember being at one of Esther Dyson's things
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:33.400]   a thousand years ago back when you had
[01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:37.800]   in the pre-Kerben times when she said nobody's
[01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:39.760]   going to have a ride on glass.
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:40.960]   Oh boy, was she wrong?
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:41.960]   Yeah.
[01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:44.080]   But she's right about a lot of other things.
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:45.680]   But that was--
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:46.240]   We didn't know.
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:47.200]   I want to see some--
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:47.640]   We didn't know.
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:49.160]   This little thing about Apple, though, which
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:55.080]   is that you look at point of sale, point of purchase things,
[01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:57.240]   and go through airports and there are restaurants that
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:21:00.800]   have easels with iPads in them.
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:04.200]   Apple's doing hugely well in business with iPads.
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:08.360]   And there are lots of different Android
[01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:10.120]   pads, but there's only one iPad.
[01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:12.160]   And there's stuff being written for iPads.
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:14.960]   And you think about Microsoft.
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:16.520]   They just made the operating system.
[01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:17.840]   They didn't make the hardware.
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:19.320]   They didn't want to do vertical integration.
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.240]   And Apple's doing it brilliantly.
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:23.560]   And I'm just--
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:25.560]   that may be a saturated market at this point.
[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:27.600]   But I think Apple's probably doing better in business
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:29.360]   than they ever did before.
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:32.400]   It's hard to tell when something will take off, you know,
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:34.600]   too, because you remember this.
[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:37.320]   You know, the early criticisms of the first iPhone,
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:38.320]   I think were really good a bit.
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:39.240]   It couldn't make sense.
[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:40.600]   It's been that much money for it.
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:41.880]   It couldn't copy and paste.
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:45.160]   It was an edge phone when 3G phones were coming out.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.480]   It wasn't 3G.
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:49.360]   I remember that year, technology review
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:53.280]   put on the front cover, the Helio Ocean, which was a phone.
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:54.280]   I ended up buying it.
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:55.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:57.880]   Remember that was the one that flipped two ways.
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:00.400]   It flipped vertically and horizontally.
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:01.400]   And it was a beautiful phone.
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:02.920]   The beautiful phone is 3G.
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:05.360]   It had so many of the features of the iPhone.
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:06.760]   But it didn't have a touchscreen.
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:08.520]   It didn't have a--
[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:10.680]   even the first iPhone didn't have an app store.
[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:12.040]   That was the whole thing.
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:12.680]   There's the other--
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:14.040]   Oh, this was like the sidekick.
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:14.880]   I bought a sidekick.
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:15.680]   It was like the side.
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:18.720]   But it also flips up vertically for the number pad.
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:20.320]   It's so satisfying.
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:23.160]   I think that was the best slider phone ever made.
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:24.680]   It's still in a pocket here.
[01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:27.440]   But yeah, looking at the first iPhone,
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:28.440]   had so many issues.
[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:31.360]   By the next year, most of those things were ironed out.
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:34.160]   Apple started to see, oh, we can't just rely on web apps.
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:35.240]   We need apps.
[01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:36.800]   We need a centralized app store.
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:38.120]   We need 3G.
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:40.520]   And Apple learned, because even Apple didn't have that
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:41.920]   at the beginning.
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:45.520]   I just reviewed the Surface Pro 9 with LTE.
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:46.520]   And--
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:47.800]   You called it a lie.
[01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:48.840]   I called it a lie.
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:52.400]   But talk about a company that has been hammering this idea.
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:53.600]   Tablets as PCs.
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:56.240]   Tablets as your laptop for 10 years.
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:00.640]   And I don't think really making it happen.
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:02.760]   The sales have been OK.
[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:05.760]   It took a couple of years, but they started making billions
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:07.080]   in revenue from services.
[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:09.440]   But you only ever really see those things on TV
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:13.480]   when a show has a merchandising deal with Microsoft.
[01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:19.600]   You see Tom Brady throwing him on the sidelines in the NFL.
[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:22.000]   And it's like Microsoft will keep trying to make this a hit,
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.120]   even though I think the consumers as a whole are like,
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:28.400]   no, I don't want to use a tablet like this.
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:30.480]   I don't want to have a kickstand on my knee.
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:31.840]   I want to have a stable surface.
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:36.600]   And also, laptops have gotten so light and so easy to use,
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:39.760]   where the idea of having a tablet PC just doesn't--
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:40.800]   there's no real win to it.
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:42.240]   But Microsoft is still doing it.
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:44.440]   So this also shows how hard it is.
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:46.600]   And Esther Dyson, that makes perfect sense.
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:48.160]   Nobody wants to write on Glass.
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:49.680]   I think she was right.
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:51.120]   But there's so many other things.
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:52.040]   It's so hard.
[01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:54.360]   This is why it's so hard as a pundit.
[01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:58.000]   All of us to know if something is going
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000]   to be the next big thing or not.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.200]   It's very hard to know.
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:03.960]   All I can do is tell you all.
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:04.520]   But they do.
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:05.480]   Right.
[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:08.040]   Yeah, I thought Quarty would be dead by now.
[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:11.120]   This is the worst.
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:13.600]   John C. Devorak famously wrote a column saying,
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:15.720]   nobody wants to use a mouse.
[01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:16.720]   Nobody wants to use a mouse.
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:18.160]   I remember that.
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:20.880]   But also, I remember the Devorak pundits too,
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:22.640]   were like, oh, this is clearly better.
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:25.600]   You know?
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:27.560]   It's hard to predict consumer usability.
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:30.640]   What I can say, from my reporting, is if I put something on
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.000]   and I'm like, that's cool.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.280]   That's interesting.
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:35.120]   I could potentially see how that's useful.
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:35.880]   That's all I can do.
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:36.720]   That's all I can convey.
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:39.120]   So the magically-- nobody is taking magically
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:42.360]   seriously now, but that headset is interesting on the
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:43.520]   industrial level.
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:45.480]   Who knows where that tech is going to go from there?
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:47.000]   I just-- I think it's cool.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.240]   Little sidelight on the Devor--
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:50.840]   is it Devorzak?
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:51.720]   He's the composer.
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:52.640]   Devorak--
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:53.720]   Oh, I forget.
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:53.920]   I forget.
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:55.720]   Devorzak's the composer.
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:57.880]   John C. Devorak's the calmest.
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:58.760]   Devorak--
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:01.800]   The Devorak keyboard is an old school keyboard designed,
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:04.920]   not like Quarty, but designed to be more efficient.
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:10.520]   Apple just added the Devorak keyboard to its iPhone lineup
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:12.200]   in iOS 16.
[01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:13.640]   Wow.
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:15.440]   And you know who loves it?
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:16.440]   Steve Wozniak.
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:22.160]   Who knew Steve Wozniak is a Devorak keyboard fanatic?
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:28.040]   He said, thank you very much.
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:32.760]   Apple, what I like most about Devorak then was the feeling
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:35.640]   of using less energy with your fingers.
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:36.680]   Oh, god.
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:37.560]   Yeah, he learned.
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:39.120]   He taught himself Devorak.
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:40.520]   He says, I was on a flight to Tokyo.
[01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:44.240]   I ran Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing in Devorak mode.
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:45.680]   That's how long ago that was.
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:47.880]   I spent five hours learning it and never again
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:48.960]   looked at a Quarty keyboard.
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:50.720]   That's all it took.
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:52.840]   So Woz is happy anyway.
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:53.880]   Hey, I got to take a break.
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:54.800]   I got to take a break.
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:56.200]   This is a great conversation.
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:56.720]   Don't stop.
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:59.760]   Just put a mental-- put a pin in it,
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:02.640]   because I want-- there's so much more to talk about.
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:03.840]   But I have to take a break.
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:05.720]   We're not going to get you out of here in half an hour
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:06.200]   to Vindra.
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:07.040]   And I wanted to.
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:08.040]   I really did.
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:09.200]   I promised.
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:10.920]   Thank you.
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:12.720]   Our show today brought to you by Wealthfront.
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:14.240]   Wealthfront's goal--
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:16.600]   to make building long-term wealth easy,
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:20.120]   offering both high-yield savings and automated investing
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:22.520]   accounts that do just that all within a beautifully
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:25.400]   design interface is your bank keeping
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:27.080]   money that could be yours.
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:29.920]   If you're earning less, get this.
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:31.920]   Wealthfront's--
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:33.920]   I guess it's a savings account, right?
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:38.680]   High-yield savings-- 2.55% APY.
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:41.160]   Your bank ain't paying you anything like that.
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:42.840]   Federal interest rates are going up.
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:45.360]   That means banks have been earning more on your savings.
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:48.120]   But they aren't passing along to you.
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:50.200]   According to the FDIC, the average US bank
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:53.760]   has only raised their rates to 0.17% this year.
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:57.960]   Wealthfront now offering their clients a rate that's 15 times
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:01.320]   higher with a Wealthfront cash account.
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:03.520]   Don't let your bank keep the interest you should be earning.
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:04.840]   Join nearly half a million people who
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:07.440]   already use Wealthfront to earn 15 times more
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:09.000]   than the average US bank.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.520]   It's easy to sign up, plus you'll get unlimited transfers
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:17.080]   that are completely fee-free, up to $1 million in FDIC
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:19.400]   insurance through partner banks.
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:21.880]   So let me give you what you're getting here.
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:28.000]   No account fees, no minimum balance, completely fee-free
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.360]   transfers.
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:31.520]   And if you sign up at wealthfront.com/twit,
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:33.600]   you're going to get a free $50 bonus
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:36.920]   with an initial deposit of $500.
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:41.160]   OK, go to wealthfront.com/twit to get started.
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:42.160]   You know what I'm thinking.
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:44.680]   And get your free $50 bonus with an initial deposit
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:46.080]   of $500.
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:49.640]   Wealthfront.com/twit.
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:53.800]   Wealthfront.com/twit.
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:57.600]   This has been a paid endorsement for Wealthfront.
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:59.320]   OK, fine.
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:01.800]   The law is in this-- banking law is in this country.
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:03.880]   Sometimes a little strange.
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:06.440]   A little weird.
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:08.760]   By the way, Apple was getting--
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:12.480]   Apple has added ads now to their app store.
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:14.520]   And a number of people, Marco, Arment tweeted,
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:17.160]   I don't like it that my app Overcast, which
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:20.880]   is a podcast app, right below it is, oh, if you like Overcast,
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:23.800]   you might like this gambling app.
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:24.840]   It was out of control.
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:27.120]   Apple at one point admits there were about 30%
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:28.920]   of all the ads were gambling.
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:30.920]   They have halted that now.
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:33.320]   They have paused app store ads relating to gambling
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:37.080]   after everybody complained.
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:38.840]   That's where the money is now.
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:41.520]   Local radio station, KGO, one of the best radio stations
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:42.520]   in the country.
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:46.800]   I worked there in the '90s and again in the 2000s.
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:49.600]   My show, syndicated show, was on KGO until two weeks ago
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:52.000]   when KGO pulled the plug on talk radio
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.600]   and became sports gambling radio.
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:58.320]   It's horrible.
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:28:59.880]   But that's just--
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:00.880]   There's so much money here.
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:01.880]   Gambling is gigantic.
[01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:03.640]   Gambling is gigantic in sports.
[01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:10.560]   And the FanDuel and whatever the other one is,
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:13.480]   they're big sponsors of the--
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:13.960]   NFL.
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:14.880]   --Ringer.
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:16.320]   All these things.
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:16.840]   All these things.
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:17.520]   They do the other thing.
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:18.520]   They have a business.
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:20.880]   They have a football and they're promoting gambling.
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:22.120]   Can we--
[01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:23.880]   let's let Pete Rose in the Hall of Fame then,
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:27.640]   because it's OK now to gamble.
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:29.080]   It's OK if you're not playing.
[01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:29.960]   Oh, OK.
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:31.600]   That was a problem with Pete Rose.
[01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:37.040]   But still, it's not possible almost to follow--
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:38.480]   I'm a sports fan.
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:40.640]   And I tune out almost everything.
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:43.560]   It's just all about gambling, because it's not interesting to me.
[01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:47.000]   But it's a gigantic part of the whole conversation.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.040]   What's the line on this?
[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:49.240]   What's the line on that?
[01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:51.240]   And are you going to do a parlay?
[01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:52.200]   Are you going to do--
[01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:52.680]   Oh my god.
[01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:53.760]   --this is the assumption behind it.
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:55.640]   Everybody's gambling all the time.
[01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:57.000]   And there's always a house.
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.320]   And the house is always going to win.
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:00.320]   And so--
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:02.280]   It's kind of amazing.
[01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:02.920]   Yeah.
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:05.240]   Yeah, it's kind of amazing.
[01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:08.400]   I don't want to be the morality police.
[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:10.640]   We're going to vote on this in California in a week,
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:14.440]   two weeks, November 8 on Prop 26 and 27 to allow--
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:17.640]   it's not legal to do sports betting in California,
[01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:20.720]   except at a casino or at a racetrack.
[01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:22.640]   And they want to make it legal on the phone.
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:24.640]   Who's sponsoring this?
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:26.520]   Vandal, MGM.
[01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:27.440]   Yeah.
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:28.800]   The gambling thing.
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:31.160]   And there is to me a little moral thing.
[01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:34.680]   I feel like I don't think anybody who has a gambling problem
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:36.520]   should have a casino in their pocket.
[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:38.960]   I think that's kind of scary.
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:40.960]   I guess it's not our responsibility.
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:42.960]   I just feel like it's a malign influence.
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:47.400]   I look at Las Vegas, all those expensive, beautiful buildings.
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:49.600]   They're built by gambling.
[01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:50.160]   Losers.
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:51.160]   Losers.
[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:51.920]   And you're all--
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:52.880]   And you know what?
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:53.920]   In the long run.
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:56.560]   We're all the losers.
[01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:57.520]   So that's--
[01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:58.020]   Yeah.
[01:30:58.020 --> 01:30:59.760]   I think it's a big problem anyway.
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:01.000]   It's huge.
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.480]   So Apple has halted those ads.
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:03.760]   I don't know if they'll--
[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:06.040]   Philip, have you heard anything about whether that's
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:07.760]   just a temporary pause or--
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:12.000]   Well, when Marco Arment complained loudly, Apple reacts.
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.600]   I guess I think they're going to take it off there.
[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:16.600]   They don't like that look.
[01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:19.680]   But I don't like the look of them selling ads at all, right?
[01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:22.000]   Because all along, they turned off--
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.120]   they put that nice setting, no application tracking
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:27.840]   in my phone, except Apple does.
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:31.120]   And Apple sells ads against what you're doing.
[01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:32.840]   Yeah, it's a very small--
[01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:34.040]   They do it on their own properties.
[01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:34.960]   They do it out in those--
[01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:38.480]   But it's OK for me, but not for these, right?
[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:39.120]   It's different.
[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:40.440]   It's different.
[01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:42.560]   But we're splitting hairs.
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:43.080]   It's promotion.
[01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:43.640]   It's not a good--
[01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:45.880]   It's promotion.
[01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:49.160]   But I was actually interested to discover that they sell--
[01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:52.600]   you can sell NFTs now on the App Store.
[01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:53.720]   And I've got a couple--
[01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:55.840]   I've got a couple I want to sell.
[01:31:55.840 --> 01:32:01.960]   I have Jean-Michel Basquiat's receipt for the first article
[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:03.440]   that was ever written about here.
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:05.880]   I don't have a Basquiat, but I have his receipt.
[01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:08.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:09.560]   I think it's worth some money.
[01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:11.120]   I think you're right.
[01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:16.760]   And I've been taking a picture of my latte art every morning.
[01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:19.880]   And I've made 365 days of latte.
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:21.360]   I think that's worth something.
[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:23.720]   Is this latte art you're creating or this is--
[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:24.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:27.080]   Every time I make one that I like in the morning,
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:27.520]   I take a picture.
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:28.440]   Where is this?
[01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:31.640]   I put it up on Instagram, on my Instagram.
[01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:34.960]   I had no idea you were a latte artist.
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:36.560]   So you take something on Instagram,
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:41.240]   and you monetize the Instagram latte that way.
[01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:43.040]   In other words, you turn it into an NFT.
[01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:44.280]   Do you even hear that?
[01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:45.560]   Or just--
[01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:46.080]   OK.
[01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:50.880]   You know, ideally, I would tell each one individually as an NFT.
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:53.280]   And then if you want to really spend the big bucks,
[01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:53.880]   did you find it?
[01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:57.200]   Lee, it's @philiped on Instagram.
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:32:58.080]   Is it--
[01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:02.400]   Well, I see a lot of Elmer Dewitt 60EA.
[01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:03.200]   Who's that?
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:04.720]   No, that's somebody else.
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:07.880]   It would be Philip-- it's Philip Elmer, probably.
[01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:08.400]   OK.
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:09.840]   But try Philip Ed.
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:12.880]   Try Philip Ed, which, by the way--
[01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:14.400]   OK.
[01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:15.480]   Yeah, I see it.
[01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:18.760]   I see it because you got-- oh, look at this.
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:19.760]   It goes on.
[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:20.920]   Keep going.
[01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:21.720]   OK.
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:24.080]   Mostly they look like volcanoes, but OK.
[01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:25.280]   They're all the trees.
[01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:25.800]   They're all the trees.
[01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:27.320]   They're always trees.
[01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:28.280]   Yeah.
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:29.480]   That's all I can do.
[01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:30.720]   And they're crappy.
[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:33.200]   I'm not very good at it, but I'm persistent.
[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:35.720]   And I've done it now for 360 days.
[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:38.560]   I'm five days away from my goal.
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:41.160]   And you too can own one of these.
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:43.280]   Oh, I want to own them all.
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:43.800]   There you go.
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:45.080]   Use them by them all.
[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:46.080]   You know where the big--
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:47.680]   So where do you sell them?
[01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:48.840]   Where do you sell them at?
[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:50.600]   I haven't sold them at all.
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:51.600]   OK.
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:53.160]   I'll tell you where you go if you want to know.
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:56.120]   There really is only one place, OpenSea.
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:33:58.880]   At OpenSea.io.
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:04.240]   And the problem is the NFT market is tanked.
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:05.200]   So you're coming late.
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:06.400]   If you sold at the beginning of the year,
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:07.840]   you'll keep it cheap then.
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:08.840]   Yeah, you can get it cheap.
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:10.720]   Yeah.
[01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:12.240]   Medieval monkeys.
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:13.960]   If you were tired of board apes,
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:16.120]   now you can get medieval monkeys.
[01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:21.640]   The floor price is .028 ETH.
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:25.080]   So you can get in pretty young, pretty inexpensive.
[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:27.680]   See, I think I have a better product.
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:29.280]   I think you're better.
[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:30.880]   I think you're better than this.
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:38.320]   How about Gene Simmons' kiss and carne?
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:40.600]   Sold out-- you know who makes the money, by the way,
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:43.760]   who's really making money on this OpenSea?
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:50.200]   The gas fees, the money they charge for these transactions
[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:51.600]   are guaranteed.
[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:54.320]   You're going to get that no matter what.
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:57.120]   It's like Levi's selling the jeans to the gold miners.
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:34:58.360]   You may or may not get a strike,
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:34:59.880]   but we're going to get the money for the jeans.
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:01.960]   It's like the house in Las Vegas.
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:03.360]   Yeah, it's the house.
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:06.080]   OpenSea's the house.
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:07.200]   OK.
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:08.160]   OK.
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:11.000]   OK.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:11.840]   Let's see.
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:12.840]   Apple, by the way.
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:19.400]   I'd like your story about getting rid of daylight saving time.
[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:21.680]   So I've gone back and forth on this.
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:26.640]   We're about to the very, very powerful candy lobby
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:28.640]   in the United States.
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:29.760]   This is not a joke.
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:36.640]   Convince Congress to move the change back to standard time
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:39.160]   after Halloween.
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:43.120]   Because the theory being that it's better
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:45.000]   to have more hours of trick or treating
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.840]   because we're going to sell more candy.
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:53.520]   So next Sunday, the clocks will then fall back.
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:56.320]   And I'm sure I will once again go on a tirade
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:58.760]   about what a miserable idea this is
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:01.320]   and how more people die on the Monday.
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:03.240]   Actually, fall back, you're getting more sleep.
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:06.920]   So that's not as bad as spring where you lose an hour sleep.
[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:08.040]   But there's more heart attacks.
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:10.120]   There's more car crashes on the Monday after.
[01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:10.880]   Blah, blah, blah.
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:12.440]   It doesn't save energy.
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:14.680]   The farmers-- I know farmers.
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:15.920]   They've got electric lights now.
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:18.120]   They don't care.
[01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:21.280]   We give them farmers enough already.
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:24.960]   Leo, what I like about this story,
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:29.000]   having been in the city government now for a while,
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.000]   it's like the-- let's get rid of the copper penny.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:33.480]   It's an actual--
[01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:35.080]   It's an achievable goal.
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:38.920]   And you don't have to be a political genius to get it.
[01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:39.680]   Right.
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:41.600]   It's something that you might be able to achieve
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:43.920]   in your lifetime, unlike most political--
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:46.800]   So are you lobbying for the fine?
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:49.600]   I thought you're in Bristol, but you're not as--
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:51.680]   are you like one of those Oz guys?
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:53.200]   Are you a carpet bagger?
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:56.120]   Are you out of state now?
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:57.400]   No, no.
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:36:59.000]   My residence is in Greenfield.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.120]   I'm here because it's nice on the weekends.
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:03.120]   His residence is in Massachusetts,
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:05.000]   but he lives in Rhode Island.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.000]   No, no, I ask you.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.280]   I can't wait to get out of city government.
[01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:11.920]   I have a year and two months left.
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:12.880]   What are you called?
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:14.680]   What is the title of this?
[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:16.520]   Counselor Elmer, they call him.
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:18.760]   Counselor Elmer.
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:22.680]   So is this on your agenda before your term runs out
[01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:25.760]   to change a Greenfield, Massachusetts
[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:30.320]   to a little private zone of no daylight saving time?
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:30.840]   No.
[01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:33.920]   See, I don't actually care one way or the other about daylight
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:35.400]   savings or the copper penny.
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:39.480]   I just like achievable goals.
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:42.960]   Mexico has scrapped daylight saving time.
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:46.400]   By the way, John, you can yell at the AP for pluralizing
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:47.520]   savings.
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:50.320]   You'd think the style guy would have stopped them on that one.
[01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:51.520]   That's shocking.
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:55.800]   Shocking Mexico scraps daylight saving time,
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:38:00.560]   except the long border, where they're still dealing with the US.
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:03.000]   Right.
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:07.280]   Sunday, when Mexico was scheduled today, this morning at 2 AM,
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:11.920]   to turn the clocks back for the last time, then that's it.
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:14.680]   The health secretary Jorge Alsozler
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:17.760]   says Mexico should return to God's clock.
[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:22.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:27.440]   It was a family values thing.
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:30.040]   We voted in California.
[01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:34.840]   We had a proposition the past that said,
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:37.560]   I believe, say, stay on daylight saving time,
[01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:39.120]   because this is part of the debate.
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:42.040]   Do you want it dark in the morning, all winter?
[01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:46.360]   Because that's what happens if you stay on daylight saving time.
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:49.120]   But we're not allowed to do anything unless the feds change
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:52.720]   our time zone or something.
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:55.480]   I can't remember what-- yeah.
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:57.320]   If you want, you can stay standard time.
[01:38:57.320 --> 01:38:59.160]   That's your time zone.
[01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:02.960]   It's optional whether you go to daylight saving time or not.
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:04.880]   So you can turn off the daylight saving time.
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:09.840]   But what we want to do is make permanent daylight saving time.
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:10.960]   That's California.
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:12.360]   That's California when I say we--
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:14.320]   Yeah, because it's sunny in the evening.
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:15.000]   You want that.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:15.960]   Yeah, we don't need it.
[01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:18.440]   Because, yeah, and if you're in Oregon or Washington state,
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:22.280]   or God forbid, Canada, this is a lifesaver,
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:26.560]   because it's like dark until 10 in the morning, all winter.
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:28.560]   And so you don't want kids going to school in the dark
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:29.120]   and so forth.
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:31.200]   So I have mixed-- I don't know.
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:33.240]   I've heard from both sides now.
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:36.960]   And like you, Commissioner Elmer DeWitt--
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:38.680]   Counselor, Counselor.
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:43.800]   I am now neutral on the subject.
[01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:45.720]   But we've got to get rid of the copper penny.
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:47.560]   That's just ridiculous.
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:50.840]   That's just absurd.
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:55.080]   By the way, Jaws, Greg Jawswieck has confirmed.
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:56.840]   Apple will move to USBC.
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:39:59.800]   Well, we knew that, because Europe said they had to.
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:02.400]   But Apple has finally said, yes.
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:06.080]   Did he say, though, Philip, whether it was this year 2015,
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:07.240]   or is it going to be?
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:09.480]   He said he would comply with the law.
[01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:12.120]   He'd comply with the law, whatever that is.
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:14.560]   Joanna Stern was great.
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:16.320]   She got two of them.
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:20.240]   He and Craig Federico for half an hour at a Wall Street
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:20.840]   Journal event.
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:23.920]   She was just working her butt off to try to get them
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:24.840]   to confirm something.
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:26.200]   And that's what she got.
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:29.520]   Otherwise, they kept ducking the questions.
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:33.280]   Talking to Apple is like talking to you like a brick wall
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:35.440]   sometimes, trying to get them to answer anything.
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:36.640]   It's amazing.
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:39.840]   The worst bureaucrats you ever run into.
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:42.640]   I almost always issue interviews
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:47.240]   with chief executive officers and sports figures.
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:49.320]   Musicians are also pretty bad.
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:50.240]   They say nothing.
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:51.560]   They say nothing.
[01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:53.480]   And the CEOs are trained to say nothing.
[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:55.760]   I mean, like, they are adept at saying nothing.
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:56.800]   Politicians too.
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:59.240]   In fact, frankly, you never want to interview anybody
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:01.160]   who you think would be interesting.
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:03.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:06.920]   The most interesting people are just normal people.
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:11.440]   Because they got nothing to hide, I guess.
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:14.120]   I always made it a point to be interesting.
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:15.120]   I thought that was my job.
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:16.240]   Well, you're great.
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:19.520]   Yeah, I'll interview you any day.
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:20.720]   Yeah.
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:23.120]   It's actually an interesting point, though.
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:24.400]   Because it's a good get, right?
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:26.760]   It's prestigious, like Joanna Stern got.
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:28.040]   That's prestigious.
[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:30.040]   But it's murder.
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:34.320]   It's like, they're not going to say anything ever.
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:38.600]   She gave them goody bags of old cables.
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:40.120]   Old life.
[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:42.080]   She's good at the stunts.
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:43.560]   She's the queen of the media stunt.
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:44.560]   Well, she used to have a beyond a twit
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:46.840]   until she became a big shot at Wall Street Journal.
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:50.960]   She became at the Journal because they made her do video,
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:52.600]   the queen of the stunt.
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:54.200]   Yeah.
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:55.400]   I'm wondering.
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:57.680]   She crashed cars to test the--
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:00.880]   She crashed cars to test the watch.
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:02.600]   Yeah.
[01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:04.520]   Which is a stunt.
[01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:05.440]   Yeah.
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:07.080]   And of course, you know about the roller coasters.
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:08.720]   So it's kind of a cool story.
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:10.680]   Yeah, we talked about it a couple of weeks ago is that--
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:12.640]   Oh, you did.
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:15.120]   So I don't know what the upshot I would imagine by now
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:19.960]   the 9/11 centers that are near amusement parks are--
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:23.000]   because you'll get a call from somebody's watch
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.680]   saying, I don't know what happened, but this guy can't be good.
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:28.200]   You better send an ambulance.
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:30.600]   And it turns out the guy was just on the Six Flags roller
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:31.800]   coaster.
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:32.800]   Right.
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:34.200]   All they have to do is say is it a Six Flags?
[01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:36.360]   Oh, it's a roller coaster.
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:39.200]   But then what if somebody died on a roller coaster
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:41.720]   and then they'd show up because they
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:43.240]   thought it was just spurious.
[01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:45.200]   So I don't know what you do.
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:46.360]   You tweak the algorithm.
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:47.480]   That's what you do.
[01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:49.120]   That's right.
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:52.120]   I wonder what do you guys think about government
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:55.960]   mandating an interface like USB-C?
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:58.360]   I thought that was overboard myself.
[01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:00.560]   What would something better than USB-C
[01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:01.600]   comes along?
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:02.520]   Will it be forbidden?
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:04.120]   Because you're just like, we're stuck with this.
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:05.040]   It's the metric system.
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:06.320]   USB-C is a metric system.
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:07.000]   We're with that.
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.360]   They would update it down the line.
[01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:11.040]   But it's one of those things I do remember going on CNBC
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:13.720]   or something like when Lightning was debuting and saying,
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:16.400]   that was 2012, so 10 years ago.
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:18.200]   I was like, USB-C is right there.
[01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:19.720]   Everyone is going to be moving to USB-C.
[01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:22.440]   I don't know why Apple's doing this other thing.
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:24.480]   Now they're forced to do it.
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:28.000]   I think the Lightning connector is at least for me.
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.720]   And my phone's a disaster.
[01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:32.200]   Because I don't know if it's my pockets or what,
[01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:34.760]   but there's always a ton of lint that gets in there.
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:35.280]   That's right.
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:36.040]   Lint gets in there.
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:38.240]   And the connection with the cable
[01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:39.360]   is always a little finicky.
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:43.360]   So now in my car with CarPlay, no matter which cable I use,
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:45.080]   if the phone shifts just a little bit,
[01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:46.920]   I lose my CarPlay entirely because of the way
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:47.880]   Lightning is constructed.
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:49.320]   So yeah, get rid of it.
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:51.520]   USB-C is at least a little stronger, I think.
[01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:54.320]   Doc, it's also the gold we're about.
[01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:55.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:43:55.240 --> 01:43:57.360]   Your point is interesting, Doc, because actually,
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:00.080]   that's what Alex Lindsey on Macbreak Weekly says all the time,
[01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:02.840]   is you don't want government to get involved
[01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:06.120]   in mandating user interface features.
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:10.600]   But at the same time, I argue, and I don't disagree with that.
[01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:12.480]   I mean, the government's the last people.
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:15.720]   It should be specifying tech specs.
[01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:17.920]   But at the same time, there is a benefit, isn't there,
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:19.880]   to having, remember when laptops,
[01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:23.360]   every one of them had a proprietary charger, that was awful.
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:24.560]   Yes, I will.
[01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:27.760]   It will, but the market solved that, I guess.
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:32.400]   Sort of, like USB-C itself is a messy standard.
[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:33.680]   And a lot of people have written about that,
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:36.160]   like different voltages, it's hard to tell, like,
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:38.520]   "Will my laptop charge on this phone charger?"
[01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:39.680]   That's all unclear.
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:43.320]   So USB-C is not a huge win, but I think overall, like,
[01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:44.880]   "Okay, I can plug my phone into this thing.
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:46.040]   Let's see if it charges."
[01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:47.520]   Like at the very least, I could do that.
[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:49.840]   You know, and that's better than lightning and everything.
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:51.600]   I had a call on the radio show asking that
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:52.720]   perfectly legitimate question.
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:56.160]   He says, "I bought a dongle.
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:57.200]   You had a lot of ports on it."
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:44:58.880]   And it had a little tail.
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:02.640]   He says, "I can't reach the back of my computer with his tail.
[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:04.960]   So I'm gonna get a USB-C extender.
[01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:08.560]   But how do I know if the USB-C extender
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:11.040]   will do all the things the dongle will do?"
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:12.320]   And I said, "Well, in theory,
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:14.440]   there should be a silkscreen logo
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:16.920]   that tells you what it does, but nobody does that."
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:19.640]   So the standard calls for it,
[01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:22.080]   but nobody adheres to the standard, I guess.
[01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:24.040]   And so, yeah, you don't know.
[01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:26.600]   And it's not just will it carry data?
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:28.280]   It's, "Well, what speed is it thunderbolt 4,
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:31.800]   thunderbolt 3, USB 2.1, USB 2?
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:33.400]   Does it charge? Does it do video?
[01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:34.240]   What does it do?
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:35.080]   I don't know.
[01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:35.920]   No one could tell.
[01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:36.760]   Just plug it in.
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:37.600]   That's your solution?
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:38.440]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:41.200]   (laughs)
[01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:42.280]   - Okay.
[01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:43.320]   - Let's take a little break.
[01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:45.320]   Dervender's got 10 minutes.
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:47.080]   - Woo!
[01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:48.520]   - 10 minutes. - I'm down.
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:50.440]   - And I'm down to 7% battery, someone who--
[01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:52.760]   - Oh my God, you're just gonna die on us.
[01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:54.600]   (laughs)
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:55.640]   You mean you're, "Oh, your headset."
[01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:56.480]   Oh good, okay.
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:57.320]   - Yeah.
[01:45:57.320 --> 01:45:59.120]   - My segue is down to zero, I'll tell you.
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:02.320]   This speaking tech brought to you today by ExpressVPN.
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:05.760]   What if there was someone out there
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:09.920]   who kept a log of all the things you did online?
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:11.160]   Like you don't even have to show them
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:13.720]   you're in internet history, they already know.
[01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:14.760]   - Well, guess what?
[01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:15.600]   (laughs)
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:17.520]   - Yeah, that's exactly what's happening.
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:19.000]   If you don't use ExpressVPN,
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000]   your internet service provider,
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:24.040]   not only does it, it's legal, they're allowed
[01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:28.120]   to log every website you've ever visited.
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:30.040]   And it is also allowed, in fact, legal
[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:34.360]   to sell that data to anyone, to marketers,
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:35.360]   anyone will pay.
[01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:41.320]   That's just one of many reasons why ExpressVPN is a must.
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:44.800]   Even if you're at home, ExpressVPN rerouts your internet
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:47.360]   connection through their secure servers.
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:50.000]   So it's scrambled, the minute it comes out
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.080]   the back of your computer, your internet service provider
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:54.680]   can't see, can't log what you do online.
[01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:57.400]   They don't see anything, but random noise.
[01:46:57.400 --> 01:47:01.360]   Now, this brings up an important question.
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:03.440]   Well, if I'm routing all my data through a VPN,
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:04.760]   that doesn't that just mean the VPN?
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:06.080]   Can see what I'm doing?
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:08.080]   Can't they do the same thing and log my data?
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:08.920]   You're right.
[01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:13.920]   Many VPNs claim to have a no log policy,
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:16.960]   but they've been caught logging customer activity.
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:19.120]   Even worse free VPNs,
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:21.160]   how do you think they pay for that server?
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:24.160]   They're selling everything they can.
[01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:27.120]   But I love ExpressVPN 'cause they don't.
[01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:28.800]   It's in their privacy policy, we don't log.
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:30.040]   We know they don't log.
[01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:31.840]   They go the extra mile not to log.
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:34.080]   We know they don't log because from time to time
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:37.320]   it's happened many times, especially in countries,
[01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:40.160]   authoritarian countries where they don't need a warrant,
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:42.440]   they'll just come, they happen in Turkey,
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:44.400]   they sieves the server.
[01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:47.040]   No knock, just come in, take the server.
[01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:48.720]   There's never anything on it.
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:51.520]   They're frustrated every single time.
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:53.720]   And that's 'cause ExpressVPN goes the extra mile
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:55.240]   to really protect your privacy.
[01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:58.640]   They use something they designed called Trusted Server.
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:00.600]   In fact, they were the first major VPN provider
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:02.800]   to engineer all their VPN servers,
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:05.720]   these trusted servers to run in RAM only.
[01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:07.440]   They're running completely in RAM.
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:08.840]   When you open the VPN connection,
[01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:11.320]   it spins up the Trusted server in RAM.
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:14.400]   It's sandboxed in RAM so it can't write to the drive.
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:17.120]   And when you close the server, it goes away.
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:19.280]   It's yours and yours alone, no one else is using it
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:22.080]   and it goes away and there's no trace left.
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:23.360]   Nothing left.
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:26.440]   Furthermore, they use a custom Debian install
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:29.440]   that automatically wipes the entire drive
[01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:31.680]   every reboot and they do that every single day.
[01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:34.280]   So even if somehow they were able to write to the drive,
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:36.920]   there'd be nothing left the next day.
[01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:40.200]   It is impossible for their VPN servers
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:42.040]   to store any data including logs
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:43.920]   of any ExpressVPN customer.
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:46.160]   So your privacy is absolutely protected.
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:47.820]   They know that's their business.
[01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:50.360]   You don't even have to take my word
[01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:52.520]   or ExpressVPN word for this.
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:53.800]   They're so confident.
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:56.560]   They know they do this.
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:58.720]   They've actually had PricewaterhouseCoopers
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:00.200]   that one of the biggest assurance companies
[01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:01.920]   in the world, assurance companies in the world,
[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:03.920]   audited it and PricewaterhouseCoopers said,
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:05.320]   "Nope, you're right.
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:10.160]   Trusted server works as explained with their policy
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:12.680]   "their privacy policy is absolutely 100% adhere to.
[01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:14.040]   "They do not log."
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:18.080]   That's why CNET, Wired, TechRadar,
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:20.800]   countless others, rate ExpressVPN number one,
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:23.560]   it's why I use it, it's the only VPN I use.
[01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:26.120]   It's the only one you should use.
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:28.760]   Stop letting people log what you do online.
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:33.760]   Start watching content without any geographic restrictions.
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:36.280]   Start protecting yourself against hackers
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:40.000]   and malicious actors on open Wi-Fi networks at hotels
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.320]   and conferences and coffee shops
[01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:45.280]   and cruise ships, expressvpn.com.

[01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:55.640]   Look, it's not free, I understand.
[01:49:55.640 --> 01:49:58.160]   It's a fair price, it's less than seven bucks a month
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:49:59.840]   and you get the best service.
[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:01.520]   They use that money to make sure
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:03.680]   they rotate IP addresses regularly.
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:08.040]   That's very important for eliminating geographic restrictions.
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:09.920]   They make sure that their servers
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:11.920]   have the fastest connections possible
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:14.960]   so you don't feel like you're bogged down by them.
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:18.120]   I mean, the money goes to a really good cause,

[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:35.120]   We are big fans, the only one I use
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:39.160]   and I have verified personally that they do it right.
[01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:42.760]   Phillip Elmer DeWitt is here, PED 30,
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:45.560]   his battery has been charged.
[01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:46.880]   - About to 8%.
[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:49.120]   (laughing)
[01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:49.960]   Woo!
[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:54.600]   - For a few more minutes, we've got Devender Harder War.
[01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:57.840]   Love having Devender on, he is at Engadget
[01:50:57.840 --> 01:50:59.280]   where he's a senior editor.
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:02.480]   You liked the GTX 4090 didn't you?
[01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:04.800]   - I mean, I sure,
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:06.240]   it's crazy powerful.
[01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:07.760]   I don't think anybody should buy it.
[01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:10.280]   You know, I don't think a sane person,
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:13.520]   you know, would probably wait for the 4080 and the 4070,
[01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:15.280]   but it is very nice.
[01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:17.680]   It's like having a Ferrari to sit in my garage
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:20.560]   and I'm like, well, I can't deny it's a very fast car.
[01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:23.840]   - It's kind of the opposite of what Nvidia has done
[01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:26.920]   in the past, usually they'll release like the 3080
[01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:28.840]   and then they'll do the titanium version,
[01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:30.840]   they'll slowly release better versions.
[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:32.160]   They're doing it the other way around.
[01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:33.000]   This is the top part.
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.520]   - I think because they needed the like big headline
[01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:38.640]   of like just how fricking fast this thing is,
[01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:41.040]   whereas the others may not be as big a leap
[01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:44.280]   between the 3000 series GPU, so you know,
[01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:46.080]   it kind of makes sense in that respect.
[01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:50.800]   - Yeah, how did you, your review says unholy power.
[01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:52.840]   - Oh yeah, I forgot to root that.
[01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:56.920]   It's just so, I had to upgrade my power supply.
[01:51:56.920 --> 01:51:58.080]   - Well, that's what I was asking.
[01:51:58.080 --> 01:51:59.200]   - Yeah, how did you review it?
[01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:00.800]   You put it in your computer?
[01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:01.640]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:03.440]   - I mean, I was once I saw, so first of all,
[01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:06.120]   we don't typically get the like 90 series GPU
[01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:08.000]   reviewed and gadget, like we're not as cool.
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.040]   It's like some of the other PC hardware folks.
[01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:13.000]   But once I saw that was coming, I was like, okay, well,
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:16.040]   I have a 750 watt power supply right now.
[01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:17.440]   That's probably not gonna be enough.
[01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:19.520]   And also I was rebuilding my system
[01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:21.520]   for the new AMD chips as well.
[01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:23.200]   So I was doing this whole rebuild,
[01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:25.080]   I was like gotta get at least a thousand watts.
[01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:28.800]   Once, that was fine, like setting that whole thing up.
[01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:33.800]   The 4090 required for the power connectors.
[01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:38.960]   - And we've heard from some sources that these melt sometimes.
[01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:40.280]   - The adapter they're using,
[01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:43.560]   because there's just so much power coming out of that thing
[01:52:43.560 --> 01:52:45.160]   for a couple of people has melted.
[01:52:45.160 --> 01:52:46.000]   - That's impressive though.
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.160]   - A newer power supply. - A few melted,
[01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:48.000]   your powers.
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.280]   - It's too much.
[01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:53.480]   It feels like you're, you know,
[01:52:53.480 --> 01:52:54.840]   dock in back to the future.
[01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:56.000]   It just feels like a crazy thing.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.960]   I don't know if I should be plugging
[01:52:57.960 --> 01:52:59.960]   any of these things in because this,
[01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:01.760]   first of all, this graphics card is so big.
[01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:03.800]   It's almost as wide as my entire case.
[01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:07.000]   It's just a crazy experience.
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:08.280]   If you have a newer power supply,
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:09.600]   you can use one cable.
[01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:12.360]   And actually just learning my modular power supply has like,
[01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:14.320]   I can buy an extra cable to kind of do it
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:15.800]   for the new power supply standard.
[01:53:15.800 --> 01:53:20.440]   So you newer ones will be okay, hopefully, you know?
[01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:23.160]   - I, in a way, I like this Apple does this once in a while
[01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:24.720]   where a company says, okay,
[01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:26.680]   what would you do if there were no limits?
[01:53:26.680 --> 01:53:28.760]   Like we didn't worry about what the street price
[01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:29.680]   was gonna end up being.
[01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:31.840]   We just put in the best technology we had.
[01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:33.280]   What would that look like?
[01:53:33.280 --> 01:53:35.200]   And I mean, most, you know what,
[01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:37.080]   GPU's are one of those things I could see people
[01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:39.320]   spend in 16 hundred bucks for the 40-50.
[01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:40.160]   - Sure.
[01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:41.200]   Especially if it's part of your business,
[01:53:41.200 --> 01:53:43.200]   if you're encoding video or in the Ring 3D,
[01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:46.280]   it's like that is a, that's gonna save you time
[01:53:46.280 --> 01:53:47.640]   and save you money ultimately, right?
[01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:48.600]   So it's worth it.
[01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:49.960]   - Yeah.
[01:53:49.960 --> 01:53:52.480]   It's, it's hysterical.
[01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:53.320]   - Gamers don't need it.
[01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:54.160]   I could say this is--
[01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:55.000]   - Oh, really?
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:55.840]   - 'Cause that's what I would need.
[01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:57.960]   - That's what I would thought would be interested in this.
[01:53:57.960 --> 01:53:58.800]   Not gamers.
[01:53:58.800 --> 01:54:00.040]   - This is more of like a Titan,
[01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:01.640]   for people who are buying Titan cards,
[01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:03.680]   this is probably a better alternative to that.
[01:54:03.680 --> 01:54:04.520]   - Okay.
[01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:06.640]   It's for Blender and, you know,
[01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:08.360]   cinema 4D and stuff like that.
[01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:09.200]   - Yeah.
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:10.200]   - Okay, I get it.
[01:54:10.200 --> 01:54:13.400]   - Do you wanna take off to Vendra?
[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:16.320]   I don't wanna keep you here if your daughter is--
[01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:17.160]   - I'll, I'll, I'll just,
[01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:19.800]   we're in the middle of bath time and baby put down time
[01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:21.160]   and gonna make sure my daughter's okay.
[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:24.200]   So, but yeah, I do miss doing long twits
[01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:25.600]   'cause since my son was born,
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:27.040]   I haven't been able to do a twit, I believe.
[01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:28.760]   So, you know, it's been fun chatting.
[01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:29.600]   - Yeah.
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:31.080]   - Aw, it was nice to meet you.
[01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:32.000]   Come back sometime.
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.040]   - Nice to see you all.
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:35.240]   - When your kids are in Vegas or something.
[01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:37.880]   - Just, you know, once things have settled down
[01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:39.320]   a little bit, but yeah,
[01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:40.760]   yeah, let's do a family trip to Vegas.
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:42.840]   That'll be, I opening for everybody, right?
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:44.080]   - Oh my God.
[01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:45.200]   - Oh my God.
[01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:46.040]   - Oh my God.
[01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:47.040]   Thank you to Vendra.
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:47.880]   Great to see you. - Thank you folks.
[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:52.640]   - Vendra Hardware, senior editor at Engadget.com
[01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:54.400]   and a great, great guy.
[01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:55.800]   We love you.
[01:54:55.800 --> 01:54:56.640]   Have fun. - Thank you.
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:54:58.920]   - Half time, I miss Bathtime.
[01:54:58.920 --> 01:54:59.760]   That was fun.
[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:00.760]   I always liked it.
[01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:01.600]   - I always liked it.
[01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:02.480]   - Especially when the kids were really little
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:05.840]   and they could bathe together and it was just so cute.
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:06.760]   It was so fun.
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:12.400]   Wired magazine in their ideas section.
[01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:16.800]   And I thought, I've got two senior statesmen
[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:19.080]   of the technology industry here.
[01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:21.040]   Three of you include me.
[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:22.960]   Now that we got rid of the kid,
[01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:24.880]   we could talk.
[01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:25.880]   I wanna talk about this.
[01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:28.320]   Doc Serrels, Philip Elmer DeWitt.
[01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:31.200]   I thought this was a really interesting article
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:35.000]   that really pinpoints, I think a larger problem
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:38.240]   in the tech industry.
[01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:40.520]   Oh now I have to, by the way, here's another problem.
[01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:41.800]   I've got to log in.
[01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:44.680]   Okay.
[01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:46.920]   I should have done this beforehand.
[01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:48.480]   But the premise is,
[01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:50.760]   when you have an entire tech industry,
[01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:53.880]   set up along the notion
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:55.920]   that in order to make it,
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:56:00.440]   you have to raise money with VC companies
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:03.480]   who then are going to put a lot of pressure on you
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:04.600]   to make an exit.
[01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:07.840]   That maybe ultimately,
[01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:11.000]   this isn't the best way to run a company.
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:12.640]   And it kind of got me thinking,
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:16.000]   not just about that in tech companies,
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:20.200]   but companies in general that are motivated,
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:23.000]   that feel like their business
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:27.280]   is to make money for the stakeholders
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:29.280]   not to serve customers.
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:33.760]   Now that's not a problem when those two goals are aligned.
[01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:37.200]   But if they're not, and sometimes they're not,
[01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:41.560]   then it's a bad for customers, it's a bad experience.
[01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:44.880]   The author of this, actually authors,
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:47.040]   just three people, Pia Mancini,
[01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:49.920]   who's the CEO and co-founder at Open Collective
[01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:52.360]   and chair of the Democracy Earth Foundation.
[01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:54.280]   That gives you an idea where we're going with this.
[01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:57.760]   Alana Irving, an open source developer,
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:01.000]   who also builds tools for communities
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.480]   for radical participation and cooperation.
[01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:05.160]   And Nathan Hewitt,
[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:06.440]   who's in New York City-based
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:09.680]   fiscal sponsorship professional governance nerd,
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:12.640]   local activist and ambient musician,
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:14.880]   all three, I think, very progressive.
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:16.640]   Say startups find themselves stuck
[01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:18.960]   between a rock and a hard place.
[01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:21.760]   They need funding to make something special.
[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:25.040]   But their only options are infinite growth
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:27.520]   or to escape, to sell.
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:31.160]   The options for selling, also known as exiting or limited,
[01:57:31.160 --> 01:57:34.000]   companies can either go public via an IPO,
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.160]   or work to be purchased by another company
[01:57:36.160 --> 01:57:38.160]   through an acquisition in both cases.
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:40.520]   If that's your target,
[01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:42.160]   the companies at risk of losing focus
[01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:43.640]   and being beholden to stakeholders
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:47.280]   that do not include the communities served.
[01:57:48.680 --> 01:57:52.600]   They propose, an open collective is behind this,
[01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:55.680]   a different idea where essentially,
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:58.360]   the exit is you sell to your customers.
[01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:00.760]   So the example here with Twitter
[01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:04.280]   would be instead of selling to the richest man in the world,
[01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:07.600]   what if Twitter somehow could figure out a way
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:09.400]   to sell it to the users
[01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:15.440]   and then be responsible for serving the users,
[01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:18.000]   not the financial markets.
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:18.840]   What do you think, Doc?
[01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:21.120]   - Oh boy.
[01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:25.920]   The first thing that Joe was back to me with is,
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:28.040]   I was at a party in like 1999,
[01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:32.680]   and there was this guy who was a young entrepreneur,
[01:58:32.680 --> 01:58:35.040]   and he said, and he had,
[01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:36.400]   I asked somebody who was doing, he said,
[01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:38.920]   "We're an arms merchant to the portals industry,
[01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:40.280]   back when portals were a thing."
[01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:42.720]   And I said, "That's an industry?"
[01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:44.440]   And I asked a bunch of tough questions.
[01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:46.560]   I finally asked, "How are sales?"
[01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:47.480]   And he said, "They're great.
[01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:51.360]   We just closed our second round of financing for $25 million."
[01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:53.880]   And even though I already knew this,
[01:58:53.880 --> 01:58:55.600]   what came across to me is that,
[01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:57.760]   "Wow, every company has two markets,
[01:58:57.760 --> 01:59:00.640]   one for its goods and services and the other for itself."
[01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:04.880]   And what happened is that this happened
[01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:06.640]   in Silicon Valley for decades,
[01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:09.360]   where the second one, where the value of the company itself
[01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:11.600]   overcomes the value of whatever the company's goods
[01:59:11.600 --> 01:59:12.840]   and services are.
[01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:16.040]   And so that's one thing that just sort of sticks
[01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:17.040]   in my mind about this.
[01:59:17.040 --> 01:59:19.280]   And another is that there's, there was these state,
[01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:23.600]   I mean, I don't think most investors want necessarily
[01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:24.600]   you to go straight to exit.
[01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:26.840]   Although often you get that question, what's your exit?
[01:59:26.840 --> 01:59:28.560]   You know, like, I don't have an exit.
[01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:30.080]   I just wanna grow the thing,
[01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:31.520]   is that, but there are these stages
[01:59:31.520 --> 01:59:32.360]   that companies go through,
[01:59:32.360 --> 01:59:35.360]   which are like new, hot and big, and they're very different.
[01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:39.160]   And I think most of the time when you're talking about
[01:59:39.160 --> 01:59:41.200]   exit, it's when things are not going that well.
[01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:43.440]   So I wonder, Philip, is that true?
[01:59:43.440 --> 01:59:46.360]   That if you look for like a word cloud
[01:59:46.360 --> 01:59:48.160]   where exit suddenly gets really big,
[01:59:48.160 --> 01:59:50.200]   is it not when companies are in trouble?
[01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:53.840]   No, I don't think it's necessarily that.
[01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:57.560]   I agree that it's not a good situation
[01:59:57.560 --> 02:00:02.000]   because if you're aiming for an exit strategy,
[02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:07.000]   well, if an IPO, at least the product continues.
[02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.520]   If you're looking to be acquired,
[02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:13.720]   often the product disappears, they're buying the IP
[02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:15.400]   or they're buying the talent.
[02:00:15.400 --> 02:00:21.400]   So it's very, very far removed from serving the users.
[02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:22.960]   I hate to keep going back to Apple,
[02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:24.480]   but that's what I know about.
[02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:27.040]   One of the things that made it great
[02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:29.640]   was they're focused on the user experience.
[02:00:29.640 --> 02:00:34.640]   They made an effort to make this stuff relatively easy to use.
[02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:39.480]   They had what your experience was gonna be like,
[02:00:39.480 --> 02:00:41.840]   as part of their design strategy.
[02:00:41.840 --> 02:00:43.880]   I think they've gotten away from that.
[02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:46.920]   The iPhone is incredibly complicated now
[02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:49.440]   and has a much higher learning curve than it did,
[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:52.160]   but at least they were initially focused on that.
[02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:54.000]   Now they're more about money.
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:57.240]   Let me go ahead.
[02:00:57.240 --> 02:01:00.280]   Talk, I'm thinking about your premise
[02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:05.200]   that the exit to sale is always a sign of a company
[02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:05.880]   not doing well.
[02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:08.160]   I'm thinking about some of the big exits
[02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:10.680]   we know of YouTube selling to Google.
[02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:12.520]   That probably was necessary.
[02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:15.560]   YouTube couldn't succeed as a small company
[02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:17.800]   because they were gonna get sued out of existence.
[02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:21.040]   Maybe not WhatsApp, which was a tiny company selling
[02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:24.520]   to Facebook or Instagram for a billion dollars to Facebook.
[02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:26.280]   Again, tiny companies,
[02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:28.200]   probably very glad to get the big check.
[02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:30.960]   Here's the counter example though, this is more recent.
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:34.840]   Adobe just bought Figma for $20 billion.
[02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:37.240]   Figma was not suffering.
[02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:39.720]   Figma was about to kill Adobe.
[02:01:39.720 --> 02:01:44.680]   Now there's always, I'm sure the founders had reasons.
[02:01:44.680 --> 02:01:48.200]   But the reason wasn't, oh God, we're in trouble.
[02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:50.360]   The reason probably was more like
[02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:52.760]   (laughing)
[02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:56.640]   20 billion, six comma club.
[02:01:56.640 --> 02:02:00.000]   It was so much money that they couldn't say no.
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:01.280]   And I think that happens too.
[02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:03.160]   So it isn't an exit.
[02:02:03.160 --> 02:02:05.880]   And now I don't think Figma was built to be acquired by the way.
[02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:07.960]   I doubt very much it was built to be acquired.
[02:02:07.960 --> 02:02:09.800]   I don't know what their plans were.
[02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:13.120]   But they certainly had a big day.
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:14.520]   It's just a sense that I had.
[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:16.600]   I don't know.
[02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:20.800]   I mean, there's plenty of examples of all these things.
[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:23.720]   And of course, I've dealt over the years with a lot of startups
[02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:26.400]   'cause I kind of like push along new ideas
[02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:27.720]   that some people pick up on them.
[02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:29.000]   Most of fail.
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:30.160]   And they're always looking for an exit
[02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:31.520]   before they hit the ground.
[02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:33.600]   Oh, so you have a lot of experience with that.
[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:34.960]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:36.160]   There's no IPO ad huge.
[02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:37.000]   It's biased.
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:37.840]   Yeah.
[02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:38.680]   Well, exactly.
[02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:40.000]   When there's not an IPO, it's like,
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:45.120]   well, maybe there's some money company or something could buy us
[02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:47.120]   or there was some other exit.
[02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:51.680]   No, being a founder myself,
[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:54.160]   there was never gonna be an IPO for Twit.
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:58.880]   But as Headwind started to stir up with the ad market
[02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:01.920]   because Spotify and iHeart and Amazon
[02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:04.800]   were killing the RSS podcast market
[02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:07.280]   by taking these, buying up these companies,
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:10.240]   buying up these shows and making them exclusive.
[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:13.720]   Advertisers suddenly said, well,
[02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:16.840]   you know, I can tell you exactly who's listened to my ad
[02:03:16.840 --> 02:03:20.800]   on Joe Rogan 'cause it's through Spotify, the app.
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:22.720]   And so it's worth a million dollars.
[02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:25.160]   And I'm not gonna buy Twit because what do you know
[02:03:25.160 --> 02:03:26.280]   about your audience?
[02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:27.600]   Nothing.
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:31.280]   I know they're subscribed to our RSS feed.
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:34.160]   So we too, for that very reason,
[02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:35.680]   kind of seeing these Headwinds coming,
[02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:37.320]   unfortunately, pandemic killed us.
[02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:38.200]   But we thought about me,
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:40.520]   and we should probably try to get acquired by these guys
[02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:42.120]   'cause at some point,
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:44.120]   it's, and that point is rapidly coming
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:46.400]   where it's almost impossible to sell ads
[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:48.680]   because any advertiser is gonna say,
[02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:51.000]   well, why should I buy an ad from you?
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.640]   You can't tell me anything about who's listening.
[02:03:53.640 --> 02:03:56.360]   This is a gigantic moral question.
[02:03:56.360 --> 02:03:58.520]   And of course, this is something I dwell on
[02:03:58.520 --> 02:03:59.760]   almost exclusively.
[02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:04.440]   Which is that it is morally wrong to follow people
[02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:06.360]   without their invitation or a court order.
[02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:09.840]   And there's a trillion, $2 trillion business based on that.
[02:04:09.840 --> 02:04:11.440]   And that's what's going on with Spotify
[02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:12.800]   and the rest of that, I suppose.
[02:04:12.800 --> 02:04:15.280]   I've been following them so much, but.
[02:04:15.280 --> 02:04:18.040]   You don't Spotify spent half a billion dollars
[02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:19.600]   acquiring ad tech.
[02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:21.520]   I know for the time, I answered it.
[02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:22.360]   Right.
[02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:23.320]   Did they, is that what they did?
[02:04:23.320 --> 02:04:26.280]   I mean, I could see acquiring the ringer.
[02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:28.760]   I mean, I think they wanted to be in the podcast business.
[02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:31.880]   But then more than that, they acquired Anchor FM,
[02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:33.200]   capability to make podcasts.
[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:35.080]   They acquired Charitable and Pod sites.
[02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:38.120]   The tracking, the ad tracking companies that we used
[02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:40.800]   and then pulled the plug for us.
[02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:42.840]   They said, "Now you can't use us anymore."
[02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:45.120]   So they're going vertical and exclusive.
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:46.880]   Yeah, they're killing pod.
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:50.920]   They're literally killing RSS based podcasting.
[02:04:50.920 --> 02:04:51.920]   By acquiring it all.
[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:54.200]   And you don't spend half a billion dollars to acquire stuff
[02:04:54.200 --> 02:04:58.320]   like that, and useless, you have a pretty good plan
[02:04:58.320 --> 02:04:59.960]   to monetize it.
[02:04:59.960 --> 02:05:03.400]   Well, so, okay, so I listened to a bunch of ringer podcasts,
[02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:06.080]   especially, and all of the ads that I don't think,
[02:05:06.080 --> 02:05:08.440]   those any of the ads that I hear there are personalized.
[02:05:08.440 --> 02:05:11.880]   They're generally people like, if it's Bill Simmons,
[02:05:11.880 --> 02:05:14.160]   he's like, "You, you're talking about ExpressVPN
[02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:16.320]   "or one of the other sponsors."
[02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:20.160]   And a lot of them are fan dual, of course,
[02:05:20.160 --> 02:05:22.720]   because they're kind of gambling oriented.
[02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:25.200]   But I have a sense that they're personalized at all.
[02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:26.040]   To you.
[02:05:26.040 --> 02:05:30.440]   But they are personalized to the sports fan
[02:05:30.440 --> 02:05:32.200]   who would be listening to those shows, I guess.
[02:05:32.200 --> 02:05:34.080]   Well, I mean, if it's generalized that way,
[02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:35.680]   and I don't mind them finding out,
[02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:37.760]   I mean, I don't mind them knowing
[02:05:37.760 --> 02:05:39.480]   that I skipped over the ads.
[02:05:39.480 --> 02:05:43.320]   But I don't want them knowing it's necessarily me.
[02:05:43.320 --> 02:05:44.960]   And I don't know what that-- They do, because--
[02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:46.720]   I don't know what the feedback there is.
[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:48.600]   You know, and I mean, of course,
[02:05:48.600 --> 02:05:50.880]   I'm listening generally on Apple's thing,
[02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:52.960]   and though it's sometimes I listen to overcast,
[02:05:52.960 --> 02:05:54.400]   or one of the others downcast.
[02:05:54.400 --> 02:05:56.360]   Oh, so as long as you can still listen to--
[02:05:56.360 --> 02:05:59.360]   If I'm skipping forward on something besides Spotify,
[02:05:59.360 --> 02:06:00.760]   they have a full of-- I know list on Spotify.
[02:06:00.760 --> 02:06:02.080]   I've never listed this--
[02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:03.560]   Then you are a no-one Spotify.
[02:06:03.560 --> 02:06:06.360]   But understand Spotify's goal as they did with Joe Ruggs.
[02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:08.720]   I know, they want to suck in the market.
[02:06:08.720 --> 02:06:10.920]   Right. And what are the reasons that I, you know,
[02:06:10.920 --> 02:06:13.240]   I mean, something I have a trouble with,
[02:06:13.240 --> 02:06:16.160]   less with sports than with some other topics,
[02:06:16.160 --> 02:06:19.480]   is that an penalty because sports is evanescent,
[02:06:19.480 --> 02:06:22.080]   and it's of no interest two weeks or five weeks from now.
[02:06:22.080 --> 02:06:26.320]   But I don't like that all of a sudden
[02:06:26.320 --> 02:06:29.720]   all of the archives are available only to subscribers.
[02:06:29.720 --> 02:06:31.200]   You know, I don't like that.
[02:06:31.200 --> 02:06:33.240]   And I suppose that's the case with Joe Ruggs as well.
[02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:35.120]   There will come a day with Ringer
[02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:37.320]   where you will have to download the Spotify app
[02:06:37.320 --> 02:06:39.000]   if you want to keep listening.
[02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:40.720]   Yeah, and I mean, I will do it.
[02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:41.240]   It's a--
[02:06:41.240 --> 02:06:43.880]   That's actually supposedly, and I--
[02:06:43.880 --> 02:06:47.480]   It's hard to confirm this because it's an internal thing.
[02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:49.600]   But I have seen some evidence, and it's
[02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:54.480]   kind of inductive reasoning that Joe Ruggins' influences
[02:06:54.480 --> 02:06:57.640]   dropped when he went exclusive, which they think
[02:06:57.640 --> 02:06:59.160]   is evidence that the audience dropped,
[02:06:59.160 --> 02:07:01.520]   because there are many people who would not continue to listen
[02:07:01.520 --> 02:07:04.960]   if you had to get a podcast app to listen other than the one
[02:07:04.960 --> 02:07:05.800]   they liked.
[02:07:05.800 --> 02:07:06.300]   Yeah.
[02:07:06.300 --> 02:07:07.520]   And maybe that would happen with Ringer too.
[02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:09.960]   Maybe in fact, that's why Spotify hasn't moved Ringer
[02:07:09.960 --> 02:07:11.720]   to an exclusive deal yet.
[02:07:11.720 --> 02:07:13.080]   They did right away with Ruggin.
[02:07:13.080 --> 02:07:15.840]   They even took him off YouTube.
[02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:17.520]   So to get back to my original premise,
[02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:24.560]   Figma, which has devoted users, loved it, sold to Adobe.
[02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:27.280]   Adobe had to make the acquisition
[02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:31.480]   because Figma was basically eating their lunch.
[02:07:31.480 --> 02:07:33.800]   Users are unhappy about this.
[02:07:33.800 --> 02:07:36.000]   This is how it works.
[02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:39.000]   Wouldn't it be nice if there had been some sort of way
[02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:43.200]   that the community that users, Figma, could have acquired it
[02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:47.280]   and control it and keep Figma focused on its customers
[02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:50.640]   instead of focused on making money for Adobe?
[02:07:50.640 --> 02:07:54.680]   That's the premise of this wired editorial.
[02:07:54.680 --> 02:07:58.480]   The SEC doesn't get involved when someone like Adobe
[02:07:58.480 --> 02:08:00.440]   buys its competitor.
[02:08:00.440 --> 02:08:04.000]   Oh, there will definitely be regulatory approval.
[02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:05.280]   I'm sure on this.
[02:08:05.280 --> 02:08:09.840]   You look, Facebook just told they can't buy Giffy by the UK.
[02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:13.120]   So that deal is off for that very reason.
[02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:15.160]   It's anti-competitive.
[02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:18.400]   Facebook/meta.
[02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:19.960]   Yeah, maybe Figma, maybe that'll be stopped.
[02:08:19.960 --> 02:08:21.280]   But let's face it.
[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:27.040]   If you're relying on the US government or EU or the UK
[02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:31.240]   to protect consumer interests in these acquisitions,
[02:08:31.240 --> 02:08:35.080]   you've been mightily disappointed over the last 40 years.
[02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:38.520]   There's been no success in that area.
[02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:42.520]   I think the challenge of getting the users to everybody
[02:08:42.520 --> 02:08:45.760]   to pony up would be huge.
[02:08:45.760 --> 02:08:47.000]   I mean, think about it.
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:50.240]   If every Twitter user was invited to buy Twitter,
[02:08:50.240 --> 02:08:53.320]   all you have to do is throw in 10 bucks,
[02:08:53.320 --> 02:08:56.440]   I'd be surprised if 10% responded.
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:08:56.880]   Yeah.
[02:08:56.880 --> 02:08:58.760]   I mean, in a way, that's what a pay wall is.
[02:08:58.760 --> 02:09:02.000]   That's what a subscription fee is.
[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:06.120]   You're counting on your users to support you.
[02:09:06.120 --> 02:09:09.640]   But I guess the users, no matter how much they paid for Figma,
[02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:12.160]   couldn't come up with $20 billion.
[02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:14.240]   So the community probably could either.
[02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:15.320]   Yeah.
[02:09:15.320 --> 02:09:17.120]   Yeah, I don't think it's a--
[02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:18.320]   It's not a viable option.
[02:09:18.320 --> 02:09:21.160]   But a related fact, though, it's not a fact.
[02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:22.760]   It's a supposition in my part.
[02:09:22.760 --> 02:09:25.880]   But I think it's correct, is that Wired has gotten better
[02:09:25.880 --> 02:09:26.440]   lately.
[02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:27.280]   And I think it's--
[02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:28.240]   This is a really interesting piece.
[02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:29.480]   I agree with that.
[02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:30.480]   It's gotten better and better.
[02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:32.240]   And since Gideon Lichfield got there,
[02:09:32.240 --> 02:09:33.560]   he was at Quartz before that.
[02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:34.640]   I knew him through that.
[02:09:34.640 --> 02:09:36.160]   But I actually have one link over here.
[02:09:36.160 --> 02:09:38.080]   There's a Wired that I've immediately--
[02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:39.240]   Actually, wait a minute.
[02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:40.240]   What a magazine--
[02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:41.800]   They still have a--
[02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:42.800]   They still do that.
[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:43.280]   I still get it.
[02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:44.280]   I get that.
[02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:45.080]   Yeah, I get that.
[02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:48.080]   It's not real thick, you'll see.
[02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:51.120]   But they're actually selling actual ads to companies.
[02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:53.600]   And that's cool.
[02:09:53.600 --> 02:09:56.840]   But the quality of the editorial
[02:09:56.840 --> 02:09:57.680]   in it is getting better and better.
[02:09:57.680 --> 02:09:58.680]   I agree with you.
[02:09:58.680 --> 02:10:00.000]   And I like that.
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.720]   Is the legibility of the page getting better?
[02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:04.040]   No.
[02:10:04.040 --> 02:10:06.920]   It's always a triumph of design over Readability
[02:10:06.920 --> 02:10:08.880]   always has been.
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:12.880]   And so the day glow colors, the type
[02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:14.800]   that falls off the page and stuff like that.
[02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:19.880]   I have to say Wired is doing what many paywall magazines
[02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:22.000]   do, which is essentially saying, look,
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.680]   just buy access to the digital content.
[02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:25.600]   We'll throw in the print version.
[02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:26.680]   It's probably true.
[02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:28.960]   Right?
[02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:33.400]   Yeah, I get Barron's and Business Week.
[02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:37.240]   They come into my mailbox every week or month.
[02:10:37.240 --> 02:10:38.360]   And I have to throw them away.
[02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:39.720]   I don't want them.
[02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:40.200]   Yeah.
[02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:41.800]   I don't want them.
[02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:44.640]   Please don't send me the Paper Magazine.
[02:10:44.640 --> 02:10:46.640]   I got the Atlantic for the same reason,
[02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:49.800]   because you're buying the digital access.
[02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:52.040]   And they just kind of, look, just please,
[02:10:52.040 --> 02:10:55.240]   take the print edition, please.
[02:10:55.240 --> 02:10:56.280]   I don't want them.
[02:10:56.280 --> 02:10:57.440]   Who wants them anymore?
[02:10:57.440 --> 02:10:59.800]   My mom, my mom, bless your soul.
[02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:03.360]   90 years old or will be in January,
[02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:06.960]   bought me the New York Review of Books for a whole year.
[02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:07.960]   Oh, boy.
[02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:08.880]   Is this still in paper?
[02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:10.000]   Is this still on newsprint?
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:10.920]   Is this still on newsprint?
[02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:15.640]   On newsprint, it's a tabloid size, it's huge.
[02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:16.400]   It's hard to read.
[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:17.320]   It's hard to read.
[02:11:17.320 --> 02:11:19.040]   It's really tiny print.
[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:23.840]   And it was hard for me to say this to her, but I said,
[02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:26.280]   "Mom, I'm just going to read it online if you don't mind.
[02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:28.880]   I don't get me the print edition.
[02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:29.920]   Thank you."
[02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:31.440]   But no.
[02:11:31.440 --> 02:11:33.440]   The thing is that I mean, and this is--
[02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:35.920]   I mean, I'm close to alone.
[02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:37.080]   You guys are with me, I think.
[02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:39.920]   At least I know you are, Leo, which is that I--
[02:11:39.920 --> 02:11:42.400]   what I like about the Wired magazine, or like any print
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:44.840]   magazine is I know I'm not being followed.
[02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:47.840]   I'm not being spied on with that thing.
[02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:52.800]   And I have to, while Elle Prays Condi Nast for managing
[02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:55.800]   Wired Well and hiring the right people and all that,
[02:11:55.800 --> 02:11:57.680]   their subscription system sucks.
[02:11:57.680 --> 02:11:59.200]   Oh, it's awful, horrible.
[02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:03.000]   And on top of that, they tracked it, living that out of you.
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:04.400]   And it's just wrong.
[02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:05.400]   It's just wrong.
[02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:08.280]   And that's the way advertising is done right now.
[02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:10.840]   I actually wonder, going back to the start of the show,
[02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:17.000]   whether or not that stock drop for meta and Amazon and Alphabet
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.480]   had anything to do with the fact that Apple is doing a really
[02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:22.480]   good job on at least talking privacy well.
[02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:23.200]   With ATT.
[02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:24.200]   And--
[02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:26.400]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:29.800]   I mean, to tell the truth, I mean, I'm an absolutist.
[02:12:29.800 --> 02:12:34.360]   There should never have been an advertising ID on a phone,
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:34.760]   ever.
[02:12:34.760 --> 02:12:36.160]   It shouldn't have ever been there.
[02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:38.320]   They put it there when they were into business.
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:41.320]   Here's your advertising identifier.
[02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:42.600]   I don't want that.
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:44.920]   I think most people are actually wouldn't.
[02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:46.280]   But there it is.
[02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:51.400]   But anyway, as several of that business has to collapse.
[02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:52.920]   The ATT definitely heard--
[02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:55.440]   I mean, Facebook, it was really clear.
[02:12:55.440 --> 02:13:02.040]   I find myself saying, OK, OK, give me your cookies.
[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:05.120]   It's just too much work.
[02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:06.320]   We have to work together.
[02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:08.920]   You know, poem beneath the Statue of Liberty.
[02:13:08.920 --> 02:13:12.000]   Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled nasses,
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:13.640]   your cookies.
[02:13:13.640 --> 02:13:14.600]   We'll take them all.
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:15.400]   Yeah, we'll take them all.
[02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:17.640]   Well, I heard a good one the other day, which is, well, look,
[02:13:17.640 --> 02:13:18.280]   it's not cancer.
[02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:19.040]   It's only fleas.
[02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:20.160]   Everybody's covered in fleas.
[02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:21.360]   It's fleas.
[02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:22.760]   But there's a trillion--
[02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:25.080]   There's a $2 trillion business in fleas.
[02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:26.520]   So put up with this--
[02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:27.040]   It's face me.
[02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:28.640]   You live with face me.
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:31.240]   You know they're there.
[02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:32.640]   What are you going to do?
[02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:33.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:36.520]   It's-- they're ricky.
[02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:38.280]   But I-- but I've--
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:39.920]   you know, I mean, there are so many people
[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:41.640]   you could have on the show to talk about this.
[02:13:41.640 --> 02:13:44.280]   It's not me, but-- because they have the numbers.
[02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:46.160]   But for the most part, they sh-- doesn't work.
[02:13:46.160 --> 02:13:47.280]   It actually doesn't work.
[02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:48.560]   That's why-- that's exactly right.
[02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:49.080]   If you say that--
[02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:50.000]   It actually does not work.
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:51.200]   --regarding you.
[02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:53.200]   That could be because they're not tracking you.
[02:13:53.200 --> 02:13:55.560]   But it's much more likely because their targeting
[02:13:55.560 --> 02:13:57.080]   doesn't work that well.
[02:13:57.080 --> 02:14:00.800]   Well, yeah, I mean, I've always liked the fact
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:03.440]   that the sports section of the newspaper
[02:14:03.440 --> 02:14:06.360]   was sponsored by car dealers and tire sellers.
[02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:07.080]   That's great.
[02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:10.880]   I mean, I-- and I-- and I think that--
[02:14:10.880 --> 02:14:12.840]   I mean, there's a wonderful piece written
[02:14:12.840 --> 02:14:17.080]   by Ambler and Hollier, two researchers, like 20 years ago,
[02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:18.640]   called the-- the waste and--
[02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:21.200]   the waste and advertising is the part that works.
[02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:24.400]   Like, I know the 50 minutes will save me 15% with GEICO.
[02:14:24.400 --> 02:14:25.520]   I don't have GEICO.
[02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:26.040]   Yeah.
[02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:28.840]   But GEICO is in my brain because I've heard that 1,000 times.
[02:14:28.840 --> 02:14:32.640]   And you can't let go of the jingle where they say the name
[02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:33.680]   of the company four times.
[02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:34.080]   And that's it.
[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:36.360]   Liberty, Liberty, Liberty, Liberty.
[02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:37.280]   And that's it.
[02:14:37.280 --> 02:14:37.760]   That's it.
[02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:38.840]   Yeah, the farmers thing.
[02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:41.480]   And I mean, the insurance people are doing the best job.
[02:14:41.480 --> 02:14:42.040]   They're so good.
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:44.160]   GEICO was nowhere before they advertised.
[02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:45.120]   Like, they do.
[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:49.340]   And it's-- I mean, the creative advertising
[02:14:49.340 --> 02:14:50.680]   actually works for making brands.
[02:14:50.680 --> 02:14:53.760]   Most of the brands you know were made by advertising.
[02:14:53.760 --> 02:14:54.680]   There are a few exceptions.
[02:14:54.680 --> 02:14:56.120]   Like Trader Joe's and Zara.
[02:14:56.120 --> 02:14:58.320]   But for the most part, a lot of advertising
[02:14:58.320 --> 02:14:58.920]   bought that.
[02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:00.640]   And because the sponsor shows.
[02:15:00.640 --> 02:15:04.000]   It's what pays too much money to all the athletes you like.
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.480]   That's old-fashioned advertising.
[02:15:06.480 --> 02:15:09.680]   But it's because the world is digital now
[02:15:09.680 --> 02:15:12.840]   and because we could be spied on everybody in the ad business.
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:15.200]   The most quoted thing I've written in the last few years
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:18.800]   was Madison Avenue fell asleep, direct marketing ate its brain.
[02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:21.440]   And it woke up as an alien replica of itself.
[02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:23.840]   That alien replica is running things right now.
[02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:25.760]   And behind me, you could see it.
[02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:30.080]   But over my head there, just back there on a blanket,
[02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:32.680]   I'm in a basement in Indiana right now.
[02:15:32.680 --> 02:15:35.760]   But there's an LA Times that I saved.
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:39.440]   It was on somebody's front lawn when I was in LA this spring.
[02:15:39.440 --> 02:15:40.960]   It had two ads in it.
[02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:42.400]   Oh, my God.
[02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:42.920]   Just two.
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:44.360]   And they were small.
[02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:48.840]   One was for a lawyer and one was for the art theater chain,
[02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:49.840]   the Lemley Theater.
[02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:50.960]   There was nothing else.
[02:15:50.960 --> 02:15:52.080]   Nada.
[02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:59.080]   And they still have 150,000 subscribers to the physical paper.
[02:15:59.080 --> 02:16:00.160]   That's not nothing.
[02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:01.760]   It's just nobody knows how to sell it.
[02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:04.080]   They don't have a staff there selling it anymore.
[02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:04.680]   That's gone.
[02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:06.400]   Exactly what's happening in podcasting.
[02:16:06.400 --> 02:16:08.360]   We have advertisers.
[02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:12.760]   And the advertisers we have know that their ads work.
[02:16:12.760 --> 02:16:14.360]   I mean, they're going after a tech audience.
[02:16:14.360 --> 02:16:16.560]   So you notice they're all tech companies.
[02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:17.000]   Yeah.
[02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.600]   But they know they work.
[02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:21.280]   Most of them have been with us for years.
[02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:22.760]   They're audibles with us for a decade.
[02:16:22.760 --> 02:16:25.160]   They know it works.
[02:16:25.160 --> 02:16:29.080]   And so this lure of-- but you could know more about the people
[02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:31.440]   listening-- is really specious.
[02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:35.800]   It's kind of evil because what does it matter?
[02:16:35.800 --> 02:16:39.320]   As long as it works, it's working.
[02:16:39.320 --> 02:16:43.200]   And this whole idea of targeting and all this stuff
[02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:45.680]   is, I think, snake oil.
[02:16:45.680 --> 02:16:49.480]   And unfortunately, people fall for it.
[02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:51.720]   Because there's lots of 10-dentures math
[02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:53.600]   that you could put together to say that it works.
[02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:55.160]   And for the most part, it does not.
[02:16:55.160 --> 02:17:00.720]   There's a really great section of the book,
[02:17:00.720 --> 02:17:02.880]   The Filter Bubbled by Eli Paris,
[02:17:02.880 --> 02:17:05.800]   where they came out back in 2012, I think it was.
[02:17:05.800 --> 02:17:09.920]   And what you said that all this is based on what he calls
[02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:12.400]   a bad theory of you.
[02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:14.880]   That you're buying something all the time.
[02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:17.000]   You're not buying something all the time.
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.160]   But you might buy something you've heard about a lot
[02:17:19.160 --> 02:17:20.400]   when it comes time to buy something.
[02:17:20.400 --> 02:17:21.360]   When it's time.
[02:17:21.360 --> 02:17:22.200]   When it's time.
[02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:24.000]   But you're not buying something right now.
[02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:25.800]   We're owning things all the time,
[02:17:25.800 --> 02:17:28.520]   but they make it really difficult to own something.
[02:17:28.520 --> 02:17:32.000]   That's one way that Apple just kills.
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:36.120]   Their service, their glitches, their times is not great.
[02:17:36.120 --> 02:17:39.240]   They're not-- those aren't all geniuses behind the bar.
[02:17:39.240 --> 02:17:40.400]   But I know I could get help.
[02:17:40.400 --> 02:17:43.480]   I know I can call those guys up and I get a good answer.
[02:17:43.480 --> 02:17:45.320]   And nine times out of 10, I do.
[02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:45.840]   And I'm--
[02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:47.160]   To the degree that companies--
[02:17:47.160 --> 02:17:48.960]   Yeah.
[02:17:48.960 --> 02:17:50.320]   Are serving their--
[02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:53.320]   I think serving their customers, even though the market would
[02:17:53.320 --> 02:17:58.240]   like them to maximize profits and sometimes screw customers,
[02:17:58.240 --> 02:18:00.440]   to the degree that they win the customer's loyalty
[02:18:00.440 --> 02:18:03.120]   and they serve their customers, I think in the long run,
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:05.360]   maybe not in the quarterly run.
[02:18:05.360 --> 02:18:08.080]   But in the long run, that's how you're going to succeed.
[02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:10.600]   Amazon very-- you know, that was Jeff Bezos's
[02:18:10.600 --> 02:18:12.560]   credos super serve the customer.
[02:18:12.560 --> 02:18:15.320]   I'm not sure that's the case anymore.
[02:18:15.320 --> 02:18:17.160]   They're playing the advertising game.
[02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:19.800]   And Phil, maybe you could tell us more about this.
[02:18:19.800 --> 02:18:22.480]   But their bargains-- I mean, their profits went way up
[02:18:22.480 --> 02:18:24.720]   when they got into the creepy advertising business.
[02:18:24.720 --> 02:18:25.480]   And--
[02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:26.680]   It's good money.
[02:18:26.680 --> 02:18:27.680]   It's hard to say no.
[02:18:27.680 --> 02:18:28.920]   It's good money.
[02:18:28.920 --> 02:18:31.680]   But super serving the customers good.
[02:18:31.680 --> 02:18:33.640]   And by the way, I got really good customer service
[02:18:33.640 --> 02:18:36.280]   from Amazon the other day when two things weren't delivered.
[02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:38.200]   You know, they just delivered them again.
[02:18:38.200 --> 02:18:38.920]   It's actually a fine--
[02:18:38.920 --> 02:18:41.400]   Interesting problem for Amazon because they
[02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:44.040]   do want to make it easy to return stuff.
[02:18:44.040 --> 02:18:47.000]   But it ends up they have a bunch of stuff they can't sell.
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:50.000]   And so they just kind of buried it and then Phil.
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:54.440]   And I told a guy Costco told me that you bring back anything
[02:18:54.440 --> 02:18:55.440]   to Costco, it's gone.
[02:18:55.440 --> 02:18:56.440]   It's gone.
[02:18:56.440 --> 02:18:57.240]   They're not going to resell it.
[02:18:57.240 --> 02:18:58.160]   They can't.
[02:18:58.160 --> 02:18:59.240]   They're not going to resell it.
[02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:00.800]   It just goes somewhere else I don't know where.
[02:19:00.800 --> 02:19:04.520]   So there is a high cost to a customer service, I guess.
[02:19:04.520 --> 02:19:07.600]   This just in breaking news from Casey Newton's platform,
[02:19:07.600 --> 02:19:09.080]   where we were talking about him,
[02:19:09.080 --> 02:19:12.960]   Twitter is strongly considering making its users pay
[02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:14.440]   to remain verified.
[02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:16.280]   You like your blue check?
[02:19:16.280 --> 02:19:18.800]   Platform has learned if the project makes forward,
[02:19:18.800 --> 02:19:20.440]   users would have to subscribe to Twitter
[02:19:20.440 --> 02:19:24.120]   blue at $4.99 a month or lose their badges.
[02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:25.840]   I'm sure this is just being workshopped
[02:19:25.840 --> 02:19:28.360]   like about 1,000 other ideas.
[02:19:28.360 --> 02:19:29.320]   Yeah.
[02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:31.000]   Will they have any of the people who are
[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:32.760]   workshopping that?
[02:19:32.760 --> 02:19:34.640]   You're paying for yours, you said.
[02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:35.720]   Yeah, but not for the check.
[02:19:35.720 --> 02:19:37.240]   I'm playing for the other features.
[02:19:37.240 --> 02:19:42.080]   And I actually like probably like you, Doc, paid for Twitter
[02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:43.320]   and the blue because I wanted to support Twitter.
[02:19:43.320 --> 02:19:44.320]   I never did.
[02:19:44.320 --> 02:19:46.000]   I didn't even, in fact, till you mentioned it,
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:46.800]   I didn't know what Twitter blue was.
[02:19:46.800 --> 02:19:48.200]   Did even know it existed.
[02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:49.800]   And I don't have a blue check bar.
[02:19:49.800 --> 02:19:51.320]   There's a problem right there.
[02:19:51.320 --> 02:19:52.160]   That's a problem.
[02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:54.800]   I've been on them since, I mean, I know we have Williams.
[02:19:54.800 --> 02:19:59.600]   And I got on it like a day two, you know, but still, you know.
[02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:00.320]   Yeah, I do.
[02:20:00.320 --> 02:20:01.400]   2006.
[02:20:01.400 --> 02:20:03.040]   I don't even know how you get the blue check
[02:20:03.040 --> 02:20:03.960]   or what that's about.
[02:20:03.960 --> 02:20:04.800]   No one does.
[02:20:04.800 --> 02:20:05.800]   I know it's called verified.
[02:20:05.800 --> 02:20:06.640]   Yeah, no one does.
[02:20:06.640 --> 02:20:07.480]   But I didn't know what the process was.
[02:20:07.480 --> 02:20:08.560]   It looked like work.
[02:20:08.560 --> 02:20:09.400]   I didn't need the work.
[02:20:09.400 --> 02:20:10.640]   So I never did anything.
[02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:11.480]   Does it matter?
[02:20:11.480 --> 02:20:12.000]   No.
[02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000]   I did the work and didn't get the check.
[02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:17.000]   Oh, no, it's terrible.
[02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:17.840]   That's terrible.
[02:20:17.840 --> 02:20:18.920]   Sorry.
[02:20:18.920 --> 02:20:20.880]   Well, as somebody with a blue check, I can tell you,
[02:20:20.880 --> 02:20:25.160]   it means absolutely nothing.
[02:20:25.160 --> 02:20:27.600]   And would I pay $4.99 a month just for that?
[02:20:27.600 --> 02:20:31.200]   No, Elon, I wouldn't.
[02:20:31.200 --> 02:20:32.040]   Let's take a little break.
[02:20:32.040 --> 02:20:35.080]   We'll have some more in just a bit with our dwindling panel.
[02:20:38.600 --> 02:20:40.840]   The Philip Elmer DeWitt, great to have you.
[02:20:40.840 --> 02:20:46.800]   PED30.com is the website for the best Apple coverage.
[02:20:46.800 --> 02:20:48.960]   And I'm going to say it with the financial slant.
[02:20:48.960 --> 02:20:52.400]   If you're an Apple investor and you're not reading PED30,
[02:20:52.400 --> 02:20:53.320]   you're missing out.
[02:20:53.320 --> 02:20:57.080]   That's really how you keep up on what's going on.
[02:20:57.080 --> 02:20:58.680]   It is definitely a pitch for investors.
[02:20:58.680 --> 02:20:59.200]   Yeah.
[02:20:59.200 --> 02:21:00.120]   That's what it's for.
[02:21:00.120 --> 02:21:01.160]   Stumme, I didn't know.
[02:21:01.160 --> 02:21:03.960]   I went to that meeting a little that I know.
[02:21:03.960 --> 02:21:05.480]   I'm just glad they didn't lynch me.
[02:21:05.480 --> 02:21:07.120]   I burned me or something.
[02:21:07.120 --> 02:21:07.920]   I don't know.
[02:21:07.920 --> 02:21:09.720]   Also, the great Doc Serals.
[02:21:09.720 --> 02:21:11.640]   And by the way, one of the reasons
[02:21:11.640 --> 02:21:13.600]   I bring up these deep philosophical things
[02:21:13.600 --> 02:21:17.800]   about the future of investing and companies
[02:21:17.800 --> 02:21:19.560]   and community ownership service, because Doc
[02:21:19.560 --> 02:21:22.600]   wrote the definitive book on companies
[02:21:22.600 --> 02:21:25.120]   and their relationship to their customers.
[02:21:25.120 --> 02:21:28.200]   It resonates 20 years later.
[02:21:28.200 --> 02:21:30.840]   Clue Train Manifesto, you can read it online.
[02:21:30.840 --> 02:21:33.080]   Get on the Clue Train.
[02:21:33.080 --> 02:21:35.280]   David Weinberger, also your co-author.
[02:21:35.280 --> 02:21:37.160]   Yeah, we co-wrote it with Twitter, guys.
[02:21:37.160 --> 02:21:38.920]   And just brilliant.
[02:21:38.920 --> 02:21:40.520]   And still true.
[02:21:40.520 --> 02:21:43.200]   And I've told you this, Doc, but I'll say it to our Twitter
[02:21:43.200 --> 02:21:44.040]   audience.
[02:21:44.040 --> 02:21:46.000]   When I was at Tech TV, I really felt
[02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.920]   like they didn't understand their business, what business
[02:21:48.920 --> 02:21:49.600]   they were in.
[02:21:49.600 --> 02:21:51.000]   And they were really struggling.
[02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.960]   I remember the Tech TV guys coming up to me, because I said,
[02:21:53.960 --> 02:21:55.360]   look, you've got to reach--
[02:21:55.360 --> 02:21:57.640]   you're talking to an enthusiast audience.
[02:21:57.640 --> 02:21:59.640]   You're acting as if you're ESPN, but you've
[02:21:59.640 --> 02:22:01.160]   got to explain what football is.
[02:22:01.160 --> 02:22:02.720]   This audience knows.
[02:22:02.720 --> 02:22:05.800]   Their enthusiast served them, super served them.
[02:22:05.800 --> 02:22:07.920]   Their 14 million programmers in the United States
[02:22:07.920 --> 02:22:09.360]   serve them.
[02:22:09.360 --> 02:22:11.480]   And this is what the boss told me.
[02:22:11.480 --> 02:22:14.640]   He said, Leo, Leo, I've got to tell you this.
[02:22:14.640 --> 02:22:16.720]   And every advertiser knows it.
[02:22:16.720 --> 02:22:21.600]   Brand is the refuge of the ignorant.
[02:22:21.600 --> 02:22:25.520]   Advertisers, he said-- it was his contention, believed--
[02:22:25.520 --> 02:22:27.880]   that you don't want a smart audience.
[02:22:27.880 --> 02:22:30.200]   They won't fall for it.
[02:22:30.200 --> 02:22:31.840]   If you want your brand to succeed,
[02:22:31.840 --> 02:22:34.480]   you've got to advertise to dummies.
[02:22:34.480 --> 02:22:37.600]   So that was their reasoning for not going after the Tech
[02:22:37.600 --> 02:22:38.080]   enthusiast.
[02:22:38.080 --> 02:22:39.040]   You guys are too smart.
[02:22:39.040 --> 02:22:39.720]   Wow.
[02:22:39.720 --> 02:22:41.280]   Can you believe that?
[02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:45.720]   By the way, Tech TV long gone, purchased by Comcast,
[02:22:45.720 --> 02:22:48.300]   merged with G4, their gaming network,
[02:22:48.300 --> 02:22:50.000]   formed G4 TV, fired me.
[02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:51.880]   I was gone.
[02:22:51.880 --> 02:22:53.960]   That went out of business a few years later.
[02:22:53.960 --> 02:22:55.480]   They tried to bring it back last year.
[02:22:55.480 --> 02:22:57.000]   They just announced this week.
[02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:58.160]   No, it's over.
[02:22:58.160 --> 02:22:59.520]   G4 is gone.
[02:22:59.520 --> 02:23:02.040]   So I survived.
[02:23:02.040 --> 02:23:04.400]   I have outlived now.
[02:23:04.400 --> 02:23:06.000]   Tech TV, G4.
[02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000]   And I'm hoping to outlive the chief
[02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:11.040]   twit over there at the Bluebird site.
[02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:13.200]   I am going to outlive you, Elon.
[02:23:13.200 --> 02:23:16.000]   If it's the last thing I do.
[02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:20.440]   Our show today brought to you-- anyway,
[02:23:20.440 --> 02:23:21.600]   everybody should read the clue train.
[02:23:21.600 --> 02:23:22.600]   I bought the clue train.
[02:23:22.600 --> 02:23:24.800]   After he told me that, Brand is a refuge of the ignorant.
[02:23:24.800 --> 02:23:25.960]   I bought him a clue train.
[02:23:25.960 --> 02:23:27.960]   I bought everybody at Tech TV a copy.
[02:23:27.960 --> 02:23:29.200]   I bought 20 copies.
[02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:30.920]   Gave it to all the executives.
[02:23:30.920 --> 02:23:31.960]   I doubt they read it.
[02:23:31.960 --> 02:23:33.880]   They certainly didn't learn a thing from it.
[02:23:34.600 --> 02:23:35.840]   What can I say?
[02:23:35.840 --> 02:23:37.760]   Our audience and our advertisers
[02:23:37.760 --> 02:23:40.800]   know that marketing is a conversation.
[02:23:40.800 --> 02:23:42.880]   The way we've always treated our advertisers--
[02:23:42.880 --> 02:23:43.480]   we're very careful.
[02:23:43.480 --> 02:23:45.200]   We pick advertisers we like.
[02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:50.400]   And my attitude is I'm introducing this company to you,
[02:23:50.400 --> 02:23:51.880]   our users.
[02:23:51.880 --> 02:23:53.360]   I'm making an introduction.
[02:23:53.360 --> 02:23:55.640]   I'm starting the conversation.
[02:23:55.640 --> 02:23:58.480]   Our show today this week brought to you by Melissa, for instance.
[02:23:58.480 --> 02:23:59.960]   You've heard me talk about Melissa before.
[02:23:59.960 --> 02:24:01.280]   It's awesome.
[02:24:01.280 --> 02:24:04.520]   A leading provider of global data quality and address management
[02:24:04.520 --> 02:24:05.040]   solutions.
[02:24:05.040 --> 02:24:07.640]   Now, if you're in business, you have address lists.
[02:24:07.640 --> 02:24:10.720]   You have supplier lists, customer lists, so forth.
[02:24:10.720 --> 02:24:14.280]   Those lists are rotting away every single day.
[02:24:14.280 --> 02:24:16.960]   You're ignoring them, but they're rotting away.
[02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:21.640]   And poor data quality can cost organizations a lot.
[02:24:21.640 --> 02:24:24.640]   Average of $15 million a year.
[02:24:24.640 --> 02:24:26.640]   The lower-- the longer the poor quality
[02:24:26.640 --> 02:24:28.640]   of the day stays in your system, the worse it gets.
[02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:30.960]   The more losses you accumulate, email addresses
[02:24:30.960 --> 02:24:34.720]   change, addresses change, names change, phone numbers change.
[02:24:34.720 --> 02:24:38.040]   How are you keeping that data, that most valuable data
[02:24:38.040 --> 02:24:41.800]   you've got, your customer data up to date, Melissa?
[02:24:41.800 --> 02:24:44.960]   Melissa will never cost you more than you're going to save.
[02:24:44.960 --> 02:24:47.520]   To ensure your success, your customer information
[02:24:47.520 --> 02:24:49.360]   just has to be accurate.
[02:24:49.360 --> 02:24:51.000]   High quality data saves you money.
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:51.600]   It doesn't cost you.
[02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:52.640]   It saves you.
[02:24:52.640 --> 02:24:55.080]   There's another side to an accurate data customer service
[02:24:55.080 --> 02:24:57.360]   of a customer already upset with something
[02:24:57.360 --> 02:24:59.360]   about your product or service calls up.
[02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:02.160]   And you address them with the wrong name
[02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:03.840]   or verify the wrong address.
[02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:06.440]   Things can go from bad to worse.
[02:25:06.440 --> 02:25:08.920]   Check out Melissa's cloud-based data cleansing
[02:25:08.920 --> 02:25:09.680]   enrichment tool.
[02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:10.760]   Easy to use.
[02:25:10.760 --> 02:25:11.680]   You upload your file.
[02:25:11.680 --> 02:25:13.720]   You choose the data quality service.
[02:25:13.720 --> 02:25:15.960]   You map the input fields process your list.
[02:25:15.960 --> 02:25:16.720]   You get it back.
[02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:20.840]   It's fresh, clean, sparkling.
[02:25:20.840 --> 02:25:23.000]   Melissa's data quality suite also
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.640]   helps eliminate clutter and duplicates.
[02:25:25.640 --> 02:25:28.440]   For a long time, I was getting three or four catalogs
[02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:29.360]   from Restoration Hardware.
[02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:32.640]   These are the big, thick, full-color expensive catalogs
[02:25:32.640 --> 02:25:34.840]   to the same name and address.
[02:25:34.840 --> 02:25:36.480]   They didn't-- obviously, they didn't have Melissa,
[02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:39.120]   because they didn't know they were mailing me four copies
[02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:40.400]   of the same thing.
[02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:42.760]   Imagine how they could have cut their postage and mailing
[02:25:42.760 --> 02:25:44.000]   costs.
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:45.440]   You need this stuff.
[02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:47.880]   Batch address, cleaning process, and entire address
[02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:50.200]   list for accuracy and completeness.
[02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:53.720]   You can do name verification, parse, and standardized first
[02:25:53.720 --> 02:25:55.880]   and last names.
[02:25:55.880 --> 02:25:59.680]   And analyze your data and prove its quality over time.
[02:25:59.680 --> 02:26:01.240]   They have email verification.
[02:26:01.240 --> 02:26:05.600]   They can remove 95% of bad email addresses, just like that.
[02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:07.160]   95%.
[02:26:07.160 --> 02:26:09.920]   Melissa's flexible deployment options.
[02:26:09.920 --> 02:26:11.600]   Let you do it the way you want.
[02:26:11.600 --> 02:26:12.440]   You can have it on-prem.
[02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:14.440]   You can have it as a SAS product.
[02:26:14.440 --> 02:26:16.440]   They even have a secure FTP server.
[02:26:16.440 --> 02:26:20.000]   You can upload your customer list to and then download it.
[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:21.920]   They've got an app on iOS and Google.
[02:26:21.920 --> 02:26:23.280]   It's called Lookups.
[02:26:23.280 --> 02:26:26.640]   It'll let you search addresses, verify social security numbers,
[02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:29.640]   access detailed property data, and more,
[02:26:29.640 --> 02:26:30.960]   and I'll want your fingertips.
[02:26:30.960 --> 02:26:33.600]   And the thing you've got to know is, Melissa cares about that data
[02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:34.320]   as much as you do.
[02:26:34.320 --> 02:26:35.720]   They protect your data.
[02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:39.280]   They undergo continuous independent security audits
[02:26:39.280 --> 02:26:42.840]   to reinforce their commitment to data security, privacy,
[02:26:42.840 --> 02:26:44.680]   and compliance.
[02:26:44.680 --> 02:26:45.880]   This might be important to you.
[02:26:45.880 --> 02:26:50.920]   They are SOC2 compliant, HIPAA compliant, GDPR compliant.
[02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:53.360]   Melissa's data quality suite and clean suite
[02:26:53.360 --> 02:26:55.760]   speaks for itself, but once again,
[02:26:55.760 --> 02:26:58.640]   named a leader this year by G2.
[02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:01.440]   Their experience, their independent, 37 years
[02:27:01.440 --> 02:27:03.600]   of data quality expertise.
[02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:06.600]   That's why more than 10,000 businesses know Melissa
[02:27:06.600 --> 02:27:08.680]   as the address experts.
[02:27:08.680 --> 02:27:11.520]   And man, their support is second to none.
[02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:15.200]   24/7, world-renowned support from their Global Support Center.

[02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:27.640]   Melissa.com/twit.
[02:27:27.640 --> 02:27:30.160]   We thank them so much for supporting our show.
[02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:34.680]   And if you're in the need of data, address cleansing data,
[02:27:34.680 --> 02:27:37.200]   cleansing, please do me a favor check them out
[02:27:37.200 --> 02:27:41.320]   and use that address, Melissa.com/twit.
[02:27:41.320 --> 02:27:45.280]   We had a great week this week on the shows.
[02:27:45.280 --> 02:27:49.160]   In fact, we've made a little mini movie for your Delectation.
[02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:51.200]   So this is the Oculus Pro.
[02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:51.840]   See?
[02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:53.200]   Whoa!
[02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:55.080]   Yikes!
[02:27:55.080 --> 02:27:57.240]   Oh my God, I'm terrified.
[02:27:57.240 --> 02:27:59.520]   Oh God, now I know, I'm not gonna do it.
[02:27:59.520 --> 02:28:00.520]   I'm going back.
[02:28:00.520 --> 02:28:02.040]   (laughs)
[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:02.880]   Whoa!
[02:28:02.880 --> 02:28:06.080]   So I'm a chicken.
[02:28:06.080 --> 02:28:10.280]   Previously on Twit.
[02:28:10.280 --> 02:28:11.440]   This week in Google.
[02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:14.680]   Jeff Jarvis and I get to talk to Rabel.
[02:28:14.680 --> 02:28:17.200]   Rabel was the lead developer at ODO.
[02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:19.880]   Later worked at Twitter, has a lot of thoughts
[02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:22.400]   about the social space and a way to make it better
[02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:23.240]   for all of us.
[02:28:23.240 --> 02:28:26.040]   The reason Instagram and Twitter, you know, even Tinder,
[02:28:26.040 --> 02:28:27.600]   lets you download all of your data
[02:28:27.600 --> 02:28:30.760]   is because the connection between people
[02:28:30.760 --> 02:28:33.000]   and the ability to connect to them, address them
[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:34.920]   and find them is the important thing.
[02:28:34.920 --> 02:28:37.320]   That's the thing we need to protect
[02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:40.280]   and also make sure are in the hands of users.
[02:28:40.280 --> 02:28:41.480]   iOS today.
[02:28:41.480 --> 02:28:46.480]   We are taking a look at iPadOS 16.1.
[02:28:46.480 --> 02:28:49.440]   And so what I can do is I can pick a picture,
[02:28:49.440 --> 02:28:52.280]   I can just tap and hold on so much, the foster cat
[02:28:52.280 --> 02:28:53.400]   and pick it up.
[02:28:53.400 --> 02:28:55.640]   Then I can just drop this over to Micah
[02:28:55.640 --> 02:28:58.240]   and I can then just hit enter and wow.
[02:28:58.240 --> 02:28:59.760]   This is a really good cut out.
[02:28:59.760 --> 02:29:01.600]   You've set a headless cat.
[02:29:01.600 --> 02:29:02.640]   Oh, Windows Weekly.
[02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:04.120]   This is my last show.
[02:29:04.120 --> 02:29:05.440]   Co-hosting Windows Weekly.
[02:29:05.440 --> 02:29:06.400]   (laughs)
[02:29:06.400 --> 02:29:07.480]   Why now guys?
[02:29:07.480 --> 02:29:10.120]   I know, but hopefully I'm gonna get to come back
[02:29:10.120 --> 02:29:11.440]   and be a guest sometimes.
[02:29:11.440 --> 02:29:12.800]   Any time you want.
[02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:14.640]   Bye, Mary Jo.
[02:29:14.640 --> 02:29:15.640]   Bye you guys.
[02:29:15.640 --> 02:29:16.640]   See you soon.
[02:29:16.640 --> 02:29:18.280]   We'll see you again soon.
[02:29:18.280 --> 02:29:19.720]   Look, she just hung up on us.
[02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:20.720]   No, she's-- (laughs)
[02:29:20.720 --> 02:29:22.080]   Jesus.
[02:29:22.080 --> 02:29:23.160]   Twit.
[02:29:23.160 --> 02:29:24.120]   You know what, Leo?
[02:29:24.120 --> 02:29:24.960]   We deserve it.
[02:29:24.960 --> 02:29:25.960]   We do, we earn it.
[02:29:25.960 --> 02:29:30.600]   Alone at last, naturally, calling me.
[02:29:30.600 --> 02:29:31.600]   That was fun.
[02:29:31.600 --> 02:29:32.440]   Yeah.
[02:29:32.440 --> 02:29:33.280]   Yeah, it's fun, isn't it?
[02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:36.240]   See, you should listen to some of our shows, Phillip.
[02:29:36.240 --> 02:29:37.080]   (laughs)
[02:29:37.080 --> 02:29:37.920]   I do.
[02:29:37.920 --> 02:29:38.760]   Actually, I boned up.
[02:29:38.760 --> 02:29:41.240]   I wanted to see what you'd said about Elon
[02:29:41.240 --> 02:29:42.080]   before I got on.
[02:29:42.080 --> 02:29:43.200]   Oh, God.
[02:29:43.200 --> 02:29:44.280]   Not much, you can say much.
[02:29:44.280 --> 02:29:46.200]   Oh, God.
[02:29:46.200 --> 02:29:48.240]   There was, somebody's telling me now in the chat room,
[02:29:48.240 --> 02:29:52.760]   there was a Zoom reunion of the Homebrew Computer Club,
[02:29:52.760 --> 02:29:54.480]   and Waz was there.
[02:29:54.480 --> 02:29:55.320]   That's cool.
[02:29:55.320 --> 02:29:57.280]   I would like to find out where that was.
[02:29:57.280 --> 02:29:59.160]   That's really neat.
[02:29:59.160 --> 02:30:00.680]   That's news to me.
[02:30:00.680 --> 02:30:04.200]   We did, a long time ago,
[02:30:04.200 --> 02:30:06.000]   a Homebrew Computer Club reunion.
[02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:07.880]   I think it was on tech TV, actually.
[02:30:08.880 --> 02:30:10.480]   That was the original Computer Club.
[02:30:10.480 --> 02:30:15.240]   That's where Waz showed the very first Apple One computer,
[02:30:15.240 --> 02:30:18.320]   and he and Steve offered it as a kit
[02:30:18.320 --> 02:30:19.920]   for Homebrew Computer Club.
[02:30:19.920 --> 02:30:22.720]   Wow, yeah.
[02:30:22.720 --> 02:30:25.440]   What about the Bottle Railroad Club that was at MIT?
[02:30:25.440 --> 02:30:27.440]   That was even predated it.
[02:30:27.440 --> 02:30:28.440]   That was, yeah.
[02:30:28.440 --> 02:30:31.200]   That was where the internet sort of half came out of.
[02:30:31.200 --> 02:30:32.040]   Yeah.
[02:30:32.040 --> 02:30:35.080]   And the Homebrew is where Bill Gates showed up and said,
[02:30:35.080 --> 02:30:37.160]   wait a minute, you have to pay for software.
[02:30:37.160 --> 02:30:38.160]   You don't get it for free.
[02:30:38.160 --> 02:30:39.720]   He yelled at them.
[02:30:39.720 --> 02:30:42.240]   He said, yo guys are a bunch of pirates.
[02:30:42.240 --> 02:30:44.560]   Stop it.
[02:30:44.560 --> 02:30:46.000]   And this was back when you had to--
[02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:47.000]   They produced the letter.
[02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.480]   Pirate it by stealing the paper tapes, right?
[02:30:49.480 --> 02:30:50.920]   Or copying paper tapes.
[02:30:50.920 --> 02:30:51.800]   It wasn't easy.
[02:30:51.800 --> 02:30:53.600]   It wasn't easy.
[02:30:53.600 --> 02:30:56.080]   Anyway, if you could find the link to that Alien 78,
[02:30:56.080 --> 02:30:59.160]   in our chat room, I would love to watch that.
[02:30:59.160 --> 02:31:00.120]   Oh, he's looking.
[02:31:00.120 --> 02:31:00.960]   He's looking, he says.
[02:31:00.960 --> 02:31:01.800]   Yeah.
[02:31:01.800 --> 02:31:02.640]   I'm sure.
[02:31:04.880 --> 02:31:06.880]   Sad note, but I think an important one,
[02:31:06.880 --> 02:31:09.440]   I never heard of Kathleen Booth.
[02:31:09.440 --> 02:31:13.200]   But maybe we should honor her,
[02:31:13.200 --> 02:31:16.840]   passed away at the age of 100 this week.
[02:31:16.840 --> 02:31:19.480]   She invented assembly language.
[02:31:19.480 --> 02:31:20.320]   Oh my God.
[02:31:20.320 --> 02:31:23.880]   She was born in Worcester, Worcester,
[02:31:23.880 --> 02:31:25.920]   Worcestershire somewhere.
[02:31:25.920 --> 02:31:26.880]   Worcestershire, England.
[02:31:26.880 --> 02:31:27.720]   Worcestershire.
[02:31:27.720 --> 02:31:28.560]   Worcestershire.
[02:31:28.560 --> 02:31:29.400]   Worcestershire.
[02:31:29.400 --> 02:31:30.240]   Like the sauce.
[02:31:30.240 --> 02:31:31.080]   Like the sauce.
[02:31:31.080 --> 02:31:31.920]   Like the sauce, yeah.
[02:31:31.920 --> 02:31:35.160]   In 1922, during World War II,
[02:31:35.160 --> 02:31:38.040]   she got a bachelor's in mathematics,
[02:31:38.040 --> 02:31:39.920]   became a junior scientific officer
[02:31:39.920 --> 02:31:42.000]   at the Royal Aircraft Establishment
[02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:43.600]   and Research Organization.
[02:31:43.600 --> 02:31:44.960]   Two years later,
[02:31:44.960 --> 02:31:48.080]   became a research assistant at Birkbeck College,
[02:31:48.080 --> 02:31:51.640]   worked at the British Rubber Producers Research Association.
[02:31:51.640 --> 02:31:53.760]   That's where she met her future husband,
[02:31:53.760 --> 02:31:56.360]   mathematician Donald Booth.
[02:31:56.360 --> 02:31:57.200]   In 1940s--
[02:31:57.200 --> 02:31:58.440]   Oh, he's famous.
[02:31:58.440 --> 02:31:59.600]   Booth is more famous.
[02:31:59.600 --> 02:32:02.160]   Yeah, probably, of course, 'cause he's a guy.
[02:32:02.160 --> 02:32:04.480]   Right?
[02:32:04.480 --> 02:32:06.160]   Right?
[02:32:06.160 --> 02:32:07.800]   In 1946,
[02:32:07.800 --> 02:32:13.760]   she collaborated with Britain.
[02:32:13.760 --> 02:32:16.560]   I don't know who Britain is, another, another,
[02:32:16.560 --> 02:32:17.600]   oh, wait a minute.
[02:32:17.600 --> 02:32:19.120]   That's her maiden name, sorry.
[02:32:19.120 --> 02:32:22.200]   Kathleen Britain and Booth,
[02:32:22.200 --> 02:32:23.120]   they were yet married,
[02:32:23.120 --> 02:32:24.960]   collaborated at Birkbeck
[02:32:24.960 --> 02:32:28.000]   on the automatic relay calculator.
[02:32:28.920 --> 02:32:30.280]   Founding, in effect,
[02:32:30.280 --> 02:32:32.840]   the Department of Computer Science and Information Systems.
[02:32:32.840 --> 02:32:34.000]   If there aren't any computers,
[02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:37.040]   you can't really have a computer science department.
[02:32:37.040 --> 02:32:39.640]   They built it.
[02:32:39.640 --> 02:32:41.600]   She and her fellow researchers, Zeenia,
[02:32:41.600 --> 02:32:43.000]   Sweden, built the hardware.
[02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.080]   They often did have women build these
[02:32:45.080 --> 02:32:46.840]   because they had finer motor skills
[02:32:46.840 --> 02:32:49.000]   and they were able to do the fine wiring
[02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.360]   and so forth on the early computers.
[02:32:51.360 --> 02:32:54.240]   Plus, women were the first computers.
[02:32:54.240 --> 02:32:56.800]   Back when it was pencil and paper,
[02:32:56.800 --> 02:33:00.360]   women were computing the trajectories
[02:33:00.360 --> 02:33:02.840]   of mortar rounds and things on pencil and paper,
[02:33:02.840 --> 02:33:06.720]   even if you saw that wonderful movie about NASA,
[02:33:06.720 --> 02:33:11.400]   even doing planetary trajectories,
[02:33:11.400 --> 02:33:13.800]   what was that movie?
[02:33:13.800 --> 02:33:14.640]   Hidden figures.
[02:33:14.640 --> 02:33:15.480]   Oh, God.
[02:33:15.480 --> 02:33:16.320]   Such a great man.
[02:33:16.320 --> 02:33:17.160]   Hidden figures.
[02:33:17.160 --> 02:33:18.080]   Hidden figures, yeah.
[02:33:18.080 --> 02:33:21.080]   So, she actually,
[02:33:21.080 --> 02:33:25.120]   Bernal got funding from the Rockefeller Foundation
[02:33:25.120 --> 02:33:27.080]   for Booth and Britain to visit
[02:33:27.080 --> 02:33:30.200]   the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton.
[02:33:30.200 --> 02:33:33.800]   That was where, of course, Albert Einstein was.
[02:33:33.800 --> 02:33:37.640]   The only person who talked to them at the time
[02:33:37.640 --> 02:33:39.840]   was this guy named John von Neumann,
[02:33:39.840 --> 02:33:43.960]   who explained his concept of computing,
[02:33:43.960 --> 02:33:45.800]   which we now call the von Neumann architecture,
[02:33:45.800 --> 02:33:49.560]   the kind of the archetypal computing architecture.
[02:33:49.560 --> 02:33:51.520]   They heard this and said, "Ah."
[02:33:51.520 --> 02:33:53.120]   Went back to Britain,
[02:33:53.120 --> 02:33:57.680]   redesigned their calculator as a von Neumann machine,
[02:33:57.680 --> 02:33:59.440]   inventing the first drum memory.
[02:33:59.440 --> 02:34:03.560]   In 1948, they moved on to this next generation,
[02:34:03.560 --> 02:34:05.640]   the third generation, the simple electronic computer,
[02:34:05.640 --> 02:34:09.880]   and then the all-purpose electronic X-ray computer,
[02:34:09.880 --> 02:34:13.800]   or APXC, later sold as heck
[02:34:13.800 --> 02:34:16.080]   by the British tabulating machine company.
[02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:18.040]   There it is.
[02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:22.920]   There's a heck with Ray Bird right there.
[02:34:22.920 --> 02:34:26.840]   She married Booth, became Kathleen Booth in 1950,
[02:34:26.840 --> 02:34:28.400]   got a PhD in Applied Mathematics
[02:34:28.400 --> 02:34:30.000]   from the University of London.
[02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000]   They built the hardware.
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.680]   She wrote all the software for the Arc2
[02:34:34.680 --> 02:34:37.640]   and then SEC machines in the process,
[02:34:37.640 --> 02:34:41.280]   inventing what she called contracted notation.
[02:34:41.280 --> 02:34:44.920]   We know it better now as assembly language,
[02:34:44.920 --> 02:34:48.160]   writing at the level of the actual processor.
[02:34:48.160 --> 02:34:50.560]   She also invented asynchronous operation.
[02:34:51.480 --> 02:34:53.080]   In a book, she wrote in 1958,
[02:34:53.080 --> 02:34:56.560]   called Programming for an Automatic Digital Calculator,
[02:34:56.560 --> 02:34:59.360]   one of the first programming books written by a woman.
[02:34:59.360 --> 02:35:03.200]   We talked so little about the women
[02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:06.360]   who were so important to the early days of computing.
[02:35:06.360 --> 02:35:09.360]   And I had never heard of Kathleen Booth,
[02:35:09.360 --> 02:35:12.560]   but I think we should, on her passing,
[02:35:12.560 --> 02:35:17.360]   mark her really amazing contributions to the science.
[02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:19.800]   100 years old, Kathleen Booth,
[02:35:19.800 --> 02:35:23.560]   one of the last of the early computer pioneers.
[02:35:23.560 --> 02:35:28.120]   - One story about John von Neumann, who is Hungarian.
[02:35:28.120 --> 02:35:32.920]   He also, he didn't think that we should be afraid
[02:35:32.920 --> 02:35:37.040]   of nuclear power and he was invited to watch the bomb go off
[02:35:37.040 --> 02:35:39.880]   and he actually exposed himself purposely
[02:35:39.880 --> 02:35:40.960]   to the radiation.
[02:35:40.960 --> 02:35:44.920]   - He flashed the flash and died of cancer.
[02:35:44.920 --> 02:35:46.200]   - Yeah, he did.
[02:35:46.200 --> 02:35:47.880]   Much later, not immediately.
[02:35:47.880 --> 02:35:49.200]   - Yeah, well, 1957.
[02:35:49.200 --> 02:35:51.400]   - Yeah, he died in '53.
[02:35:51.400 --> 02:35:53.480]   - Yeah, but he worked on the Manhattan Project.
[02:35:53.480 --> 02:35:56.200]   I just read a really good book about him.
[02:35:56.200 --> 02:35:58.320]   They didn't mention him flashing the bomb.
[02:35:58.320 --> 02:36:01.500]   Wow, so it cost him.
[02:36:01.500 --> 02:36:04.360]   What was the book I just read?
[02:36:04.360 --> 02:36:05.200]   It was, it was--
[02:36:05.200 --> 02:36:06.640]   - You really hope, maybe I'm wrong.
[02:36:06.640 --> 02:36:07.480]   Maybe I'm wrong.
[02:36:07.480 --> 02:36:09.000]   - No, no, no, I think they probably thought
[02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:13.040]   that was maybe a little too salacious of a detail.
[02:36:13.040 --> 02:36:18.400]   The book actually was only about half about John von Neumann.
[02:36:19.240 --> 02:36:24.240]   It was mostly about his era and the Hungarian geniuses
[02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:29.240]   who came out of Hungary pre-war,
[02:36:29.240 --> 02:36:35.720]   who were really massively important to everything
[02:36:35.720 --> 02:36:40.080]   that we know of as modern physics, modern computing.
[02:36:40.080 --> 02:36:43.040]   The book was by Ananyo Bhattacharya
[02:36:43.040 --> 02:36:45.520]   called "The Man from the Future"
[02:36:45.520 --> 02:36:49.440]   and quite, I highly recommend it if you haven't read it.
[02:36:49.440 --> 02:36:51.440]   And since you sound like you're interested
[02:36:51.440 --> 02:36:52.960]   in John von Neumann and his genitals,
[02:36:52.960 --> 02:36:54.280]   you might wanna read this.
[02:36:54.280 --> 02:36:56.880]   (laughing)
[02:36:56.880 --> 02:36:57.880]   - Well, what did he flash?
[02:36:57.880 --> 02:36:59.800]   - Is that all you exposed, what else did he expose?
[02:36:59.800 --> 02:37:00.720]   - What did he expose?
[02:37:00.720 --> 02:37:01.560]   - I had not heard that.
[02:37:01.560 --> 02:37:02.480]   - He exposed his body.
[02:37:02.480 --> 02:37:03.320]   - His body.
[02:37:03.320 --> 02:37:05.320]   - Oh, he didn't take off his clothes.
[02:37:05.320 --> 02:37:06.160]   He just stood there.
[02:37:06.160 --> 02:37:07.000]   - No, no, no.
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:08.760]   - Oh, I thought he flashed him.
[02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:09.600]   - No.
[02:37:09.600 --> 02:37:12.200]   - No, I thought he had a raincoat and did like this.
[02:37:12.200 --> 02:37:13.520]   - Oh, no.
[02:37:13.520 --> 02:37:14.920]   - He just let, he's in his lead line,
[02:37:14.920 --> 02:37:17.040]   raincoat that he could help.
[02:37:17.040 --> 02:37:19.120]   - Amazing genius.
[02:37:19.120 --> 02:37:22.640]   I mean, a brilliant mathematician.
[02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:24.960]   And yeah, the John von Neumann architecture,
[02:37:24.960 --> 02:37:27.680]   the von Neumann architecture is how we compute these days.
[02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:30.040]   He was the guy who thought of stored memory,
[02:37:30.040 --> 02:37:32.680]   programs load from stored memory into RAM.
[02:37:32.680 --> 02:37:35.040]   None of this existed, run in RAM.
[02:37:35.040 --> 02:37:36.160]   He thought about that whole thing.
[02:37:36.160 --> 02:37:39.000]   That's the architecture we know as modern computing.
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:42.720]   So, anyway.
[02:37:42.720 --> 02:37:43.560]   - What else you got?
[02:37:43.560 --> 02:37:44.400]   What else you got?
[02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:45.240]   - That's it.
[02:37:45.240 --> 02:37:47.200]   I like to end with obituaries because as you know,
[02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:50.000]   as we get older, those are the things that tell us
[02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:51.120]   we're still alive.
[02:37:51.120 --> 02:37:56.120]   - Somebody once told me that, every morning I get,
[02:37:56.120 --> 02:37:57.560]   I think George Burns said that.
[02:37:57.560 --> 02:37:59.600]   Every morning I get up and read the obituaries.
[02:37:59.600 --> 02:38:01.600]   That's how I know I'm still alive.
[02:38:01.600 --> 02:38:02.520]   - Good, good.
[02:38:02.520 --> 02:38:03.360]   Good one.
[02:38:03.360 --> 02:38:06.560]   - Philip, great to have you.
[02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:09.720]   P-E-D-3-O.com.
[02:38:09.720 --> 02:38:11.440]   Good luck with your political career.
[02:38:11.440 --> 02:38:13.320]   Are you going on perhaps?
[02:38:13.320 --> 02:38:14.160]   - At the state of the night.
[02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:15.000]   - Oh, no, no, no.
[02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:16.000]   I've had enough.
[02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:16.840]   I've had enough.
[02:38:16.840 --> 02:38:20.560]   - Councillor Elmer, really good to have you on the show.
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:21.400]   I really appreciate it.
[02:38:21.400 --> 02:38:22.240]   - Thank you.
[02:38:22.240 --> 02:38:23.080]   Thanks for inviting me.
[02:38:23.080 --> 02:38:23.920]   - Yeah, always a pleasure.
[02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:26.560]   And thank you for that little trivia about John von Neumann.
[02:38:26.560 --> 02:38:28.560]   (laughing)
[02:38:28.560 --> 02:38:30.560]   We'll have to search for the facts now.
[02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:31.640]   - You're right, sorry.
[02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:32.480]   I'll tweet it.
[02:38:32.480 --> 02:38:33.320]   - That'll make it canon.
[02:38:33.320 --> 02:38:34.840]   - That'll make it canon.
[02:38:34.840 --> 02:38:36.400]   We'll just tweet it.
[02:38:36.400 --> 02:38:38.160]   Thank you so much, Doc.
[02:38:38.160 --> 02:38:39.400]   You were just saying in the chat room
[02:38:39.400 --> 02:38:41.760]   that you'd been on Netech TV with us.
[02:38:41.760 --> 02:38:45.840]   - Yeah, I was on with you and I was on with--
[02:38:45.840 --> 02:38:47.160]   - Devorak?
[02:38:47.160 --> 02:38:51.120]   - No, no, why am I black here at Lockernome?
[02:38:51.120 --> 02:38:53.040]   - Oh, Chris Perilla, yeah, on call for help.
[02:38:53.040 --> 02:38:55.000]   - Yeah, Chris Perilla, yeah.
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:56.040]   So these are two. - What did you talk about
[02:38:56.040 --> 02:38:56.880]   when you were on?
[02:38:56.880 --> 02:38:58.640]   - I have no idea, probably Clue Train.
[02:38:58.640 --> 02:38:59.480]   - Clue Train.
[02:38:59.480 --> 02:39:01.240]   - But we had read or plugged the more recent book
[02:39:01.240 --> 02:39:02.680]   was the intention economy.
[02:39:02.680 --> 02:39:04.120]   I wrote that one myself.
[02:39:04.120 --> 02:39:05.160]   That is not a bestseller.
[02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:06.680]   - Screw whinder, yeah.
[02:39:06.680 --> 02:39:08.880]   Let's screw it.
[02:39:08.880 --> 02:39:11.840]   - We actually, Wyberg and I together wrote,
[02:39:11.840 --> 02:39:14.160]   if you add new clues, the word new clues,
[02:39:14.160 --> 02:39:18.400]   to the URL for the Clue Train Manifesto.
[02:39:18.400 --> 02:39:22.200]   In 2015, we wrote some additional clues
[02:39:22.200 --> 02:39:23.600]   to the Clue Train Manifesto.
[02:39:23.600 --> 02:39:24.960]   Which are very optimistic.
[02:39:24.960 --> 02:39:26.280]   And I think we were right.
[02:39:26.280 --> 02:39:29.040]   - People should listen to what you guys said,
[02:39:29.040 --> 02:39:32.240]   not with just Clue Train, but with the intention economy,
[02:39:32.240 --> 02:39:36.480]   about customers and serving customers.
[02:39:36.480 --> 02:39:38.320]   - When customers, well, actually it's like,
[02:39:38.320 --> 02:39:40.960]   what are things all the customers could solve?
[02:39:40.960 --> 02:39:41.800]   There are a lot of things.
[02:39:41.800 --> 02:39:44.000]   I actually wanted to point to, before we're off,
[02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:45.000]   but maybe it doesn't matter.
[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:46.680]   We could bring it up another time
[02:39:46.680 --> 02:39:48.880]   to the Linux Foundation,
[02:39:48.880 --> 02:39:50.440]   has the Open Wallet Foundation.
[02:39:50.440 --> 02:39:51.520]   They wanna start up.
[02:39:51.520 --> 02:39:53.520]   Google has a wallet, Apple has a wallet.
[02:39:53.520 --> 02:39:54.840]   They're not compatible.
[02:39:54.840 --> 02:39:56.240]   They both work.
[02:39:56.240 --> 02:39:58.760]   But I think we need our own wallets
[02:39:58.760 --> 02:40:01.680]   that are not given to us by companies.
[02:40:01.680 --> 02:40:04.760]   That I think that's possibly the most leveraged thing
[02:40:04.760 --> 02:40:06.920]   that we can have since the browser.
[02:40:06.920 --> 02:40:08.160]   So I'm writing about that right now.
[02:40:08.160 --> 02:40:11.840]   - I love this. - It's OpenWallet.Foundation.
[02:40:11.840 --> 02:40:13.200]   - Yeah.
[02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:14.720]   - The problem with it, is that a big problem?
[02:40:14.720 --> 02:40:16.320]   Actually, on Floss Weekly this week,
[02:40:16.320 --> 02:40:20.280]   we had Hartman Gummry, who is the CTO
[02:40:20.280 --> 02:40:22.760]   for the Hyperledger Foundation,
[02:40:22.760 --> 02:40:25.000]   which is under the Linux Foundation,
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.680]   and deals mostly with blockchain related stuff.
[02:40:27.680 --> 02:40:29.480]   We talked a lot about the wallet.
[02:40:29.480 --> 02:40:32.240]   And it got me going on it because they,
[02:40:32.240 --> 02:40:36.800]   Linux Foundation is a collection of businesses.
[02:40:36.800 --> 02:40:38.360]   It's not necessarily you and me.
[02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:42.880]   Okay, so they work for the companies that pay them in a way.
[02:40:42.880 --> 02:40:45.160]   And though they're great with open source,
[02:40:45.160 --> 02:40:47.080]   I love them for a lot of things.
[02:40:47.080 --> 02:40:49.360]   We need something that's on our side with that one.
[02:40:49.360 --> 02:40:51.160]   - I agree. - No, I agree.
[02:40:51.160 --> 02:40:56.320]   Lots of great interviews on Floss Weekly.
[02:40:56.320 --> 02:41:00.400]   I must recommend you go to twit.tv/floss.
[02:41:00.400 --> 02:41:03.240]   Listen every Wednesday morning, 9 a.m., Pacific,
[02:41:03.240 --> 02:41:07.640]   noon Eastern, and go back through the catalog
[02:41:07.640 --> 02:41:12.000]   'cause some of the most important people in this space,
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:15.480]   you and your co-hosts have interviewed some of the best.
[02:41:15.480 --> 02:41:16.760]   And that was one of the reasons.
[02:41:16.760 --> 02:41:20.120]   - And there's some future stuff that you think Dave,
[02:41:20.120 --> 02:41:21.320]   Dave Huesby is there.
[02:41:21.320 --> 02:41:24.440]   He's one of them, SU, H-U-S-E-B-Y.
[02:41:24.440 --> 02:41:27.040]   And he's talking about authentic data and verified data
[02:41:27.040 --> 02:41:30.720]   and data provenance and other stuff like that.
[02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:34.600]   He's complicated, but he's really bright.
[02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:39.200]   And a lot of these people here are out in the future.
[02:41:39.200 --> 02:41:40.040]   - Yeah.
[02:41:40.040 --> 02:41:42.760]   - So there's a lot of coming distractions.
[02:41:42.760 --> 02:41:44.440]   - This is the time to think about the future.
[02:41:44.440 --> 02:41:48.280]   I mean, we talk, of course, we talk about what happened this week.
[02:41:48.280 --> 02:41:54.880]   But it's not gonna happen willy-nilly.
[02:41:54.880 --> 02:41:57.880]   We can influence what happens next week.
[02:41:57.880 --> 02:41:59.240]   And I think it's really important,
[02:41:59.240 --> 02:42:01.560]   especially as users that we do that.
[02:42:01.560 --> 02:42:06.200]   And of course, I hope you will all vote November 8th.
[02:42:06.200 --> 02:42:09.480]   That's probably the most valuable, powerful way
[02:42:09.480 --> 02:42:10.640]   you can influence your future.
[02:42:10.640 --> 02:42:13.280]   But participate in these other activities
[02:42:13.280 --> 02:42:16.960]   like the Linux Foundation, like indieweb.org.
[02:42:16.960 --> 02:42:19.680]   And there's so many people who,
[02:42:19.680 --> 02:42:20.760]   I think are deep thinkers
[02:42:20.760 --> 02:42:25.200]   and are really trying to influence this for good, not evil.
[02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:26.520]   'Cause technology is neutral.
[02:42:26.520 --> 02:42:28.640]   It's a moral.
[02:42:28.640 --> 02:42:29.960]   But it can, and it could go either way.
[02:42:29.960 --> 02:42:32.440]   And we've seen it, we see it all the time go both ways.
[02:42:32.440 --> 02:42:33.840]   It's important that, you know,
[02:42:33.840 --> 02:42:37.240]   if you care that we influence it in the right way.
[02:42:37.240 --> 02:42:40.240]   And that's why we talk so much about Elon Musk.
[02:42:40.240 --> 02:42:42.600]   Thank you.
[02:42:42.600 --> 02:42:43.680]   Thank you, Doc.
[02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:44.520]   Thank you, Philip.
[02:42:44.520 --> 02:42:45.360]   Thank you, David.
[02:42:45.360 --> 02:42:46.200]   - Thank you.
[02:42:46.200 --> 02:42:47.400]   - So great to have you all.
[02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:50.000]   There's another way you can influence the future of technology.
[02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:51.600]   And that's support us.
[02:42:51.600 --> 02:42:54.160]   I talked a little bit about how difficult it's getting to be
[02:42:54.160 --> 02:42:56.320]   an independent podcast network.
[02:42:56.320 --> 02:42:58.600]   We wanna keep bringing you great shows like this,
[02:42:58.600 --> 02:43:02.800]   like Floss Weekly, Windows Weekly, Mac Break Weekly.
[02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:05.640]   And for us, I think the best way going forward,
[02:43:05.640 --> 02:43:08.440]   if I think about five years out, it's the club.
[02:43:08.440 --> 02:43:12.160]   It's supporting Twit through your direct contributions.
[02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:13.280]   And it's very affordable.
[02:43:13.280 --> 02:43:16.360]   Seven bucks a month gets you all the shows without ads.
[02:43:16.360 --> 02:43:19.200]   We don't need you to listen to ads if you're paying us.
[02:43:19.200 --> 02:43:21.680]   You get a Twit Plus feed, which includes a bunch of stuff
[02:43:21.680 --> 02:43:24.520]   we don't put out anywhere else,
[02:43:24.520 --> 02:43:29.520]   plus access to our remarkable Twit Discord server,
[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:34.080]   which I think is honestly the future of social.
[02:43:34.080 --> 02:43:37.200]   These are just all of, they're now, by the way,
[02:43:37.200 --> 02:43:41.200]   this week we passed 5,000 members in the club,
[02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:43.000]   not all of them in the Discord,
[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:44.680]   but a good number of them,
[02:43:44.680 --> 02:43:48.640]   all with kind of the same interests, the same passions,
[02:43:48.640 --> 02:43:50.920]   people you wanna talk with, you wanna learn from.
[02:43:50.920 --> 02:43:53.240]   There are unique shows that we don't put out in public
[02:43:53.240 --> 02:43:55.640]   like Hands on Windows with Paul Therat.
[02:43:55.640 --> 02:43:57.600]   Micah does Hands on Macintosh.
[02:43:57.600 --> 02:43:59.680]   Jonathan Bennett, your co-host on Floss Weekly
[02:43:59.680 --> 02:44:01.920]   does the untitled Linux show every Saturday.
[02:44:01.920 --> 02:44:04.280]   That's a great show for Linux users.
[02:44:04.280 --> 02:44:06.760]   The Giz Fizz with Dick D. Bartolo Stacey's book club.
[02:44:06.760 --> 02:44:08.400]   We had to put it off this week.
[02:44:08.400 --> 02:44:13.960]   I can't remember, I guess, we couldn't make it.
[02:44:13.960 --> 02:44:17.000]   So we will reschedule that and we'll bring that back.
[02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:18.960]   But those things are only available on the Twit Plus feed,
[02:44:18.960 --> 02:44:20.560]   and almost all of them are live.
[02:44:20.560 --> 02:44:22.200]   I think they are all live.
[02:44:22.200 --> 02:44:25.440]   So you can watch live, participate live.
[02:44:25.440 --> 02:44:27.520]   The club is the future of Twit,
[02:44:27.520 --> 02:44:29.920]   and also I think the best damn deal out there.
[02:44:29.920 --> 02:44:30.920]   Seven bucks a month.
[02:44:30.920 --> 02:44:33.000]   Find out more twit.tv/club.
[02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:34.640]   And you know what, if you've got a geek in your life,
[02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:35.960]   that would be an excellent gift.
[02:44:35.960 --> 02:44:38.160]   We do have your long subscriptions.
[02:44:38.160 --> 02:44:39.800]   I think they'll make an excellent gift
[02:44:39.800 --> 02:44:41.760]   for the holidays to come.
[02:44:41.760 --> 02:44:43.720]   Just a hint, just a hint.
[02:44:43.720 --> 02:44:48.720]   We do Twit every Sunday, 2PM Pacific, 5PM Eastern, 2100 UTC.
[02:44:50.560 --> 02:44:53.160]   It will change, by the way, after,
[02:44:53.160 --> 02:44:56.760]   in the US we're still on summertime.
[02:44:56.760 --> 02:45:01.760]   But next Sunday, we will be back to standard time.
[02:45:01.760 --> 02:45:05.360]   I'm gonna have to do some math now.
[02:45:05.360 --> 02:45:07.720]   I didn't, they told me there'd be no math.
[02:45:07.720 --> 02:45:10.320]   So that we are falling back.
[02:45:10.320 --> 02:45:12.200]   So we're moving backwards an hour.
[02:45:12.200 --> 02:45:15.840]   So I think we're UTC minus eight, is that right, John?
[02:45:15.840 --> 02:45:19.440]   So yeah, I know he's going on, I don't know.
[02:45:19.440 --> 02:45:21.440]   So it is minus eight.
[02:45:21.440 --> 02:45:22.360]   It's minus eight.
[02:45:22.360 --> 02:45:23.560]   We're currently minus seven.
[02:45:23.560 --> 02:45:24.720]   Now it'll be minus eight.
[02:45:24.720 --> 02:45:25.560]   It's gonna be minus eight.
[02:45:25.560 --> 02:45:26.520]   See, you can do math.
[02:45:26.520 --> 02:45:27.960]   You're a math guy.
[02:45:27.960 --> 02:45:29.280]   No, no.
[02:45:29.280 --> 02:45:30.560]   No, minus eight.
[02:45:30.560 --> 02:45:32.160]   I'm gonna watch, I'm a clock guy.
[02:45:32.160 --> 02:45:35.080]   So it is, it is 21, was 2100,
[02:45:35.080 --> 02:45:37.840]   it will be 2,200 UTC next week.
[02:45:37.840 --> 02:45:39.840]   Okay, okay, did you get that?
[02:45:39.840 --> 02:45:41.960]   You can have to do the math for your local time.
[02:45:41.960 --> 02:45:43.960]   2,200 UTC next week.
[02:45:43.960 --> 02:45:46.760]   Come by, join us, you can watch the live stream.
[02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:49.400]   Or listen, there's live audio and video.
[02:45:49.400 --> 02:45:51.840]   Twit.tv/live.
[02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:53.560]   If you're watching live chat live,
[02:45:53.560 --> 02:45:55.920]   the IRC is open all day and all night
[02:45:55.920 --> 02:46:00.640]   to everybody, to all comers at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:46:00.640 --> 02:46:02.920]   There's also, of course, the Discord for club members.
[02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:05.480]   After the fact, get your copy on demand,
[02:46:05.480 --> 02:46:07.640]   add supported at twit.tv.
[02:46:07.640 --> 02:46:08.960]   Or on the YouTube channel,
[02:46:08.960 --> 02:46:12.480]   all of our ad supported shows have YouTube channels
[02:46:12.480 --> 02:46:13.640]   dedicated to them.
[02:46:13.640 --> 02:46:15.840]   That's a great way to share content,
[02:46:15.840 --> 02:46:17.240]   'cause you can easily clip it
[02:46:17.240 --> 02:46:19.600]   and post it on Twitter or whatever.
[02:46:19.600 --> 02:46:21.920]   That helps us, by the way, by promoting the show.
[02:46:21.920 --> 02:46:24.320]   And of course, the easiest way for most people
[02:46:24.320 --> 02:46:27.200]   is to subscribe, find your favorite podcast program,
[02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:31.080]   like overcast or pocket casts or Google or Apple's podcast app
[02:46:31.080 --> 02:46:32.160]   and subscribe.
[02:46:32.160 --> 02:46:34.040]   And that way you'll get it automatically
[02:46:34.040 --> 02:46:37.200]   as soon as we're done here, which we will be soon.
[02:46:37.200 --> 02:46:39.320]   We just have to cut all the profanities out.
[02:46:39.320 --> 02:46:42.920]   Thank you, everybody for joining us.
[02:46:42.920 --> 02:46:43.960]   We'll see you next time.
[02:46:43.960 --> 02:46:46.040]   Have a great Halloween, by the way.
[02:46:46.040 --> 02:46:48.400]   Nobody wore costumes today.
[02:46:48.400 --> 02:46:49.440]   I wore orange.
[02:46:49.440 --> 02:46:50.280]   I wore orange.
[02:46:50.280 --> 02:46:51.120]   That's good.
[02:46:51.120 --> 02:46:53.480]   And what does your teacher say, freedom to connect?
[02:46:53.480 --> 02:46:55.560]   It says freedom to connect at David Eisenprey.
[02:46:55.560 --> 02:46:58.480]   It was a conference 10 years ago, 12 years ago.
[02:46:58.480 --> 02:46:59.560]   It was great.
[02:46:59.560 --> 02:47:01.280]   Great conference, but it was the right color.
[02:47:01.280 --> 02:47:02.440]   Now you're that guy that you can say,
[02:47:02.440 --> 02:47:04.800]   I've got taste shirts older than you.
[02:47:04.800 --> 02:47:05.800]   Yeah, it's good.
[02:47:05.800 --> 02:47:06.640]   It's good.
[02:47:06.640 --> 02:47:07.480]   We all are.
[02:47:07.480 --> 02:47:08.680]   I'm sad to say we all are.
[02:47:08.680 --> 02:47:09.840]   Thanks for joining us, everybody.
[02:47:09.840 --> 02:47:10.680]   We'll see you next time.
[02:47:10.680 --> 02:47:11.520]   Another twit.
[02:47:11.520 --> 02:47:12.360]   It's a good game.
[02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:13.200]   Bye-bye.
[02:47:13.200 --> 02:47:14.040]   It's amazing.
[02:47:14.040 --> 02:47:17.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:47:17.400 --> 02:47:18.400]   Do the twit.
[02:47:18.400 --> 02:47:19.400]   All right.
[02:47:19.400 --> 02:47:21.040]   Do the twit, baby.
[02:47:21.040 --> 02:47:21.840]   Do the twit.
[02:47:21.840 --> 02:47:22.840]   All right.
