[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.540]   This is TWIT.
[00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.660]   This week in tech, the show that covers the technology news
[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.140]   from the week.
[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.660]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.460]   That's Buzz Out Loud.
[00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.260]   This is the show where we just kind of goof around
[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.900]   for an hour and a half.
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.180]   And we're so glad you're here.
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.100]   I am glad to be here.
[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.380]   Yes, Molly, what is here?
[00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.900]   So good to see you.
[00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.460]   You've returned to Buzz Out Loud.
[00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.020]   I have.
[00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.980]   I'm back on Buzz Out Loud every day.
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:56.940]   Yay.
[00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.820]   I tell you, it's a much better show.
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.940]   I've never made so many people so happy all at once.
[00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.420]   It was a really gratifying feeling.
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.260]   Isn't it just to know that they want you?
[00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.980]   They love you.
[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.300]   They want you back.
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.220]   I like that show.
[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.940]   And now you're ranting professionally.
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.420]   I am.
[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.900]   I've decided to rant in written form and not just
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.340]   an audio and video.
[00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.220]   I'm going back to my writer roots, actually.
[00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.620]   I have a new blog.
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.580]   It's news.com/molly-rance, which is its own rant.
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.580]   Yeah, that's a rant right there.
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.580]   Yeah, I filed a bug for that.
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.740]   Do you find that once you start ranting
[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.940]   that you could rant about almost anything,
[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.380]   like you just start looking for rants?
[00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.300]   Pretty much, yeah.
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.300]   In fact, someone twittered me the other day
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.340]   and he said, why do you let--
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.300]   I don't even know what it was.
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.660]   Why do you let a commercial bother you on TV?
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.860]   And I just wrote back and I said, have you met me?
[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.780]   I let everything bother me.
[00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.300]   Oh, that's good.
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.980]   That's the tagline.
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.500]   I let everything bother me.
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.980]   I let everything bother me.
[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.700]   Also here, Mr. Mark Millian from Los Angeles, the LA Times.
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.420]   So good to have you, Mark.
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.140]   To be on again?
[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.660]   Yeah, Mark's.
[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.500]   And I let nothing bother me, by the way.
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.900]   Really?
[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.500]   You're one of them.
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.500]   He looks just like Justin Long, the I'm a Mac guy.
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.540]   It's just like living in life in LA right for the Times.
[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.300]   What could be--
[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.780]   Come on, Mac.
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.180]   OK, got an iPhone here.
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.420]   I could be the Mac guy.
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.660]   Hi, I'm Mark Millian.
[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.140]   I'm a Mac.
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.540]   And of course, Molly is a PC.
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.140]   That's true.
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.300]   Earlier, I was wearing a t-shirt that says,
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.260]   I think I still have it here.
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.660]   It says, I'm a tech god.
[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.020]   And Windows 7, it was my idea.
[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.220]   Is that-- now, see, do you rant against Windows ever?
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.740]   Because that is a terrible slogan.
[00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.380]   Windows 7, it was my idea.
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.740]   That's kind of silly.
[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.300]   It's not the best slogan I've ever heard.
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.140]   I mean, you know, yeah, sure.
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.020]   I rant about everything.
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.620]   Like I said, everything bothers me.
[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.660]   But Microsoft is--
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.340]   they bought-- I mean, blessed their little hearts.
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.020]   They may have the worst marketing department.
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.780]   Oh, my god.
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:56.300]   What is the name?
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.540]   In all of human history, really.
[00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.340]   The new name-- OK, so the World Mobile Congress
[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.100]   went on this week in Barcelona.
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.140]   And they announced the Windows--
[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.140]   the new Windows Mobile 7, except it's not
[00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.900]   called Windows Mobile 7.
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.340]   It's called Windows 7--
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.580]   Windows phones--
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.180]   Windows 7.
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.500]   Windows Phone 7.
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.540]   No, you missed a part.
[00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.460]   Windows Phone 7, Siri.
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.500]   Siri-- ah, in terrible name.
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.420]   Can you-- could you come up with a worst name?
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.700]   It's just grammatically awkward.
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.100]   It's just terrible.
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.900]   And it's so unmemorable.
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.220]   I mean, I've been saying it all week,
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.100]   and I still didn't remember it.
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.220]   Yeah, it's beyond awkward.
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.500]   It's just word salad.
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.820]   I mean, it's like aphasia.
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:38.820]   Yeah.
[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.460]   I don't understand.
[00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.460]   Windows 7, 7 word series phone.
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.460]   Hall.
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.140]   I remember when Yahoo had-- this was my favorite name ever,
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.540]   actually.
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.660]   Yahoo, go for TV.
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.260]   Yahoo, go for TV.
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.540]   Oh, for TV.
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.740]   Yahoo, go for TV.
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.020]   It's like when Tina Fey goes, I want to go there.
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.060]   It is just--
[00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.580]   I want to go there.
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.740]   It's just crazy, crazy man.
[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.460]   Anyway, what are your thoughts about the new Windows 7
[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.140]   series phone mobile thing?
[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.860]   Well, I mean, I think despite the word salad name,
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.700]   this is the first time I've seen Microsoft doing something
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.420]   in the mobile space that looks vaguely promising.
[00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.220]   It's based on Zoom, and it incorporates
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.620]   all of these kind of things that--
[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.740]   I saw Bill Gates at E3 what three or four years ago,
[00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.060]   showing off the idea of having your Xbox gamer tag integrated
[00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.180]   into your Windows mobile phone.
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.540]   And it was like, how do you--
[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.420]   And now four years later it's here, which is great,
[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.340]   but is it too late?
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.940]   Mark, have you-- I mean, none of it.
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.300]   Nobody's seen these phones.
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.500]   It's all-- basically, I've seen this video.
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.980]   Yeah, but I've spent a lot of time, obviously,
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.180]   with the iPhones since I have one.
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.020]   And with the Android for many years,
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.460]   trying all the different Android phones for reviews.
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.300]   And I like that they didn't just pull out
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.740]   a carbon copy of the iPhone Oats.
[00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.140]   It's not just little, little, you know, chiclet buttons.
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:04.540]   But it's rather like this new, fresh, like these big Lucida
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.380]   Grand, I think, is the font face they're using.
[00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.060]   And it just looks really nice, and it looks kind of fresh
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.220]   and original, because nobody's used the Zoom before.
[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.260]   So it feels like a new interface.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:20.020]   It's fresh, because what is this Zoom they talk of?
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.780]   No, I agree with you.
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.500]   I think that it's kind of-- it's refreshing just for the fact
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.580]   that they didn't try to do an iPhone.
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.860]   I think you're absolutely right.
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.540]   They did a tiny bit try to do a Palm Pre, which I think has been
[00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.900]   a little overlooked, that they're really doing kind of that deck
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:37.980]   of cards, their faces--
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.460]   Because of the slide.
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.260]   But what they say is that it doesn't just slide this way.
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.820]   It slides this up and down and left and right.
[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:45.900]   It's like--
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.180]   It does on the pre-to.
[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.340]   Oh, the pre-to you slide up and down to?
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.900]   Yeah, the pre-totally has the x-axis sliding.
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.140]   Oh, I know that.
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.660]   OK.
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.100]   Well, you slide up the closed files, right?
[00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.940]   That's right.
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:57.460]   That's right.
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.220]   That's right.
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.780]   So I guess, OK, so it is a little pre-ish.
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.540]   Although I think big fonts, really nice graphics,
[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.500]   I'm a little annoyed that you have to have, you know,
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.180]   like, ads for essentially what are ads for Microsoft products
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.420]   in there like Xbox Live.
[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.700]   What are you talking about?
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.940]   I mean, you got a tile for it.
[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.660]   I guess you could get rid of it, right?
[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.420]   Which is awesome, because you can integrate your Zoom--
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.180]   Yeah, but what if--
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.860]   But what if I don't have a gamer tag?
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.340]   Well, you should totally get one.
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.540]   Oh, it's my fault.
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.100]   So I guess in that sense, maybe it is a little bit of an ad
[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:34.740]   for that.
[00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:35.500]   Maybe I should--
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.980]   I'm sure you can turn it off, though.
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.260]   I'm sure it's going to have a customizable, you know,
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.740]   tile screen or whatever.
[00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.140]   I'm wondering if you can switch the default search engine
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.140]   from Bing to Google, because they were
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.100]   pushing that mobile Bing quite a bit with this.
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:47.600]   Right.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.820]   And whatever happened to the rumor that Apple was going
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.620]   to do a deal to put Bing on the iPhone,
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.540]   that must have been a bad rumor, because that never happened.
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.660]   That was definitely a bad rumor.
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.060]   That was an upsetting rumor, actually.
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.780]   That just made you feel really kind of dirty.
[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.540]   That didn't feel comfortable to me out.
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.060]   What do you use a pre-today, Molly?
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.140]   No, I'm on the Droid.
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.380]   I broke up with my iPhone.
[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.500]   And then now I'm very happy with the Droid.
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.220]   You know what I like?
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.420]   I'm using the Nexus 1, and I loves it.
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:15.620]   I was just testing that phone.
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.380]   It's great.
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:17.980]   Isn't it nice?
[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:18.860]   Yeah.
[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:22.340]   I mean, they all have the improvements that haven't--
[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.980]   I don't think they've rolled them out to Droid yet, right?
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.820]   No, it's 2.1, and Droid only has 2.0.
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:29.380]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.380]   Yeah.
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.500]   Some of that stuff is awesome.
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.420]   Like, they somehow managed to improve further
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:38.500]   on the navigation app, which is just incredible
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.980]   that it's free in the first place.
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.180]   But yeah, there's so much good stuff going on with that Nexus 1.
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.060]   Actually, as long as we're talking, I haven't asked you guys,
[00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.500]   what do you think of Buzz?
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.660]   Buzz?
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.580]   Buzz, I'm ranted against Buzz, actually.
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.580]   Oh, what a surprise.
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:52.100]   Oh, really?
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:52.740]   I'm Molly Rant.
[00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:53.820]   You didn't like Buzz.
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.380]   What a surprise.
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.580]   What did you like about Buzz, Molly Wood?
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.060]   The giant privacy nightmare?
[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.060]   Oh, that.
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:00.900]   That's not the best.
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.300]   Oh, that's not the best.
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.820]   The part where everybody that I really like and am close to
[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.700]   on Gmail suddenly became part of a public friends list
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:08.900]   that everybody could see all the time.
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.620]   And also the fact that it pulled as my internal profile
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.780]   picture, at least it didn't publish it publicly.
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:16.620]   But as my profile picture that it showed me,
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.180]   it used a picture from my droid that I hadn't ever offered.
[00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:20.900]   Ooh, oh, that's really bad.
[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:21.420]   Which is bad.
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:21.900]   I know.
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.140]   I mean, on top of all of the terrible things that it did,
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.100]   including-- and this may be the worst
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.820]   in a ball cluttering up my Gmail inbox,
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.260]   which was unacceptable--
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.580]   it also, I think, pulled this droid picture out of thin air.
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.060]   And that was just creepy as hell.
[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:35.220]   Yeah.
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.700]   No, that is creepy.
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.060]   Now, but it didn't publish it.
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:39.740]   It didn't publish it.
[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.140]   No, it just published it.
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:45.860]   I'm going to channel a Google engineer.
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.100]   Well, but you didn't have a profile.
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:54.420]   So we had to supply a picture because you didn't--
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.540]   did you not create a Google profile?
[00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:57.900]   Molly, what?
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:58.860]   And then it's just so--
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.220]   I'm sure they were thinking, well, it's just so useful.
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.060]   It was a very Steve Jobs kind of rollout, actually.
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.020]   It was very like, well, you want to do this.
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.900]   You want to have everybody in your contact list
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.780]   as your public contact list.
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.540]   Everybody that you email a lot, of course,
[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.060]   they would be your contacts.
[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.340]   And it's like, never mind the fact.
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.380]   I mean, I think the big mistake--
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.540]   OK, the first big mistake was, I can't believe they
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.580]   didn't learn from Facebook that you don't opt people
[00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:22.900]   into this kind of thing.
[00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.180]   And then the second mistake is just the idea
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.340]   of having social networking as part of email.
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.020]   I just feel like those are two really different paradigms
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:32.900]   right now still.
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.820]   If email is still private space, at least to me.
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.260]   That actually hit me immediately what you're talking about
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.900]   with Facebook, because this just totally
[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.460]   wreaked of one of Facebook's many blunders.
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:49.340]   It's like these engineers that have no mind for public testing
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.820]   and no sense of personal privacy, that it's just this mindset,
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.020]   like, well, we'll do it for you, right?
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.540]   We don't need your permission.
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.020]   This is what you wanted.
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:00.500]   Like you were saying, this is what you want to do, right?
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.740]   I mean, this is like Facebook's public updates.
[00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:03.580]   This is News Feed.
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:04.780]   This is Beacon.
[00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:09.980]   It's just these engineers that are like, wait, why wouldn't
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.460]   you like this?
[00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.220]   I mean, isn't this the way to go?
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.380]   This is like the easiest thing to do, right?
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:16.380]   We'll do it for you.
[00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:17.940]   And then Eric Schmidt has the nerve to say,
[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.460]   what nobody was hurt.
[00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.460]   That was like his justification for it.
[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.340]   Well, nobody was hurt by this.
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:29.500]   And did you see the class action lawsuit that's being
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:30.940]   filed in this--
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.100]   Yeah, Lady in Florida.
[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.100]   Yeah.
[00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:34.100]   Right.
[00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:38.940]   Abusive ex-boyfriend who sees her contactless, basically,
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:43.460]   who she's emailing with most often, namely her new boyfriend.
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.780]   Oh, that's good.
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:51.940]   So now, of course, because I am exactly the opposite of Molly,
[00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:53.540]   I'm Molly twisted.
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:54.740]   I loved it.
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:55.900]   And I didn't mind.
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.300]   But I also understand why people were upset by the whole thing.
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.180]   It wasn't a good thing.
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.460]   We also got 10,000 followers almost immediately.
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.700]   Within a week.
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.540]   You know, your bathroom scale has almost as many followers
[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:08.140]   as me on Twitter.
[00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.580]   What's your Twitter handle?
[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.580]   We got to fix that.
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.660]   It's just my name, Mark Millian.
[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:21.700]   M-A-R-K-M-I-L-I-A. And please, please, please,
[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:26.100]   I beg of you, just follow the guy, because I don't know if I
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.860]   can handle the rep-- the approbation.
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.180]   I'd rather you just plug Leo's on your score scale.
[00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.180]   No, no, no, that's the opposite.
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.140]   We don't want that.
[00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:36.860]   Oh, dear.
[00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.740]   Well, yeah, no, I don't know why anybody would care,
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.740]   because Leo's scale, the only thing it does is every morning,
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.220]   it says how fat I am.
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.300]   Maybe that's why.
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.780]   Maybe that's the appeal of it.
[00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.660]   That's why you're cutting down.
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:49.260]   You're looking good.
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.780]   I'm slimming down, baby.
[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:51.940]   Thanks to Leo's scale.
[00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.940]   Thanks to the fact that I am humiliated in public
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.420]   every morning, whether I like it or not.
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:57.220]   And do you know that I did this, Molly?
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:01.940]   And when you get on the scale, it tweets it immediately.
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.460]   You can't go, oh, shoot, and jump off.
[00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.860]   Like, oh, no, don't send that.
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.940]   It's too late.
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.740]   Because I tried a couple of times.
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:13.740]   I'm going, that's wrong.
[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.700]   And I jumped off and no too late.
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.500]   So I know it's a mistake.
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.020]   I'm little.
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:19.540]   I'm little.
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.020]   I'm little.
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:20.540]   I'm little.
[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:24.420]   I'm just saying it like more power to you, sweetie.
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:24.780]   I'm sorry.
[00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:25.980]   I muted you, Molly.
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:26.660]   Oh, you did?
[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.060]   Yeah, that doesn't happen often, I'm sure.
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:28.940]   But I accidentally--
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.340]   I've been muted all this time because I've
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.380]   been saying really smart stuff.
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:32.900]   Yeah.
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:33.740]   And no one heard her.
[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:34.220]   Yeah, the whole show.
[00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.220]   The whole show.
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.380]   She was so good, folks.
[00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.660]   I wish you could have heard her.
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:40.780]   Oh, man, is she brilliant.
[00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.500]   Is that good?
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:43.340]   I'll better.
[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:44.540]   You can hear me now.
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.740]   I'm insane, Calcan is weighing himself in public.
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:47.420]   And I was thinking--
[00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:48.820]   Yeah, he's doing it too.
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.300]   You know, Lester's a little liar.
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:51.500]   Like, good for you.
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.020]   But no, thank you.
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:53.980]   No woman would ever do.
[00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.860]   I mean, it's just-- this is the kind of-- right.
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.140]   Like, this is the kind of thing that only a geek would think of.
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.260]   Like, how Google admitted that they didn't test buzz
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.420]   anywhere else but inside Google.
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:03.980]   So, of course, it made perfect sense to them
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.500]   to just sign up everybody because it was like,
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.260]   all your buddies from Google.
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.060]   And then the whole idea of the scale, which is like,
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:12.100]   you know, maybe you should ask them girls about this stuff.
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.420]   But now they fixed it.
[00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:14.300]   They fixed it.
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:15.380]   So it's OK now, right?
[00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.620]   I mean, they fixed it.
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.980]   You know, I think it's fine.
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:20.860]   And I think it's great.
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.020]   It should definitely be an opt-out thing.
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.620]   You know, I'm glad I have an inspiration.
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:25.180]   It's not.
[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:25.860]   Yeah.
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:26.820]   I still don't want it.
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.900]   Like, it just doesn't make any sense to me as a paradigm.
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:29.740]   I already have Facebook.
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.540]   And I don't want social networking in my email.
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.460]   Well, see, now this is what I think is funny
[00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.020]   because people who are on Facebook
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.060]   bitch about privacy on buzz.
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.540]   I mean, Facebook is not-- I mean, let's face it.
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.340]   It's a sieve.
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.460]   Yeah.
[00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.860]   But you don't-- but--
[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:47.460]   Well, but you can configure it, right?
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.140]   Like, I think that all of the things that Facebook did wrong
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.020]   are the things that Buzz did wrong too.
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.940]   Like, opt you into all of this stuff.
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:57.020]   And Facebook definitely should not be let off the hook.
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.140]   Like, just because Buzz is bad doesn't mean Facebook is not bad.
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:01.940]   I mean, the fact that when they rolled out
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.500]   their new privacy thing, they opted everybody in.
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.140]   If you hadn't changed your default privacy settings,
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.060]   then all of a sudden your default privacy settings
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.740]   became everyone on the internet.
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.900]   I mean, that was almost just as bad,
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.380]   except that on Facebook, you already
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.740]   opted into the people that you're friends with.
[00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.660]   And you knew that that was a public-facing thing.
[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.820]   The idea that Google would come along and all of a sudden
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:28.140]   make all of your email contacts public, I think, was just--
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:28.620]   Absolutely.
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.820]   I can't even believe that they thought that was OK.
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:31.620]   No, absolutely.
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:32.300]   Reprehensible.
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.020]   They backed down.
[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.140]   I don't know why Eric Schmidt was a little more apologetic.
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:36.860]   But that's, you know, I think that's kind of Eric.
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.260]   He's also the guy who said, hey, if you're not doing anything
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:43.380]   wrong, you shouldn't mind if everything you do is seen online.
[00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.820]   What do you got to hide?
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.180]   I think the common thread between these companies
[00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.900]   that they don't seem to realize is that social is
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.220]   a very sensitive subject.
[00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:54.100]   People have their personal privacy beliefs.
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.780]   And this is just a business to them.
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.740]   I mean, in real life, social interactions,
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.340]   there are unspoken, subtle nuances.
[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:07.300]   Like, I'm not really surprised that these engineers don't
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.660]   get those certain things.
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:16.140]   But this is just causing problems for a huge population.
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:17.460]   John C. Dvorak's in our chat room.
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.660]   I'm going to pull him up.
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:20.980]   I want to get him on the show, too.
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:21.700]   So he can rant.
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.820]   Then it'll be two ranners in you and me, Mark.
[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:27.100]   Let me get John on here.
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.860]   And then we're also going to take a break,
[00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.500]   because I want to get a commercial in.
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:34.780]   So let me see if I can pull up John.
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:35.340]   All right.
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:36.500]   Hello, John.
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.260]   Also, if you have any of the engineers in your chat room,
[00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.260]   can you ask them what the hell is wrong with this stupid laptop?
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.340]   Molly now looks like Mrs. Dvorak.
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:47.380]   They're saying you look like Mrs. Cleaver.
[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.180]   Like June Cleaver.
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:51.380]   I'm serious getting more messed up and odd looking
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.500]   by the second.
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:56.700]   Dear everyone, it's an HP NV15 and it's a turd.
[00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:57.420]   Help.
[00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.060]   Nobody's ever--
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:58.420]   Send help.
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.460]   Nobody's going to ever let you buy any of their products.
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.500]   You understand that, right?
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.820]   It really shouldn't be because it should be said out of the game.
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:06.380]   I have this magnetic field and I break it.
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.380]   She breaks everything.
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:11.180]   The laptop has already gone back to get fixed.
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.140]   Like the hard drive died.
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.340]   The N key didn't work.
[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:15.340]   Now the webcam stuck on either night mode
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.500]   or Veronica Lake vision.
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.780]   What the hell?
[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:18.860]   I like it.
[00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:23.420]   If you put on some pearls, you'd be a hot TV star from the 50s.
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:25.500]   You got any pearls?
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.180]   She's looking around.
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.220]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:33.060]   When we come back, John C. Dvorak and more news,
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:34.980]   including-- I know I bet you guys don't have something
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.180]   to say about this-- a school that now admits it's
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:42.340]   a spied on its students using their laptops 46 times.
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.220]   But that's all.
[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.140]   Meanwhile, folks, I want to talk a little bit about.
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:46.660]   Go to meaning.
[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.260]   My good friends at Citrix have put together a great product
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.060]   based on their remote access technology.
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:54.900]   You know you've heard about Citrix, I'm sure, for years.
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:55.860]   They do go to my PC.
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.940]   They have great high-end enterprise stuff.
[00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.540]   And go to meeting.
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.620]   Go to meeting is meeting software designed
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.580]   to make your meetings just pop to life.
[00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.900]   We all have phone calls, those conference calls,
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.300]   where you want to show them something visual and you can't.
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.820]   You know, a chart, a picture, a spreadsheet, maybe
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.900]   a PowerPoint presentation.
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.500]   It's frustrating because you're trying to explain it.
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.300]   This slide here, if you were able to see it,
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:23.420]   has a graph that contains four bars-- one's red, one's blue,
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:24.060]   one's green.
[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.100]   That's not going to work.
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.580]   Call loss longer.
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:28.940]   A picture's worth 1,000 words.
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:30.900]   And with go to meaning, you can show them that PowerPoint.
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:31.980]   You could show them the spreadsheet.
[00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.180]   You can collaborate.
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.780]   You can even train because you can give them control
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.460]   of a program even if they don't have it on their system.
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.300]   I just love go to meaning.
[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.100]   I want you to try it right now for free,
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.020]   but go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.540]   We use it on a couple of our shows now
[00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:46.460]   to show screenshots.
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.260]   It's fantastic.
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.540]   For sales presentations, for product demos, for training,
[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:56.420]   go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:57.020]   Try it today.
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.420]   I think you're going to like it.
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:18:59.860]   School--
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:04.660]   Now you go to meeting for the first time the other day.
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:07.300]   An engineer was showing me Office Sync.
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.500]   And he's based in Chicago.
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:10.340]   So obviously--
[00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:10.980]   How'd you like it?
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:12.380]   Pretty cool, huh?
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.940]   It was really cool, actually.
[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:17.500]   And I was on my piece of crap computer at work.
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.620]   And I was like, I really don't think this is going to work.
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.860]   And just put in the password.
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.060]   And instantly it came up.
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.860]   And yeah, I had no experience with anything like that.
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:27.380]   Yup.
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:27.940]   Love it.
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:28.940]   Love it.
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.300]   I don't know what's happening with John.
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.780]   John, are you here, John?
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.780]   Are you going to come in?
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.180]   John, do you hate us?
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.140]   Mr. Devoreak.
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.780]   Look, I found some pearls.
[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.220]   Mr. Devoreak.
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:39.740]   You did.
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:40.420]   Let me see.
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:40.940]   I did.
[00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:41.460]   Yeah.
[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:41.940]   Oh, you look--
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:42.420]   Don't drink the bread.
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.260]   Look at that.
[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.260]   She looks gorgeous.
[00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.380]   Now you do look like June Cleaver.
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:48.860]   June Cleaver, that's awesome.
[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:49.780]   That's what I was going for.
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:50.940]   Can we go back to the Veronica Lake?
[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:51.540]   Wouldn't that was good?
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.980]   You also look like Veronica Lake.
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:54.700]   You look gorgeous.
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.820]   And she's wearing a ton of makeup, which looks--
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:00.260]   you should-- in black and white, even, it looks even
[00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.140]   extra special.
[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.380]   You look more like a Lauren McCall now.
[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:04.860]   I guess if this thing is going to be a turd,
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.500]   it might as well be like a Lauren McCall.
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:07.620]   Well made up turd.
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.540]   Seriously.
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:12.020]   Let's see.
[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.460]   John says he's trying to connect.
[00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:14.820]   I'll try again with John.
[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:20.860]   Meanwhile, what do you think about this school in Pennsylvania?
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.180]   I guess it must be a good school.
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.940]   They give their kids laptops when they matriculate.
[00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:33.820]   What happens is a kid is called on the carpet
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:38.220]   by the assistant principal who says, we know what you did.
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.420]   And the kid says, what?
[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:43.060]   Look, look at this picture.
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:46.660]   And it's a picture of the kid in his room.
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:51.260]   And apparently, this assistant or vice principal
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:56.340]   used a photo taken automatically from the kid's laptop
[00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.620]   by the webcam.
[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:03.700]   The kid, good for him, said, I don't think that's right.
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.540]   I think that's right.
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:06.740]   This doesn't sound quite right.
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.500]   It doesn't sound right.
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.860]   And where'd you get?
[00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:15.860]   So the parents come in and say, what's going on?
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:20.620]   Well, turns out that every laptop is shipped with software
[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.540]   that would let the school take pictures from the laptop's
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.180]   camera, listen to the laptop's thing.
[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.060]   Now they say it's in case the laptop's stolen.
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:28.700]   And there are Mac programs like this.
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.980]   It's one called Uttercover that will do that.
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.100]   But now it's starting to come out that maybe they've
[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:34.900]   used it before and maybe really they
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.580]   are using it to spy on the kids.
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:41.100]   And in fact, they used it 42 times.
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:45.500]   They used it 42 times.
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:50.100]   And they managed to claim that in turning it on 42 times,
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.660]   that all of those times were because they thought
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.060]   that the laptops were missing or stolen.
[00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.700]   Which if you actually have that level of problem
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.180]   with the laptops they'd give the students, maybe chain them
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:03.060]   to the desk instead of spying on them in their bedrooms.
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.620]   They were talking to inner city Philly right here.
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:09.700]   You don't know.
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:10.700]   Is it inner city Philly?
[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.860]   Is that what this is?
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:14.540]   I don't know much about the school.
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:15.860]   It's Philadelphia.
[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:19.700]   I'm willing to get to bet that they're buying the laptop
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.780]   buddy that they're not having too much magic play.
[00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.940]   Has to be fairly affluent.
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.380]   I mean, that's an expensive thing.
[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:30.020]   It's the lower Marion school district.
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.260]   Now, of course, there's a lawsuit.
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.620]   Blake J. Robbins versus the lower Marion school district.
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.140]   Yes, Inc.
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.780]   This story is especially near to me
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:42.980]   because when I was in high school,
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.100]   like six years ago, five years ago--
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.540]   Oh, God.
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:47.700]   Sorry, guys.
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:48.700]   Oh, God.
[00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:49.780]   What does this mean?
[00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:52.660]   That's so mean.
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:55.780]   We had all gotten laptops my entire high school
[00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:58.100]   in my senior year.
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:01.860]   But I mean, at that point, it was probably
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.940]   their biggest blunder for that particular year.
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:07.700]   We all just installed super Nintendo emulators and stuff,
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.820]   so no work was getting done.
[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.060]   But it was still early days at that point.
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:17.660]   So they didn't even know that they could monitor us,
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:19.060]   I'm sure, using the cameras.
[00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:21.460]   But hey, they did.
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.060]   That was scary.
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:26.580]   Hey, that's John C. de Vorac appearing on your laptop
[00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.260]   to see what you're doing.
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.980]   I'm trying to look as much like Molly as I can.
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:32.140]   That's very attractive.
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.100]   You're black and white.
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.300]   You got that much going for you.
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:36.740]   You shouldn't give yourself some hair.
[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:37.940]   Now's your big chance.
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:41.020]   Oh, ow, burn.
[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:41.980]   Sing.
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.220]   Since I have a hair that doesn't really offend me.
[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:44.980]   Oh.
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:46.060]   He has plenty of hair.
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:46.580]   Yeah.
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:47.380]   He doesn't worry about it.
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:48.540]   Unfortunately.
[00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:49.740]   Yeah.
[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:52.900]   But you're just in time, John, to say,
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.460]   for some reason, the school district was totally justified
[00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:58.100]   in spying on the students with the security software.
[00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:59.380]   Yeah, so what's the deal, John?
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:01.340]   I think it'll be because the school district
[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:02.820]   who are a bunch of perverses and they wanted to see
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:04.580]   if a kid was masturbating.
[00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.060]   It's--
[00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:07.540]   I mean, you all start to wonder, though,
[00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:10.220]   like what possible other reason could there
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.060]   be other than just absolute dirty--
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.180]   I just told you the reason.
[00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:17.860]   We believe that a child here has been masturbating.
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:18.700]   We have the pick.
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.900]   What, you know, they don't ever say what this kid Robins
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:24.060]   was doing that the vice principal showed in the picture.
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:26.180]   I think I read something that said they thought he was
[00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:27.460]   taking some kind of pills.
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.660]   It was talking about--
[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:29.660]   Oh, can I?
[00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:30.660]   I mean, sure.
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.900]   I mean, there is absolutely no excuse for this.
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:34.580]   And I think they should be sued, frankly,
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:36.100]   off the face of the Earth.
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.980]   Like, I cannot imagine.
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.220]   I mean, I guess I can see that maybe it was sort of a slippery
[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:40.820]   slope, right?
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.740]   Like, they turned it on one time because they thought it was lost.
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:45.140]   And then they thought, oh, maybe we can keep an eye
[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:46.580]   on these kind of problem students.
[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:48.380]   And then the next thing you know, they're watching them
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:48.860]   all the time.
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:49.380]   But you know what?
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.940]   You're just making this up as you go along.
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:54.820]   She's trying to find some possible justification.
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.260]   It's kind of hard to punch a--
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:57.220]   That's the reason.
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:57.980]   You really think that--
[00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.420]   What also really kind of pissed me off about this story
[00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:03.260]   is that the consensus in all the coverage
[00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:06.140]   was that the quotes were saying, like, well,
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:09.820]   we could understand if they were just monitoring site activity.
[00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:11.780]   But to go through the webcam, why is it
[00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:14.300]   cool to monitor site activity?
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.100]   Even still, when I had the laptops in my high school,
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.620]   they had just a big flowing list of every site
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.740]   everybody was going to.
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.940]   And for that very reason, I would get home
[00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:27.900]   and then never use my school-led laptop again.
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.180]   And I also love about this story,
[00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:32.940]   that the kids had just finished reading 1984.
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:35.460]   It seems like that iron just keeps popping up.
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:38.300]   Like that Amazon book story.
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:39.020]   Is that really true?
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:40.620]   That sounds like a dig comment.
[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:41.580]   Too good of you believe.
[00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:42.780]   Oh, no, no, no, it's true.
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:43.620]   So much.
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.300]   Oh, wow.
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.540]   That's unbelievable.
[00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.460]   1984 ironing never stops.
[00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:52.820]   You remember that they pulled the 1984s off of the Kindles
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:54.340]   months ago?
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.260]   Remarkedly destroyed.
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.260]   It's great.
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:59.700]   So let's talk a little bit about--
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.660]   Anyway, I guess this school district is going to be in deep
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:05.540]   due to the FBI is now involved because--
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.900]   I mean, it's more than-- now it's just not a civil case.
[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:13.220]   Now the FBI says, you violated computer intrusion laws.
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.980]   Well, and I would not be surprised if at some point
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:18.460]   there is either a hint of or actual child porn charges.
[00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:20.500]   Because child porn charges have been levied against people
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:21.660]   for far less than this.
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:22.500]   That's a good point.
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.900]   And the fact is, these parents are saying,
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:28.260]   you probably have webcam footage and pictures of my kid
[00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:31.460]   in various stages of undress, and that is an out-out
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.860]   into extremely bad territory.
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:34.940]   That's awful.
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:35.540]   You're right.
[00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:36.540]   Oh, geez.
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:38.220]   I don't even want to think about it.
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:38.900]   Jail time.
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:40.340]   I mean, it's absolutely horrible.
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:42.500]   Yeah, we're talking jail time.
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.500]   Yeah.
[00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.380]   No wonder the FBI is involved.
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:46.340]   Oh, that's depressing.
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:50.300]   Now, my kid's school gives him a MacBook with a built-in laptop.
[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.100]   What do we do?
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.580]   Do we have to look for that software and try to--
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.140]   Just put a post it over the webcam,
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:56.460]   which is frankly what I should do is mine--
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.540]   Put a piece of gaffers tape over my little cameras
[00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:01.420]   on those laptops and monitors that have cameras on them.
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:02.700]   You tape it over.
[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:04.220]   But then you still have audio.
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:07.100]   It's also a problem because many people
[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:10.300]   who use Justin.tv and other YouTube video streaming
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:13.860]   services quick often turn on when they turn on the flash
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.780]   to capture it, give permanent permission for flash
[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:19.580]   to take over the webcam and the microphone.
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:22.180]   So could even go to a malicious site that would just say,
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.180]   OK, start taping.
[00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.500]   The flash you wouldn't--
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.660]   So Leo, you've gone back to the Hawaiian look.
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.380]   Is this what you're going to be seeing from now on?
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:32.220]   No, I just-- you know what?
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.260]   It was a rainy day in Petaluma.
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.100]   And I just thought I'd bring a little sunshine
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.860]   into the lives of the little people who watch this show.
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.300]   Did you ever tell the story to these people about how
[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:45.020]   you used to wear these wild shirts over tech TV?
[00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:48.500]   And then one day, one of the bosses, one of the suits,
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:52.100]   came over and told you to tone it down.
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.580]   But in fact, this was adding to the entertainment
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:56.060]   value of the show to an extreme.
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.740]   We didn't want to be too dull.
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:58.220]   Actually--
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.260]   That's why Leo's on the internet now.
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:00.940]   Yeah, damn it.
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.300]   So I can wear my Tommy Bahama shirts.
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.660]   I just think that some of these stories need to be told.
[00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:06.380]   Thank you.
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:09.860]   Well, you've just told that story.
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:13.300]   Although we do only have so much time in life, so--
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:14.900]   I'm just trying to catch up so you
[00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:16.740]   can't wear off the show for the first 20 minutes.
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:17.300]   I'm sorry.
[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:18.660]   You know, we had--
[00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.020]   We had Twitter when people were like, sweet, John's not on.
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.340]   You can keep Leo on track.
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:24.980]   We had a little scheduling sniffoo.
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:30.620]   And I guess we hadn't contacted you, John.
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.700]   Not through any lack of desire.
[00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:42.140]   So Apple has begun a war on porn.
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:45.180]   In the last 12 hours, Apple has booted--
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.700]   you're going to like this, Molly.
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.980]   5,000 applications from the App Store.
[00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.460]   Applications it had approved.
[00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:54.980]   But now decides that they're too sexy.
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:57.380]   Overtly sexual content.
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.580]   Why did you direct that story at Molly?
[00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:05.820]   Because she doesn't like Apple's punitive draconian control.
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.220]   I don't like them bossing me.
[00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:08.860]   Yeah.
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:10.700]   So you're thinking, John, that I'm being sexy.
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.660]   I'm like my ex-brother, but I can have all the porn I want.
[00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:13.780]   No, I thought you were being insulting.
[00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:15.980]   You make it sound like she's like some ex porn girl
[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:16.420]   or something.
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:17.180]   I don't know.
[00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:17.700]   No, no, no, no.
[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:18.700]   I said nothing to do with the porn.
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:22.340]   I'm going to ask the girl in this video, this webcam.
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:23.180]   No, I--
[00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:25.100]   You know what I like is that you're
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.940]   in the kitchen, Mrs. Cleaver.
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:28.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.220]   I put the girls on.
[00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:31.020]   Folks, if you're not--
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:31.860]   He's in the kitchen.
[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.140]   She's like Molly Cleaver.
[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:34.860]   And I had her put pearls on.
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:36.860]   It's just great.
[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:38.980]   No, just later on, I'll go make a roast.
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:41.420]   For those of you who are not watching on video,
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.780]   you must download the video version of this show
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.220]   and watch later.
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:46.220]   So--
[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:49.820]   This is exactly the kind of thing, I think, that Apple does
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:52.100]   and has been doing all along with the App Store, which
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:55.100]   is arbitrary approval and disapproval of apps.
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:57.060]   And then what I've said to them before--
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:59.340]   and we'll say even more strongly now--
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:02.340]   is that censorship is an incredibly slippery slope.
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:04.860]   And once you start, even just a little bit,
[00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:07.900]   you find yourself in this really uncomfortable position.
[00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.780]   If they hadn't been so insistent on approving
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:12.380]   every app in the first place, then it
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:14.220]   wouldn't be so easy to say, well, we want the sex,
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:16.220]   we're all just going to be left gone.
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.220]   And then all of a sudden, it's gone.
[00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:18.220]   And then it's like, where do you end?
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.220]   Because you're always going to be offending someone.
[00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.220]   So they could play whack-a-mole like this
[00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.220]   for the next 10 years.
[00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:26.220]   You know, it's funny because on Mac Break Weekly,
[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:29.220]   I was complaining about the fact that they were turning down
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:32.220]   really great, useful applications and allowing programs
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:34.220]   like tight-body, perky boobs to get through,
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:37.220]   which is actually a program that was there
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:38.220]   and has now been removed.
[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:39.220]   What's the name of it?
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.220]   It's gone now.
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:42.220]   It's gone, John.
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.220]   It's tight-body, perky boobs.
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:47.220]   But my question is, how did this get through the screening process
[00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:50.220]   when programs like the Squarespace Blogging App
[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:54.220]   gets turned down because its icon is unaesthetic?
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:57.220]   And so I can't really be-- I'm not going to be a hypocrite
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.220]   and say, I'm not glad that these apps are gone.
[00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:02.220]   But the point really is the point that you made at Molly,
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:06.220]   which is once they start censoring for whatever reason,
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:09.220]   that icon design, they're now in this business.
[00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:11.220]   And so they are going to get held to a higher standard.
[00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:14.220]   They did not warn any of these application guys that,
[00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.220]   you know, what you're doing, we might pull it off
[00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:17.220]   or anything like that.
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:19.220]   So let's just see if--
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.220]   If you're not going to be a higher standard necessarily,
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.220]   it's going to be an increasingly arbitrary standard.
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:24.220]   It's arbitrary.
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:25.220]   That's my point.
[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:27.220]   At this time, they've censored.
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.220]   Like there was no Google Voice.
[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.220]   They refused to like Google Voice, like you said, Squarespace.
[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:32.220]   Those bother me.
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:33.220]   That's Apple politics.
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:37.220]   Those bother me a lot more than not being able to get booby-ass.
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:38.220]   I agree.
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:39.220]   You just pull up Safari.
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.220]   You can get porn.
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:45.220]   But for these useful utilities, that's just politics.
[00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:46.220]   Right.
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:49.220]   In an effort to raise the ratings of the show,
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:52.220]   I'd like to now go through the business insider,
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:54.220]   Silicon Valley business insiders,
[00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:58.220]   15 outrageous sex apps that made it into the iPhone App Store,
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:03.220]   slideshow, iJiggles your mom.
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:04.220]   Okay.
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:09.220]   Video strip poker, strip Simon,
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:10.220]   Puff.
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:13.220]   This application lets you lift the skirts of Japanese girls
[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:16.220]   by blowing into your iPhone's microphone
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:20.220]   to create a virtual gust of wind.
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.220]   Pocket girlfriend.
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:23.220]   That's funny.
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:24.220]   Yeah, that's funny.
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:27.220]   Pocket girlfriend, which a lot of geeks,
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:30.220]   as bad as close as they're going to get.
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:33.220]   The Russian brides gallery.
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:34.220]   Oh.
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.220]   [laughs]
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:37.220]   My vibe.
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:38.220]   I'm not going to go into that one.
[00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:40.220]   Adult tennis boobs.
[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:44.220]   A bunch of pictures of tennis players.
[00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:48.220]   Yeah, this is what the computer revolution has finally come to.
[00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:50.220]   This is what it's all about, baby.
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.220]   I can carry that in my pocket.
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:55.220]   Boobs in my pocket, finally.
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:58.220]   I find it kind of adorable, like vaguely sweet,
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:00.220]   how many of these apps had boobs in the name.
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.220]   Like, that seems so almost innocent.
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:04.220]   It's a quick way to find it, you know, if you do the search.
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.220]   Now, interestingly, there are quite a few apps
[00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:11.220]   in the Android marketplace that have,
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:13.220]   but not nearly the number, frankly,
[00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:15.220]   that have some sexuality in them.
[00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:19.220]   Although the Android store has, what is the app?
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:23.220]   They have the porn app store.
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:24.220]   Oh, they do?
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:26.220]   That is like the porn app store aggregator.
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:27.220]   What the heck is it?
[00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:28.220]   Oh, I missed that.
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:29.220]   Like, I feel whatever.
[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:30.220]   Thanks for the tip, Molly.
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.220]   I missed that one.
[00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.220]   Here's my favorite.
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:37.220]   It's just for iPhone, too, if you -- it's basically a web app.
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:42.220]   If you go to, I think it's sexappstore.com,
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.220]   you go to the site --
[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:45.220]   Well, because, yeah, the way Android --
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:46.220]   Well, I'm sorry.
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.220]   It stalls it onto the home screen.
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.220]   The way Android works is they, you know,
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:50.220]   you can buy from anywhere.
[00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:52.220]   So this is -- I think this is one of my favorites.
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.220]   It's called my candy, sorry.
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:55.220]   My candy, okay.
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:34:00.220]   M-I-K-A-N-D-I, and it's the world's first porn app store.
[00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:01.220]   Wow.
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.220]   And that's why you want to draw it.
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:04.220]   Well, I don't know.
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:08.220]   This, by the way, this application is still available in the iTunes store.
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:10.220]   It's called Nude It.
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:16.220]   What you do is you take a picture of somebody and it superimposes a person in their underwear under their head.
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:23.220]   So it does face recognition and then puts a naked person underneath them.
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:25.220]   I made that guy all set, though.
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:26.220]   I know, poor guy.
[00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:27.220]   The economy's in decline.
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:29.220]   [laughter]
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:31.220]   This is a 99 cent app that is still available.
[00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:32.220]   It was just released.
[00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:33.220]   So maybe --
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:34.220]   Yeah.
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:38.220]   Confused by what -- I mean, the suicide girl one is still on there.
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:39.220]   I have a whole life.
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:40.220]   That's the problem with this.
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:42.220]   But, yeah, suicide girl is on there.
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:43.220]   Playboy is still there.
[00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:44.220]   I'm looking right now.
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:47.220]   They have this, like, you must be 17 years or older to download this game.
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:52.220]   But what -- I mean, what are their standards for what gets deleted and what stays?
[00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:53.220]   Very strange.
[00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:54.220]   Exactly.
[00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:56.220]   Like, that's what's so ludicrous about this.
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:35:00.220]   Not only are they going to be playing whack-a-mole in part in my language or, you know, be a
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:01.220]   submissive.
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:06.220]   If they keep trying to do this, be in the censorship game because new iPhone apps are popping
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:07.220]   up, you know, left and right.
[00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:08.220]   Right.
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:11.220]   They're also totally arbitrary and they won't say what the standards are.
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:14.620]   And any time you don't know what the standards are, then you have a broken system because you
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:21.220]   have no trust as a developer that you're not going to get completely screwed.
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.220]   [laughter]
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.220]   Oh, yes.
[00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:26.220]   So, apples statements so far.
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:28.220]   The only statement they made.
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:33.220]   Whenever we receive customer claims about objectionable content, why am I getting feedback?
[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:35.220]   Is that you, John?
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:36.220]   No?
[00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:37.220]   Molly?
[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:38.220]   Today's SFA.
[00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:40.220]   Molly, do you have a -- yeah, it really is.
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:41.220]   What does SFA disappear?
[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:43.220]   John's gone to.
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:45.220]   This is just -- I'm going to have, you know.
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:47.220]   The whole week.
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.220]   The whole week.
[00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:49.220]   What is SFA?
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:51.220]   So, Fing Annoying.
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:52.220]   Yeah.
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:55.220]   So, that's not how I say it when I'm not on camera.
[00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:57.220]   So, Fing Annoying.
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:59.220]   Apples a reaction.
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:02.940]   Whenever we receive customer complaints about objectionable content, we review them.
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:07.220]   If we find these apps contained in appropriate material, we remove them.
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:12.700]   However, 5,000 apps gone in 12 hours, sounds like more than, you know, they're just getting
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:13.700]   around to it.
[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:15.700]   Sounds like a new box.
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:16.700]   It's a purge.
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:18.700]   It was just a ridiculous, you know, image.
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:19.700]   It's a purge.
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:20.700]   I don't know.
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:21.700]   It's a purge.
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:22.700]   We've got some tech stories.
[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:24.020]   That's a tech story.
[00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:25.900]   It's got the word Apple in it.
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:26.900]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.100]   I guess there's that.
[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:29.700]   Does Google make us stupid?
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.700]   I love that story.
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.220]   Does Google make us stupid?
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:37.020]   I think proof is positive.
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:40.340]   This is the future of the Internet survey conducted by the Pew Internet and American
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:45.820]   Life Project and Elon University's Imagining the Internet Center.
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:46.820]   Who endowed that?
[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:48.900]   I'd like to endow something, Elon University.
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:53.500]   I'd like to endow an imagining the Internet Center.
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.500]   They were asked to consider the future of the Internet connected world between now and
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:00.180]   2020 and the likely innovation that would occur.
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:03.060]   Survey required them to assess 10 different tension pairs.
[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:05.780]   There's somebody getting a big grant for this.
[00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:12.260]   Each pair offering two different 2020 scenarios with the same overall theme and opposite outcomes.
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:14.020]   Are you following me so far?
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.700]   I can't find it on the list of stories.
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:16.700]   Yeah.
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:17.700]   Oh, you go there.
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:18.700]   I'm not going to get it.
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:19.700]   Yeah.
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:20.700]   This is episode 236.
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.700]   It's a good delicious.com site.
[00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:23.700]   Go to my YouTube channel.
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:24.700]   Find it.
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:25.700]   Yeah.
[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:30.780]   Nick Carr in a cover story for the Atlantic Monthly in the summer of 2009 wrote is Google
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:31.780]   making us stupid.
[00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:36.100]   He said that the online searching and distractions of browsing through the web were limiting his
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:37.300]   capacity to concentrate.
[00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:38.300]   Nick's a smart guy.
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.300]   I don't think he's stupid.
[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:42.620]   Well, he should have changed the title of the story.
[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:43.620]   Yeah.
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:46.620]   Google making me stupid is what I should have asked.
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:47.620]   It's not Google's fault.
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:48.620]   It's you.
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:49.900]   Well, but they basically found no.
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.860]   When they did the story, they essentially said it's not making you more stupid.
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:57.180]   It might make you think in a different way, but ultimately it's making you potentially
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:00.380]   more informed and not more stupid at all.
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:01.380]   Yeah.
[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:03.220]   Can you prioritize what you keep in your head?
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:05.380]   Now, understand this isn't a test.
[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:06.380]   It's a survey.
[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:07.580]   So it could be making us stupid.
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:09.460]   We're just too stupid to know it.
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:11.540]   That could be.
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:13.380]   It sounds like just a species argument.
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:14.580]   Did you read this text?
[00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:17.100]   I'm not thinking the way I used to, he wrote.
[00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:21.820]   In part because he's becoming a skimming, browsing reader rather than a deep and engaged
[00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:22.820]   reader.
[00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:27.620]   The kind of deep reading that a sequence of printed pages promotes is valuable not just
[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:31.700]   for the knowledge we acquire from the author's words, but for the intellectual vibration
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:34.660]   those words set off within our own minds.
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:37.180]   Well, that's his fault, right?
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:40.860]   I mean, if he wants the skin, then he's making that decision.
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:46.180]   If he wants to Google the Renaissance and then read like a 100 page piece about the Renaissance,
[00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:47.180]   he could do that too.
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:48.340]   And then he could get a good point.
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:49.340]   Yeah, nobody's forcing him.
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:50.340]   Good point.
[00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:53.820]   There's this idea too that now just because we have new technology, we have to mourn the
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:55.620]   loss of the old way that we did things.
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:39:00.860]   And it's just exhausting, this sort of nostalgic exercise and like over intellectualizing the
[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:03.020]   loss of everything that used to be wonderful.
[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:09.820]   Like you have almost the entirety of human history at your fingertips at any given moment
[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:11.980]   on a computer or on your phone.
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:12.980]   Shut the hell up.
[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:15.100]   Life is pretty awesome now.
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:17.100]   So says Molly Cleaver.
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:18.100]   Thank you, Molly Cleaver.
[00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:19.100]   Excuse me.
[00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:20.100]   I have a roasted face.
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:28.540]   We'll be right back with Leave It To Beaver right after these words from our sponsors.
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:29.540]   Oh, Molly.
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:30.540]   I couldn't resist.
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:31.540]   All right.
[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:32.540]   Sorry.
[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:33.540]   Don't do.
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:40.980]   Get some over to everybody.
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:42.980]   We're going to talk a little bit about carbonite.com.
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:45.100]   Then we'll come back with more great stories.
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:51.260]   Our guest, Molly Wood from CNET's Buzz Out Loud on the new page, CNET.com/Molly-Rance, where
[00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:54.460]   she rants about all sorts of great subjects.
[00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:55.460]   She's just the greatest.
[00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:58.620]   So great to have you on Molly, even if you're in black and white.
[00:39:58.620 --> 00:39:59.620]   John C. de Vorek.
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:00.620]   I'll get it fixed.
[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:02.220]   No, I like it.
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:03.740]   I'm not complaining.
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:05.380]   It's good.
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:06.380]   It's really good.
[00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:09.940]   If I could superimpose it over the Leave It To Beaver thing, maybe I will.
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:18.820]   Let's see if I can make and make merge you together with the Leave It To Beaver thing here.
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:19.820]   That's good.
[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:22.620]   She's got too many toys over there, Leo.
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.620]   And now, what was her name?
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:27.620]   What was her name?
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:28.620]   Right?
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.820]   June Cleaver, but who played her?
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:36.300]   We should check it out.
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:39.900]   You know, if Google weren't making you stupid, you probably could figure that out.
[00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:40.900]   Barbara Billingsley.
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:41.900]   No, Barbara Billingsley.
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:42.900]   Thank you.
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:43.900]   Billingsley.
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:44.900]   Barbara Bill.
[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:45.900]   Very good.
[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:46.900]   Tony Dow.
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:47.980]   And the beaver.
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:50.780]   And what's his name as the beaver?
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:52.740]   Yeah, so-and-so is the beaver.
[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:53.740]   Yeah.
[00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:57.980]   I think we're going to call this show the beaver and see if Apple will let it be in the Apple
[00:40:57.980 --> 00:40:58.980]   store.
[00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:03.500]   Somebody already came up with, I think, I think they nailed the title for the show.
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:04.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:05.500]   What's that?
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:06.500]   Tennis boobs.
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:10.820]   It's got SEO written all over.
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:16.700]   We'll be back with John C. Devorak from Channel Devorak and Mark Millian from the LA Times.
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:20.260]   We were having some fun talking about the week's tech news, but I do want to mention
[00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:21.260]   backup.
[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:22.260]   Oh, don't get scared.
[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:23.820]   I got an easy way for you to back up.
[00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:28.780]   You know, sometimes I think people listen and I mention backup and they, ah, they just
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:30.860]   freeze up because they've had a bad experience.
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:34.220]   You know, you forget to back up, you lose your hard drive and it's going to happen and you're
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.220]   going to lose something valuable.
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:39.340]   You're, you know, your pictures, your music, your financial documents, your email, something's
[00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:40.340]   going to go.
[00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:41.820]   And there's no reason for that to happen.
[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:43.540]   It's not just hard drive crashes.
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:49.140]   I mean, the Carnegie Mellon study up to 13% of hard drives crash in their first year, but
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:53.100]   it's also frankly user error.
[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:54.540]   People throwing stuff out.
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:59.540]   43% of people lose files.
[00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:04.540]   They consider replaceable every year.
[00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:05.860]   600,000.
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:08.140]   And only 3% of those are ever recovered.
[00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:13.260]   That's why carbonite carbonite since 2006 had backed up over 25 billion files, restored
[00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:14.260]   2 billion files.
[00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:17.660]   That's two billion files that people went, thank you carbonite.
[00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:21.100]   I want to make sure that you have carbonite on your system.
[00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:22.100]   You install it.
[00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:23.460]   It starts backing up immediately.
[00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:29.060]   All of the irreplaceable files on your computer, the stuff internally backed up to the internet

[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.940]   A lot of times people try these online backups and they say, I love it.
[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:43.060]   And then they try to restore and they go, oh, no, where is that?
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.060]   Not with carbonite.
[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:45.060]   They even have an iPhone application.
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:47.980]   So at any time, if you want to see how your backup is doing, you can go to the iPhone
[00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:52.020]   or go to another computer even, log in to carbonite.com, download your file and get it

[00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:10.020]   Right.
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:15.100]   And now we return to leave it to Beaver.
[00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:18.220]   And by the way, I want to thank the chat room for the suggestion.
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:19.980]   Oh, a little Vino.
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:23.060]   A little shots plane 2003.
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:25.180]   Did you get that at the Costco?
[00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:28.020]   Isn't it like the wine buying time at Costco?
[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:30.180]   No, this has been sitting in the cellar for a while.
[00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:31.180]   It's aged.
[00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:36.340]   But they have to say for people out there want to know, Nevada, California, Costco,
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:37.340]   go there now.
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:40.500]   The place is loaded with loaded to the gills.
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:41.500]   Really?
[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:42.500]   Yeah, loaded.
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:43.500]   Sad story.
[00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:44.500]   Loaded.
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:54.900]   Sad story this week, a small plane crashed in Palo Alto, killing three executives at Tesla.
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:55.900]   Not Elon Musk.
[00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:57.660]   The CEO was fine, fine.
[00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:03.500]   But I thought what was most interesting about this was the coverage.
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:09.780]   Mashable broke the story, at least that's the geek's coverage I saw on Twitter, as Facebook
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:12.180]   loses power due to small plane crash.
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:13.180]   Right.
[00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:17.620]   And then CNN says three executives have their priority.
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:20.180]   Facebook loses power.
[00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:23.420]   And then it was CNN that pointed out that there were actually in fact three executives.
[00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.420]   There were actually people in the plane who died.
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:26.420]   Yeah.
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:27.420]   Well, Facebook was out.
[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:30.700]   Well, I didn't know for a while, I think, that it was Tesla executives.
[00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:34.820]   It was pretty bad that they were focusing on the Facebook outage when obviously no one,
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:39.100]   you know, probably not everybody's okay when a plane crashes into a house.
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:40.260]   Yeah, that's usually pretty bad.
[00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:41.260]   That's considered not a good thing.
[00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:42.260]   That seems to be bad.
[00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:44.020]   And then the Tesla stuff came out a lot later.
[00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:46.100]   And that is, I mean, that's awful.
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:48.500]   It's a very small company still, I think.
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:49.500]   And that's...
[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:50.500]   Oh, yeah, terrible.
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:52.980]   It didn't take that long for the Tesla material.
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:56.740]   The one Tesla guy in particular that came up pretty quick because he's the owner of
[00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:57.740]   the plane.
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:58.740]   Right.
[00:44:58.740 --> 00:44:59.740]   Right.
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:00.740]   Yeah.
[00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:04.660]   New York Times talking about how much you should pay for a digital edition of the Times on the
[00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:05.660]   iPad.
[00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:08.740]   And there's some debate.
[00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:10.420]   And I'd be curious what you guys think.
[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:13.580]   First of all, how much would it be worth for you to get the New York Times on the iPad
[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:16.020]   instead of say the print edition?
[00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:17.020]   Would you buy it?
[00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:20.700]   We could do it with the LA Times if you prefer, Mark.
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:21.860]   We're not charging.
[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:22.860]   It's free.
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:24.660]   You think you're going to continue to stay free?
[00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:25.660]   Yep.
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:26.660]   We're going to stay free.
[00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:27.660]   I think that's interesting.
[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:28.660]   That's interesting.
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:31.700]   You know, Murdoch, of course, and The Times and others are saying we got a charge.
[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:34.300]   We can't give it away.
[00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:35.300]   And that's great for us.
[00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:39.300]   We get to be the number one paper pretty soon on the Internet.
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:40.300]   Yeah.
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:48.060]   We're debating the hardcore print guys in The Times, according to sources at geek.com, are
[00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:50.660]   saying $20 to $30 a month.
[00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:53.100]   It's like $240 to $360 a year.
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:55.980]   Seems like the paper is subscripted in cost, right?
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:57.540]   No, the paper's pretty expensive.
[00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:01.740]   If you just, it's like $6 to get the Sunday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday times, $6.
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:03.660]   What happened to the 25 cent paper?
[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:05.180]   They made it all up on advertising.
[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:06.780]   That's long gone, John.
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:07.780]   What?
[00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:08.780]   How old are you?
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:09.780]   Who knew?
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:14.700]   I mean, I think if they're building a full featured, if they're building these really
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:20.780]   kind of full featured apps that are optimized for these devices, not necessarily the iPad,
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:23.260]   because no one should buy that.
[00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:29.340]   But I think that there may be some compelling argument that, you know, toward a subscription
[00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:34.220]   fee, like I think I would subscribe to papers on a tablet, on a reading device like that.
[00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:35.220]   Yeah.
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:36.980]   I think how much I'm paying right now.
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:39.580]   And how about the, what's the right price, Molly?
[00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:40.580]   The point's going to be a lot lower.
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:42.300]   I think 20 or 30 bucks a month is...
[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.300]   It's too much.
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.300]   No.
[00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:45.300]   The digital edition, that's absolutely ridiculous.
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:50.300]   I mean, I think $5 or $10 a month is probably about where you might find people willing to
[00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:51.460]   do it.
[00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:55.580]   What you have according to geek.com is the print folks were afraid of cannibalizing their
[00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:57.900]   print business like there's anything left in the year.
[00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:00.380]   He would you have never heard that or argument before?
[00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:01.380]   Yeah.
[00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:03.860]   The digital folks say, oh, $10 a month.
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:06.660]   We want to charge $10 a month, which some would say it's still too much.
[00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:07.900]   Mark, you would say it's still too much.
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:09.660]   And I think $10 I would pay $10.
[00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:10.660]   I think $10.
[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:13.220]   I would pay $5 or $10.
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:18.580]   Just for Bittsblog and the main tech and business and world content alone, I think it's
[00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:19.580]   worth $5 or $10.
[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:24.580]   But I mean, at the early times we have this philosophy that we're not going to take things
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:25.980]   away.
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:31.300]   This is like taking things that everybody online has been getting for a while and they
[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:37.900]   could easily turn to scores of other organizations to get their news content.
[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:41.980]   I think there's so many other areas that the New York Times could go into.
[00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:45.700]   They could do like they could have small teams that build mobile apps.
[00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:47.700]   They could create like new products.
[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:51.260]   They don't need to take everything and put it behind a wall.
[00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:55.620]   So you think it's a lack of vision?
[00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:57.900]   I think to an extent maybe it is a lack of vision.
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:02.700]   I think they're worried more about how to make up the money in the next two years rather
[00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:10.540]   than looking to other ways and having the content as almost a sort of loss leader.
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:16.140]   I mean, John, you mentioned the 25 cents fees for the paper and then you make it up
[00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:17.540]   and advertising.
[00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:19.540]   That was always the business model.
[00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:22.420]   I mean, granted classifies are gone now.
[00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:28.940]   But the business model was never to make people pay up front and I'm afraid we don't think
[00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:30.980]   it makes sense to go there now.
[00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:32.860]   Has jobs visited the LA Times?
[00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:35.260]   Do you know Mark?
[00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:36.940]   If I knew I wouldn't be able to tell you.
[00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:37.940]   Okay.
[00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:38.940]   Good answer.
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:39.940]   But I don't know.
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:41.740]   You could have said that.
[00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:42.740]   But I think.
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:45.140]   If you knew it's your journalistic responsibility to tell it.
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:46.300]   Well, that's an interesting question.
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:47.300]   Is it?
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:48.300]   I don't know.
[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:49.300]   It's just like it's a steep job.
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:52.940]   My personal NDA, if I see him, I can't tell anybody.
[00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:54.260]   He's like a con.
[00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:59.380]   Molly, if if jobs showed up at CNET, even if the big boss said you can't say a word,
[00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:00.700]   would you say?
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:02.620]   It's the big.
[00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:03.620]   It's that.
[00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:06.820]   Ask me the question, Leo.
[00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:07.820]   John C. de Vorek.
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:10.100]   If Steve Jobs came to the house.
[00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:14.220]   And your wife said, John, you may not tell anyone.
[00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:15.220]   Would you say?
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:17.340]   I would tell everybody.
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:18.340]   Yeah.
[00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:20.100]   Nobody tells me what to do.
[00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:21.940]   That's why you don't have a job, John.
[00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:25.580]   You just work for freelance for a bunch of people.
[00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:30.660]   I've told everybody at the Twit College that they may not say that Steve Jobs was here.
[00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:32.660]   It's a secret.
[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:33.660]   When was he there?
[00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:34.660]   What?
[00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:36.660]   So he was there then is what you're saying?
[00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:37.660]   Okay.
[00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:38.660]   Excuse me.
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:39.660]   I have to do it.
[00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:42.500]   You know, for some unknown reason, I just can't see Steve Jobs showing up at the cottage.
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:45.060]   No, he didn't show up.
[00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:46.060]   Actually I think Steve.
[00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:52.700]   You know, remember I held up the laptop and sent out a signal of the iPad announcement,
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:53.700]   right?
[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:56.180]   And I've been waiting for repercussions because, you know, I mean, they didn't tell me not
[00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:57.180]   to.
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:58.180]   Nobody stopped me.
[00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:02.540]   There's a couple of Steve Jobs lookalikes that are in the industry.
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:03.540]   Yeah.
[00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:07.060]   We can do a show and then I'll be sitting there and the thing and saying, Hey, hey, hey,
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:09.220]   that's, look, look, and then you'll swing the camera.
[00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:12.180]   I'll grab a camera, swing it over, catch him as he runs out.
[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:14.180]   It's like the Yeti.
[00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:17.180]   Just see a foot.
[00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:22.020]   You just see a, you know, a well, well, clad foot coming out the door.
[00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:23.500]   So what was I saying?
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:27.060]   Oh, so Steve apparently did visit the Wall Street Journal in the New York Times.
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:29.060]   Brown or something.
[00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:30.060]   Yeah.
[00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:32.060]   Wearing a weird hat.
[00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:33.060]   Yeah.
[00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:34.060]   Now that's Valley WAG.
[00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:35.060]   That can't be real.
[00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:39.540]   I mean, I think the question really is though, like, you know, with all due respect, Mark,
[00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:43.700]   the LA Times has had some pretty serious financial problems that the New York Times and Wall
[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:45.180]   Street Journal are hoping to avoid.
[00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:49.860]   I mean, it is a possibility and this is obviously a discussion that's ongoing in the industry,
[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:54.620]   but it is a possibility that it isn't sustainable to keep relying on advertising in the way that
[00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:59.500]   we have, at least not if that advertising has to pay for the cost of, of manufacturing
[00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:00.500]   and delivery.
[00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:04.580]   So a digital edition is going to be cheaper, but if it has a value add, and I guess that's
[00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:07.700]   my question, does it give me something more than the web?
[00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:11.940]   And if it does, and it's a, it's a great reading experience for whatever reason on this tablet,
[00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:16.340]   and I don't know that it's, that it's going to be fundamentally unreasonable to charge
[00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:18.060]   a small subscription fee.
[00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:21.660]   It's just that that has to be, I think it's going to have to be a small subscription fee
[00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:23.260]   or people aren't going to pay it.
[00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:24.260]   Yeah.
[00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:29.860]   Well, Molly, the industry model sustained itself for 150 years in newspapers.
[00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:32.340]   We're an economic downturn right now.
[00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:36.220]   You kind of have to have faith that it will eventually turn around and that advertising
[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:38.220]   will be a viable model again.
[00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:42.900]   And granted before there was classified ads, but that's, that just goes to the point that
[00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:45.580]   there are other business models out there.
[00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:49.780]   And it was just never about limiting your reader base.
[00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:51.980]   Can I mention something that was being overlooked here?
[00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:52.980]   Yeah.
[00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:56.340]   But especially about the New York Times and to a lesser extent, probably to no extent
[00:51:56.340 --> 00:51:57.860]   with it Wall Street Journal.
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:02.020]   The New York Times is because they set themselves up as a syndicate, Tuke syndicates actually
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:05.180]   as a New York Times syndicate, and then they actually syndicate their entire content to
[00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:07.100]   anybody who wants it.
[00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:11.900]   And which creates, if you go to Google News, you see there's a huge redundancy of stories
[00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:12.900]   from the New York Times.
[00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:15.900]   And even when you go to the New York Times, it says that blocks you out.
[00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:18.220]   It says you cannot read the story unless you're registered.
[00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:22.660]   You can cut and paste the headline into Google and find 45 other instances of the exact same
[00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:28.740]   story running in St. Petersburg and Atlanta and Austin and every place else around the
[00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:29.740]   country.
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:34.780]   These people, once the New York Times puts itself onto the little iPad, I don't see why
[00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:37.940]   they wouldn't do the same thing and they can just undercut the New York Times.
[00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:41.020]   This is what's cannibalizing the potential for the New York Times.
[00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:46.300]   It's its own syndication and the fact that it set out to ruin the newspaper industry
[00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:47.300]   years earlier.
[00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:51.020]   The New York Times and Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post decided to syndicate their
[00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:53.620]   content and their columnist incidentally.
[00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:57.980]   So all the papers are in the middle of Poe Dunk USA would say, "Well, let's just fire all
[00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:01.580]   our local columnists and just run theirs because it's a lot cheaper."
[00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:05.780]   They kind of ruined the entire country, but now with the internet, it's turned back on
[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:06.780]   them.
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:09.780]   I think it's one of the great ironies that's undiscussed.
[00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:11.980]   I don't think it's undiscussed.
[00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:15.580]   I mean, I think everybody is kind of aware that if you start to...
[00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:20.660]   I can see Leo is listening to my diet tribe.
[00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:23.460]   What did you say, John?
[00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:26.700]   Oh, I had the wrong picture.
[00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:27.700]   There we go.
[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:28.700]   Yeah, look at that.
[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:29.700]   It's pretty close.
[00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:31.900]   It's not bad.
[00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:32.900]   It's pretty good.
[00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:36.300]   Anyway, any old fuzzy black and white photo.
[00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:38.100]   I don't know what we're talking about.
[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:39.100]   I totally forgot.
[00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:40.580]   I'm sorry.
[00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:42.220]   Whatever you said, John, you're right.
[00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:43.220]   You're right.
[00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:44.220]   No, pretty.
[00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:49.660]   No, everybody knows that the big argument against the idea of charging for this idea,
[00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:53.700]   some sort of premium journalism product, is that you can find that journalism product
[00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:55.620]   in some form all over the web.
[00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:57.700]   I mean, I don't think that's undiscussed at all.
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:01.380]   I think that's probably the thing that has been keeping everybody up at night, including
[00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:02.380]   CNET.
[00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:04.620]   I just think that there is...
[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:07.100]   I think it's worth it to experiment.
[00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:10.820]   Like at CNET, that there is a market for higher quality news, and people want to pay
[00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:11.820]   for it.
[00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:12.820]   And by the way, I should clarify.
[00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:14.300]   I don't read the text.
[00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:15.300]   I'm not a fan.
[00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:16.300]   I do.
[00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:17.300]   I love it.
[00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:18.300]   I pay for it.
[00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:19.300]   I pay 10 bucks a month, easy.
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:20.300]   I wouldn't pay that much.
[00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:21.300]   I'm not sure.
[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:25.540]   They put into that newspaper, and I think that they may find, by trying this experiment,
[00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:27.780]   that people are willing to pay for it.
[00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:30.700]   Well, I think there's evidence to the contrary.
[00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:35.260]   Newsday put up their wall, and they're fairly big in their own market.
[00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:37.340]   Thirty-five people subscribe to the news-
[00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:39.380]   Yeah, classic story.
[00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:40.300]   Say this again?
[00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:41.300]   Mm-hmm.
[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:45.860]   I don't know if that's exactly the number, but newsday put up their pay wall, and within,
[00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:50.380]   I think, nine months, 35 people have subscribed to the online edition.
[00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:51.380]   Total.
[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:53.180]   Yeah, it was something really low like that.
[00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:54.180]   Okay.
[00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:57.780]   The journal makes a ton of money on their online subscription and their newspaper, which is
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:59.740]   outrageously expensive.
[00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:02.060]   And I pay for it for a good reason.
[00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:03.060]   Why?
[00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:04.060]   It's good paper.
[00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:08.900]   It was because it has specific targeted financial information about companies you may have invested
[00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:10.260]   in, and you need to know about.
[00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:11.260]   You make money on it.
[00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:12.260]   You target rich people.
[00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:13.260]   Yeah.
[00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:17.380]   Well, you're rich, but also that information makes you money, so you're willing to pay
[00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:18.380]   for it.
[00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:23.540]   But also, it's a high quality journalistic product, and that's what the New York Times
[00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:28.100]   is trying to say, too, is we're a higher quality journalistic product than, you know,
[00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:29.580]   blog XYZ.
[00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:33.340]   And so we think, and mind you, I'm just playing devil's advocate, right?
[00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:36.620]   Like, they are saying we think people are going to be willing to pay for it, and the
[00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:39.180]   market will decide whether, in fact, people are willing to pay for it.
[00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:42.220]   I still think it's worth them trying it.
[00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:48.340]   According to New York's Daily Intel, Steve Jobs had a top secret dinner at--
[00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:49.340]   Oh!
[00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:52.620]   --Prano in the Flatiron District.
[00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:54.620]   The sometime Pescatarian--
[00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:56.620]   Is that reading from ValleyWag?
[00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:59.420]   The sometime Pescatarian.
[00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:00.420]   Jobs is actually a vegan.
[00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:01.420]   I don't believe he eats fish.
[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:06.140]   Dined with 50 New York Times company executives in the seller dining room sat with Times
[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:11.100]   publisher Arthur Saltsberger, according to Daily Intel, showed off his new iPad and
[00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:14.140]   ordered off-menu.
[00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:15.140]   This wasn't on the menu.
[00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:20.100]   He ordered a mango, lassi, and penne, in case anybody's interested.
[00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:21.100]   Also according to Daily Intel.
[00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:22.980]   And I think this ruins the whole story.
[00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:25.940]   Jobs showed up wearing, quote, "a very funny hat."
[00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:26.940]   A big--
[00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:27.940]   Very funny.
[00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:29.940]   A big top hat kind of thing.
[00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:32.940]   He was just trying to entertain his new biographer.
[00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:33.940]   A top hat?
[00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:35.940]   That would be something.
[00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:36.940]   Hi, I'm Steve Jobs.
[00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:39.420]   Where's the paparazzi when we need them?
[00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:41.660]   Was he, like, in disguise?
[00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:45.940]   Yeah, as Mr. Peanut, apparently.
[00:56:45.940 --> 00:56:50.180]   There was also a tweet that got Steve a little upset.
[00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:57.500]   Alan's Murray, Alan S. Murray, who is an online executive editor on February 4, tweeted
[00:56:57.500 --> 00:56:58.500]   from an iPad.
[00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:00.260]   It says, "This tweet sent from an iPad.
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:02.780]   Does it look cool?"
[00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:05.260]   Immediately deleted it.
[00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:10.380]   A tipster tells ValleyWag that deletion ultimately traces back to a furious jobs.
[00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:11.980]   ValleyWag asked Murray for comment.
[00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:15.900]   Murray wrote, quote, "I would love to talk about this, but can't.
[00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:20.540]   In a later email he added, I will say that Apple's general paranoia about news coverage
[00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:24.740]   is truly extraordinary, but that's not telling you anything you didn't already know.
[00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:28.460]   So if you get an iPad, do not tweet from it.
[00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:33.620]   Now I've been told, and this is where I think I'm getting my comeuppance because I've been
[00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:34.620]   told that--
[00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:36.700]   Would you just look at Leo?
[00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:37.700]   Nobody.
[00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:40.700]   That was a-- I looked off to the right, but there's nobody here.
[00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:42.740]   There's somebody over there.
[00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:45.740]   It's Steve Jobs and his top hat.
[00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:46.740]   How did you know?
[00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:50.740]   John, you're so perspicacious.
[00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:53.940]   I went there to the iPad thing.
[00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:55.180]   I streamed out audio.
[00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:57.540]   I confess and video from the iPad announcement.
[00:57:57.540 --> 00:57:58.540]   Nobody told me not to.
[00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:02.020]   I never asked, and nobody said no, so I didn't break any rules that I know of.
[00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:04.860]   However, I have a feeling I'm getting-- because Cina did ask, apparently.
[00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:08.260]   I found out later and was told no.
[00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:10.460]   But I've been waiting for the other shoe to drop.
[00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:12.220]   Like somehow I'm going to get it, right?
[00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:20.220]   So I found out today that my archrival radio host, Kim Commando, who does a nationwide
[00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:27.420]   syndicated computer talk show, claims she is getting an iPad review unit next week.
[00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:29.060]   Not I.
[00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:31.220]   And second place is two iPads.
[00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:32.900]   Yeah, you don't really care.
[00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:37.060]   The iPad, apparently, on the 25th, the rumors say will be available for pre-order.
[00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:40.300]   I take it, you're not going to pre-order, John.
[00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:42.100]   You've got that correct.
[00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:43.100]   I am.
[00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:44.100]   I would.
[00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:45.100]   I can't wait to get my molly.
[00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:46.100]   Yeah, well, you buy everything.
[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:47.100]   No, but I don't count.
[00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:49.340]   I don't count, but I would buy it even if I were a normal person.
[00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:50.340]   Like he's hopping.
[00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:52.340]   I'm bouncing on my ball.
[00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:53.340]   I'm so excited.
[00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:54.340]   He's like Kevin Space.
[00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:56.740]   He has to fall over like he did last week.
[00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:57.740]   I did.
[00:58:57.740 --> 00:58:58.740]   I fell off the ball last week.
[00:58:58.740 --> 00:58:59.740]   It was quite humiliating.
[00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:01.940]   Molly, I take it, you're not going to pre-order an iPad.
[00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:03.580]   I'm not going to pre-order it.
[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:04.580]   Come on.
[00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:08.260]   Even if I want-- even if I thought that in its current form, it is all that a tablet can
[00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:09.260]   be.
[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:11.260]   It's first generation hardware from Apple.
[00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:14.420]   That alone is enough reason not to pre-order it.
[00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:15.420]   Mark Millian, come on.
[00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:17.940]   You're going to get one.
[00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:19.300]   I probably won't get one.
[00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:24.900]   But before I tell you why, I want to thank you for that live stream of the Apple conference,
[00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:28.820]   because I was tasked with blogging that remotely, which is usually the hardest thing
[00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:30.420]   in the world that I just follow.
[00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:33.060]   If you hadn't followed my stream, you wouldn't have gotten it anywhere.
[00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:35.540]   We had 150,000 people watching that.
[00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:37.020]   It was valuable.
[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:39.180]   Refreshing the GDGT live blog.
[00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:40.180]   But aside from that--
[00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:48.620]   they were-- it was me and GDGT because of Ryan Block because everybody else was using
[00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:51.500]   CoverIt Live and it went down.
[00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:53.500]   Of course.
[00:59:53.500 --> 01:00:00.700]   But no, I'm not getting an iPad because I can almost envision no scenario when I would
[01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:05.940]   pick up that device versus going to my laptop or going to my phone.
[01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:13.420]   I think it would be great for my mom who has a desktop and a phone but just has no in-between
[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:15.860]   to use the couch or whatever.
[01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:18.700]   Just for me, I don't really think it makes sense.
[01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:21.060]   Well, I'm going to order one.
[01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:22.060]   So there.
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:24.460]   I don't mean to discourage you.
[01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:25.460]   I'm going to order two.
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:27.500]   John, I don't even have to ask you.
[01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:29.060]   You cannot discourage him.
[01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:30.060]   No.
[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:31.060]   You're going to ask me what?
[01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:32.620]   I guess you already said you're not going to get one.
[01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:33.820]   I'm not going to order one.
[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:34.820]   Why would I?
[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:36.060]   Because I need another piece of equipment.
[01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:37.060]   I got enough stuff.
[01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:40.500]   And by the way, since I'm here, since you got me on the camera, I have a new poster for
[01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:41.500]   sale.
[01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:42.500]   Oh, good.
[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:43.500]   Let's see it.
[01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:44.500]   Okay.
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.300]   Look, there's the Barney that got 1.2 million views.
[01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:47.860]   1.3, by the way.
[01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:49.940]   Singing in John's bathtub.
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:50.940]   What is this?
[01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:52.740]   This is the Captain Zylog poster.
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:54.500]   Oh, I'd buy that.
[01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:55.500]   From the '70s.
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:59.940]   Zylog created the Z80, which was one of the early microprocessors.
[01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:01.380]   And it says Captain Zylog.
[01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:04.700]   The fireworks have just begun.
[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:06.140]   Wow.
[01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:07.820]   Handsomely framed.
[01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:09.300]   He looks like Captain America.
[01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:10.900]   And is this to promote the Z80?
[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:11.900]   Yeah.
[01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:14.220]   This is when Zylog was a big shot company.
[01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:15.380]   They came out with these posters.
[01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:17.740]   And this is extremely rare now.
[01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:21.460]   So, yeah, some guy in the chatroom typically bid a dollar.
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:23.220]   A bid a dollar.
[01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:24.220]   Yeah.
[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:25.220]   Nice try.
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:26.980]   So anyway, that's my latest.
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:29.620]   So I'm trying to get rid of all this stuff.
[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:30.620]   Yeah, I know.
[01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:32.700]   I'm sure your house is full of that crap.
[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:34.180]   So what do you got a Barney back there?
[01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:35.180]   I mean, you know--
[01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:36.180]   You got a Barney.
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:37.980]   Is that a code word for something?
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:39.780]   I got you a Barney right here.
[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:41.740]   I got a Barney back here.
[01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:45.220]   So how could somebody-- if somebody wanted to buy that, what would they do?
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:46.700]   Just email me, man, make an offer.
[01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:50.540]   And if I see something I like or, you know, anything, like somebody just bid $500.
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:51.540]   I'd sell it for $500.
[01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:52.540]   That'd be a good deal.
[01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:54.060]   Whoops, somebody just bid a thousand.
[01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:55.060]   Yeah, sure.
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:56.060]   Name monkey.
[01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:57.060]   That'd be a good deal.
[01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:58.060]   Anyway.
[01:01:58.060 --> 01:01:59.060]   You're like that.
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:00.060]   Go ahead.
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:04.660]   Oh, I have some breaking news about the New York Times and the paywall, actually.
[01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:08.980]   It appears that Arthur Sullsberger, Janet Robinson, and Martin Neeson Holtz of the New
[01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:14.060]   York Times at the paid content conference today said that-- and this is where now I'm
[01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:16.940]   not even going to try to devil's advocate them anymore.
[01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:20.060]   They said they will include blogs in their metered paywall.
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:21.060]   Oh, at least.
[01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:22.060]   What does that mean?
[01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:23.060]   You know what?
[01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:24.060]   No.
[01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:25.060]   No.
[01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:26.980]   People are going to pay to listen to some blogger.
[01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:28.300]   No, they have some blog.
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:31.380]   They have their-- if you look in bits, they have a number of blog tech blogs.
[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:33.300]   It's mostly a tech blog.
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:38.820]   And then that is where the entire argument falls apart because that is where there are
[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:43.340]   a million different publications that are doing the exact same thing as the New York
[01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:44.340]   Times blog.
[01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:47.580]   And there is absolutely no way that they can try to convince me that that is worth paying
[01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:49.140]   for over another blog.
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:54.340]   See, that's just annoying because I was just kind of playing to Arthur.
[01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:55.620]   Yeah, and actually that's a bad amount.
[01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:59.380]   Like the shoulders make the blogs free and have the blogs constantly referencing the
[01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:00.380]   paid site.
[01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:01.380]   Yeah, something.
[01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:02.380]   Yeah.
[01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:03.380]   That's a premium.
[01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:04.380]   That's a premium.
[01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:05.380]   Yeah.
[01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:08.740]   I mean, this idea that really like their blog is so much better than somebody else's blog
[01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:10.540]   that I'm going to pay for it, I mean--
[01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:12.540]   Forget about it.
[01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:13.540]   So what's the next story?
[01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:14.540]   I'll show you the next story.
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:15.540]   Screw the times.
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:16.540]   Screw the times.
[01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:18.020]   We're going to take a break for audible.com.
[01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:23.620]   But meanwhile, this moment, just-- you made me think of this from Antique Roadshow, John.
[01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:26.060]   It's about three, five years ago.
[01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:30.220]   This is a pig on wheels.
[01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:31.860]   And I have a habit.
[01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:32.860]   Just couldn't--
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:33.860]   And what did you pay for?
[01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:34.860]   It was about $200.
[01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:35.860]   Disgusting it.
[01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:37.500]   Which was a lot of money for me.
[01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:38.500]   It's disgusting.
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:39.500]   It was a lot of money.
[01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:40.500]   But I thought to myself--
[01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:41.500]   I love it.
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:42.500]   It's a unique object.
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:45.220]   It's a kind of crap I'd have around the house if I had the money.
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:50.980]   Nothing is unique in our business, but sometimes you see something you've never seen before.
[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:51.980]   Right.
[01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:54.780]   I must say, I've never seen this before.
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:56.780]   It's generically a pull toy.
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:59.220]   Like cast iron wheels and probably made in jail.
[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:00.220]   What is going on?
[01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:04.220]   I've been made around 1895 to 1910.
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:05.220]   Most pull toys--
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:06.220]   It's disgusting.
[01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:07.220]   --are like a city.
[01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:08.220]   The iPad in 10 years.
[01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:10.300]   There's this big, little wooden platter forms.
[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:12.860]   Sometimes a man wears a very popular--
[01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:13.860]   OK.
[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:14.860]   --goes a very--
[01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:15.860]   I'll leave it as an exercise.
[01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:16.860]   The eye pig.
[01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:17.860]   Sell them?
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:18.860]   Get a good material in there.
[01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:20.860]   And you sell them so you platform toys this big.
[01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:22.860]   I mean, this is really exciting.
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:24.380]   The life size pig.
[01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:25.940]   You sell them for you.
[01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:27.580]   So cute and so animated.
[01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:28.580]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:29.580]   So push them over here.
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:30.580]   So push them over here.
[01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:31.580]   And also animated.
[01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:32.580]   And listen to them.
[01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:34.660]   And you see there's a mouth go.
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:37.220]   I mean, this guy is really a little charm.
[01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:38.220]   The mouth goes up in the eyes.
[01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:39.220]   The mouth goes up in the face.
[01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:40.220]   The face goes up in the face.
[01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:41.220]   The face goes up.
[01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:42.220]   The face goes up.
[01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:43.220]   The face goes up.
[01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:44.220]   And the face goes up.
[01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:45.220]   And the face goes up.
[01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:46.220]   And the face goes up.
[01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:47.220]   And the face goes up.
[01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:48.220]   And the face goes up.
[01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:49.220]   And the face goes up.
[01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:50.220]   And the face goes up.
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:51.220]   And the face goes up.
[01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:52.220]   And the face goes up.
[01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:53.220]   And the face goes up.
[01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:54.220]   And the face goes up.

[01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:22.220]   >> That's what you got.
[01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:23.220]   >> No, so I buzzed that.
[01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:24.220]   I thought it was funny.
[01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:25.220]   I buzzed it.
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:26.220]   I thought it was funny.
[01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:27.220]   What's really fun.
[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:29.220]   >> I thought the casual seductive knee on the trunk.
[01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:30.220]   >> Yeah.
[01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:31.220]   It's so yeah.
[01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:32.220]   It's rakish.
[01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:33.220]   It was rakish.
[01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:36.220]   So what I thought was funny is that most of the people on there,
[01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:37.220]   you know, go ha ha ha.
[01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:39.220]   Is that a camera in your pocket or whatever?
[01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:40.220]   They get the joke.
[01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:45.220]   But a couple of people go, oh yeah, is that a 70 to 200 to
[01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:50.220]   Canon L lens?
[01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:55.220]   Do you use the 2x extender with that?
[01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:59.220]   Some people just, you know, no sense of irony.
[01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:01.220]   >> I call that the literal internet.
[01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:03.220]   I'm surprised that you didn't have someone who was like,
[01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:06.220]   dude, did you know that that camera lens is totally in your
[01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:07.220]   crotch?
[01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:08.220]   >> Yeah, I'm surprised you're right.
[01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:10.220]   I haven't gone through all 121 comments yet.
[01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:11.220]   >> Yeah.
[01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:12.220]   Someone is in there.
[01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:13.220]   Someone from the literal net.
[01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:14.220]   >> Dude.
[01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:17.220]   >> There are, it's probably a small percentage of people.
[01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:20.220]   Maybe people who have some sort of brain damage that gives them
[01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:21.220]   no sense of humor.
[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:22.220]   >> I wish it were smaller.
[01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:25.220]   They seem to be all of my Twitter friends.
[01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:28.220]   >> They all, they all, the painfully obvious, they observe
[01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:32.220]   the painfully, they have no sense of irony or, or like, they
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:34.220]   don't get the joke.
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:37.220]   >> Or they're so, or maybe they're just so anxious to have
[01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:38.220]   something to respond with.
[01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:39.220]   But I feel like they don't get the joke.
[01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:42.220]   I mean, I Twittered one day about watching the hangover, right?
[01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:46.220]   I had to stop it because I peed my pants laughing.
[01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:48.220]   >> And they think you literally did.
[01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:49.220]   >> I'm saying that 32 at replies.
[01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:51.220]   Oh my God, did you seriously pee your pants?
[01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:53.220]   Like, I can't believe you put that on Twitter.
[01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:54.220]   >> Oh, geez.
[01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:57.220]   That's just bizarre.
[01:12:57.220 --> 01:13:01.220]   Speaking of bizarre, here's a couple who met and fell in love
[01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:07.220]   at the Apple Store and, and they got married at the Apple Store.
[01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:13.220]   >> In fact, did he just slap her on the butt?
[01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:18.220]   >> He did, which is, I think, so romantic in a, in a wedding.
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:21.220]   You know, of course, they've, they've replaced the audio on
[01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:24.220]   this, the guys, by the way, the minister is reading off an
[01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:25.220]   iPhone.
[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:27.220]   Apparently, Steve Jobs was quoted in the vows.
[01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:28.220]   >> He looked at me dressed like Steve Jobs.
[01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:29.220]   >> Oh, he is.
[01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:31.220]   He's wearing jeans and a black tournolec.
[01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:35.220]   You know, the bride quite sensibly has her back turned to the
[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:36.220]   camera and I'm sure will never--
[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:37.220]   >> Oh, yeah, the smart one.
[01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:39.220]   >> We will never see her face.
[01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:41.220]   >> I'm so embarrassed for those people.
[01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:45.220]   >> Josh and Ting Lee, they confirm it was their real wedding.
[01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:48.220]   They first bonded over a mutual fascination with all things
[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:50.220]   click wheel, Josh says.
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:53.220]   We got to know each other because Ting was looking to buy an
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:56.220]   iPod and I managed to strike up a conversation that way.
[01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:59.220]   >> They were both in the place dressed like that and they got
[01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:01.220]   married on the spot when they first met.
[01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:03.220]   >> Oh, they, they, they came back.
[01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:04.220]   >> Yes, John.
[01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:05.220]   >> Literal met.
[01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:06.220]   >> Literal met.
[01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:07.220]   I love it.
[01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:09.220]   Is it literal.net or just literal.net?
[01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:11.220]   >> I think just literal.net.
[01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:13.220]   It's just like a truncation of literal internet.
[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:16.220]   >> I may be, I'm going to see if I can get the domain name
[01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:17.220]   literal.ly.
[01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:18.220]   >> Ooh.
[01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:20.220]   >> It's gone now.
[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:21.220]   >> Yeah.
[01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:23.220]   Never mention it.
[01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:27.220]   I used to joke says Ting or maybe this is Josh, I don't know.
[01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:30.220]   I used to joke that the Apple store is my church because I'm not
[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:32.220]   religious and I loved everything Apple.
[01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:37.220]   >> Ting, Ting then came up with the idea of having the wedding
[01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:38.220]   there.
[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:41.220]   And apparently they, they quote Steve Jobs and the vows but those
[01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:43.220]   vows have been removed from.
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:46.220]   >> I like how the note says that it's because of the personal
[01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:49.220]   nature of the vows which were not so personal that they couldn't
[01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:50.220]   put them on the internet.
[01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:51.220]   You know what happened.
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:52.220]   Steve Jobs was like, uh-uh.
[01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:53.220]   >> Oh, yeah.
[01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:55.220]   >> They're, they're, you know, you're absolutely right.
[01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:56.220]   >> I have your quote.
[01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:57.220]   My quote's up there.
[01:14:57.220 --> 01:14:58.220]   >> The, the audio was.
[01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:00.220]   >> Just wise up and stop loving him.
[01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:02.220]   >> You're absolutely right.
[01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:06.220]   The audio was on the video before and YouTube changed it or they
[01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:10.220]   changed it to put a copyright song there instead.
[01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:11.220]   >> Right.
[01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:15.220]   >> And they said do the personal nature of the vows but wait a
[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:17.220]   minute, they're, they're, you're absolutely right.
[01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:18.220]   Molly, Steve Jobs complained.
[01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:21.220]   >> I'm not, I'm seriously, I'm not buying that for a second that
[01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:23.220]   all of a sudden it was too personal.
[01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:25.220]   I mean, you had your wedding in the Apple story weird.
[01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:26.220]   >> Right.
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:29.220]   >> I was like, there's no sense of shame there.
[01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:33.220]   >> WordPress is down, was down WordPress.com 9.2 million
[01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:34.220]   blogs down.
[01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:37.220]   Boy, that's a little scary when you're on a site like that.
[01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:39.220]   >> It was only down for like a minute.
[01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:40.220]   >> Oh.
[01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:41.220]   >> Oh, it was down for 110.
[01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:42.220]   >> 110 was down for 110.
[01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:45.220]   >> When I saw it down, it was just back up like within five
[01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:47.220]   minutes, I must have caught it at the end.
[01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:48.220]   >> Yeah.
[01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:49.220]   >> You know why I got it.
[01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:50.220]   >> I was down for 110.
[01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:52.220]   >> You know why it was a big story because tech crunch was on it.
[01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:53.220]   >> Yeah.
[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:56.220]   >> I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was
[01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:58.220]   like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like,
