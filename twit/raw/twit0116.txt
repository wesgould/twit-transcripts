[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   And for the first time ever, I actually have a title for the show before the show even begins.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Zoom rhymes with doom.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Is that right, Kevin Crewell?
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   That's the CNET.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   I'm an homage to CNET there.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   And I'm homage, yes.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Oh my gosh.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Yes, that's one of the CNET writers that had proclaimed.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Yeah, it doesn't really rhyme, come on.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Oh, Mr. Literature Professor John C. Devorax.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Let me introduce the panel and then we'll get to the bickering.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Kevin Crewell is back.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   He is, of course, at NVIDIA.

[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   and often one-time contributor to Twit.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   We just kind of lost track of you, Kevin.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Thank you.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Thanks for having me back.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   But you've been commenting on my blog, LeoVille.com/blog quite a bit, so I thought, well, here's a man with taste.

[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   I've been haunting you.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   And I just wanted to get that in.

[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   JohnC. Devoract.org/blog is here.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   I did that as an homage to you, John.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Drinks in everything.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   You've got a lot of homages going for you.

[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   That means I steal from the best.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   And also, back with us, Don Reisinger, who is a freelancer for CNET, ZDNET, and a lot of other places.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   And it's great to have you back, Don.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Yeah, thanks for having me back, Leo.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Big story of the week.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   The recording industry sucks it to her.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   She's a single mom from Minnesota who was sharing 1702 songs through Kazad.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Does anybody still use Kazad?
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Recording industry suitor for 24 specific violations.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   The judge told the jury that if she did it, you know, if she was just offering those songs,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   regardless of anybody downloading them, that it was a crime.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   And the fine could be anywhere from just a few hundred dollars per song to $13,000 per 24 songs.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   The jury had to think, decided to go right down the middle, charge her $9,250 per song,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   do the math, $222,000 fine for Jamie Thomas of Minnesota, 30-year-old single mom.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   John, you think Jamie might have made the wrong decision to fight this one?
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   She got herself in a jammy.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   She's in a jammy, all right.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Oh, is this the rhyming show?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Everybody's in the rhyming?
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Yeah, if you would.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Oh, by the way, yes.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Everything that you say has to be an iambic pentameter.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Rhyming would be nice, but not required.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   So now, you know, I kind of just saw the story pass by because I wasn't going to really spend a lot of time.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Why not?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   This is huge.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   This was expected to happen.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   The question on my mind, did anybody explain that, you know, with some of these systems that you, I mean, this, I know this was the case with, I think it was the case with Kazan to that, you know, if you get yourself into a situation where the thing auto, you know, auto loads when you're losing your computer.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   No, it's normal.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   It sits there.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   And anything you've downloaded goes into a folder, which is, unless you say not to automatically share.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And there's a lot of naive users out there that probably don't know that this is actually going on.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Jammy wasn't so naive.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   No, she claims she was.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Yeah, you know, if you read the details, it seems like Jammy kind of really did walk right into this.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   You said, you said, John, that the EFS.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   So that's not so that's, wait a minute, you're telling me so that that's means she's not naive that you walked into the.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Well, for instance, well, for.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   John, what are you becoming?
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   You become the nit picker of the crew.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Here's a way I want to interrupt right here because somebody called in and said, you were really picking on Leo last time you were on.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   You were a mean to him.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Not me.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   No, you weren't mean to me.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   You were mean to that other guy, Tom Merritt.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Oh, was I mean to Tom?
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Remember?
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Oh, you were so mean to Tom.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   He started to synopsizing his book.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   He said, all right, that's enough of that.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Oh, no, no, I was complaining about.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   I wasn't complaining about Tom's book, which by the way, I think people should go out and buy.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   I was complaining about the fact that he used a Lulu.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Well, yeah, but then he started to talk about what his book was about.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   You know what?
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   I did.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   The funny thing is neither Tom nor I thought saw anything of it.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   You know, and then we started both started getting all his emails saying, Devorac was so mean.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   And no.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   I apologize to Tom.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   No, Tom doesn't need an Apollo.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   He doesn't want to.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Well, that's because I kind of stiffed him on the, you know, I didn't go to.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   I was supposed to.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   I was scheduled last week to do one of their broadcasts over at CNET.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And I didn't never put in the calendar.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Oh.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   And that was, it's like two strikes, Mr. D.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   So now I think he hates me.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   I think we ought to find you $7,920 per non-appearance.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Well, then I'd be broke.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   I'm telling you, I'm getting flaky in my old age.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   So according to a former music executive, Chris Castle, this woman, quote, "found lawyers who tried to make her the Joan of Arc of illegal downloading."
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Are they going to write the check?
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   You know, Leo, it's just amazing to me.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   I was, when I heard this, this story, I went and I looked around and, you know, more than anything, you know, there's such a dangerous precedent and everything else.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   But if you look at the copyright law, it says that, you know, we can charge per, for instance, like 750 up to 30,000 or something like that per active infringement.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   And if she did on purpose, if they could, if they could determine intent, $150,000 per song.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   I mean, am I missing something here? But, you know, when I go to an iTunes, it costs me $0.99 for a song.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   I mean, in what world is this song, my active infringement, wherever you call it?
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Well, this is not a lawyer, but this is what we call stat, what they call statutory damages as opposed to actual damages.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   So in other words, they're not going to look for actual damages.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   How do you prove how much, how many sales they lost, how do you demonstrate that?
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   So their lawyers said, "No, we're going to go for the statute.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   The damages specified by the statute." And remember, this statute doesn't just cover music, it covers movies, covers anything copyrighted.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   So these are the damages that the statute specifies, the law specifies.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   And they do provide quite a range. Now, why the jury decided 9,250, I don't know, but probably because it was right, you know, kind of in the middle.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   It's a lot.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   They were trying to be balanced.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Fair amounts. But it's a peer-to-peer network. So therefore, even as she had stuff on her PC, she was sharing with other people because it was a long-she uploaded.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   So that's part of the damages.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   So here's the deal. She said, "Oh, I don't know anything about it. I didn't do it."
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   But it turned out that the login that was being used on Kazah was a name that she commonly used on forums and so forth.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Her lawyer said, "Well, somebody was impersonating her."
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Then she tried to, she pulled, this is I think what probably convinced the jury.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   She said she had swapped out her hard drive the year before the record companies were able to prove that she swapped it out just a few days after she got a notice that she was illegally file sharing.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Uh-oh. That's kind of a smoking gun.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   So now you know, let's go back to your basic thesis that she was not naive.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   She was not naive.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   How did she make all these mistakes that she was not naive?
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   I see what you're saying. She could have covered her tracks.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Exactly.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Yeah. Well, my point was she knew what she was, she knew she was sharing music. She knew once she got that notice she was in trouble.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   She tried to cover it up and I think that's what the jury saw and said, "Well, you know, we're going to throw the bullet."
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   She should have just broken the tears and just, you know, begged for mercy and said she didn't know it was wrong.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   She got bad legal advice.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   But the other thing is she could have settled earlier. She didn't have to go to court.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   This is how it usually happens. The RIAA comes after you and says, "But for $5,000 we'll forget it."
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   And in fact, this is one of the few cases that's ever gone to court.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Well, it's such an ugly precedent.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   The EFF apparently encouraged her to pursue it. They thought they had a good case.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Although I think as the case evolved, they probably regretted that.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Although Fred Loman at the EFF says a number of attorneys have come forward saying,
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Fred Loman said saying that they would be glad to defend her in an appeal.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   So I imagine there will be an appeal.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Oh, yeah. You could make an aim for yourself if you win this one.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Sure. Or even if you lose it.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Well, I don't know about that part.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   You'd be, well, this is a, you know, I don't know if there's much cause for appeal here.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   I'm not a lawyer again, but boy, it seems like they caught her dead to rights. The law is very clear.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   The one thing people were saying, maybe the judge went a little far in his instructions to the jury.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   It doesn't take much. Just one little slip up and you go to appeal.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Right. Right. So no word on whether she will appeal.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   There's a good article by Declan McCullough on "Scene at the Akana Class" on the jury instructions
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   and why the jury really had to do what it did.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   The instructions were very clear. The judge said, first of all, the act of downloading copyright song recordings
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   on a peer-to-peer network without license violates copyright period.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Instruction 15, the act of making copyrighted sound recordings available on a peer-to-peer network
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   violates copyright regardless of whether anybody actually downloaded any.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   So the jury didn't have to determine that somebody had actually downloaded it.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   And finally, he said, you can award him the RIAA statutory damages, which could be $750,000 to $30,000.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   And if you found willful, that's when the $150 was.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   See, that's where the jury could have stepped in and said, "Okay, we can follow all that instructions.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   And since you have this, you know, there's an option on what you can make the statutory damages,
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   they could have made it a nickel."
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Well, no, they could have made it $750. It has to be at least $750.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   I think they could have made it a nickel.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Are you an activist jury? Is that what you want here?
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Absolutely.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Well, even 750 a song is not insignificant for 24 songs.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   You know, 24 songs are so stupid.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Well, she was sharing 1700, but the RIAA picked 24.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   You know, I look at this and I say, there's no doubt in my mind that she was guilty,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   and she did what she did, and I don't think she's any debating that.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   I think that, to some extent, she should be charged something.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   But, you know, how many more people are out there and how many people are worse than doing a share,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   you know, 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, or even just the pirates over, you know, in Asia and everything else?
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   I mean, why is it that we're basically just focusing on, you know, the single mother
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   and we're just leaving all the big guys out and doing what they want to do?
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   I mean, that's always been my biggest issue with this.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Low-hanging fruit.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   I think you're right.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   I think you're right.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Is Jammy Thomas the reason CD sales are down 8%?
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Absolutely.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   I'm just saying.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   In my argument, is the Jammy Thomas is of the world?
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   All of them.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Well, it certainly sends a strong message.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   I mean, if you're, I imagine more than a few people ran to their E-Donkey and turned it off.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   You know what it really does?
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   It makes their, it's going to up their game a little bit.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Screw dad.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   I think it just pisses them off more than anything and they're going to go out and say, "Listen,
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   you know, I'm going to do twice as much as it's going to come get me."
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Well, no, I don't think it's, I think they're going to make it, they're going to do twice as much anyway,
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   or how many they're going to do, but they're going to do it very discreetly in some way.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   I mean, the original MP3 scene, which began in the 90s, you know, started by these guys,
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   when the first MP3s came out, there were college kids trading and the record industry went after
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   them because they were, you could go on the internet and just look up, you know, a song
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   and you, in fact, you used to be, well, I know, but it was to an extreme, there used to be
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   MP3 search engines and you could find these huge sites and you could just download whatever
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   you wanted and nobody, you know, it was just a small group of people anyway because nobody
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   knew what an MP3 was.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Go to C-Pod.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   It's S-E-P-O-D.com.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   You can find any song for playable song on the internet.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   You want to give the public that URL again, Leo?
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   S-E-E-Q-P-O-D.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   But, Mike, I know what you're saying.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Go ahead, your point.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   I'll just point.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   It was the fact that they cracked down and so the kids, you know, they took all these
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   sites off, they went to black sites, they went to, they took action to prevent this from
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   happening again and they, they went underground and they just keep going deeper and deeper
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   and deeper underground and harder and harder to dredge up the more that this takes place.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Well, and that's the point.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   I mean, they started these lawsuits in 2001.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:29.400]   There have been 26,000 lawsuits or at least subpoenas and if you look at the amount of
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:34.040]   songs being shared, the number of people using peer-to-peer networks since 2001, it's doubled
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.040]   every year since.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.000]   It hasn't even, it hasn't slowed it.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.360]   And, and I'm just looking at Sikh pot, I typed in Metallica, which of course is the band that
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.560]   is most famous for abhorring.
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.560]   Making a fuss.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:50.960]   And every, I could play, if there's, let's see, 50, 507 songs, different Metallica songs
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:56.960]   for play, for download on websites, they're not underground, not hidden right now.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.960]   Well, do you, can you, do you really think you can get those songs because you know,
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.960]   I think over the years, these, I think there's a lot of dead links.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.960]   Listen to this.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.960]   That's Metallica, baby.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:07.960]   Right.
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.960]   Playing it right off the internet.
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:10.960]   I mean, like that.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:12.960]   No, these are all real songs.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:13.960]   You win.
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:14.960]   My whole point is to moose.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.440]   It's not, no, it's not moose.
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.280]   Your point is right on.
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.600]   But it's even worse than you're saying.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.800]   It not only has it, has it, it hasn't even driven them underground.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.200]   It hasn't slowed it in the least.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.920]   Well they're going to have to deal with this.
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.000]   Well, and that's kind of, you know, I'm kind of thinking, and I talked about this on the
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   radio show.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.960]   I mean, this is the law.
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.120]   The court enforced the law.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.720]   The jury enforced the law.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.920]   They didn't really have that much choice.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:38.920]   It's very clear.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.080]   The law is very clear on this.
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.240]   There's a lot of laws that people just disobey.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.400]   You know, there are scoff laws out there that won't follow any laws.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.760]   And then there's a lot of dead letter laws.
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.800]   If you really start looking into it, you'll find a half a, you know, I mean, in any state,
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.480]   there's like thousands of laws that aren't being enforced.
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.480]   And they're called dead letter laws.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.720]   And they can't be enforced.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:02.360]   And so any law can be just ignored by the public and then not enforced by the officials.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.480]   I mean, these guys obviously have to enforce this law if they want to keep it in play.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.800]   This is a constituency that really wants this law to be in fact, to be used.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.160]   And there's a lot of dollars at stake.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.760]   Yeah, that's the point is there's nobody going to court saying, hey, he grazed my, his
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:21.960]   cow on my lawn, but there, there is obviously somebody going to court and filing a lot of
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.120]   lawsuits saying they're stealing our song.
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.120]   So I'm not doing it.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.920]   But the point is, is that I think we've all made is not doing them any good with all this
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:29.920]   growth in this.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.360]   My point is that the law needs to be changed.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:37.040]   If you really want to do something about this, you can't, you know, get mad at the jury or
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:42.480]   the judge or even the recording industry, you just have to change the law.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.480]   We got to go to con right.
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.240]   I mean, you got to go to Congress and say, though, this is this law, does it make sense?
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:50.200]   You know, the Trump problem with Congress is that they have so many lobbyists now in the
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.440]   United States that they dangle a few hotties in front of a couple of these horny old senators.
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.960]   And the next thing, you know, they got anything they want.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.160]   Actually, jammy Thomas is kind of cute.
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:03.160]   Yeah, I mean, maybe, maybe a hotties are, you know, hotties may not work with senators
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.160]   anymore.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.600]   Well, it could be, you know, gay hotties.
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.600]   I mean, come here.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.600]   Cute boy.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.600]   I don't know.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.600]   Just go to a bathroom.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.600]   You'll be fine.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.600]   You guys.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.600]   You guys.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.600]   You're bad.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.600]   You're bad men.
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.680]   Hey, by the way, I got a phone call from some anonymous guy named Tyler, who's who wants
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.600]   me to say that he's coming out of the closet.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.600]   So Tyler out there.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.400]   Actually, you say this drunken kid calls me up and says, Hey, can you say that Tyler
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.400]   is cool?
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.480]   How do you get your number?
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.960]   Yeah, three months ago.
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.640]   Well, you know, you can get my number if you try.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.120]   You're the most unlisted guy in the world.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.440]   I'm not going to do this for anybody else, by the way.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.440]   Just been drunk in guys.
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.800]   They call you just like two months ago.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.680]   It keeps saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll do it just as a lark.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:49.760]   The next time you're a drug in a bar, Devoract.org/blog.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:50.760]   Come on.
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.200]   Drink's on me.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.880]   New Zoom is out.
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:56.880]   Several new zoons.
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:01.640]   And actually, one thing that gratified me is for the first time ever, Microsoft is actually
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.960]   supporting podcasts.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.600]   There's a podcast menu item on the new zoom.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.720]   But it's called podcast, not netcast.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.240]   Isn't that odd that it's called podcast?
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.560]   I thought, no, I'm glad to be proven wrong.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:16.480]   I thought there was no way Microsoft would ever use the word pod in anything.
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:20.440]   I think it was a mistake, especially on the zoom.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:25.280]   I mean, isn't the iPod the deathly enemy of the zoom?
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.080]   You know, when they call the zoom casts.
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:30.480]   Yeah, why didn't, well, no, really, no, it's seriously, that would have been a perfectly
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.480]   good thing.
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.480]   I mean, I think so too.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.480]   I think somebody screwed up.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.320]   I think somebody probably got chewed out for this.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.320]   Wow.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:41.400]   Yeah, the new, the new zoons actually are making me think I might want to get one.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.400]   There are flash models.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.440]   There's an 80 gig hard drive model.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:50.320]   Finally, Wi-Fi syncing, which is something not even the iPod does support not only for
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.040]   podcast, but recorded TV.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.320]   And there's going to be a firmware upgrade they say for the existing zoons.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.760]   It'll add some of these features to the existing zoons.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:58.760]   You could.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:17:59.760]   Hurray.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:00.760]   Yeah.
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.320]   You know, Leo, when the first thing I said, you announced this.
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.960]   As soon as they announced this, I thought to myself, let's say I go to the store, I look
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.640]   at the new iPod touch and I look at the zoo next to each other.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:10.640]   Oh, you're right.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.200]   The zoom looks just, it looks like last year's model.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:17.760]   It looks like something the Soviet Union designed in 1958.
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:21.080]   You know, I mean, if I had to choose between a touch screen, something that looks futuristic,
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:24.800]   it's on the cutting edge, where I look at this, you know, finally it has a scroll pad,
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.280]   finally I can do things I was doing on my iPod two years ago.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.600]   I mean, you know, what's the impetus there to buy it?
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:34.520]   And not to mention it's what some of them are 99 cents more expensive than the iPod.
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.760]   You know, I agree with that.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.680]   It's like, you know, Apple's going in the new direction and Microsoft's picked up the
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.680]   old direction.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.680]   That's what they do.
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.680]   By the way, there's an eye river.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.720]   Have you seen the new eye river?
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:45.800]   The river's always been good.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:46.800]   I like the eye rivers.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.040]   Yeah, but they have one that's got a new clickable.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:51.840]   The whole thing is like the entire thing is like a giant kind of a switch.
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.320]   Yeah, I actually reviewed that.
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.840]   I reviewed that for information weekend.
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:57.840]   It's great.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.360]   It's really, really nice.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:02.640]   And it's a completely new user interface that, you know, doesn't copy the iPod.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.840]   That's the way to do it.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:04.840]   That's the way to do it.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.080]   So it's it looks like the touch.
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.080]   What is different about it?
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.120]   And how does the clicks work?
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:15.880]   The whole front panel, the front plate of it is clickable, like John said.
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:20.840]   So let's say I'm looking at the menu and I want to, you know, go drill down from music
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.320]   to artist to song.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.200]   Instead of having a scroll pad or whatever else, all you do is just click the side of
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:30.320]   the screen and the whole it's almost as if like the middle part of the of the top is
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.200]   hinged and the rest of it can be moved anywhere you want.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:39.080]   And you just you basically hold it as you would like a, like a blackberry, I guess, and, you
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.560]   know, with your thumbs there and use your thumbs to just maneuver your way around it
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:42.880]   by clicking the panel.
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:43.880]   The actual.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:44.880]   So it's not a touch.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:48.400]   It's like it's like is though there's a gimbal in the middle of this whole thing and
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.600]   you when you it's almost like a controller because you can actually hold it with two
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.160]   hands and click all over the place.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.160]   Right.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.160]   Yeah, it's wild.
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.160]   It's not a touch screen though.
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.160]   It's just there's a physical click.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.160]   No, weird.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.160]   Weird.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.160]   Well, we've always like rivers.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.640]   I remember makes the sound calling on.
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.160]   I was is excellent.
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.360]   How are these a flash based?
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.360]   I don't.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:11.840]   Yeah, I think they were.
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:12.840]   Okay.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.840]   Cool.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:14.840]   Well, there you are.
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:15.840]   Wait a minute now.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:16.840]   Let's see.
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:17.840]   HD.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:18.840]   Yeah.
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:19.840]   I mean, look at look at there you go there.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:20.840]   It's possible to innovate.
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.840]   You don't think Wi-Fi sinking is an innovation?
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:27.600]   No, I think it is, but I don't think it's enough of an innovation to justify me spending
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.160]   that kind of money on a zoom.
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:34.760]   I think it's there's more to this device than just Wi-Fi sinking, you know, and all and
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:35.760]   all.
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.720]   And I compare it, like I said to the iPod, it just doesn't really give me anything worth
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.720]   buying.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.680]   Zoom rhymes with dune.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.320]   You feel better about that, John?
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.760]   It also rhymes with moon.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:52.320]   And spoon and too soon.
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:56.360]   And tune, which I think is the reason they use the name zoom, zoom and tune do rhyme.
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.200]   But what's the Z stand from not sure?
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.720]   It's whatever the social is.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:03.480]   Did you see also that they ousted J. Allard?
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.480]   They threw him out.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.680]   He's the guy invented the zoom.
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:07.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.680]   He's the reason.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:12.520]   He's in a vina, but J. Allard was the Xbox guy they brought in.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:16.800]   The only guy at Microsoft apparently went any consumer sense at all to head the zoom
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.080]   division, figuring he, if anybody could save the zoom as J. Allard.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.720]   So I guess he didn't save the zoom, huh?
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:22.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:27.640]   I think he's still going to stay on as like a creative director or whatever he's going
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.640]   to be called.
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.720]   But this new, this new guy is going to take, take his place.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:32.720]   His name is Rick Thompson.
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.120]   This is the new, the new leader of the zoom there.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.720]   That's going to be, that's going to be a job.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.400]   You just can't wait to get that call from Bill, right?
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.400]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:49.440]   Hey, um, yeah, we were wondering if you wanted to, uh, run the zoom division.
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.440]   What?
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.320]   I'm sorry, I'm losing you.
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.320]   I'm losing you.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:58.480]   So what we're talking about this kind of thing, we should discuss the whole bungee software
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.480]   issue.
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:05.280]   Why did they spin off the most successful thing that they've done in the last 20 years?
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:11.600]   Halo three comes out in a week, sells 300 million dollars.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:16.320]   I mean, it is the biggest entertainment product launch in history beats any movie by, you
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.240]   know, a factor of 50%.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.800]   And then they spin off a spongy.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.840]   They probably either had to spin them off or they'd lose the talent.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.200]   Uh, nobody wanted to work for the, uh, evil.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:31.200]   Because I think probably had contracts that would be just coming up about now.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.000]   And they released, they released Halo three.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.840]   So maybe the, the, their, uh, terms of, of, I'm, I'm conjecturing here.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.200]   Maybe their terms of employment might have expired where they would have been free agents
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.200]   anyway.
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:46.560]   So by allowing the whole group to spin off, you keep that core team together and you can
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:47.560]   still work with them.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:51.760]   They still have an investment in that organization and they can still call on them for other,
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.000]   you know, development work.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:54.920]   I think that's more or less what happened.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.840]   And one of the things, of course, is I've, I've been convinced that they had something
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:02.920]   up their sleeve that they wanted to bring out thinking Microsoft would think it was cool.
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:07.880]   Like for example, some software for the Wii, which Microsoft doesn't really directly compete
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.960]   with, but they could make money from.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.800]   Um, and I think they said, no, no, no, no, we can't do that.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.360]   Cause there's no such thing as the Wii.
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.080]   Uh, there's only one thing in the world and that's Xbox.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.000]   We either own dog food, blah, blah, blah.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.120]   And so these guys started grousing about it.
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:26.080]   I mean, they already moved to Kirkland cause they couldn't stand being around the Redmond
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:30.800]   compound and they, you know, they got their own key card system cause they couldn't take
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.160]   these Microsofties coming in and out of there and pointing at this and pointing at that
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.360]   and saying this is right and that's wrong.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.240]   And so, you know, at this point, they said, look at that, you, and you're probably dead
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.240]   right.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.760]   There's probably a way they could have lost half the talent.
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:42.760]   And yeah, okay.
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:43.760]   What do you got left?
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:47.040]   That's not forget that Bungie's first game was for the Mac.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.040]   Right.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.120]   They may have a Mac thing up their sleeve.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.120]   Who knows?
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.120]   That would be interesting.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.960]   You know, I almost thought, I almost think it's a blunder on Microsoft's part in that,
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:59.120]   you know, they still own, I think they still own most of the rights to Halo and I think
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:02.760]   whatever, some kind of future properties that that Bungie is developing.
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:08.120]   But you know, is it just another instance where Microsoft gave up on something too soon
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.280]   or just, you know, shouldn't have done what it's supposed to be do?
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.560]   And now, now it might pay the price.
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:16.000]   I think, like you said about the Mac, I think they said that they were, they're looking
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.160]   towards developing for the Mac because they want to go back to those.
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.160]   They're Mac.
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.840]   I mean, that really was their thing for a long time.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:27.480]   In fact, really, if you look at Halo closely, it looks pretty much like a successor to Marathon,
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.280]   which was their great Mac game.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.280]   Gaining on Mac?
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.280]   Is there such a thing?
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.280]   Yeah, baby.
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.280]   Marathon.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.280]   Oh.
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:40.600]   Actually, I've been playing Halo 3 and it's really, it's not, you know, it's not a great
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.600]   single player game.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:45.720]   It's, you know, it's just another shooter, but it is probably the best, you know, online
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.320]   gaming out there.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.320]   You're going to have to world a Warcraft.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.360]   I don't have a Warcraft.
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.360]   Yeah.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.360]   Wow.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.360]   The wow starts now.
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.600]   Actually, you know, we had in our message boards a little discussion about whether Microsoft
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.680]   had done any advertising when Vista came out.
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.920]   And I thought, man, Microsoft, did they do any ad?
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:11.040]   They spent what, like $75 million on advertising and nobody remembers one ad.
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.960]   Do you remember any Vista ads?
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:14.960]   I don't.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:15.960]   Not at all.
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:16.960]   No.
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.760]   They skinned the New York City subways.
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.680]   I remember that.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.520]   I remember flying in that work.
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:29.040]   I remember flying in the JFK and there was like a long, you know, those long escalator,
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.680]   you know, conveyor belt corridors going from terminal to terminal.
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:37.400]   And the whole thing was lined with plasma displays saying the wow starts now.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.400]   Wow.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.800]   As you're going down this 800 foot corridor, that must be what they spent all the money
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:43.800]   on.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:44.800]   Public guard.
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:49.200]   They should have spent more time fixing their operating system.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.640]   No kidding.
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:56.400]   This is Don Rizinger is on the guy who said that Microsoft should abandon Vista.
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.400]   You know, maybe, maybe.
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:00.920]   I'm not the only, I said that too.
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.640]   So I mean, it's not like, well, you've been saying that.
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.440]   You said that you said that last year though, John, that was the difference.
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:09.680]   Well, I said it again recently.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:14.640]   I don't think maybe they could spin Vista off like they did bungee.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:22.680]   I'm using, I use Vista and it's, I mean, it's, it's, it's pretty nice.
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.680]   It's just early.
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.400]   I guess we're all being sort of the two testers.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.400]   It wasn't done.
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:31.000]   God, you think after five frickin years.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.800]   It was that word again frickin.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:37.280]   It rhymes with stinking.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.880]   You think it'd be done.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.120]   Which lawsuits against Apple for breaking iPhones had to happen.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.120]   It's about time.
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:51.760]   Timothy Smith sued Apple in a class action case in Santa Clara County Superior Court.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:52.880]   That was the attorney of record.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.640]   The suit filed by Damien Fernandez.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.640]   I'm sorry, vice versa.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.960]   The suit is filed by the attorney, Damien Fernandez.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.400]   Damien actually was soliciting people for the case.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:05.440]   He found somebody doesn't ask for a specific dollar amount, seeks an injunction against
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:10.480]   Apple, which prevents it from selling the iPhone with any software lock.
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:15.720]   So as said, Apple be enjoined from denying warranty service to users of unlocked iPhones.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.160]   So there's a new, there's a new scam going on.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:22.920]   I'm not gonna say who's doing it, but I know a few people who brick their phone, which by
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:27.320]   the way is a dumb, I mean, you got plenty of warnings not to do this upgrade.
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:30.120]   I don't know what they were thinking, but they did it.
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:34.360]   So now, so now this is the solution because you can't bring it in with it's, but it's
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.640]   brick because Apple can tell you, yeah, you hacked it.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:42.720]   So what you have to do is you, you, you unbrick it sort of by reverting it to 102.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.160]   And then you start the upgrade again, the unlock upgrade again, and then you pull the
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.600]   plug halfway through.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.520]   And this so fatally destroys the phone.
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.520]   Cool.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.280]   That even Apple can't tell you hacked it.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.320]   It just looks like the thing just died.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:28:00.960]   So I had a, I had a different, I had a different recommendation, which probably less work, which
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:05.720]   is that you find any output on the thing, headphones, whatever, and then you hook it to
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.720]   your 12 volt car battery.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.600]   And later it up.
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:16.040]   And after that guys, that guy's battery blew up in his pants the other day, I think this
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.040]   would probably work.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.280]   So what some guys, what happened?
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.680]   It was an iPod.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.240]   It was an iPod blew up in his pants.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.920]   Yeah, that's got to hurt.
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:24.920]   I don't know.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.320]   That's some hot music he was playing.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:31.560]   I believe he was at an airport too.
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:34.320]   Just as long as you don't say bomb, it's okay.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.640]   And they'll be just confiscating those next time.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:42.640]   And whatever you do, do not carry any more than three ounces of fluid on your person.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.480]   3.2 ounces actually.
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.480]   Is that it?
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.480]   Is that it?
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.480]   Boeing Boeing was it for a while.
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:50.480]   Well, the one guys that were, you know, you go to the airport and they've got the bullhorns
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:55.160]   out like we're in the Soviet Union, you know, berating your, you can only have this.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.400]   And if it's, you know, I had one guy, he was in some airport, he's yelling through the
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.400]   bullhorn.
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:05.080]   So if you have two ounces, but the package says four ounces, I will assume it is four
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.080]   ounces.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.080]   Oh, geez.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.080]   Oh, geez.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.440]   I figured it all out, by the way.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.760]   You got to follow the money.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:22.640]   Dick Cheney served on the board of GLAD packaging who makes zip lock bags.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:26.880]   And how many zip lock bags have they sold since this policy went into effect?
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:27.880]   I ask you.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:28.880]   That's good.
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:29.880]   It's conspiracy theory.
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:30.880]   I like it.
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.600]   I just made it up, but it sounds good, doesn't it?
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:33.600]   So bull.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.600]   But it sounds good.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.600]   I like it.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.640]   You're looking everybody's got to carry a zip lock fricking bag.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.600]   I don't carry that crap on the plane anyway.
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.680]   And you know, the other thing is I've been carrying, well, I don't want to say this,
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.680]   but I'm going to say it anyway.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.080]   I've been carrying a little too dinky tuba toothpaste in the luggage.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:50.480]   And you know, these guys look at going to crap another guy with dinky tuba toothpaste.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.920]   Well, they can tell that that's a tuba toothpaste.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:54.920]   It can't tell.
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.480]   See the outline of everything.
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:00.520]   So you just get toothpaste that's shaped like a gun and you'll be all right.
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:03.880]   Hey, here's a great gag, by the way, talking about that.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.120]   I always thought this would be something to do that.
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:09.520]   Of course, you know, you're going to get somebody in trouble and hopefully they don't
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:10.520]   track it back to you.
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:13.240]   And I'm not recommending, by the way, anybody actually do this.
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.240]   Okay.
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.960]   Disclaimer, disclaimer, disclaimer, disclaimer.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:20.200]   It's get your find some guy likes to take books under the plane and then get a get some
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:27.040]   lead foil and cut out a thin outline of a gun with lead foil and then slip it into
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.000]   the book just between the pages.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.920]   It's a bookmark.
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:37.480]   As a bookmark and see what happens when the X-ray machine sees that.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.680]   Is it illegal to carry gun shaped pieces of lead foil?
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:41.680]   That's the question.
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.680]   It seems unlikely.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.920]   I can't believe that there's a law against that.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.000]   Well, in Boston, there probably is.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.640]   You have Play-Doh in your hands and you go to the airport.
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.360]   Apparently that's a really threatening.
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:58.440]   The girl from MIT who went to the airport to pick up her boyfriend and she had a sweatshirt
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:03.080]   on with an improvised electronic device, which was basically a flashing LED sign under her
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.080]   sweatshirt.
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.080]   Oh, yeah, that's the thing.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.200]   And she had Play-Doh under hands for some reason.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.520]   And then she refused to answer when she was questioned about her shirt.
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:14.400]   And next thing you notice, she had a, they were resting here and they had a, you know,
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.080]   they were a gun point.
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.080]   Unbelievable.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.400]   Yeah, that was a big news item when it happened.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:23.280]   I was actually in some airport when that broke and everyone was looking and watching.
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.280]   I had to figure out what was going on.
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:28.480]   I would caution people not to mess with the TSA though because they actually have more
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.920]   teeth than one might think.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.240]   And I'm not talking about tasers on their belt.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:38.360]   But you know, Boeing Boeing suggested that people were carrying what they would do is
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:42.120]   they would play little tricks on the TSA that carry bottles of water and they'd slip
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.080]   around and so forth.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:48.640]   And a guy did it and got fined like $10,000.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.200]   The TSA could actually find you and big fights.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.200]   So don't mess with them.
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.600]   Yeah, well, that's why I don't recommend any of these gags.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.600]   No.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:58.240]   Where these are pure speculation.
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.240]   Yeah.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.240]   Very active imagination.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:05.240]   I know there's a bunch of goofballs out there, do stuff like that.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.720]   John's an imagineer.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.600]   It's a troublemaker.
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.120]   Troublemaker.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:14.240]   According to Engadget, it's the French.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.240]   It's the fault of the French.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.440]   It is a French.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.440]   It's a fault.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:24.640]   Apparently, the launch of the iPhone in France is being held up by two different regulations
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.920]   that prevent it from being locked down.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:27.920]   Oops.
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:32.960]   A law passed in '98 requires that carriers unlock any phone upon customer request.
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:33.960]   Good.
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.400]   That's what we have should have that law in this country.
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.080]   This is just obvious.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.120]   For a fee during the first six months, that's fair of the contract.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:45.680]   So they get their money back and for free after that.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:51.200]   And by the way, all three major French carriers have challenged this law and failed.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:56.000]   The second law apparently requires carriers to sell both locked and unlocked phones.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.440]   They can't just sell locked phones.
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:01.960]   You know, why would all three carriers, I don't understand why they'd be all upset about
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:02.960]   this.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:03.960]   I mean, it'd end.
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:04.960]   It'd end.
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:06.360]   But wouldn't it all wash out in the end?
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:10.480]   I mean, you know, I lose, you know, say 5% of my customers every month to, you know,
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.120]   the company A and I tell you why.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.120]   I'll tell you why.
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:16.160]   I think that they suck and they think they're going to lose all their customers.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.720]   The other guy who thinks he sucks.
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:18.720]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:19.720]   They all think you're right.
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:20.720]   This is exactly it.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.840]   Leon, I think this is actually this is a good idea for a column for me.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:29.480]   They must preconceive themselves as totally sucking to such an extreme that they have
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.720]   to fight these things to today.
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:35.120]   If you allow unlocking, we'll lose all our customers.
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:40.120]   But yeah, and it's a cost of a lot to both get new customers and also lose customers.
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:44.760]   So that kind of cost rather than just holding onto a customer for two years or a period
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.400]   of time is much cheaper for them.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.400]   Hey, I got a crazy idea.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:52.000]   Why not give them good service, you know, reasonable costs, you know, let me get my
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   pen down.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.880]   Why not give them something to stick around for?
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.240]   No, no, we got to lock them in because if they found out what we really liked, they'd
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.240]   leave.
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:06.480]   I tell you know, I unlocked my iPhone and I of course did not update it.
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.760]   So it's still working unlocked.
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:13.080]   But you know, I have to say, I feel like it's going to be stuck.
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.120]   It's a dinosaur because I can no longer update it.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:18.240]   So it's just going to be the way it is for the rest of the rest of the.
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:19.600]   I think there are two iPhones.
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.720]   I do have a regular one that is not a dinosaur.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.560]   It's updated and one that's not.
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:24.720]   Okay, no one actually left.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:28.040]   I left the one that I'd unlocked in Canada.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:30.480]   I just put it on the street hoping some Canadian would find it.
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:33.760]   No, I left it with the TV show and a weird thing happened.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:37.160]   I've been able to use it with T-Mobile, but they were not able to get the Rogers Sims
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:38.160]   to work in it.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:43.040]   Yeah, I wonder if Rogers has done something.
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:46.000]   You wouldn't really want a Rogers Sims to work in it because it would cost you.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.280]   They estimate it costs several hundred dollars a month because of the exorbitant data plans
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.280]   in Canada.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.920]   You know, Leo, I don't know too much about Canada.
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.840]   I've never been there, but it seems like everything I hear out of there is from Rogers.
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.320]   They just run everything up there.
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.680]   Yeah, I think I've taken over the country, believe it or not.
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.360]   Ted Rogers owns everything.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:08.920]   Down to video stories, you're driving down the street and there's Rogers VHS video stores.
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.640]   The guy owns everything.
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:17.120]   He owns the dome where the Blue Jays play and he owns the Blue Jays and he owns the television
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.080]   network that broadcasts the games.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.080]   Wow.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.520]   I mean, talk about it.
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:27.160]   But see, the problem is Canada for all its size and I think it's the biggest landmass
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.160]   of any nation.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.240]   It's one of them anyway.
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.960]   Has only 30 million people.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.840]   So it's spread like peanut butter, very thin.
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.760]   It's a lot more than Iceland has.
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.440]   Okay, true.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:45.480]   And look how much Reykjavik has done for all of us.
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:51.320]   Did you know that the White House was actually applauding this RIAA victory?
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.840]   Did they really?
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:58.880]   Chris Israel, who's the US coordinator for intellectual property enforcement.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:02.920]   Formerly a senior commerce department official.
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:05.880]   He was still appointed by Bush in 2005.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:09.160]   Before that he worked for Time Warner Records.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.400]   Oh, shot.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.400]   Shot.
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.400]   Another friend.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:17.160]   He says, "This proves copyright law is effective and working as planned."
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.920]   Then why is it going up?
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.440]   Like we just talked there earlier.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.320]   Let's just sue everybody and see what happens.
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:24.320]   I'd be great.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.320]   You know, you make a lot more money.
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:30.280]   Instead of selling records, just sue people and then lock their iPhones.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:32.280]   That's a war.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.280]   It's a war.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.200]   You know it is a war, isn't it?
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:38.160]   It's consumers against big companies.
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:42.600]   The difference is consumers now can use the internet and other technologies to kind of
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:45.080]   band together in a way they couldn't before.
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:48.040]   They could take us out onesie-toozy in the past.
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.520]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:53.440]   Honestly, if they're going to, if that is a war, you know, not honestly, I really think
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.440]   consumers will win easily.
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:57.720]   I mean, I'll take the war any day, any day.
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:01.080]   Only if they're organized.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:05.920]   A smaller organized group can still defeat a larger unorganized group.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:08.320]   Okay, I saw a bunch of communists.
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:11.720]   Hey, I read, I read confessions of an economic campaign.
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.200]   The sumas of the world unite.
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.960]   I know what's really going on.
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.520]   John, you read the book finally.
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:17.520]   I'm not finished with them.
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.520]   I'm reading it.
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.240]   It is fascinating.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:25.240]   The premise that John's been touting this book on Audible and in paper for a while.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:28.200]   The premise of it is this guy was recruited after-
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.240]   Given the name Leo.
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:34.160]   The confessions of an economic hitman or as he calls it an EHM.
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:40.360]   And this guy was recruited after dropping out of college to go around and pretend to
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.840]   be an economist, essentially.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:47.280]   Go to nations and tell the nation, "You're going to have a huge boom.
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:51.520]   You're going to, everybody's going to cost the standards of living.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.920]   You're going to go through the roof.
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.560]   It's going to be an amazing thing.
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:38:00.040]   All you have to do is borrow a couple of hundred billion dollars from the US monetary
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.680]   fund.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.120]   Send that money to the international money.
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:06.040]   I'm sorry, it is international in name anyway.
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:10.640]   From the world back in the IMF, send that money back to the US to companies like Halliburton
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:15.240]   and Bechtel to build these dams and nuclear power plants.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:19.400]   Then you'll owe the US for the rest of, you know, forever.
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.840]   And a lot of people will get rich in the US.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:22.120]   A few people will get rich in your country.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.080]   It's going to work out great.
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:25.640]   And apparently they've been doing this for a while.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:26.640]   Do you believe this guy, John?
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.120]   Do you think he really was an EHM?
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:30.840]   You know, I like this story a lot.
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:37.160]   And if you read the whole thing or listen to the thing on tape, you, and then you reappraise
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.680]   the news as it comes out.
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:39.680]   It does make sense.
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.080]   It's like everything he says is right on the money.
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:43.080]   It does make sense.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:45.480]   It explains Iraq.
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.680]   It explains a lot of what's going on.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:49.920]   In fact, one of the things he says is the reason that we had to go to war with Iraq is
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:53.600]   because they wouldn't play along with the EHM strategy.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.320]   They weren't like Ecuador.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.320]   Ecuador played along.
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:00.280]   Well, yeah, Ecuador is going to be apparently according to this guy, the next target for
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:03.240]   like being destroyed.
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.600]   It's pretty funny, actually.
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:07.120]   It's funny if it's, if you're over here.
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.200]   Yeah, it's funny if you're living here, exactly.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:14.160]   Hey, that brings up Audible.com, by the way, once again, Audible sponsoring this wonderful
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:17.000]   show and we thank them very much for their support.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.240]   IBLE.com/twit.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:23.800]   You can get the confessions of an economic hitman there.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:24.800]   That's how I'm listening to it.
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:29.440]   But I also want to remind you that they now have Stephen Colbert's book.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:32.880]   In fact, they got it before it was in the bookstores.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.120]   I am America and so can you.
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:39.080]   The new book by it's actually hysterical.
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:41.880]   Colbert at his best, he reads it, of course.
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.760]   It wouldn't be the same if he didn't.
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.680]   And this could be one of them, any number of books.
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:53.320]   They have 45,000 titles, nonfiction, fiction, even radio shows and the lectures, comedy,
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.240]   club appearances, all sorts of stuff.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.600]   Great listening.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:01.480]   And you can get a credit for a free book by joining up now at audible.com/twit.
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.600]   T-W-I-T-R recommendation of the week.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.760]   Well, we got two confessions of an economic hitman.
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.840]   We've recommended that before, but still a good read.
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:12.200]   And I am America and so can you.
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.600]   Which makes no sense by Stephen Colbert.
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:15.600]   Does that rhyme, John?
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.320]   Can you give us the judge's opinion on that?
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.280]   I am not the rhymer rapper here.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.280]   You guys are.
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:25.120]   Thanks to audible.com for their support.
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.120]   We really appreciate it.
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:27.120]   Audible.com/twit.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:32.560]   You can still get your free chapter, by the way, of the Chopin manuscript at audible.com/freechaptor.
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.680]   Okay, that's that.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:35.680]   Go ahead.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.440]   You were going to say something, was it Kevin or Don?
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:39.000]   You guys sound so much alike now.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.660]   I'm going to have to remember that because I'm going to have to get a chick to separate
[00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:45.280]   you for the next time you're both on at the same time.
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.400]   I mean, we can't both be on the same time.
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:51.840]   No, you can, but we need somebody in between that sounds different.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.560]   I tried to get Veronica.
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:56.000]   I said, Veronica, I need a woman and she didn't respond.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.880]   I don't know why.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:58.880]   What is she doing anyway?
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.640]   She was going to work for Calla Canis or something.
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.640]   She's doing a show at Mahalo.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:03.640]   Yeah.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:04.640]   Mahalo has shows?
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.640]   I don't know.
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.000]   I asked her that I said, that's exactly what I said.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   Mahalo has shows.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   She said, well, I've only won.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   Me.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.560]   Where do you find it?
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:18.560]   I was on Mahalo for the first time yesterday and I was off in about five seconds, but it
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.800]   was, I don't know, I couldn't really find anything.
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:22.800]   It's a search engine.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.640]   What do you mean you can't find anything?
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.360]   It's going to flower on it.
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.360]   What do you mean?
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.360]   Perfect.
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:29.360]   There you go.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:30.360]   Flowers all I need.
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.360]   Yeah.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.600]   You know, I don't know where you find her show.
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:37.240]   In fact, I don't even know if she's made any shows yet, but Jason can afford to have a
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:38.240]   couple of people hanging out.
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:39.240]   I think you're just looking for a date.
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:40.240]   I think so too.
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:43.240]   You know, I hope I can get.
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:45.200]   Jason's a care.
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.200]   I love Jason.
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:47.200]   He's quite the character.
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.560]   He's the Brooklyn guy.
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:51.520]   But I don't know what's going to happen with Mahalo.
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:54.360]   You know, it's funny I was on the marketplace the other day.
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:57.240]   I think I mentioned this and they were asking about another search engine that's trying
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:00.240]   to compete with Google and I said, yeah, right, good luck.
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:01.520]   Yeah, that's too funny.
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:05.080]   They said, but wait a minute, they got $12.5 million of venture capital.
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.080]   Oh.
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:09.520]   And I said, how much money do you think Microsoft sport into their search?
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:10.920]   Have they beat Google yet?
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:11.920]   However.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:15.000]   I know what you're talking about.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.360]   I always like to throw back.
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:22.120]   You know, Google has $2.2 billion in R&D as its budget.
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:24.560]   And you're going to tell me 12 million is going to do what?
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.960]   Yeah, and they have more PhDs in Switzerland has people.
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:28.960]   So no, I agree.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.440]   Anyway, essentially that's what I said.
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:34.040]   And I got an email, a very nice email from the CEO of the company said, well, let me
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:36.280]   let me demonstrate why we're going to succeed.
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:38.280]   And it's like, OK, yeah.
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:41.720]   I mean, put that on my busy schedule.
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:43.240]   Have any of you ever used--
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.920]   Give me the baby get bought.
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:45.760]   I don't know.
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.760]   Who would buy it?
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:47.960]   I've never used Clusty.
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:48.480]   I'm sorry.
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.240]   Never used Clusty.com.
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:51.280]   Yeah, I like Clusty.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:53.440]   But again, I use Clusty.
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.520]   I use it like when I'm really hard up.
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:43:00.520]   The idea of Clusty is it aggregates, right?
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:04.440]   Yeah, I use it for a little while and it wasn't all that bad, really.
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.840]   You know, well, I think--
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:07.040]   And that was at a Google, no way.
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.040]   But you know--
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:09.040]   That's the problem.
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:10.480]   Google's a verb for crying out loud.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.480]   Yeah, it does.
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:15.880]   Well, and so does A9 and I used A9 for a while because I thought, well, it's all the value
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:18.880]   of Google+, but you end up going back to Google, don't you?
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.880]   Isn't A9 really a Microsoft product?
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:21.880]   No, it's Amazon.
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:22.880]   It's Amazon.
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:23.880]   All right, right.
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:27.720]   I'm sure there's something in Australia that's got something weird, moniker like that.
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:28.960]   Oh, I know what you're talking about.
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:29.960]   Yeah, I saw that.
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.320]   It's a different kind of search.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:34.120]   Yeah, I can't remember the name of that.
[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:35.600]   Everybody's nibbling around the edges.
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:36.600]   But forget it.
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:37.600]   What are you going to do?
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:38.600]   I can't beat Google now.
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:43.520]   Well, what you have to do is you have to hope that something-- some new concept breaks.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.520]   You know what?
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:49.880]   The one thing that actually had a chance-- and it lasted about five minutes-- ask.com made
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:50.880]   a big deal.
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.480]   Oh, we don't save any search information.
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.720]   You can say, you know, completely anonymous search.
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:58.720]   And I think for-- I've used it for like a few minutes and then I went back to Google.
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:59.720]   Yeah.
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:01.720]   People are fundamentally going to-- are lazy.
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:05.600]   And you're so used to going to a certain place each and every time.
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.120]   And Google, it's really hard to break that habit.
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.160]   Or Yahoo still like number two.
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:13.320]   Yeah, I tried-- you know, somebody said, oh, Yahoo's got-- because apparently Yahoo's updated
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:14.320]   how they do it.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:17.120]   And I don't know, they're doing something better and different and neat and new.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:18.600]   So I tried it for a few minutes.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:22.080]   And you know, you get one bad search result and it's back to Google.
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:26.520]   You know, I think that Yahoo dropped the ball some years ago, especially when Terry Semmel
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:27.520]   came on board.
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:28.520]   Well, he's gone now.
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:30.320]   And you know, I think they're turning it around, don't you?
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:31.320]   Well, they're trying.
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:32.320]   They got a lot of smart guys there.
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:33.320]   I know that for a fact.
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:37.240]   The point is that when they had their original-- before they were-- the search engine became
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:40.360]   a search engine before Alta Vista.
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:42.360]   Yahoo is extremely popular.
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:45.480]   But it used a methodology that was somewhat, you know, community oriented.
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:49.160]   So people would like-- you know, the public itself would actually contribute to what was
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:53.240]   popular, what was the definitive side about bear hunting or whatever.
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:55.640]   That's the idea behind Mahalo.
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:59.480]   And well, you know, the irony is that, you know, they invented it.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:02.560]   They were called-- of course, there were directories more than they were search engines.
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:06.640]   But meanwhile, we've gone to this Web 2.0 community thing and all the rest of it.
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:10.560]   And they dropped the ball and it's like it was handed to them on a silver platter and
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:11.560]   they dropped the ball.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:15.160]   I mean, coming from behind, like, you know, I mean, they had critical mass.
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:17.600]   Mahalo's got no mass.
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:19.280]   I don't think there are enough people in the world to do.
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:27.160]   Remember in the early days of the telephone, they had humans, operators, female, who actually
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:28.520]   they were all women.
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:29.760]   One ringy dingy.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:30.760]   They would connect.
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.760]   You'd say, hello, central.
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:38.600]   Give me John de Vorak and she would put a wire in the hole that said John de Vorak and
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:41.480]   a wire in the hole that said you and connect you.
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.120]   And that was the theory.
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:45.000]   That was how it was going to work.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.560]   It unfortunately did not scale very well.
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:51.800]   In fact, somebody, you know, they kept hiring more and more and more and more operators.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:55.480]   Somebody made a calculation that by 1950 at the rate of growth they were going, every
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:46:00.320]   woman in the entire world would be employed by the phone company.
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:01.320]   And that's the same problem you have with it.
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:03.800]   Which actually makes no logical sense if you think about it.
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:06.360]   Because who's making all the calls if they're working at the phone company?
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:07.360]   Yeah, right.
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:08.360]   Not me.
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:09.360]   They'll be calling each other.
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:10.360]   Right.
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.320]   So thank goodness electronic switching came along because it would scale.
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:14.320]   I'm not so sure.
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.320]   You don't think so.
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:16.320]   I think I've been better the old way.
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:17.320]   It's a great story.
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:18.320]   You want to call central?
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:20.920]   You know, that's going to be able to call somebody and say, hey, get me Leo on the phone.
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:23.240]   I know I like that, don't you?
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:24.480]   That feels powerful.
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:29.320]   No, it feels, it feels, it feels, uh, uh, efficient.
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:30.800]   That's what we're looking for.
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.960]   We're not looking for being the bean counters out there.
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:35.800]   We have to punch in a million numbers just to get somebody on the phone when you could
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:38.520]   have just told somebody to get the person and they get paid.
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:40.040]   It's personal efficiency.
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:42.320]   And how much does that phone call cost?
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:44.480]   Probably that's what it does today.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:45.480]   You think?
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:49.360]   Because now the millions and millions of dollars going into the CEO's pockets, you know, could
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:50.800]   have been distributed to all these people.
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:55.400]   I mean, look at these people are making $100 million a year in salaries, sometimes 200
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:56.400]   million.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.400]   What do they do with this money?
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:01.080]   I mean, that the $100 million is like a hundred people that could be making a million dollars
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:04.040]   or, you know, 200, you know, you can just extrapolate.
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:06.120]   There's plenty of room for expansion.
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:07.360]   I'm not buying it.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:10.840]   They in the, in the old days when there was an operator that this was the origin of the
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:14.580]   time lady, you would just ask the operator what time it was.
[00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:19.200]   And she would look at a clock on the wall and she would tell you the time.
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.200]   That's the old and day.
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:21.200]   That's real old.
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:24.000]   But that, but people expected that.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.280]   And so when they went to electronic switching, they had it, they literally in the fifties had
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:31.480]   to invent a way to do this because people expected to be able to call central and get
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:32.480]   the time.
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.360]   And by the way, you know, they did have that popcorn number or whatever it was, anything
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:36.960]   pure people follow, whatever.
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:39.440]   And of course they killed that like about two weeks ago.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:40.440]   Yeah.
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.440]   Yep.
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:44.400]   So you can't get the time anymore because it's too much work for them to have an automated
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:45.680]   system that gives you the time.
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:46.680]   Forget it.
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:47.680]   Hey, wait a minute.
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:48.680]   Money making idea.
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:49.680]   Google time.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:52.880]   Oh, that part, you know, you can do that.
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:53.880]   You can do that.
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:55.360]   You actually called that number though at this point.
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:56.360]   Type in time.
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:57.360]   I would call it.
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:58.360]   Yes.
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:01.640]   So we just called it a friend who I just called tried to call it the other day and found out
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:02.640]   it no longer works.
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:04.360]   No, I called it all the time when the power goes out.
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:05.360]   What's the first thing you do?
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:06.360]   You call it popcorn.
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:07.600]   Yeah, you can't do it anymore.
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:10.680]   Well, Chris, I mean, most people use their, I mean, I use my computer for the time.
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:14.840]   I have the atomic clock, which is what everyone should have as a utility, which is one of
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:15.840]   the programs.
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:17.800]   We have a Mac and it does it automatically.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.280]   It calls the atomic clock.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:20.280]   Yeah.
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:21.280]   Actually, so does Windows.
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:22.840]   But anyway, go ahead.
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:23.840]   Keep talking.
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:26.800]   Well, whatever the case is, I might computer calls you a clock on the clock.
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:27.800]   That's good.
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:28.800]   Every time I boot.
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.800]   And does the atomic clock look at the clock on the wall?
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:33.960]   It has the time and tells you what time it is.
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:34.960]   Is that amazing?
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:35.960]   It's incredible.
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:36.960]   How does it know?
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:39.960]   Oh, there it is right there.
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:42.520]   Calling you with the time.
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.800]   Hello.
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:50.560]   I just, I just bought a blackberry to replace my, my hacked iPhone because it can put third
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:52.440]   party software on it.
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:53.440]   What a concept.
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:49:01.360]   This, the new, the get this, the new T-Mobile blackberry, the 80, 80, 320 has wifi on it.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:06.160]   And you can use the wifi to make VoIP calls built in.
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.160]   Really?
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:08.160]   It comes with the phone.
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:09.160]   It's not even.
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:10.160]   Have you done it?
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:11.160]   Yeah.
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:12.160]   Does it work?
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.160]   Yeah.
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:14.160]   I mean, it does, you know, it sounds like a VoIP call, but it does it.
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:15.160]   It does it.
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.480]   It does it automatically.
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:20.280]   So there, I mean, this is, I think one of the things that Apple has done, it's interesting
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:24.240]   has, just as they did with the iPod where there's companies like iRiver that have to
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:28.280]   innovate because they, they can't compete against the iPod head to head.
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:29.280]   So they innovate.
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:30.720]   I think the phone companies are going to start doing the same thing.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:34.200]   They've got this iPhone staring them down the, so they're going to, they're going to
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:37.400]   come up with things that are better, like putting VoIP on a phone.
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:39.360]   I think they're a little freaky about the iPhone.
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:44.840]   The iPhone has a, you know, the thing that might take off is that Palm $100.99 product,
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:45.840]   a smartphone.
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:46.840]   That's the, I like that.
[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:47.840]   I like that.
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:48.840]   I like that.
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:49.840]   Yeah.
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:50.840]   The iPhone's don't sell.
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:51.840]   They don't sell.
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:52.840]   They don't sell.
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:53.840]   They don't sell because they cost a fortune.
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:55.840]   It's in the right price point.
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:56.840]   Has that made played with the center?
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:57.840]   All of a sudden they sell.
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:58.840]   Anybody played with it?
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:01.040]   Yeah, I did last week at Digital Life.
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.040]   What do you think?
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:03.240]   I thought it was okay.
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:05.040]   You know, like I said, we talked about it.
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:06.040]   We did.
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:07.040]   Yeah.
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:08.040]   You know, it was pretty good.
[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:12.120]   I mean, like I said last week, you know, it really will appeal to the entry level professional
[00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:15.520]   and anyone else who wants a little bit more advanced functionality, but doesn't want to
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:21.640]   spend the, like John said, the $300, $400, $500 to have, you know, the newest and best smartphone.
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:22.720]   It's no folio.
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:26.120]   That's all I can say.
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:27.120]   I liked the folio.
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:30.240]   I was going to be the only guy to buy it, but I liked the folio.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:32.640]   I could use the Neo node, but it's kind of pricey.
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:33.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:36.560]   Dr. Jim Goodnight, who is the CEO at SaaS.
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:41.000]   He was a statistician who had some good ideas on using statistics to help businesses make
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.800]   more money created a company about, I don't know, about 30 years ago called SaaS done very
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:46.240]   well.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:51.200]   He says that he has one thing in common with about 47% of the high school dropouts.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.520]   School is boring.
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:57.360]   He was, it was actually on the fifth, marking the 50th anniversary of his Sputnik, which
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:02.980]   of course, well, we'll get into this in a second, but it is considered common, received
[00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:08.320]   wisdom that Sputnik scared the US so much that the federal government for the first time funded
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:12.960]   science and technology education in the schools and really drove a whole generation of, of
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:13.960]   geeks.
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:17.680]   I think you can make the case that the technology revolution we're going through right now,
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:18.680]   partly is because of Sputnik.
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:19.680]   No, I agree with that.
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:22.960]   And the fact of the matter is that's when the science fairs and everybody all jacked
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:23.960]   up about science.
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:28.560]   And now, in fact, I was watching a really good special on wired TV.
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:35.080]   It was about how they now a days, as opposed to the olden days, you can't even buy a chemistry
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:38.560]   set and they're starting to lose people are losing interest in chemistry.
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:40.560]   Because when I was a kid, we had a, I had a chemistry set.
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:45.160]   I was blowing stuff up and making foam and driving people crazy.
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:46.880]   But now you can't even buy one.
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:50.320]   There's actually a museum that has all the old ones stored away because half the stuff
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:54.560]   in there was illegal by today's standards and the kids are dumbed down.
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:56.760]   I had to ask a question before we go further.
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:52:00.040]   Kevin, are you running a illegal gambling concession in there?
[00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:01.040]   I mean, what was that?
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:02.520]   Was that a real wet wheel?
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:03.520]   What the hell was that?
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.520]   The bang there?
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:05.520]   No, that sounds like a roulette.
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:08.520]   It sounded like a big counting money.
[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:09.520]   No, it was a.
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:11.080]   No, that's my wallet.
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:14.320]   It vibrates when one of the doors close.
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:19.800]   I got this really cool shelf that's got my American flyer trains on it.
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:22.520]   And every time one of the door closes, it rattles a little bit.
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:24.480]   See they should ban those trains too.
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:25.720]   They're dangerous too.
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:27.840]   I've tried to buy a chemistry set for my kids.
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.480]   I thought, oh man, this is great.
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:30.960]   They're eight years old now.
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:32.920]   It's time to blow stuff up.
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:35.960]   And it's because of this crazy safety consciousness people have.
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:39.520]   And the guy that did this report whose name eludes me at the moment, but he's a really
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:43.520]   good, it seems like a really good reporter, he points out the fact that these chemistry
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:47.960]   sets, if you looked at them historically, they have, you know, these scientists that
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:49.400]   are looking like they're doing important stuff.
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:53.240]   And if you look at today's chemistry sets, which don't have much in them at all anyway,
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:57.600]   the scientist that's portrayed on the kits by the marketing guys are goofy looking nut
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:52:58.600]   cases.
[00:52:58.600 --> 00:52:59.600]   Oh, you're right.
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:01.080]   Were their hair sticking out in big black?
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:04.080]   They look like, you know, the perforters on the dentist.
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:05.080]   Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:06.080]   That's a freak.
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:12.960]   Well, welcome to, you know, the way we're operating nowadays.
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:13.960]   It's the idiocracy.
[00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:15.280]   It's the dumbing of America.
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:18.280]   We don't celebrate that anymore, do we?
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:21.760]   You think I'd be dead 10 times over all the things I do when I was a kid that I can't
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:22.760]   do anymore?
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:25.520]   You know, I mean, amazing, amazing.
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:30.440]   Dr. Goodnight said kids today are ill served by old school schooling.
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:35.240]   Today's generation of kids is the most technologically savvy group this country's ever produced.
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:39.000]   They're born with an iPod in one hand, a cell phone in the other.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.640]   They're text messaging, emailing, instant messaging.
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:43.680]   They're on MySpace, YouTube and Google.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:46.440]   They've got Nintendo, Wii's and Game Boys and PlayStations.
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:48.720]   Their world is one of total interactivity.
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.800]   They're in constant communication with each other.
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:56.200]   But when they go to school, they're told to leave those, quote, toys at home.
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:57.560]   They're not to be used in school.
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:01.880]   Instead, the system continues teaching as if these kids belong to the last century by
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:03.320]   standing in front of a blackboard.
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:04.320]   Is he right?
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:05.320]   Yep.
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:08.600]   But there's also difference between technology and science.
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:11.200]   Science is a much more, they're not learning science.
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:13.320]   They're learning technology, learning to end results of science.
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.280]   Yeah, but they're not even learning technology in school.
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:16.520]   I think the point is trying to make it.
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:21.720]   He's also saying that they're not using any of these fantastic learning tools at all.
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:24.160]   They're just using a blackboard.
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:26.640]   Now on the other hand, I don't think you should plunk a kid down in front of a computer and
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:28.880]   say, "Here, Johnny, here's the internet.
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:29.880]   Learn."
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:33.840]   Yeah, but I think there's one significant issue here that maybe you shouldn't be addressed
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:37.040]   in the fact that most of these schools don't have the money to do it right now.
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:38.640]   They can't afford a computer.
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:41.440]   We have to make hundred dollar computers so they can afford them.
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:42.440]   Yeah.
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:46.240]   You know, I mean, the most schools don't have the technology they really need to enter into
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:47.480]   the 21st century.
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:49.640]   And I think that's where we need to start.
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:53.840]   Well, Don, you're in Upper New York State where they actually have an education budget.
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:55:00.080]   John and I are in California where we have our budgets lower than Arkansas per kid.
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:02.840]   And more the kids are starting to talk about this.
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:05.640]   I brought my lunch pile, but I got to leave early.
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:07.560]   I harvested tobacco crop.
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:11.080]   I want to find out if I can get a job as a chicken plucker.
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:12.080]   Oh, no.
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:13.080]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:14.080]   We love Arkansas.
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:15.840]   Right, Kevin, you're from Arkansas.
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:16.840]   Now from New York.
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:17.840]   No, you're hard.
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:19.360]   I actually do like Arkansas.
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:21.040]   I just don't like the chicken pluckers.
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:26.560]   Now that said, I took a trip from one end Arkansas to the other like just a few years ago.
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:28.360]   And I have to say, it's one of the prettiest states in the world.
[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:30.400]   They actually have some really nice wine growing areas.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:34.080]   Believe it or not, up in the mountains in the Ozarks.
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:39.400]   And there's a little town on the border between Oklahoma and Arkansas called Buchanan, which
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:42.440]   is maybe one of the most overlooked gems in the country.
[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:46.480]   It's actually an antique Victorian little city that was built, I guess, around the
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:48.000]   turn of the or before the turn of the century.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   And it's been kept intact.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.480]   It's kind of a tourist attraction.
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:55.600]   No, I share that prejudice that a lot of us from the big northern cities have about the
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:56.600]   southeast.
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:56:00.800]   And once we started working for tech TV, we made a lot of trips to Louisville and Maloxie
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:01.800]   and Montgomery.
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:03.800]   And that's a really beautiful country, beautiful people.
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:08.400]   Yeah, a couple of weeks ago, if I spent, you know, I was in North Carolina floating
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:12.080]   around and it was, I went to Asheville, which is we got a bunch of hippies.
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:13.080]   It's weird.
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:14.080]   Yeah, that's.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:16.320]   And I got to touch my new radio stations in Asheville, actually.
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:17.720]   And Asheville is a really nice little place.
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:19.840]   And Dr. Goodnights from North Carolina too.
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:20.840]   There you go.
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:21.840]   Okay.
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:22.840]   So we made it up.
[00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:23.840]   We made it up for ourselves.
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:24.840]   Do we back pedal fast enough?
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:25.840]   I'll tell you that.
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:28.000]   There are people that still talk like this.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.040]   Nothing wrong with that at all.
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:32.520]   That is the original American accent.
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:35.760]   So I went, you know, through North Carolina, I went, when since I was there, North Carolina
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:37.080]   is well known for its barbecue.
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:40.800]   And they have a thing that there's a club down there that has what's called the Holy
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:46.280]   Grail Trail, which takes you to every one of the great, you know, definitive North Carolina
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:49.800]   style barbecue places, which is about, there's about four different styles.
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:51.840]   And within the main style.
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:57.320]   And I have to say that now I can say for a fact that my pulled or chopped pork is as
[00:56:57.320 --> 00:57:00.120]   good as anything in North Carolina.
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:01.120]   Really?
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:02.120]   Absolutely.
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:03.120]   Are you making some right now?
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:04.120]   I've been working on this for years.
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:07.040]   And I finally got the whole formula down where I can make it just a stunner.
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:09.320]   Now you said pulled or chopped, which is it?
[00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:10.320]   Well, you can, it depends.
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:14.360]   You can take the way I make it with shoulder is that you can take and mash it up with a
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:15.800]   fork and it becomes kind of pulled.
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:19.400]   It has its, it's got a stringer quality or you can take the whole thing and then chop
[00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:22.160]   it and it has a slightly different more chunky quality.
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:25.000]   But it's essentially the difference is minor.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.760]   The North Carolina, North Carolinians, they like to chop it and the Georgians when they
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:32.160]   make this type of pork, they like to pull it.
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:34.000]   They call it pulled, but in fact, it's kind of mashed.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   I love pulled pork.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.200]   Oh, that's welcome to this weekend, Barbara.
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:39.200]   We could go on.
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:41.720]   You know, one of the advantages I think we have out here is a week.
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:45.520]   They usually, you know, I think even though the greatest wood in the world is hickory,
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:48.880]   oak and pork is just a phenomenal and there's so many different kinds of oak and they all
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:50.120]   have their own specific flavors.
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:56.240]   I have a tree that I grow in myself that has an oak flavor that is astonishing and that's
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:57.960]   what I use for my pulled pork.
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:01.280]   You cut down your own tree and dry it and use it?
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:05.440]   I have a tree that when we, when we take a few limbs off, it's a pretty big tree.
[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:07.400]   It provides enough wood for a couple of years.
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:11.600]   So John, you don't have to worry about, you know, all this educational stuff because you
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:13.000]   are a man of the earth.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.680]   You know how to, you know, you know, you know, we could lose.
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:17.080]   I smoked them own trees.
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:18.760]   You're smoking your own wood.
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:20.360]   You're pulling your own pork.
[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:21.360]   I'm impressed.
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:23.640]   I need to grow some pigs then.
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:24.640]   Yeah.
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:31.080]   I have a good friend who kind of bemoaned education from a different point of view.
[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:33.720]   He wanted to bring into my daughter's junior high school.
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:40.000]   He wanted to bring in a pig and slaughter it in front of the kids and then cut it up
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.840]   and make cuts of me and show them.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:45.240]   He said, look, this is where your pork comes from.
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:46.240]   You need to know this.
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:50.040]   Why don't you just take the kids to a meat processing place instead of doing it in the
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:51.040]   classroom?
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:52.880]   Well, it's a field trip.
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:53.880]   It's a field trip.
[00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:56.640]   But he had no, that's a very good point though, don't you think?
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:59:01.960]   And the other day I had a dream that we had lost all power and it was never going to
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:03.280]   come back.
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:05.760]   And I thought, what the hell am I going to do now?
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:06.880]   I don't have any skills.
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:08.160]   I couldn't do any of that.
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:10.040]   I couldn't even smoke my own hickory.
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:11.040]   Yeah.
[00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:12.040]   No, you don't smoke the hickory.
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:13.040]   You use it to smoke.
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:14.040]   See?
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:15.040]   See it?
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:16.040]   There you go.
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:19.360]   I'm going to go learn how to kill a pig.
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:21.120]   I got to have something to do with it.
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:22.120]   Go fish it.
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:23.120]   The power goes out.
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:24.120]   You live out there in farm country.
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:28.280]   You should have some ability to live without power.
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:31.200]   This guy makes his own olives.
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:32.200]   They're good too.
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:33.200]   That's not that hard.
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:34.200]   Okay.
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:35.200]   I'm going to do a tree.
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:36.200]   All right.
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:37.200]   Okay.
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:38.200]   So I need it.
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:42.960]   British Telecom is telling its customers that they want their customers to share their
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:47.960]   bandwidth.
[00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:52.400]   The routers that are designed to hook under your internet and offer free Wi-Fi access
[00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:54.160]   to your neighbors.
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:59.640]   And if you do that, BT is going to sell you the router at a deal.
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.680]   They're going to encourage people to do this.
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:04.600]   I mean, at fonts also, I didn't know this, but fonts also signed a deal with Time Warner
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:05.600]   Cable in the US.
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:08.680]   I don't know if that's your cable company done in Upper New York State.
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:09.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.680]   All too well it is.
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:11.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:12.680]   Have they?
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:13.680]   Yeah, I turn.
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:14.680]   Stuff.
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:17.920]   They'll want you to give people some background on this because I don't think everybody out
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.160]   there knows what you're talking about.
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.960]   This is a little controversial.
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:22.840]   I remember people even thought this was kind of a scam.
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:26.920]   It's a Spanish company, Fonera, F-O-N-E-R-A.
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:29.640]   The Fawn routers are available at F-O-N.com.
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:34.880]   And the idea is you get these little inexpensive $40 or $50 routers.
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:35.880]   They're Wi-Fi routers.
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.360]   You don't have to get rid of your own router.
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:38.360]   You actually plug it into that.
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:39.560]   So that way you're still secure.
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:43.400]   You're protected because nobody can get into your inside of your network.
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:46.080]   But you offer your internet access to the outside world.
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.360]   And you can choose to charge people or give it away.
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:51.040]   But if you give it away, then you get an account with Fon.
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:54.400]   And anywhere you go in the world where there are other Fon routers that are being put up
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.080]   this way, you can use them for free.
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:58.760]   So it's kind of give a little, get a little.
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:01.080]   It's actually, I think, a great idea.
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.600]   There's another company doing something similar.
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:06.160]   Only they're using mesh, which Fon does not use.
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:07.640]   You have to have a connection.
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:10.520]   This sounds highly socialistic to me.
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:13.440]   Well, once again, it's the commies at Apple.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:17.160]   I think the advantage is it saves them putting in more towers.
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:18.160]   Right.
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.400]   I think from BT's point of view, there's an advantage.
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:24.560]   And certainly, I mean, it doesn't, you don't use more bandwidth because you put this thing
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:25.560]   in.
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:26.560]   I guess you could.
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:27.560]   You could use slightly more.
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:28.560]   But...
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.600]   You know, Leo, talk about Time Warner Cable.
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:33.320]   My router died at me about a month ago.
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:34.320]   And I went down.
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:36.520]   I told them I needed an old new setup and the whole deal.
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:38.760]   And they gave me a wireless RCA router.
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:43.280]   So I don't know if it has anything to do with this, but there's no way for me to get
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:46.760]   into the system without calling them and doing whatever they want me to do.
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:48.440]   But you know, it's open right now.
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:50.280]   And I wonder, you know, does this have anything to do with it?
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:51.280]   I could be wrong.
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:52.280]   And I've been wrong with it.
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:53.280]   They made a deal with Fon.
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:55.200]   They made a deal with Fon to distribute these routers.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.200]   So it could vary.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.200]   I mean, very interesting.
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.200]   Who makes the router?
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:01:59.200]   RCA.
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:00.200]   RCA.
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:01.200]   Well, I think Fon's routers are...
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.200]   RCA.
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:03.200]   I didn't even know they were in that.
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:04.200]   RCA.
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.480]   Another high quality product from RCA.
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:10.080]   I think RCA is just a brand that gets tossed around these days.
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.800]   They sold it to somebody.
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:12.800]   The French.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:13.800]   The French on it.
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:14.800]   Thompson.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:15.800]   That's right.
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:16.800]   You're right.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:17.800]   Maraki is this other company, M-E-R-A-K-I.com.
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.960]   And I actually have a Maraki router.
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:20.960]   I'm going to set it up.
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:24.040]   But they sell outdoor ones and door ones, but the idea is it's mesh.
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.360]   It's being used in San Francisco.
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.360]   You're going to set it up.
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:28.360]   Leo, you're out in the middle of...
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.360]   Yeah.
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:30.360]   But if any cows want to buy...
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:31.360]   Wow.
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:33.360]   You're getting online and you're going to have to pick this up.
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:34.600]   Just strap a router to a cow.
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:36.040]   If any cows go by.
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:37.040]   You can set it.
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:38.320]   But I think the idea is...
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:39.320]   And these are mesh.
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:42.360]   So that means even if you don't have access, if you set one up, then you can reach somebody
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:46.160]   else who does, you can pass it along.
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:47.160]   I think these are very...
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:50.760]   They have solar powered outdoor antennas.
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:52.880]   Maraki M-E-R-A-K-I.
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:53.880]   That's probably your right.
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:54.880]   It's probably utopian.
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:55.880]   Never happened.
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.880]   Well, it's fun.
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:01.800]   I'm glad you're having fun.
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:02.800]   That's good.
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:03.800]   Okay.
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:06.000]   I think we're going to wrap this up unless anybody has anything else.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.760]   It's fun to talk about.
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:10.760]   Going once.
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:11.760]   I think so.
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:12.760]   Going twice.
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:13.760]   Hey, it's been great having you guys.
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:14.760]   I appreciate it.
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:18.800]   Don Reisinger is a freelance author for ZDNet and CNET.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:19.800]   Is there any more?
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:20.800]   It's only CNET.
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:23.800]   They syndicate every now and then the ZDNet.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:24.800]   Oh, okay.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:25.800]   That happens.
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:26.800]   I don't know.
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:27.800]   It's just...
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:28.800]   Yeah, even at their arch.
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:29.800]   That's their arch rivals, isn't it?
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:30.800]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:31.800]   It was on there once.
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:32.800]   Same company, isn't it?
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:33.800]   Oh, is it?
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:34.800]   I can't keep track of it.
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:36.800]   It's Google Reisinger and you'll find him.
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:37.800]   I know.
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:38.800]   Yeah.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:39.800]   Are you like easier just to do that?
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:42.080]   Are EIS-I-N-G-E-R.
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:43.720]   And I'm really glad we get you back on, Don.
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:44.720]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:45.720]   I really appreciate it.
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:46.720]   That's really incredible.
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:47.720]   Kevin Cree.
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:49.880]   Well, is it Nvidia?
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:51.600]   What do you do at Nvidia?
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.840]   Oh, some strategic marketing stuff.
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:56.320]   How is it going in Nvidia?
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.560]   You're the Kings right now, aren't you?
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:59.880]   Are you the guys on top with the fastest card?
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:02.040]   You must love seeing these games come out.
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.040]   The Bio and Fox.
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.040]   Oh, no.
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:07.640]   Actually, right now is a great time because you have BioShock.
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:14.160]   You've got World in Conflict, the Half-Life 2, Red Box is coming.
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:16.360]   There's just a ton of great stuff.
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:18.080]   Crisis comes out next month.
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:19.080]   Crisis is going to go.
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:20.080]   Latest month.
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:26.120]   Do you OEM your stuff to Xbox or PlayStation 3 or they do their own stuff?
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:29.000]   We've licensed some of our technology to PlayStation 3.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   So there's our...
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   You get a little cut out.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.480]   Not a physical chip, but our licensed technology.
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.080]   Man, I just saw...
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:42.760]   On Heavenly Sword, they have a trailer for Metal Gear Solid, whatever, 17 or 30 or whatever
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:43.760]   it is.
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:45.560]   Man, does that look good.
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:47.640]   Where's Duke Nukem forever?
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:49.120]   Supposedly any day now.
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:52.120]   Yeah, they've been saying that for about 10 years now.
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:53.920]   Does anybody still work?
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:54.920]   Is anybody still working on it?
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:55.920]   I wonder.
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.520]   That's the way I heard they were, I thought.
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:04:59.520]   You're kidding.
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:01.960]   They promised something at E3 and I don't know if they delivered.
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:03.800]   I wasn't there, but I guess they...
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:04.800]   Who knows?
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:05.800]   You never know of these guys.
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:08.560]   In its day, that was a fun game.
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:09.560]   It was.
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:12.640]   It was a great game and it was pretty impressive for what it was.
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:13.640]   I'm looking for...
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:18.880]   The new Metal Gear Solid is at least judging by this incredible trailer is going to be
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:19.880]   the game of 2000.
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:23.400]   You probably saw the movie trailer, all the good stuffs in the trailer.
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:24.400]   No, you know what it is?
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:25.400]   It's kind of cool.
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:28.160]   It's the designer, Japanese designer walking through it.
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:33.880]   They're actually playing it, so it's not cutscenes, and demonstrating some of how to play it.
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:35.720]   And it is very strategic.
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:38.040]   Not only does it look good, but the strategy is amazing.
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:39.600]   It looks like it's going to be an incredible game.
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:41.920]   I'm sure someone can't wait for it to come out either.
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:43.520]   They need some.
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:48.480]   Ratchet and Clank's not going to keep those cuffs filled with gold for two to down.
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:50.400]   Actually, I got Skate, which is pretty good.
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:52.360]   Skate's very nice.
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:54.400]   Ratchet and Clank will be pretty good.
[01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.600]   Heavenly Sword looks good anyway, but they don't...
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:58.600]   Right, there's a Dirtha Games for that platform.
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.240]   It's kind of depressing.
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:03.480]   I bought it because it was the cheapest Blu-ray player on the market.
[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:04.480]   500 bucks.
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:05.480]   You know, Leo, I went...
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:07.360]   It was back in the summer, I think I bought it.
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:09.880]   I got the PlayStation 3 for $83.
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:10.880]   What?
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:14.440]   Yeah, I went to EB Games, and they had some special deal going on.
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:21.000]   They took $200 off of you, traded in the year old PlayStation 2, and a working controller
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.760]   and a memory card.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:24.680]   And then I traded in a whole bunch of games.
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:27.080]   And I walked away with $83 and said, "I'll take it."
[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:28.080]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:31.320]   Of course, now a year later, you're still wishing you had something to play on it.
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:34.440]   Yeah, of course, it only has dust on it right now.
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:35.440]   You know what?
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:37.200]   The Metal Gear Solid uses the 6-axis control.
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:40.440]   I didn't even know that this controller was a spatial controller like the Wii control.
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:43.080]   I didn't have no idea because no game used it.
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:45.560]   But you could tilt it and move it back and forward.
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.360]   And Metal Gear Solid uses that.
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:49.200]   It looks like it's going to be really cool.
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.480]   Yeah, I was 17-year old.
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:52.080]   He loves his PS3.
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:54.480]   And we also had Xbox 360s when playing Halo on.
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:58.880]   So the PS3 has been collecting dust while the Xbox 360 has got some use.
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:02.280]   Hey, you know, they saved everything for the end of the year, but at least there were
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:03.280]   some good games.
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:04.280]   I loved Bioshock.
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:05.480]   I finally finished that.
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:09.280]   I kind of was saying I can't play Halo 3 until I finished Bioshock.
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:13.520]   You know, I mean, with the Wii too, it was my favorite console for a while.
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:15.680]   But now, I mean, it just needs games.
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.680]   But I mean, I get a little bored with it.
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:19.280]   You know, there's a bunch of mini-games.
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:20.680]   Yeah, mini-games, exactly.
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:21.680]   Yeah.
[01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:23.880]   And you still can't walk through a store and get the new-
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:26.880]   Capcom's got a lot of games for that device.
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:27.880]   The Wii?
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:28.880]   Go to the key.
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:29.880]   Yeah, go to the Capcom.
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:31.880]   So I think I got a lot of good stuff.
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:33.880]   Nothing knocks my socks off, though, on the Wii.
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:34.880]   It's not for you.
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:35.880]   Oh, OK.
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:41.280]   Although the bowling and the tennis games that will come with it, they're just, they're
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:42.480]   they're a lot of fun.
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:43.680]   Yeah, Wii Sports, right.
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:44.680]   Yeah, there they are.
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:45.680]   Yeah.
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:47.880]   But I think what Mario's coming out soon, so maybe that'll help.
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:48.880]   That'll be good.
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:49.880]   That'll help a lot.
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:50.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:51.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:52.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:53.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:54.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:55.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:56.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:57.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:58.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:07:59.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:00.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:01.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:02.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:03.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:04.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:05.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:06.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:26.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:33.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:40.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:47.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:54.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:09:02.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:07.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:14.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:21.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:28.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:35.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:42.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:52.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:59.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:04.880]   I think it's the best game in the game.
