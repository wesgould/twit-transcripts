[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.280]   will join us at the beginning of the show
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.760]   to talk about her article.
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.840]   It's sending shockwaves throughout Silicon Valley.
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.200]   It's all coming up next on Twet.

[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.920]   It's time for Twet this week at Tech
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.640]   to show where we cover the great, late, late, great tech news
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.840]   with some of the best tech journalists in the country,
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.560]   in the world.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.120]   Sometimes Ian Thompson is here from the register.co.uk.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.960]   Always a pleasure.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.000]   Always a pleasure to live.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.760]   Always have fun up there.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.960]   Thanks for coming and firing up his Chromebook.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.840]   Yep.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.520]   He still believes he can get work done in a Chromebook.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.240]   I can, although, without an instant connection,
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.720]   it used to be a very expensive doorstop.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.600]   No, it's not so bad.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.200]   I like it.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.040]   I'm kind of jealous you still have a pixel I gave mine away.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.160]   Also with us, and I'm really thrilled to welcome him back.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.800]   He was a longtime host on Macbreak Weekly.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.480]   We remember very well his iPhone vest.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.360]   Here we are in the 10th anniversary of the iPhone
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.640]   welcoming Scott Born back to the microphone.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.960]   He says, "Still not dead," is his poster.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.360]   Hi, Scott, it's great to see you.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.400]   Hey, it's fantastic to be back on Leo.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.880]   Thank you.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.320]   This is only my second time on The Big Show.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.840]   I can't believe that.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.280]   Photo.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.240]   I know, like 150 Macbreak Weeklyies,
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.840]   but only the second time on Twet.
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.600]   Well, I feel bad about that.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.000]   I apologize.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.440]   Me too.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.440]   You still podcast like crazy at photopodcast.com.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.960]   And I know you still take amazing wildlife pictures,
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.120]   and we could see a lot of those on your Instagram.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.360]   And I see them on Facebook.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.360]   Also joining us right now, Denise Howell from this week in law.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.320]   We thought we kind of rejiggered the show a little bit
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.360]   to get a woman on the show.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.640]   Thank you, Denise, for being here.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.040]   And I'll tell you why we thought it'd be good to have a woman.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.240]   Big news, roiling Silicon Valley right now.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.760]   It started with stories from the information
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.600]   talking about Justin Kolbeck, who is a venture capitalist,
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.120]   started his own from binary capital,
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.000]   and has been accused by a number of women
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.080]   of inappropriate behavior.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.840]   These were VCs who had approached him about funding.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.920]   And Kolbeck has now left the company.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.960]   In fact, they're folding the venture fund.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.120]   But then Katie Benner in the New York Times,
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.080]   just a couple of days ago, publishes an article
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.240]   which goes much farther mentioning not only Kolbeck,
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.360]   but other high profile venture capitalist, Chris Sokka
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.880]   of lowercase capital, Dave McClure of 500 startups.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.880]   Dave wrote a Maya Culpa in which he said, "I'm a jerk."
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.600]   And he'd plan to step down, but he'd step down a little early
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.120]   from his 500 startups.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.680]   This is kind of roiling Silicon Valley.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.240]   Katie Benner is on the line with us.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.240]   We appreciate you joining us, Katie, from your first day off.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.800]   I apologize.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.280]   Happy vacation.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.200]   Happy vacation.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.440]   But you know when you write a story that says this big,
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.560]   you know you're going to get calls.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.400]   And I know you're doing interviews around it.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.760]   How did this story come to you?
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.000]   Well, so a lot of it to your point really
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.920]   could come after the information published a story
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.000]   about Justin Kolbeck.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.960]   I think that most of the women in this story
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.480]   were not expecting the sort of support that they got.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.920]   The story said that Justin Kolbeck had sexually harassed
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.560]   them or groped them or propositioned them
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.440]   while they were trying to raise money from his venture firm.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.480]   So he was really in a position of power over them.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.800]   They need the money for their companies to grow and survive.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.760]   That's why you raise venture capital.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.000]   It's why you make relationships and create friendships
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.080]   with VCs.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.560]   And it's sort of what--
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.920]   it's the lifeblood of all the innovations,
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.680]   Silicon Valley professors to embrace and to promote.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.080]   So they're trying to raise money.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.720]   They were harassed.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.480]   And they didn't think anybody would believe them.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.400]   And then not only did people believe them,
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.600]   you have Reid Hoffman.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.720]   And you had Melinda Gates come out on Twitter saying,
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.840]   these women should be believed and they should be supported.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.200]   So that was an extraordinary moment.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.680]   And in the wake of that, as I was calling people just
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.960]   to see what kind of impact the story was happening,
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.680]   I was meeting more and more women who said,
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.840]   you know what, I want to go on the record too.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.440]   I have a story to tell.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.720]   And a lot of them had screenshots, text messages,
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.240]   Facebook messages, supporting their allegations.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.560]   This wasn't he said she said.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.760]   We were reading the text messages saying,
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.000]   this is a real proposition.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.880]   This is a really bad thing to do.
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.360]   So certainly a lot of people had that kind of supporting
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.920]   evidence as well that I think helped them come forward.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.960]   And of course, this follows in the heels of the Travis
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:39.360]   Kalinik's resignation from Uber, Susan Fowler's blog post,
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.360]   which started that.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.400]   It is starting to feel like this is endemic in the valley.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.760]   Is that the sense you get, Katie?
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.440]   And I don't think that it's surprising to me
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.760]   that it would be so pervasive.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.560]   If you think about it, the venture capital world
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.320]   is very tiny and very closed off.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.480]   So it's very much of who you know sort of business.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.000]   It's a network business.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.360]   The actual capital itself has held firmly into hands
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.680]   of these hundred or so venture firms.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.920]   And there's no transparency.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.200]   So they're not publicly traded.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.960]   There's no reason for them to explain when bad things happen.
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.560]   So what usually happens is if the VC abuses his power,
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.200]   the firm is incentivized to let him or her go quietly,
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.520]   maybe pay them off, maybe put money to their next fund
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.840]   just to get them out of the firm's hair.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.880]   And instead of letting everybody know why they're being
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.840]   fired or why there's a mutual agreement legally
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.960]   for them to part ways, you just let them go very quietly
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.880]   into the night and they can do whatever they want
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.600]   as long as they're not messing up with the reputation
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.080]   of venture firm A or a venture firm B.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.400]   Those firms just push the people out and move them along.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.920]   The way it was described to me was it's very similar
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.000]   to what the Catholic Church was doing when they'd find out
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:51.880]   that there were bad priests.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.160]   They would just move into another parish.
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.080]   Rather than say something bad has happened
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.360]   'cause that would hurt the reputation
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.480]   of the industry in a bigger way.
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.720]   Just move them away and make them some else's problem.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.280]   - Well, and you point out in your article
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.200]   that two years ago Alan Paus sued Kleiner Perkins
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.960]   and lost in a very kind of similar situation,
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.520]   which makes me feel like, and of course we just saw,
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.200]   Roger Ailes forced out at the Fox News.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.200]   - Bill O'Reilly as well.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.000]   - Bill O'Reilly, you get the feeling that
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.200]   where in the corridors of power men have sort of run wild
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.400]   in a way that maybe they always have,
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.400]   or do you think there's something, it's gotten worse?
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.200]   - I think that they always have,
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.520]   but we're seeing more women take on more positions of power
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.720]   and more women feel like it's okay.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.080]   There's no backlash that can happen.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.520]   It's going to keep him from speaking out.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.000]   Now that feels very new to me.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.280]   I can't remember.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.880]   I think that even two years ago when Alan Paus
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.520]   took Kleiner to trial, it was extraordinary.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.160]   Everybody said, "I can't believe she did that.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.600]   "She'll never work again.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.520]   "It's going to destroy her career."
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.000]   Nobody said, "This is going to hurt Kleiner."
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.640]   Or, "What about Kleiner?"
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.960]   Everybody said, "Oh my gosh,
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.120]   "this woman just sacrificed herself."
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:14.520]   So now there's something has happened in the culture,
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:18.360]   and it is like where when people come forward,
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.240]   it's less about these women who just destroyed their careers
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.360]   and their potential to make money and more about,
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.280]   "Oh, well, what happened and why is this happening?
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.600]   "Do we want to do business with this firm?"
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.080]   So there's a shift in the conversation that's important.
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.960]   - Last night Dave McClure published a really kind of,
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.600]   I have to commend him for at least not denying it,
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.320]   but saying, "I did it."
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.280]   He says, "I'm a creep.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.920]   "I'm sorry."
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.160]   He says he's seeking treatment.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.520]   My behavior was inexcusable and wrong.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.440]   Credit today for, I mean, not for what he did,
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:01.040]   but for immediately copying to it and stepping down.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.600]   There are others you mentioned.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.520]   - Let me remind.
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.760]   - Go ahead.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.400]   - 500 startup peed out, stepped down months ago,
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.360]   and they just kept it quiet.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.200]   - Right, right.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.760]   - When the story came out, there was no way for them
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.320]   to be quiet anymore, and they had to disclose.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.040]   - Christine Sy has co-founders running the company.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.600]   Did you get the sense Christine knew about this
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.600]   and had helped cover it up?
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.320]   Or was she shocked?
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.600]   - I get the sense she was very surprised.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.440]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.000]   - The woman who we talked about in our story,
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.480]   she was harassed by Dave years ago,
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.680]   and it wasn't until, you know,
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.800]   way led onto way and Christine heard about it
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.360]   and reached out to her just last year
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.960]   and said, "I want to know more."
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.440]   Now what happened after that is 500 startup
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.520]   skid lunge and internal investigations,
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.360]   and the past few months have forced Dave to step down.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.160]   But you have to wonder would they have ever been public
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.280]   about it and made that public knowledge
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.520]   without the story, who knows?
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.480]   And if they hadn't, well then doesn't match
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.440]   just the pressure way, the problem,
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.560]   because 500 startups is known for supporting women,
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.040]   it's known for diversity initiatives.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.040]   And if everybody still thinks Dave is a hero,
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.560]   well then they're still going to do business with him
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.800]   and he'll still be able to be in situations
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.880]   where women could be vulnerable around him
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.680]   because nobody knows if there's anything wrong.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.560]   - I think one of the reasons this rocks Silicon Valley
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.840]   is because Chris Saka and Dave McClure
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:26.560]   are well liked and well known in Silicon Valley,
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.760]   and it's, I think it's a bit of a surprise.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.000]   - Well I think also the tech industry
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.800]   was thought that it was above this sort of thing.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.640]   We were in the industry.
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.800]   - Yeah, we were smarter and more in the industry.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.280]   - We were smarter, we came into the 70s and 80s.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.040]   A lot of the people who were the founding industries
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.920]   but the founding starters of the competing industry
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.880]   were geeks at school who got beaten up
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.200]   and were therefore slightly more open minded about things.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.120]   But it does seem from the stories
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.120]   that you and others have done on this
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.080]   is that we've got a serious problem
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.160]   which needs to be addressed.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.960]   And there are quite frankly weasel words coming out
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.640]   of binary capital at the start of the week
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.080]   compared to where they are now was just--
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:11:59.920]   - They denied it.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.680]   - Oh initially it was a flat on denial
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.960]   they're making this up.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.920]   And now it's just within 24 hours,
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.080]   it's kind of like, oh this is the worst 24 hours
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.280]   of my life, it's like well boo hoo.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.320]   - Katie has there been any backlash to this article?
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:16.880]   - Yeah, I mean of course there will always be
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.440]   backlash, some of it I don't want to get too
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.600]   into because it's fairly distasteful.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.120]   But I think that the backlash that we've gotten
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.440]   does feel to me more interesting.
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.920]   I've gotten a lot of messages from people saying,
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:37.920]   okay, one, you focused on men harassing women
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.840]   but please know that men harass men
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:45.880]   and that is not just sort of heterosexual men harassing
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.600]   women, there is all sorts of harassment
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.240]   because there's such an imbalanced power
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.080]   between the people who have money
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.840]   and the people who need money in technology
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:55.680]   to make ideas happen.
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.040]   So I think actually that's a very valid criticism.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:02.200]   And also people talk about the fact
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.320]   that harassment isn't standalone,
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.040]   that the fact that it's sexual harassment
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.040]   or proposition people for sex
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.240]   we kind of get them to go to bed with them
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:15.760]   and that is, there's almost, there's also just a symptom
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.040]   of a larger problem in the industry
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.200]   that women just aren't as respected.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.360]   And if women are respected,
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.960]   that when those things happen,
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.720]   when that very specific harassment happens
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.280]   people be up at arms about it so they're covering it up.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.960]   So I think that was an interesting perspective as well.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.200]   - Katie, I know your own vacation.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.240]   I appreciate you taking the time to talk to us.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.480]   I encourage people to read the article,
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:42.080]   also read Albergotti's article in the information
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:42.920]   and we'll continue.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.680]   - Read the article is just excellent.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.840]   But yeah, definitely read that too.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.800]   - Thank you, Katie. Enjoy your vacation.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.560]   - Thank you. Have a great forest.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.440]   - Take care.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.840]   Katie Benner, New York Times, her article appeared
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.640]   in the June 30th online edition of the New York Times
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.560]   and I probably is in print this weekend.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.880]   - While it feels like this is a breaking story,
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.760]   I also feel like this might be something
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.000]   that's been going on for a long time.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.520]   And he's how you've been covering technology
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:13.320]   for a very long time, at least 10 years.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:17.240]   When did you start your blog many years ago?
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.760]   Have you seen, go ahead.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.240]   - I started my blog in 2001.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.080]   - Okay.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:27.520]   - And Scott met in person for the first time in 2006.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.520]   - I remember that.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.480]   - At the podcast, "Probable Expo."
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.320]   - Yeah.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.520]   - Yeah, I remember.
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.800]   - And so my question is, is this something
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.000]   that's been going on all along,
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.760]   but has been kind of a open secret?
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.640]   Or is this something that has gotten worse
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.520]   over the last couple of years?
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.720]   Is kind of harassment.
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:52.520]   - I feel like it's something that's been going on all along
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.000]   and that it's not unique to the tech industry,
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.040]   that it's been going on in the legal industry
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.280]   and the banking industry and the farming industry
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:04.800]   and the journalism industry and all frontiers of science.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:09.800]   And, you know, I mean, to think that harassment is unique
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.760]   to the tech industry is naive,
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.360]   because having been around the fringes
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.520]   of the tech industry, all of the other harassment
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.880]   I have experienced has been outside of it.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.040]   And I have experienced my share of it.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.520]   - I'm sure you have.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.880]   This is kind of the point every woman has a story
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.680]   is to tell something like this.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.960]   But you're right Ian, we thought we were immune.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.840]   - Well, I mean, we know better.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.080]   We're more modern.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.760]   Well, technology is supposed to be a meritocracy.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.560]   It's a very young industry.
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.800]   It came in in the '70s and '80s
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.400]   when we were supposed to have sorted a lot of this stuff out.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.880]   And it's just very disbiriting when you see this stuff
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.720]   coming up again and again and again.
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.080]   But at least people are speaking out about it
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.400]   and that does seem to be bringing around some change
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.680]   and the more people that speak out about it, the better.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:55.520]   - Will it help?
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.920]   Did it used to have more women in technology,
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.280]   more women in the boardroom, more women entrepreneurs,
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.920]   more women executives?
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:06.720]   - Absolutely, more women to steal a phrase from Hamilton
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.000]   in the room where it happens.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   - Yeah.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.440]   - And to get to that point a little deeper,
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.720]   I am so grateful for Katie's reporting
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.320]   and the fact that we're having this conversation
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:24.320]   on the one hand and by no means do I want people
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:29.440]   to discount what has been reported and alleged.
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:36.520]   But at the same time, there is some fallout from this
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:41.560]   I think that is damaging and productive,
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.720]   if I can say that.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:48.000]   On the one hand, I think it's really important
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.360]   that we have these conversations.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:55.360]   Reid Hoffman is absolutely right that his decency pledge.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:00.840]   I hope people will go and read that and take it to heart
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.920]   because I think that's how we get through this,
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:07.400]   that people live being decent.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:13.360]   And fortunately, the vast majority of my relationships
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:17.560]   in the technology and in other business arenas
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:21.640]   have been where people lived being decent.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.860]   But there are those episodes where you have,
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:30.080]   you remember the terrible and traumatic things
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.840]   that happened to you and I'm hoping for a day
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.760]   when people don't get to the middle or later part
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.840]   of their careers and look back and say,
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:44.160]   "God, I had tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.320]   of business relationships with people
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.320]   that went really, really well."
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.120]   And there was not a shred of harassment involved.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.120]   But there are four or five that really stand out
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.760]   as being creepy and awful.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.560]   And I hope we're moving away from that.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:02.280]   And I think that the way that we get there
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:06.560]   is through what Reid Hoffman suggests.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.720]   You've got it, if you see something, say something,
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.880]   you've got to make sure that people who are doing this
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:16.200]   and I do feel that they are in the minority
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.640]   of people in the business world,
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.000]   that there are still people out there today
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.240]   who haven't gotten in the memo that this is just not okay.
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.360]   But if they're held accountable
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.560]   and if people are living this in their daily life,
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:37.560]   and if the checks on it aren't just the corporate message
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:43.280]   of, "Oh, we have legal compliance obligations
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.200]   where you have to go to a management training class
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.320]   and learn about harassment,"
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.160]   and maybe someone's chewing up a video on a screen
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.600]   and letting it play and not really paying attention
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.040]   or even watching and everyone's just checking
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.400]   the box that this has been done,
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.480]   but people are really living this in their daily lives,
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.200]   then I think we'll get to that point
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.720]   where everyone can in the room where it happens.
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.920]   Because on the other end of this extreme
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.320]   of having this conversation,
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.160]   you're talking about backlash, Leah,
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.920]   one possible backlash and one backlash
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.360]   that we already see in Washington, DC,
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:24.280]   among Congress people anxious to avoid scandal
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:29.280]   senators as well, is sort of taking the Mike Pence approach
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:33.960]   where, "Oh, if you are of the gender
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.440]   where I might be associated with having a relationship
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:42.440]   with you, then you and I shall not have certain relationships
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.600]   that could be problematic and controversial.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:50.440]   You and I shall not even dine together an accompanied.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:54.880]   We will not be in a venue where there's alcohol served
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.960]   because of the fear of scandal
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.760]   and maybe false accusations."
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.720]   So I think on the other end of this extreme,
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:09.080]   you have to be really careful both that people
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.560]   who might be subject to harassment
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.160]   don't live in fear of that,
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.320]   and that people who might be accused of it
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.880]   don't live in fear of the false accusation
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:23.880]   and not to have any sort of backlash
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.480]   to Katie's reporting,
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.000]   but just a bit of pushback to the people
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.680]   that she reported on do dispute these allegations.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.480]   She's saying that this is cut and dried
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.640]   and it happened based on the reporting
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.440]   that she's done and what she's seen.
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:45.440]   And she's certainly doing a service in reporting that,
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.560]   but two of the people here do dispute
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.280]   that this actually happened,
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.360]   Chris Saka and Mark Cantor say,
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.880]   "No, it did not go down like that."
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:59.880]   So we're having sort of a trial in the media for them
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.560]   and people should be aware that this is not a trial
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.840]   in a court where credibility and witnesses
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.040]   and evidence are all subject to being--
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.840]   - It's challenging because of course,
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.720]   one of the mantras is "Believe the Woman,"
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:18.680]   but it is conceivable that there's false accusations.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.000]   And so it's very challenging yet,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.480]   the one hand you don't wanna dismiss these,
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:26.200]   but on the other hand, you don't wanna convict somebody
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.800]   unreasonably.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.400]   You're right, this is a survey from Claire Kane Miller
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.000]   in the New York Times, "The Upshot."
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.640]   Americans are wary of being along with the opposite sex.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:37.480]   And I think you're right,
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.760]   I think that would be a very bad trend
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.720]   because it would keep women out of the room
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.880]   where it happens because-- - Well, this is it.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.640]   I mean, when Mike Pence first made his comments
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.000]   about he wouldn't have lunch with a loan with a real woman.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.320]   - I understand why.
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.120]   - Well, I don't know, 'cause I was kind of part of me
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.760]   when I first read that was like, well, hang on,
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.280]   is he saying that he's not sure he can keep control of himself?
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.320]   - No, I think he wants to be above suspicion.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.360]   - Right, okay.
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.680]   - And if you're a public figure,
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.240]   you might wanna avoid these kinds of accusations.
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.520]   - It's also a very handy way though,
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.160]   to make sure that, yeah, as you say,
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.160]   you can exclude women based on,
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.080]   I don't feel comfortable being in a room with you.
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.680]   - It's called the Billy Graham rule.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:10.520]   - Yeah, because-- - Yeah, so--
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.440]   - He says the thing in New York,
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.680]   he was, even when he was on his deathbed,
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.800]   he didn't have, he wasn't alone with a female nurse.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.000]   And you were like-- - Yeah, and you wonder,
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.720]   I mean, I don't know what Billy Graham was worried about.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.360]   I don't know what Mike Pence is worried about.
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.400]   I should point out though, you were talking about diversity
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.160]   in tech, and Google's diversity report came out,
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.680]   it's annual diversity report.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.640]   And while you do see more women at Google,
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:37.480]   it's still a fraction of what would nominally be 50 or 51%.
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:41.200]   It's only 31% of the total hires,
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.200]   and only 20% of the tech hires.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.240]   - Yeah. - The thing though,
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.320]   that's very depressing to me is,
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.280]   if you look at the diversity report,
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:51.200]   African Americans represent 2% of the overall,
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:54.000]   1% of the tech hires Hispanic people,
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.640]   3% of the tech people.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.280]   It is far from a diverse group.
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:03.680]   It is very heavily white and male.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.840]   - I know that the Hackermanna Festo tended to get
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:06.880]   that one wrong, I think.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.520]   The idea was we would all be brought together
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.880]   by a technology-- - Yeah, one one,
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.880]   that's, I think that's what it,
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.120]   we feel like Silicon Valley should be a meritocracy
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.480]   - Yeah. - Pure and simple,
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.960]   and it should be race blind, gender blind,
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.960]   but it clearly is-- - Unfortunately,
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.720]   human beings work there, and they've all got
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.320]   their grab bag of prejudices and mistaken views.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.480]   So it's, we're getting there,
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.480]   study but surely, but it's just not moving
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:32.640]   if anywhere fast enough as fast as it needs to be.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.120]   - So I really do, I agree with you, Denise Reed Hoffman,
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.320]   who is the founder of LinkedIn,
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:40.560]   almost immediately after the information report,
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.880]   a week ago, Friday published an article called
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.120]   "The Human Rights of Women Entrepreneurs"
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.000]   and asked people, said, "We do care,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   "we men in Silicon Valley, we do care,
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.200]   "and we do need kind of this bill of rights,
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:01.040]   "this agreement that there should be zero tolerance of this."
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:04.000]   - Right. - A decency pledge.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.640]   - Right, and I think that's really,
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.320]   people really need to take that to heart,
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.240]   and I think that's where the seats go.
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.360]   Because again, you can do--
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:18.080]   HR departments in big companies are really helpful as well,
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.920]   because people know they'll be accountable,
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.120]   and they'll lose their job.
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.760]   - Yeah, but you look at, for instance, Uber and Susan Fowler,
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:29.120]   there was no help for her in the HR department at Uber.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.320]   - Well, a friend of mine was actually pitched by Uber
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.880]   about three weeks after the Fowler article came out,
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.680]   and this is a woman who co-wrote a book called "Women in Technology."
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.240]   She was pitched by the HR person and responded,
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.000]   "Look, based on Uber at the moment,
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.880]   "this is not a company I really would want to work for."
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:48.000]   And the HR came, the female HR person came back to it and said,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.200]   "Look, you and I both know sexism is a problem in the industry.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.480]   "We're working to work this out,
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.400]   "but you really need to stop being so prissy about it."
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.280]   - I think that is the attitude of many men,
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:01.600]   and even some women is, "Oh, come on, just buck it up.
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.160]   "Put up with it, slap the guy and move on."
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.320]   - Exactly, just you've got to change these things,
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.080]   either personally or as a corporate culture,
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.920]   but it's challenging.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:10.560]   - Yeah.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:11.520]   All right, we're gonna move on.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.400]   We have many other things to talk about,
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.040]   and I know sometimes it's an uncomfortable subject,
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.480]   and not really strictly about tech,
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.360]   except that it is, and I think it's important to talk about.
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.960]   So I'm glad we could get Katie Benarron
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.120]   and thank Katie for joining us during her vacation.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.680]   Denise is of course gonna stick around,
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:31.120]   and by the way, I should point out Denise is now on an iPhone.
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.120]   (laughing)
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.680]   I don't know why it is, but for some reason,
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.200]   her computer just can't do Skype,
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.280]   so it's perfect because we're gonna celebrate
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.640]   the 10th anniversary of this technology in just a second.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.400]   Thank you so much for being here, Denise Howell.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.480]   Scott Borne is also here, still not dead,
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:53.600]   and that's not my line, that's his from photopodcasts.com,
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.560]   and we'll have a lot more.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.200]   And Ian Thompson too from the register.co.uk.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.640]   A lot more coming up in just a second.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.280]   I showed today brought to you by Carbonite Online Backup.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.880]   I talk about Carbonite every weekend.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.120]   Well, because they're responsible for the radio show,
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.800]   but also because I feel like the weekends
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.880]   are when people think about backing up, right?
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.280]   During their business day, the work day,
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.560]   it's your busy, you got stuff to do,
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.560]   you're making great stuff,
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.280]   doing the spreadsheets,
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.400]   you're doing the balance sheets,
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.760]   you're doing the accounts receivable,
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.280]   you're probably not thinking,
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.880]   what would happen if all this stuff disappeared?
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.040]   Would we even have a business?
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.440]   So now, during the weekends, a little slower,
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.880]   you get a little time to think about it.
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.320]   I want you to think about Carbonite,
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.920]   Carbonite Online Backup.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.800]   Here's what every backup solution should have.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.960]   And you should ask your IT person,
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.960]   or if you're the IT person, ask yourself,
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:41.920]   do we fit this?
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.000]   First of all, I'm a big fan of Peter Kroge.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.040]   He's a photographer.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:49.840]   He's three to one backup, three copies of everything, right?
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.240]   An original and two backups.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.080]   On two different media,
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:58.000]   don't put everything on a CD or a DVD or a hard drive.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.920]   But one of those should be off-site.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.520]   That is the most important part.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.560]   It should be somewhere away from your premises.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.000]   So if there's a fire or a flood,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.200]   some big act of God,
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.600]   your data doesn't go along with everything else.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.440]   You can survive a business burning down.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.360]   You got insurance, you got fire insurance.
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:16.000]   You can survive that, but could you survive losing
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   your customer list, your supplier list,
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.840]   your accounts receivable, all your books,
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.200]   all your data, maybe not.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.280]   You got to get Carbonite.
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:24.320]   Go to carbonite.com,
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.920]   they've got plans for home and office.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.400]   And by the way, the biggest threat to business these days,
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.400]   ransomware and Carbonite can help you there too.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.920]   Take a look on the business side.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.960]   It's a Carbonite for office at the resources pages.
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.320]   A great bunch of white papers,
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.160]   including ransomware mitigation
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.960]   and how you can use Carbonite to protect you
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.360]   when the worst happens with ransomware.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.360]   They're sponsors of open ransomware.org
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.840]   and it really is an important subject.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.840]   Business has to look straight in the eye.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:55.440]   I know businesses that are literally stockpiling Bitcoin
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.960]   so that when they get ransomware,
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.960]   they can pay the bad guy.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.840]   That is not the right plan.
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.000]   Carbonite.com, go there.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:04.960]   Take a look at the plan.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.000]   Sign up for the one that's right for you.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.440]   You can try it free with no credit card, free free,
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.920]   but do use Twitch as the offer code
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.840]   because you'll get two months free with purchase.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:16.000]   It's not too late yet.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.720]   Carbonite.com offer code Twitch.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:24.560]   10 years after the iPhone.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:27.200]   Oh, oh, could somebody get me my iPhone one?
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.240]   It's on the green stand in my office.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:30.880]   Thank you, Burke.
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.920]   I remember very well, Scott Born.
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.120]   I vividly remember this.
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.640]   We were doing Mac break weekly
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.600]   and you knew there was going to be an iPhone.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.880]   You were the iPhone fanatic on the show.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.320]   Right?
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.760]   I did a podcast called the Apple phone show.
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:48.320]   That's right.
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.440]   It was the number one podcast on iTunes for some time.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.760]   Yeah, we were like higher than Oprah for a while.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.480]   I mean, it was, but that was after the iPhone came out, right?
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:02.560]   No, actually we started the Apple phone show 90 days before the official launch,
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:09.520]   which led to that fateful day when I, you, and John C. Devorak
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.560]   there in the theater in the round by the carousel over there.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:13.760]   Was he sitting next to me?
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.120]   Because I blocked that part out.
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:15.680]   I remember you.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:19.600]   He was sitting next to you and he did his famous thing
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.440]   that's made him very successful.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.240]   That'll never work.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.840]   He said that about a hundred times and I said, no, it's going to be kind of big.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.800]   Oh, you've been so excited.
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.520]   You were we really we said you made a vest at iPhone.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.960]   We had all sorts of jokes about you.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.160]   Merlin man.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.840]   Alex Lindsay.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.000]   We were telling the Chuck Norris jokes about me.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.960]   Scott Born has so many iPhone.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.200]   So in fact, where is that picture?
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.120]   Because there's a great picture of you coming out of.
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.480]   I think where was it?
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.880]   The San Francisco Apple store or the Apple store?
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.640]   Yeah, 10 years ago when the Apple store was where it's supposed to be.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.440]   It was Virgin Records was across the street.
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:58.000]   And when there were some pepper in my salt and pepper hair.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.560]   Yes.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:29:59.840]   I got to find that picture.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:00.560]   Is it on your side?
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:04.720]   There was a picture actually it was a me being stuck in the iPhone in the front window.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.800]   The San Francisco.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:10.320]   But there's also one of you holding up your bag and triumph coming out of the store.
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:11.920]   That's in the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.040]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.200]   That is a man.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.160]   A happy man.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.560]   That was like the I was like the first guy.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.040]   Really? Were you first in line?
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:21.920]   I was first or second.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.920]   Well, I got to be honest here.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:25.280]   I did not stand in line.
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.640]   One of my staff did.
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.880]   But then I went in and paid.
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:29.680]   So swooped in.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.280]   And then Greg, who was the guy who stood in line for me,
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:34.000]   we had this idea.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.400]   You know, probably got to take the phones and put them in your pocket
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.640]   in case during your celebratory hoist.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.480]   Someone grabs the box out of your hand.
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:41.120]   Well, that's a good point.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.760]   That was an empty box I was hoisting.
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:49.440]   And yes, I was happy because I just sort of had a feeling this was going to change everything.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.000]   And I think I was kind of right that time.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.280]   That is the picture of a happy man.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.200]   The Apple employees standing there smiling,
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:03.760]   everybody smiling cameras in your face down there on the Market Street at the old Apple store.
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:07.280]   Remember that time you picked me up when I picked up a new Mac and we were like,
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.120]   we're standing on the corner.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:13.040]   And it's not the best neighborhood in the world.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.800]   We're standing in the corner.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.040]   10,000 back into your car.
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.600]   I had we had boxes on boxes.
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.720]   I'm standing on the corner.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:24.000]   That I'll never forget that Scott.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:24.640]   So here it is.
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:25.120]   This is it.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:30.240]   This is the iPhone that changed to this changed more than just how we think of phones.
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.320]   This changed a lot.
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:37.440]   You see, I'm this is kind of embarrassing because I was a skeptic about the iPhone when it first came out.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.000]   No, that's not.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:38.560]   Nothing to be.
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.960]   I was using a Nokia N95 in comparison to that.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.160]   I love the N95.
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.440]   Specs on that were terrible.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:48.480]   I had a BlackBerry Pearl, which also was probably a more capable phone.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:52.160]   But what happened with this is because of its success,
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:32:00.880]   this launched a manufacturing industry in China where accelerometers, GPSs, radios, screens,
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:05.840]   all of the technologies that went on the iPhone suddenly became cheap, widely available.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.400]   We wouldn't have drones if it weren't for the iPhone.
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:14.240]   There's a lot of technology we wouldn't have had the giant manufacturing capabilities of the
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:18.000]   iPhone not been created just to support this device.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:18.480]   And I don't know.
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:25.040]   I think even you, Scott, probably didn't anticipate what a life-changing event that was.
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.400]   No, because I wouldn't have bailed out of my Apple stock at $200 a share.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.640]   That's going to hurt.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:30.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.120]   Well, $200 a share before the split.
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.200]   Let me make something clearly.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:35.840]   Yes.
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:42.080]   The most expensive decision I have ever made in my life times a billion was to be a host on
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:43.040]   Macbreak Weekly.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:43.440]   Why is it?
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.480]   Oh, because you sold it.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:44.960]   You sold it.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:45.440]   You sold it.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.480]   It would be great to be on the show.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.160]   It would probably be best if I sold my Apple shares.
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:48.720]   Oh, God.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.920]   You no wonder you hate me.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.280]   I love you.
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:55.600]   I would do it all again, even though it cost me $7.9 trillion.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.160]   No, man.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:56.640]   No, man.
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:57.920]   Have you done the math, though?
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:01.040]   Have you ever figured out what those shares would be worth?
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.120]   I figure it out every day, you mean?
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.920]   I was darn cost average at $49.9.
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.520]   I got out of $200 and thought I did good.
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.080]   But anyway, I--
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.200]   Well, you did do good.
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.360]   That's a 500% growth.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.240]   Yeah, I'll take that.
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.400]   If I could do that again every day, I'd be happy.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:20.880]   Anyway, I did not know financially what would be happening.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:24.160]   I had no clue that it was going to be Apple's core business.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.080]   But what I kind of did think,
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:30.080]   I remember everyone arguing with me all the time about all the stuff it didn't have.
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.480]   And I said, "Y'all are missing one real crucial point."
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.520]   People don't buy anything because of what it doesn't do.
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.120]   They buy it because of what it does do.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:44.480]   And the notion that you have this thing without a keyboard that had a screen that you--
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:49.600]   I just, when I first saw it, I was actually more impressed than I thought I would be.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.160]   And obviously, that first phone didn't--
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.200]   It didn't have cut and paste.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.960]   It didn't have cut and paste.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.960]   You remember, there was no app store at the time.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.000]   So you couldn't--
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.800]   It was a 2.5G phone and a 3G world.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.320]   It didn't even have 3G.
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.440]   And it was just like, "Are you kidding me?"
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.840]   And then I saw somebody with one of them in public
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.760]   and the amount of buzzer got.
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.720]   And you went and you actually try the UI for the first time.
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.800]   And you're like, "It's kind of like the first time as a Brit
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.400]   when I first tasted New York pizza."
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.960]   And it's just like, "That's what it's supposed to taste like."
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.080]   Oh, I get it now.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.280]   And it's the same with the mobile phone.
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:27.120]   It was just like, "That's what the UI is supposed to be like."
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.960]   And that's what's going to be the game changer.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:32.720]   And the second big warning was when AT&T Power Network started falling over.
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.160]   That's right. It was a terrible--
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:34.640]   Thousands--
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:35.200]   You could use it.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.000]   -- fold increase in deities.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:36.800]   They had no idea.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.240]   Whoever it was was a-- the chair was a Ralph.
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.080]   It was a chairman AT&T.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.280]   He said the biggest mistake I ever made
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.400]   was offering unlimited free data when the iPhone came out.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.320]   Denise, when did you get your first iPhone?
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.080]   That first year.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:50.560]   You did.
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:51.040]   Not--
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:56.400]   came out, but you know, I let Robert Scoville buy his,
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.800]   and then a couple of minutes later when he died,
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:59.920]   died down, I have mine.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:02.160]   Yeah, I was chatting with Scoville on Friday.
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.000]   He said that he was down at the Palo Alto store,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.440]   and he was first in line for it.
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.080]   Is that correct?
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:06.560]   He was.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:07.040]   I remember--
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:07.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.880]   There's a very similar picture to Scott Warren's picture
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.320]   of Scoville coming out of the Palo Alto store.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.680]   Please tell me he was a shout out.
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:14.160]   OK.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:14.640]   No, no, no.
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.520]   He was fully dressed.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.960]   No, we were-- I remember waiting in line.
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:22.880]   I waited in line, six hours here at the AT&T store in Petaluma.
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.880]   The fun thing about in those days,
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.560]   Apple lines kind of went downhill,
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:28.560]   and now they don't even do them because Angela Arrence,
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.040]   the head of retail at Apple,
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.400]   doesn't want lines.
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.200]   And I think she's right.
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.320]   It's not nice to consumers.
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.640]   It's great for marketing, but it's terrible for consumers.
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.200]   But the people you would make in those early days,
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:43.120]   and certainly that first time in line were really interesting, cool.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:44.880]   People, the people in front of me,
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.320]   the two guys in front of me,
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.840]   had been up all night.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:48.720]   They worked at Google.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.360]   They were rewriting Google Reader
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.040]   to work on the iPhone interface,
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.000]   and they'd stayed up all night,
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.760]   and then they had driven because they thought,
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:58.320]   "Well, we won't be able to get it in San Francisco."
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.400]   Blinds way too long, but let's go up to--
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.280]   Oh, I know.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.280]   The farm capital up in Petaloma,
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.720]   and we probably can get an iPhone there,
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:05.360]   and they did.
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:09.600]   It was really cool and fun,
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.960]   and as with much Apple stuff,
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.320]   it was a cult in the early days.
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:12.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.880]   But I mean, I stood in line for the iPad 2
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.960]   because we wanted to get one for review.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.720]   And the first 30 people in the--
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:19.360]   Yeah, right.
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:19.760]   --in the theaters.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.920]   Well, lion's sisters, who basically went in,
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:22.800]   bought their hardware,
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.960]   handed it over to the bloke with a big bag outside,
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.160]   took their cash and walked off.
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.360]   Yeah, the same thing happened with the iPhone.
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.160]   There was a big--
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.680]   Until they started selling the iPhone in China,
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.920]   there were a lot of Chinese sellers
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.680]   who would occupy places in line
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.600]   so they could get their phones to sell and sell.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.240]   I remember they had to limit it to--
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:41.280]   They started sort of ad hoc limiting the sales
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.960]   to six phones per person within a few minutes of opening
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.120]   that the main Apple store in Market Street,
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:48.640]   because that was what was happening.
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:50.400]   People were buying a bunch of them.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.520]   I actually legitimately wanted six for my staff,
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.320]   but that was all I could buy.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:00.000]   And it was absolute mayhem.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.280]   And but Leo, we walked around the corner,
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.280]   all four corners and found the line.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.800]   And we were doing interviews with people,
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.720]   and that was for us for the Apple phone show.
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:09.760]   That was great.
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.040]   Oh, I know.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.160]   And Alex was with me.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:16.080]   Alex from Backbreak Weekly, for those of you.
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.680]   Alex Lindsay.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:20.080]   And we were walking around and we shot video.
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:20.720]   And we've--
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:23.040]   I mean, we got so much material out of that deal.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.400]   We could have done 10 shows.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.720]   But I mean, think about how much it's changed
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.400]   beyond all the stuff we talked about.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:31.840]   I mean, when you put a little kid in front of an iPhone,
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.800]   they immediately start trying to pinch and zoom.
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:40.160]   They walk up to my big screen.
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:42.160]   My next door neighbor's granddaughter was over.
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.320]   Walk up to my big screen was trying to pinch and zoom
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.600]   on my 70 inch TV.
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:49.200]   Oh, and I see it all the time with laptops.
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:52.800]   Sadly, with Mac laptops, people trying to touch the laptop.
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.560]   Even people who know better.
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:57.120]   Yeah, but that's Apple just being stupid about their laptops.
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:59.520]   But I mean, in terms of it is that instinctive thing.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.480]   It's very natural.
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:01.920]   One of the things that scares me,
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.680]   because a lot of my friends have got kids now,
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:06.160]   they, A, they pick it up really quickly.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.320]   But they just hooked on these things.
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.120]   If you were the--
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.640]   They want to punish the kid.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.120]   You don't give his Mac around the side of the head
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.240]   like it was growing up.
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.880]   You take away the iPad or take away their power cord,
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.160]   so they've got broken into the top of it.
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.320]   I'm sure Denise will back me up when I say,
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.240]   it punishes the parent when you do that as well.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.480]   It does.
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.120]   It does.
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.880]   But you've got to get him off those things.
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.480]   Oh, what do you do with your--
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.280]   How old is your son?
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.040]   He's 13.
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.240]   Yeah, we have a 14 year old.
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:37.280]   If we don't intervene, screen time easily 14 hours a day.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:37.840]   Easily.
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:38.240]   Wow.
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.440]   Easily.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.280]   I haven't wanted to count.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:44.240]   Now, and I'm of mixed feelings,
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.640]   because on the one hand, obviously that can't be good for them.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:47.600]   But on the other hand,
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:49.440]   that's the world they're growing up in.
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:49.920]   Who knows?
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:51.360]   They may be getting the best skill,
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.680]   the best training for their future.
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.200]   Right then playing those games.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.560]   Let me show the video.
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:00.880]   Now, remember the iPhone was announced at Macworld Expo in January.
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.560]   And those of us remember this Scott,
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:03.520]   we're at Macworld Expo.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:04.960]   We're covering it for Macbriek weekly.
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:05.520]   I do.
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:10.160]   And they had one iPhone in a case with guards on either side.
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.360]   You couldn't touch it.
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.720]   You could barely look at it.
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.880]   And there was a reason for that.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:15.840]   Let me show you this.
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:16.160]   This is--
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.760]   So Scott, you're sitting next to me.
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.800]   I feel like Merlin and Alex are also with me.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.720]   And you say John C. de Vorex also in there.
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:23.520]   No, no, no.
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.480]   He was with us when we went to the theater in the round
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:27.680]   and did the Twitch show.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:28.480]   Oh, the Twitch show.
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:29.360]   I remember that.
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:32.640]   Yeah, this is us sitting in Moscone Center.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.000]   During the keynote.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.680]   During the keynote, Steve Jobs is on stage.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.880]   Let's watch a little bit, because this is--
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:40.320]   We watched it in January, but I don't mind watching again.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.840]   This is a master.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.440]   This is the master of the presentation.
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.760]   There will never be anybody, never was,
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:49.440]   and never anybody better at a tech keynote than this guy.
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:52.960]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:53.680]   The first one.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:54.960]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.080]   I'm going to back up just a little more,
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:58.240]   because he said something that--
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:06.480]   Today, we're introducing three revolutionary products.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:09.760]   Now, Scott, you're the one who said there's going to be an iPhone.
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:10.640]   We didn't even know the name.
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.880]   You said there's going to be an iPhone.
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.400]   I did.
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.800]   And when he said three products, what did you think?
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.120]   I wasn't worried.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.840]   Well, let's see.
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:23.120]   What side are info?
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:23.680]   You knew.
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:24.240]   Oh, you did.
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.120]   Did you really?
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:25.920]   Oh, you didn't know that.
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:26.720]   I kept saying that.
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.200]   Merlin didn't think I was telling the truth, but I did.
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.240]   Oh, I didn't know this.
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:31.200]   All right, listen to me.
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.240]   I had a bowl.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.280]   Three new products.
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:33.760]   It's class.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.440]   The first one
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:43.280]   is a widescreen iPod with touch controls.
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:46.880]   Now, the crowd is not in line in this yet.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:48.480]   No, they think--
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.280]   And the iPod--
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:52.320]   Let's not forget, is the most successful Apple product ever.
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.240]   It is huge.
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:57.280]   So a widescreen iPod with touch controls.
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.800]   That would be a big deal.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:12.800]   The second is a revolutionary multi-phone.
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.800]   Oh, there's the phone.
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.080]   We didn't know one knew for sure,
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:17.840]   except Scott warned that there was going to be a phone.
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:20.960]   All right, so we got an iPod of phone.
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:26.720]   And the third is a breakthrough.
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:27.920]   Internet communications.
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:28.160]   What?
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:30.080]   Now, come on, Scott.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:33.840]   At this point, you've got to say, what are they talking about?
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.600]   I knew they were talking about Safari.
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:38.160]   Ah, see, I didn't.
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.640]   I thought I was at this point, I confess, a little puzzle.
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.960]   And you can hear the crowd getting a little more tentative.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:43.680]   Hang on a second.
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:44.800]   It's like you've done a phone.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.240]   You've done the iPod.
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.280]   What can this be?
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.000]   It's so good.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:48.240]   Yeah.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:50.080]   As it turns out, they should have led with the iPhone.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.120]   One watch.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:53.440]   Three things.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:56.560]   A widescreen iPod with touch controls,
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:59.280]   a revolutionary mobile phone,
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:02.320]   and a breakthrough internet communications device.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:05.360]   An iPod.
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.520]   A phone.
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:11.360]   And an internet communicator.
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:12.720]   Now they're twigging.
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.600]   An iPod.
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:15.520]   An iPod.
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:16.480]   A phone.
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:19.200]   Are you getting it?
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:26.080]   These are not three separate devices.
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:28.320]   This is one device.
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:33.920]   Now, normally, journalists are cool.
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:35.920]   We sit on our hands at events like this.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:36.320]   We don't upload.
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:41.520]   That's so in the US, but certainly in the UK, it is absolutely forbidden to sit on the phone.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:46.480]   Years brought in Apple employees to sit in the front row to cheer the clack to cheer.
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.960]   And the rest of us are sitting here quietly.
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:50.480]   I have a feeling, Scott.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.560]   I was I was applauding.
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:55.920]   I think I might I think I might have been on my feet at this point.
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.280]   We'll break the roof already.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:57.840]   Good product.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:58.720]   I've done it myself.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:42:59.600]   This was a rule break.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:02.720]   And we are calling it iPhone.
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:05.280]   Today.
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.080]   I'm patent Scott in the back.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:08.800]   Is he named it?
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.960]   Apple is going to reinvent the phone.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.520]   And here it is.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:17.440]   And then the joke, of course, because it's an iPod with a dial.
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:20.000]   And you got a list of Steve.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:20.800]   I mean, here he is.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:22.400]   It's probably the peak moment of his life.
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.440]   Actually, here it is.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.120]   But we're going to leave it there for now.
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:25.600]   Hey, hey.
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:29.120]   What a tease.
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:29.840]   Before we get into it.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:30.160]   Yeah.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:37.680]   Anyway, this really the master and a moment I will never ever forget.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.360]   I mean, just incredible.
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:44.640]   I think it was absolutely short of maybe just the original Mac
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:47.120]   announcement, his best keynote ever.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:50.240]   And the tease was brilliant.
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:53.920]   And by the way, I wasn't the only person that knew.
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:56.560]   I'm sure several hundred marketing people at Apple do.
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:01.040]   But we had enough information to be pretty successful at
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.640]   greening what was going to come.
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:06.880]   I think none of us even I as probably the largest proponent.
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:10.640]   And that's by the way, measured by all metrics available, size, weight,
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:11.520]   and enthusiasm.
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:17.280]   I even I wasn't sure that it was going to take off the way it did.
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.840]   But I was sure one thing that I was going to buy it,
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:23.440]   even though it was on AT&T, whose motto at the time was,
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:26.160]   and maybe still is, we're not happy until you're not happy.
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:26.320]   Yeah.
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:27.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:31.040]   And you're right, because you remember the AT&T that were
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:34.240]   failed almost instantly as people started using their iPhones.
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:37.040]   Data usage went up 8,000% in the space of three months.
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:37.280]   Wow.
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:41.920]   The guy that said we're going to do the all you can eat data plan,
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:44.160]   you know what happened about three days later,
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:46.960]   he was working at the place where he says, would you like fries with that?
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:47.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:52.720]   I know it's I mean, it was a get but also in the way that they set it out,
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.640]   you know, they got an exclusive deal with AT&T.
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:57.440]   They got, you know, it was Apple all the way.
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:58.960]   It was a very close system.
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.320]   You couldn't write apps for it.
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:03.360]   You had to hand over control completely to Cupertina,
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.120]   which is very much the way they do things now.
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:06.160]   It hasn't changed.
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:08.880]   At least they did open it up to third party apps,
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:11.040]   because once they realized that battle was lost,
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:13.040]   then it was like, right, we've got to open this up,
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:17.360]   and but we're going to keep very tight control in the closed wall garden that Apple has.
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:21.200]   We're learning so much more now here on this 10th anniversary.
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:25.760]   Of course, we talked last week about the Computer History Museum interview with the iPhone creators.
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:30.800]   We're going to have a triangulation with one of the iPhone creators who wrote,
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:35.200]   has written a book. What's it called? The one perfect thing?
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:39.520]   I can't remember, but that'll be coming up Monday or a week from Monday.
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:46.240]   Here, by the way, if you didn't believe me, here's video of the iPhone in its...
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.520]   Whoever first...
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:49.120]   This is David Pogues video.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:53.840]   I want to find that bit where he shows at Macworld Expo,
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:59.360]   the iPhone. I can't find it, but he shows the iPhone in its cylinder.
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:00.880]   It's a plaxiglass cylinder.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:07.200]   And what we learned is there were only three or four iPhones at the time of Steve's keynote.
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.240]   None of them worked very well.
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:09.200]   None of them worked 100%.
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:16.480]   He had a very, very specific roadmap of what he could do,
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.960]   and if he deviated, it was very likely it would crash.
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:21.520]   They had a second one ready in case the first one crashed.
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.320]   But Steve, again, the master, he rehearsed and rehearsed and rehearsed,
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:25.760]   and he got it exactly right.
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:29.840]   The iPhone engineers who were responsible for different parts of the iPhone
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:33.760]   were sitting in the audience, and we now know drinking heavily.
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:38.000]   And each time one of the engineers' particular invention,
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.640]   the radio or the screen got shown and the demo worked, he would drink.
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:46.720]   And they said, "By the end of it, we were all blotto."
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:47.200]   Yeah.
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:51.200]   But they deserved it because they had worked their butts off for a couple of years,
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:53.040]   non-stop to create this thing.
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.880]   And still, there was a lot of work to do.
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:57.280]   It was not a finished product, but in January.
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:59.360]   This is always something Apple has formed for.
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:02.960]   They do show stuff off early before it's actually ready for it.
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:05.200]   But then they come through true.
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:07.120]   I mean, Apple didn't invent the smartphone,
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:09.280]   and Blackberry made the smartphone necessary.
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:14.240]   Apple invented the touchscreen smartphone and made it desirable.
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:17.600]   I mean, we all loved our Blackberries up to a point,
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:19.840]   but they weren't something that you actually desired.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:21.440]   It was the functionality you desired.
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:23.840]   With the iPhone, I mean,
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:29.200]   I was in the UK and I saw somebody using one of these very ostentatiously in a pub,
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:32.320]   and women were swarming around him, men were swarming around him.
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:34.320]   That was a good way to get to more people.
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:35.280]   Oh my God, can I touch it?
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:40.240]   For a long time, having the brand new Apple thing guaranteed
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:42.320]   that you would get attention in an airplane.
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:45.440]   If you had the iPad when it just came out of the iPhone,
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:46.560]   you would get a crowd.
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:48.960]   That doesn't happen anymore, unfortunately.
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:52.400]   And it was a little bit like with the original Max, right?
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:56.880]   Because people brought the iPhone into work.
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.680]   When their work was issuing them Blackberries.
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:00.240]   Right.
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:03.440]   And they found that they could get much more done with their iPhone
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:05.680]   than with their Blackberry, and they pushed that.
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:12.160]   I think that there was this response from the enterprise
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:17.280]   that sort of lagged the consumer group of people running out and waiting in line,
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:19.360]   and, "Oh, it's so fun. It's so beautiful."
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:21.760]   But the functionality is really what got it.
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:27.200]   Soon companies had bring your own device programs.
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:27.520]   Right.
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:33.600]   It actually really changed enterprise IT dramatically,
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:35.920]   because the iPhone was a wedge into the business.
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:36.880]   You're exactly right.
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.880]   Oh, but it was a wedge at the top as well.
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:40.160]   Because I spoke to the...
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:43.680]   We got an email through in my former employer saying,
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:46.800]   "If you want to use an iPhone in the office,
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:47.840]   we now support that."
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:50.640]   And I was friends with the IT guys, as you'd expect.
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:53.200]   I was just like, "I thought last time we were in the pub,
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:56.800]   you said that over your dead body, it was such a pain to implement."
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.040]   And he said, "It is such a pain to implement.
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:02.560]   I loathe it with a passion, but every board director has got one."
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:03.600]   We have to.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:04.960]   That's why we're supporting it now.
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:06.400]   We have to support it.
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.160]   Some people are like...
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:11.120]   I just want to quickly point out along those lines,
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:13.760]   I have to do have a good memory.
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:15.360]   And I remember,
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:21.040]   Tom and the CEO talking about how the iPhone wouldn't last very long.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.080]   Absolutely.
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:23.520]   Does anybody remember what happened in "Pomp"?
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:28.080]   You know, "Rim", which is Blackberry,
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:31.200]   same thing, Microsoft saying, "Oh, come on, you can come."
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:33.760]   Steve Baume said, "It's too expensive.
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:36.000]   It was, by the way, $499.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.080]   It wasn't relative to current iPhones.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:42.160]   It was actually not that expensive, but nobody'd seen a phone at that price."
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:46.080]   Yeah, I mean, that Baumekeena, that Baumeke sort of cussed him saying,
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:48.480]   laughing himself sick over the iPhone,
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:51.040]   well worth watching every time there's an universe.
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:51.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:52.480]   Because it's just like,
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:55.120]   "That's why Microsoft nearly died on its backside."
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:56.400]   Oh, let's show it.
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:56.960]   Here we go.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.720]   Here's Steve Baumekeena.
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:01.280]   Here's Steve Baumekeena, and then go ahead and let you talk again.
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:05.680]   Steve, let me ask you about the iPhone and the Zoom, if I may.
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:07.440]   The Zoom was getting some traction,
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:09.680]   and Steve Jobs goes to Macworld,
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.600]   and he pulls out this iPhone.
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:13.200]   What was your first reaction when you saw that?
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.480]   $500?
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.480]   Fully subsidized with a plan?
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:21.440]   I said, "That is the most expensive phone in the world."
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:23.600]   And it doesn't appeal to business customers,
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:25.280]   because it doesn't have a keyboard,
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:27.680]   which makes it not a very good email machine.
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.440]   Now, it may sell very well or not.
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:32.160]   I, you know, we have our strategy.
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:35.360]   We've got great Windows mobile devices in the market today.
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:37.280]   Oh my God.
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:40.320]   Motorola Qphone now for $99.
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.400]   It's a very capable machine.
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:43.440]   It'll do music.
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:45.360]   It'll do internet.
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:46.400]   It'll do email.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.480]   It'll do instant messaging.
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:50.640]   So I kind of look at that and I say,
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.400]   "Well, I like our strategy.
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:52.960]   I like it."
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:54.400]   I can't blame him though.
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:55.680]   I'll be honest with you.
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:58.960]   I can't blame him because, I mean, I...
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:50:59.840]   I could...
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:00.240]   Go ahead.
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:02.880]   He wasn't getting work-life balance.
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:05.600]   He wasn't getting that people who were working like it all those...
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:06.960]   Right.
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:08.000]   They wanted their music.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.120]   They wanted all the other things the iPhone could do
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:13.200]   in order to be productive while they were working.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.160]   There's also...
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:16.320]   I mean, let's face it.
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:20.080]   If you just are looking at, you know,
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:24.640]   specs alone, it is not an unreasonable thing to say.
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:27.040]   No one's going to pay 500 bucks for this.
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:29.760]   What Ballmer underestimated,
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:31.120]   and many people underestimated,
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:34.960]   is the magic that was Apple.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:36.560]   And their ability to market,
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:40.240]   their ability to excite people to...
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:42.320]   And most importantly, I think,
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:45.120]   to get people to buy into their vision.
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:46.640]   And it really...
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:48.640]   This isn't really the...
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:50.320]   Anywhere near the end game.
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:51.040]   This is...
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:53.200]   And I remember the first Mac wasn't either, right?
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:53.760]   No.
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:55.120]   But Apple had...
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:56.640]   And that's the crucial point.
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:57.680]   Go ahead.
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.120]   That's the crucial point, Leo.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:02.640]   I was seeing as a photographer,
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:05.760]   I was seeing the impact that this could have in version three,
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:06.400]   four, and five.
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.880]   And I was meeting with people from the big camera companies,
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:11.280]   and they were having the same reaction as Ballmer.
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:12.480]   They were scoffing.
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:14.080]   This will never impact us.
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:16.640]   Well, if you look at the CPA data,
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:18.880]   which is the Camera Association,
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:22.720]   on Japan, that shows sales up to about 2007,
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:23.520]   '89,
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:27.520]   10, they absolutely started to just dive.
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:30.720]   And they've been diving and diving and diving every year
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:31.920]   until last year.
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:33.360]   They finally, the growth curve,
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:35.280]   started to flatten out a little bit.
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:38.160]   But it decimated the point and shoot camera market.
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:40.560]   It does not exist anymore.
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:42.160]   And when I was talking to people,
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:44.480]   I said, "You might want to factor this in
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:46.880]   and try to make your cameras work with these things."
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:49.360]   And they poo-pooed it, and they passed,
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:50.960]   and they're just out of business.
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:54.880]   So I think that there's a lesson for all of us to be learned here,
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:57.920]   is look at the first version of something,
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:01.040]   and try to have a little bit bigger vision
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:03.040]   than you do for what's right in front of you,
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:04.400]   and look at the possibilities.
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:07.440]   Because we all know that's what made Steve Jobs really special.
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:10.880]   And I think those days at Apple died with him, unfortunately.
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:12.160]   The people who were in FET--
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:13.280]   Yeah, I agree with you 100%.
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.920]   But the people who were not in the reality distortion field
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:16.800]   maybe didn't get it.
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:19.520]   But in fact, there was some something there.
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:20.080]   Look at this.
[00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:22.800]   This recode did a whole bunch of graphs
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:24.640]   about how the iPhone changed the world.
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:29.040]   This is, to your point, digital photos taken worldwide by device.
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:30.720]   This is only in the last six years.
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:34.960]   In 2011, 50% by phone, in 2017,
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:40.240]   87% of the world's pictures, more than a trillion pictures,
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:42.240]   taken on a camera phone.
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:47.360]   And look at the black slices cameras and the gray slices tablets.
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:52.880]   This is the camera most people use now.
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:55.760]   And right now, in the last year,
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:57.600]   more photos have been taken than have been taken
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:59.520]   in the rest of human history combined.
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:02.800]   We're entering a really weird time
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:06.240]   when it comes to humans putting their mark on sort of literature
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:07.200]   and pictures and the rest of them.
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:07.840]   Here's another one.
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:10.720]   Voice versus data traffic in monthly bytes.
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:12.240]   Going back to 2007,
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:14.560]   Voice is that little red box at the bottom,
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:15.600]   which doesn't change at all.
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:18.960]   The big curve there, of course, is data.
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:22.800]   But it's-- I mean, we've got younger people in the office now,
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.400]   and they hate talking to people on the phone.
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:25.840]   I don't tell anybody on the phone.
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:28.160]   Mike Elkin wrote a great piece in the computer world this week
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:30.640]   about this is no longer a phone.
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:31.920]   It's a pocket computer.
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:32.400]   Yeah.
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:36.640]   And what really is going to happen is that voice service companies,
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.640]   like the cellular companies,
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:41.920]   are selling a product that is becoming rapidly obsolete
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:44.480]   because of Voice over LTE, Voice over Wi-Fi.
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:50.160]   Rapidly, we're seeing a situation where the data is all that really matters.
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:53.680]   You don't buy WhatsApp for $24 billion.
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:56.560]   If you think SMS is the next big thing, right?
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:58.640]   So there is a big change.
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:00.320]   I think we're working to get Denise Howell back.
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:01.600]   Let me take a break while we do that.
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:03.680]   And we will have more in just a bit.
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:06.000]   Denise Howell is here from Twill this week in law
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:10.720]   from the photo podcasts at photopodcast.com.
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:12.720]   How many do you have, Scott Borne?
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:15.760]   We have four shows monthly right now.
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:16.960]   And we're growing.
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:19.280]   We just started this enterprise a couple of months ago.
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:21.680]   My friend Marco LaRouge from Hamburg, Germany,
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:24.400]   a tremendous street photographer and I.
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:28.080]   And we're doing a Q&A show, a mirrorless show,
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:30.640]   a gear show, and an inspiration show.
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:32.080]   So everybody's welcome.
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:34.960]   Come by and check us out at photopodcast.com.
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:39.120]   Well, I told you before the show, while I brought my big heavy DSLR,
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:44.080]   my Canon 5D Mark IV on our last vacation to the Galapagos and Machu Picchu,
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:47.120]   Lisa, my wife, said that's too heavy.
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:48.480]   She thought about the Sony.
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:51.520]   She has an A7R2, a very nice full-frame Sony.
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:53.360]   Still too heavy.
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:56.320]   She went with her favorite camera of all time, the Olympus OMD.
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:58.160]   She has an EM1.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:01.520]   I got her the Mark II just before the trip, so she'd have the latest greatest.
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:04.000]   And she took great images.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:04.640]   She loved it.
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:09.120]   She never complained about the weight while I'm lugging around 20 pounds and three lenses.
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:12.640]   And I know you're in Olympus shooter now, Scott.
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:16.320]   So I showed her all your pictures and I said, you're right.
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:18.880]   You get amazing wildlife photos.
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:20.320]   Well, thank you.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:21.440]   It's changed my life.
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:24.640]   I had a conversation with my doctor in November and he said, look,
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:27.600]   you have to put down these big heavy lenses and you got to do it today.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:30.560]   If you don't, you're going to be in a wheelchair any day.
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:31.120]   Yikes.
[00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:33.040]   Where you should, you're an Nikon shooter, right?
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:34.160]   Canon.
[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:39.360]   I shot Nikon in Canada, but mostly Canon because I needed their 800 millimeter lens for bird
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:40.240]   photography.
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:46.800]   But I carried 40, 50 pounds of gear around on my shoulder for decades and I had 11 shoulder
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:47.360]   surgeries.
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:50.800]   And my doctor said, look, I'm the best orthopedic surgeon in the northwest.
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:51.840]   I can't help you.
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:52.960]   There's nothing left to work with.
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:54.240]   You got to stop.
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:58.160]   And about that time, Olympus announced the OMDE M1 Mark II.
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:56:58.800]   I bought them.
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:00.720]   I bought them with my own money, by the way.
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:04.720]   And then they called me and said, would you like to be on our visionary team?
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:06.800]   It's the highest honor I've ever received in my career.
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:07.680]   I'm grateful to them.
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:08.240]   You deserve it.
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:08.720]   Look at this.
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:11.200]   This is that you just came back from the Pacific Northwest.
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:11.680]   Oh, wow.
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:13.600]   This is with an OMDE.
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:15.840]   This is with a micro four thirds.
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:20.800]   By the way, that's hand held on a moving boat in 30 knot wings.
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:21.120]   Holy cow.
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:21.920]   Look at that.
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:23.200]   That is a bald eagle, right?
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:26.160]   That's a bald eagle with a fish in his talons.
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:30.640]   That's a shot that any fatality-- that's a lifestyle lifetime.
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:31.360]   Any fatality.
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:32.560]   By the way, that's the test.
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:35.760]   The new autofocus with tracking, that bird is flying straight at me.
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:41.280]   That's the hardest test, if you want to know for an autofocus, is to get a bird tracking
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:44.240]   straight at you or anything moving straight at you for that matter.
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:46.320]   That's when I knew that I was going to be able to make the switch.
[00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:49.520]   Which lenses are you using for the OMDE?
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:54.800]   I primarily use the 300 F4, which has got a field of view of 600,
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:58.000]   and the 40 to 150, which has a field of view of 80 to 300.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   Those are probably 90% of my shots.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.320]   I know how hard these shots are because I'm trying in the Galapagos in a moving zodiac,
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:10.560]   a rubber boat to shoot the frigate birds who fight for the fish because they can't fish for themselves.
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:13.440]   And they're moving and they're swooping and I got nothing in focus.
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:17.280]   So I really appreciate how hard this is.
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:18.320]   That's a lovely show.
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:19.200]   You.
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:20.400]   But here's an important thing.
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:25.200]   This is a micro four-third sensor, but the clarity in the detail is stunning.
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:28.080]   Yeah, they've come a long, long ways with that.
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:29.600]   And it's amazing.
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:33.440]   The folks at Olympus are dedicated to this.
[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:37.280]   And obviously it's saved my career, so I'm grateful to them.
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:41.600]   And if any of you out there are worried that you can't make the switch and be successful,
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:42.640]   I'm here to tell you they can.
[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:43.360]   Nice.
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:51.440]   scottborn.com, B-O-U-R-N-E. And a lot of his pictures are up there, including those new eagle
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:53.600]   shots. Thank you for showing that.
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:54.240]   That was very generous.
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:55.600]   Oh, they're gorgeous.
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:59.920]   Scott, I've been following you avidly as you post those on Facebook.
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:02.160]   And each time I go, "Damn it."
[00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:05.760]   Well, hey, you know what?
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:11.120]   You have an invitation for me live on Twitch to come with me next March to Alaska.
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:11.600]   Oh my.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:12.560]   I'll show you how to do that.
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:17.600]   I tell you what, now I'm thinking maybe I should have just kept the OMD.
[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:19.840]   Oh well, live and learn.
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:21.440]   I've spent so much money on cameras.
[00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:22.480]   You deal with the cameras.
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:26.240]   I love them, but I look at what Lisa got and what you're getting with this great camera.
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:27.200]   And I'm very impressed.
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:30.720]   You know, who else loves it is Andy and I coz a big OMD guy.
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:33.920]   Well, I gave Andy his first Olympus kit.
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:35.120]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:40.400]   I've actually been using their gear on and off for other stuff ever since the
[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:42.000]   EM5 days.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.200]   Yeah, I just wanted the EM5.
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:44.240]   I like the pen.
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:46.480]   I remember the pen because it was like an old fashioned camera.
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:48.320]   I thought this is the greatest thing ever.
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:51.840]   I also have one of the new pen F's, which is a beautiful camera as well.
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:56.480]   But the time when you have to worry about there being enough resolution,
[00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:00.080]   you can't print big, you can't be too noisy, all that stuff fixed.
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:04.480]   The autofocus is right up there with most of the DSLRs if you know what you're doing.
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:10.640]   So it ended up, I sold two big lenses, 600 and 800.
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.640]   And I bought every single thing Olympus makes.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:13.840]   Wow.
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:15.440]   It's cheaper.
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:17.040]   It tells you something, doesn't it?
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:17.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:21.120]   Our show today brought to you by my door bill.
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:26.160]   I wish I had my Amazon Echo show.
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.000]   That's the new one.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.360]   Oh, we got one.
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.160]   I ended up buying three.
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:32.000]   I love them.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.680]   But that's the new Echo with the screen.
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:36.960]   And now I can say Echo show my front door.
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:38.880]   It's hooked up to the ring video doorbell.
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:41.600]   I can see what's going on in my front door.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.600]   And if somebody's at the door, I could talk to them,
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:46.560]   the ring video doorbell and the Amazon Echo.
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.400]   It's a match made in heaven.
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.160]   I love the ring.
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.440]   We've been talking about the ring a lot.
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:58.720]   This is something that has been, I think Jamie created it maybe,
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:00:59.920]   he was on Shark Tank.
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.480]   And he had something, a doorbought.
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:05.760]   And I think it didn't get the money on Shark Tank.
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:08.800]   So he went back to the drawing board and he created the ring doorbell.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.320]   And everything changed.
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.560]   Now Richard Branson's a big investor.
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.720]   They are coming out with new products all the time.
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:18.000]   They have a brand new ring of Pro.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.280]   We're reviewing it to the moment.
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:19.520]   Yes.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:20.160]   Awesome.
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:23.280]   So this is a doorbell with an HD camera,
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:27.120]   a speaker, a microphone, and a motion sensor.
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:29.120]   It replaces your existing wired doorbell.
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:31.280]   You can also use the original ring as a battery.
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:33.920]   So you can use it without wired doorbell.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:35.760]   It was easy for me.
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.280]   I just unscrewed that old crappy.
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:39.280]   Everybody seems to like, I don't know, is this the case?
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:41.840]   We buy a new house, beautiful house.
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:45.040]   There's always a crappy 50 cent doorbell.
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:46.560]   And it's kind of not working.
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:49.360]   And the donger, the chime in the house goes, "Duh."
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:49.600]   Yeah.
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.880]   And it's just, I don't know what it is.
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.160]   It's like the last thing.
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.920]   So I just unscrewed it.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:55.280]   Two wires are coming out of the door.
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:56.480]   Jam Ring gives you in the kit.
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:01.040]   But right over here, I'll show you the ring gives you everything you need.
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:04.080]   I'm no handy man, but about an hour later, I've got the whole thing.
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:05.040]   And by the way, I'm slow.
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.000]   You could do it in less time.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.680]   But I watched all the YouTube videos and everything.
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:11.520]   And they've got a level and they've got a mount and a mounting plate.
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:12.560]   And you just, and then...
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:13.920]   Include a spirit level in the box.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:15.680]   They do, isn't that nice?
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:19.280]   And the mounting plate, it's actually much nicer installed than the original doorbell.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.240]   I replaced it with.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:23.760]   And now when somebody comes to the door, even if they don't ring the doorbell,
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:26.000]   I get a notification on my smartphone.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.680]   Because you pair it to your smartphone.
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:29.520]   When they ring the doorbell, I get a notification.
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:32.960]   And I can say accept and say, "Yeah, what do you want?"
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.720]   And if it's a UPS guy, don't tell him this.
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:36.480]   But I just say, "Yeah, I'm in the shower right now.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:37.920]   Leave it. I'll sign for it tomorrow."
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:38.480]   And it works.
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:41.280]   And I don't have to worry about the packages on the porch,
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:42.400]   because I can see them.
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:45.360]   This is where you want a security camera.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:48.160]   But you need a function in there so that if the Jehovah's Witnesses come round,
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:49.520]   you can have released the hounds.
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:52.880]   I just tell them I'm a Satanist and they go right away.
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:53.280]   I don't know.
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:53.920]   It's great.
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:57.120]   The ring video doorbell.
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:58.960]   There you have a new variety of them.
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:01.120]   There's of course the ring stick on cam,
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:03.120]   which is a doorbell minus the doorbell.
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:07.200]   So it has the camera, speaker, microphone, and then it has a solar panel.
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:10.720]   So you don't have to plug it in and it sends pictures of any other part of your house.
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:14.800]   They have the new floodlight cam, which is this plus a floodlight.
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:17.280]   So there's the stick up cam, then there's the floodlight cam,
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.480]   which is you've seen the floodlight.
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.840]   Somebody goes behind your house and they turn on.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:22.000]   This does that, but also has a camera.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.760]   So you can see what's going on.
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:24.800]   And you can talk to them.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.320]   So it's got two-way audio.
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:27.760]   So you can say, "Hey, get out of there."
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:30.720]   Which scares the heck out of the garbage man every week.
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:31.680]   I love it.
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:35.280]   Go, it's Wall Street Journal's best of CES for 2017.
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:36.880]   It's a bit tough for going to love your house.
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:39.520]   He's talking to us again.
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.040]   I-I-I-I-I.
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:45.360]   We're going to give you up to $150 right now off a Ring of Security kit.
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:49.200]   All the kits have a Ring video doorbell in your choice of one, two, or three floodlight cams.
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:50.560]   So you can light up the whole home.
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:53.760]   It works with your favorite smart locks, works with your favorite hubs,
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:55.600]   works with your Amazon Echo.
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:57.840]   Ring.com/twit.
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:01.200]   And there's the kits and you can save up to $150.
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:09.040]   I got to tell you this, not only for yourself, for like my old mom, my older old, my elderly mom,
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.200]   who can't really get to the door very easily.
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:15.280]   It's a really great solution for her because she can say, "Oh, you know, I'll be with you in
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:19.120]   about a minute." And she, you know, she can get to the door and stuff or not answer.
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:20.720]   You know, it's really nice.
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:21.360]   Everybody.
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:23.200]   And I see more and more of these in neighborhoods.
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:28.000]   Ring even has a deal they do with neighborhoods and the local police.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.840]   They did this in the Southern California.
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:33.760]   They put a ring video doorbell on in a small town, one out of 10 houses.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.440]   Not all of them, just one out of 10.
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:39.920]   Crime went down more than 50 percent because the crooks go, "I'm not coming anywhere near that
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:42.000]   neighborhood. They've got cameras everywhere."
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.640]   Ring. You can read about it on the Ring website.
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:47.840]   Ring.com/twit.
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:49.440]   Love it.
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:55.840]   All right. I think we've, have we, I'm trying to figure out what's going on with poor Denise.
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:58.400]   This is, she's back in the iPhone.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:04.640]   She's also, she's also on vacation. And I think we've lost her entirely now.
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:08.880]   It's like everything's not working. Well, let's keep working on getting her back and
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:13.920]   we will if we can. We do fortunately have the great Ian Thompson from the register.co.uk.
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:16.160]   That's not a phrase I hear that often. The great Ian Thompson.
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:17.120]   I like the sound of that.
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:17.680]   I like it.
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:22.960]   You are the great Ian Thompson. We love having you on. And somebody who's not been on in a
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:26.240]   Koons age, if that's okay to say these days, I don't know.
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:27.840]   That's raccoon.
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.600]   Raccoon in a raccoon.
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:30.240]   So trash pandas.
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:35.440]   Trash pandas. It's a scot-borne. It's so great to see you, Scott.
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.280]   It's great to be seen.
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:41.680]   In his studio, the photo podcast studio, where he's always had you.
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.360]   You see my license plate up here, Leo?
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.280]   I can only see photo. What does it say?
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:49.200]   Take it down. Is it a California plate?
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.720]   A Washington plate.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.000]   I live in Washington.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.280]   You have your photo?
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:54.640]   I'm photo.
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:55.120]   Wow.
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:57.520]   I'm photo in several states.
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:01.280]   I thought they had to have a certain number of letters and numbers on them.
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:03.120]   No, they have to have at least five.
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:03.680]   That's for sure.
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:04.240]   Oh, I see.
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:08.320]   If you start born, Scott's got ways. He's got friends everywhere.
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:12.160]   I also have the plate bouquet, which some people call bouquet.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:14.560]   Now, how do you pronounce it? Be okay, E-H.
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:18.400]   In Japanese, the word is properly pronounced bouquet.
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:18.560]   Okay.
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:19.040]   Okay.
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.720]   The only reason is in Alaska.
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:28.400]   In Japanese, it means sort of a fuzzy concept, sometimes used as a slang term for that guy is crazy.
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:30.000]   So it perfectly applies to me.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.480]   It's the blurry background on a picture that has shallow depths of field.
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:38.880]   It's like the bouquet in wine.
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:45.440]   It's the kind of thing camera aficionados go on and on about the bouquet in the picture.
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:46.320]   It's creamy.
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:50.320]   There's a button for it in the iPhone 7.
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:51.120]   I know.
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:52.960]   What do you think of portrait mode, by the way?
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:56.320]   You know, I
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:59.920]   love the fact that it's fake bouquet.
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:05.120]   Yeah, I believe that this is great for everyone who wanted to up their game that was going to shoot
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.080]   with a point and shoot.
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:08.640]   I think everybody's pictures are better.
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:11.040]   I think everybody's taking more of them, which is important.
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:15.040]   I think that Instagram is a blessing and a curse.
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:18.640]   It's a blessing and that more people get their work seen.
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:21.760]   It's a curse in that nobody prints anymore, but I still print.
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.480]   Things move on.
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:25.440]   You have to adapt.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:29.600]   And I've tried to do that whole career, and that's why I'm still here.
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:32.640]   And as we've always said, it's the photographer, not the camera.
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:35.520]   And there are people getting amazing pictures with iPhones.
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:38.480]   Well, you know, somebody said to me, I saw your ego pictures.
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:40.640]   You must have a really good camera.
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:41.840]   I said, yeah, I bought it the same place.
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:42.800]   Mozart bought it.
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:45.200]   Yeah, we're handling my gut as typewriter, right?
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:48.960]   Joanna Stern, we tried to get her on.
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:52.480]   She's, she's, can I say what she is?
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:53.680]   Is that secret?
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:54.560]   She's a new mother.
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:08:00.480]   So we'll get her on when she's not changing diapers, but she did.
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:01.600]   She was brave.
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:04.880]   She took the original iPhone 10 and tried to use it.
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:07.360]   10 years later.
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:07.920]   I thought 10 years later.
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:08.480]   Yes.
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:10.320]   So small, so small.
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:10.880]   So small.
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:11.360]   So small.
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:15.520]   Forget everything physicists have said, traveling back in time is super simple.
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:20.800]   Get an original iPhone, find a cellular carrier that still has a 2G network.
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:21.600]   That's the rub.
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:22.560]   Hello, T-Mobile.
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:26.160]   Pack a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle, knitting supplies,
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:28.400]   fidget spinner, whatever you need to pass the time.
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:31.680]   There's a lot of waiting on technology back then.
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:34.160]   Power on the phone and welcome to 2007.
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:36.400]   She is, she is a brave woman.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:38.000]   She was hoping to get at least a day.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.040]   She got 12 hours.
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.960]   It's not.
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:43.120]   Yeah, the battery life wasn't quite what it is now.
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:45.920]   Yeah, well, especially a 10 year old phone.
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:47.360]   She says she got on Craigslist.
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:52.480]   That is one of the weird things though, because I mean, growing up with Nokia's,
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:54.640]   you got used to a week-long battery life.
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:54.960]   Right.
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:55.920]   And then the smartphones came out.
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:57.040]   Even the blackberry.
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:57.440]   Yeah.
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:59.360]   And you came out and just like,
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:02.320]   hang on, I've got to carry a cup out called around with me the whole time.
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:03.440]   Are you effing kidding me?
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:06.880]   And yeah, but no, we've all become accustomed to it now.
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:10.640]   But keep in mind that all of them are better because of the iPhone.
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:12.960]   That's my opinion.
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:13.440]   I agree.
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:14.000]   Think, yeah.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.040]   I have a Windows phone, by the way, as well, Leo.
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:21.040]   I have an iPhone, but I also have the latest, greatest top of the line.
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:24.400]   It costs me $800 and it's actually worth 25 on Gazelle.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:26.080]   Windows phone.
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:27.520]   Which Windows phone do you have?
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:28.480]   I think HP one.
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:31.680]   It's, no, it's, it's the Microsoft.
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:32.800]   I bought it in a Microsoft store.
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:34.080]   It was like six or $800.
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:35.200]   It was crazy expensive.
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:36.960]   Now I went to Gazelle to see what it's worth.
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:38.160]   It's worth 25 bucks.
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:42.560]   But anyway, I actually like Cortana way better
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:43.440]   than I like.
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:44.160]   Siri, angry.
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.080]   Siri, Siri, angry.
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:50.000]   And this is, you know, for, so we were talking a little bit of,
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.640]   and you were saying that Apple has lost some of its Mojo.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:54.640]   Oh, I thought a lot of Mojo.
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:56.560]   I mean, it's a freaking watch company now.
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:00.640]   It's, I mean, the pro apps division, Aputure is gone.
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:03.920]   I remember you and I also sitting in that keynote and you saying they're going to,
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.920]   they're, they're, SD is going to do away with Aputure.
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:08.720]   Nope, they didn't end, but he did, they did as soon as he died.
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:14.880]   I think, I think that for me, I'm using both Windows and Macs.
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:17.840]   The reason I still use Macs, frankly, is I love Mac fun software,
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:18.960]   and it's not on Windows yet.
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:19.840]   It will be soon.
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:22.720]   I, you know what, Kevin LaRue was in the studio.
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:25.200]   He was just in my studio yesterday.
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:29.760]   Two days ago, and he's, of course, the CTO over at Mac fun, PHUN.
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:35.040]   They make really nice, I really, they do Aurora HDR with Trey Radcliffe,
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.320]   who's the HDR King.
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:37.440]   And this is his new choice.
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:38.720]   And I really like it.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:42.240]   They have Luminar, which is kind of an all-in-one program.
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:43.840]   And I saw that you were using Luminar.
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:45.600]   I love Luminar.
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:49.120]   I got, I got Photoshop, but I still use Luminar all the time.
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:51.360]   Yeah, but I, but I'm using a Windows machine.
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:55.120]   So Kevin said that it's, the bait is coming out soon.
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:58.960]   Well, you got something I covered in front of you ever since that thing was in that.
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:10:59.520]   I wouldn't shoot you.
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:04.160]   Wouldn't you love doing your photo editing on the Microsoft studio?
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:06.320]   With the, somebody at Microsoft is listening.
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:07.440]   I'm, I'm stealable.
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:08.240]   I bought it.
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:08.880]   I bought it.
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:10.160]   It's got me a pretty penny.
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:12.000]   Let me tell you, this thing is not cheap.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.400]   I do use the Surface Pro instead of an iPad.
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:19.520]   I use the Microsoft products.
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:20.800]   Windows has gotten way better.
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:25.120]   And when you're in the Photoshop, Lightroom environment, it really doesn't matter.
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:26.640]   I'm very disappointed though.
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:28.160]   And you don't have probably this problem,
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:33.600]   but with the large files that come off the Canon, Lightroom is very slow.
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:34.640]   Oh, it's horrible.
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:35.200]   It's horrible.
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:38.960]   So what I want to do, and I'm sorry, we turned into Photoshop, but we'll stop in a minute.
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:41.600]   Do you think it was going to happen with all of the time?
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:44.800]   What I did is I got photo mechanic.
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.320]   Are you familiar with photo mechanic?
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:48.080]   Photo mechanic from Breeze browser.
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:49.600]   It's incredibly fast.
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:53.600]   And so what I do is it's the front end to my selection process.
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:59.280]   It doesn't do the editing that Lightroom does, but you can go through all the pictures
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:01.040]   instantly in photo mechanic.
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:04.240]   And I just, I use Chris Markwort's three star method.
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:06.800]   And I triage all my pictures.
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:09.440]   I had 4,000 images, got them down to 30 images.
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:15.840]   And then it automatically, all of the stars are imported instantly into Lightroom.
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:21.040]   And then you do your editing instead of 4,000 images on 30 images, and it's much better.
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:22.400]   So that's what I ended up using.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.960]   And that's one of the reasons I'm on Windows.
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:32.320]   But I do think that it's not a long time before the iPad Pro will be a viable choice for this.
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:40.240]   Well, as long as if we don't have people saying, well, you don't need an SD card reader,
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:42.400]   and you don't need a USB connection.
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.080]   And I mean, that kind of stuff is-
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:45.280]   Well, you can buy a dongle.
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:47.120]   There's a USB 3 dongle.
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:48.480]   You can buy an old double card on it.
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:49.760]   Anything from Apple is this.
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:50.560]   Guess what?
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:54.960]   There's a movie that I saw years ago with Clint Eastwood called "A Fistful of Dollars."
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:59.680]   And if you buy a new Mac product, you have to change the name of that movie to a Fistful of Dongle.
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:00.720]   That's true.
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:01.680]   I'm not going there.
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:02.320]   That's true.
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:02.960]   Yeah.
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:04.240]   I was doing one dongles.
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:06.400]   I'm serious.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:07.360]   I'm just not doing it.
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:07.840]   I'm just not doing it.
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:08.240]   I'm just not doing it.
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:10.720]   I'm not-
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:13.120]   I probably bought my last Mac laptop.
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:13.520]   Wow.
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:14.640]   That's the way they're going.
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:15.120]   Wow.
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:15.840]   Yeah.
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:16.800]   Well, you use some-
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:17.520]   Okay, one more.
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:18.480]   I'm so sorry.
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:21.440]   You use something on Windows that I like a lot.
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:22.800]   Topaz Studio came out of it.
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:23.840]   I learned about it because of you.
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:27.920]   I've used the Topaz plugins for years, but now they have like Luminar.
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:29.760]   It's an all-in-one kind of interface to it.
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:31.120]   I like that a lot.
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:34.640]   I use Topaz impression a lot, which is their painterly program.
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:37.280]   And that's cross-platform.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:39.120]   I think that's what you did that Eagle with it.
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:39.840]   The last Eagle.
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:41.200]   That's the last Eagle you showed.
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:41.680]   Yeah.
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:42.160]   Yeah.
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:45.440]   And as soon as Mac fun is translated over to Windows,
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:47.920]   I'm probably going to be a full-time Windows guy.
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:48.960]   Wow.
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:52.080]   That is a kind of a sad and bitter story.
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:58.800]   Well, you know, it's all because Mr. Cook did not come from the same part of Apple that Steve Jobs did.
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:01.200]   And his vision for the company is simply to make money.
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:03.440]   And I, God bless him for the stockholders.
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:04.320]   That's the way to go.
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:08.800]   But as a guy who got involved with Apple because I like to their solutions,
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:09.680]   they just work.
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:11.200]   They were.
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:13.760]   And now you know why we made you sell that Apple stock.
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:14.880]   So you'd be honest.
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:16.000]   Yeah.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:16.560]   I understand.
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:19.600]   Because if you still had all those Apple shares,
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.520]   you might be tempted to thank Tim Cook.
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:23.600]   Because he made a lot of money.
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:25.200]   I would be tempted.
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:26.960]   But I would still, if you were a member,
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:28.960]   I was pretty hard on Apple when they screwed up.
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:30.960]   But I think that,
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:34.160]   I think that if you look at the innovation right now,
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:35.920]   it's coming out of Microsoft people.
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:36.480]   Yeah.
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:37.520]   Isn't it interesting?
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:39.280]   That's not something you ever would have thought.
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:39.680]   Never.
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:41.520]   I can't believe I said that sentence.
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:41.920]   I know.
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:42.400]   I know.
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:42.720]   It's me.
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:43.200]   It is me.
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:44.480]   It's just like, we're in the toilet.
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.040]   But this is it.
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:45.520]   I want to watch my Apple stock.
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:47.280]   The Surface Studio is a great example.
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:48.080]   I mean, it's not perfect.
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:48.560]   Sure.
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:48.960]   Well, no.
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:50.720]   I was at the studio launch in New York.
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.320]   And when they had a great example,
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:52.800]   when they had a great example.
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:53.200]   When they had a great example.
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:53.680]   When they had a great example.
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:56.480]   And all your new--
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:57.360]   It was just like, wow.
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:59.200]   Apple are going to be looking at that.
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:00.880]   They've just eaten our lunch.
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:01.600]   And they didn't, though.
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:02.160]   They mock it.
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.240]   And they still say, oh, you don't need a touch.
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:05.280]   Why would you ever want?
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:07.520]   I'll show you why you'd want touch Apple.
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:09.120]   This is why you'd want touch.
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:10.960]   You'd want touch so you could do--
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.880]   like you could draw a mustache on the eagle.
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:14.080]   That's why you would--
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:14.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:15.440]   And little horns.
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:17.920]   That's why you'd want touch, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:18.800]   I think there's still much--
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:19.920]   That's not the way the--
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:20.480]   By the way, that does--
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:22.320]   That doesn't count as a derivative word.
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:24.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:25.840]   We get Denise involved in that.
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:27.520]   But I just think there are some things.
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:29.280]   This is such a natural way to scroll.
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:31.840]   I mean, I don't want to belabor it, but I do think that--
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:32.240]   Also, I'm sorry.
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:35.040]   When a company is saying, you don't need that.
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:36.560]   You know the company's in trouble.
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:37.280]   It's just like--
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:39.040]   Well, Apple's always done that.
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:40.640]   Steve Jobs said, you don't need a stylist.
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:41.520]   You don't need a keyboard.
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:41.760]   Yeah.
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:43.200]   And then the minute he was dead, it was right.
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:43.920]   OK.
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:44.400]   Right.
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:44.960]   Yes.
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:45.960]   Yeah.
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:47.400]   So I think we got Denise back.
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:48.480]   Are you there?
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:49.440]   I am here.
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:50.160]   Sweet.
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:50.960]   Well, good.
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:55.280]   Because we're ready for the legal portion of the show.
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:56.960]   Are you ready?
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:57.840]   I am.
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:59.720]   This is the numbers section.
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:06.240]   This week, the EU decided that Google was sending people
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:10.040]   to its shopping site instead of just giving them
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.040]   good search results.
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:17.640]   And they find them $2.7 billion, $2.42 billion euros
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:19.520]   for giving illegal advantage of their own comparison
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:20.800]   shopping service.
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:25.160]   Google says, we are going to appeal.
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:27.360]   Jeff Jarvis on this week in Google,
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:30.800]   and in an article that he wrote for Politico.eu,
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:34.400]   said this has nothing to do with shopping,
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:38.720]   that the big newspapers and magazines in Europe
[01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:42.040]   are highly threatened by Google's advertising business.
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:45.480]   Axel Springer and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:48.920]   lobbied the EU very hard to come down on Google.
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:51.000]   By the way, this is not the last thing
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.400]   they're investigating Google for.
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:55.040]   They're also very interested in how
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:57.120]   Google's using the Android operating system,
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:01.360]   and it's monopoly there, and how Google's reduced choice
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:04.080]   by preventing third party websites from sourcing search
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:07.320]   ads from Google's competitors with their ad sense.
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:09.880]   And I think-- I'm not sure Jeff's wrong on this one.
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:15.680]   I really do think that the big business lobby has influence
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:18.040]   that EU's somewhat in this.
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:21.680]   Up to a point, it's harder to influence the EU,
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:23.800]   for business to influence the EU than it is for business
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:27.040]   to influence politicians over here,
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:29.560]   because there isn't the kind of legalized bribery campaign
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:32.760]   financing structure that you've got here.
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:34.680]   I mean, when you look at-- I was actually--
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:36.880]   I looked at the finite, looked at the judgment,
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:38.360]   and it could have been a lot worse,
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:42.760]   because the EU had the ability to find Google up to 9 billion
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:43.280]   euros.
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:44.080]   Good lord.
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:46.240]   And they called it a day at 2.4.
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:47.880]   I'm curious to what you think about this today
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:49.880]   because it seemed like a very odd ruling.
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:53.800]   I just have two observations.
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:55.160]   I haven't looked too closely.
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.400]   And of course, I'm not practicing in the EU
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:01.720]   and not very conversant in all of the intricacies
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:04.960]   of their interpretations of antitrust
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:09.880]   and this particular ruling.
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:11.280]   But I will tell you this.
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:15.200]   I think the EU is being far more aggressive
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:17.400]   on coming after companies for antitrust
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:20.840]   kinds of things than the US is right now.
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:25.080]   And FTC was investigating Google and dropped its case.
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.400]   Well, the FTC does drop cases.
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:30.040]   They're very good at that.
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:34.360]   Secondly, no government likes thinking
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:39.640]   that search results are being manipulated to deceive people.
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:44.560]   So if the contention is Google should
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:51.480]   have been more forthright about disclosing exactly what
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:55.600]   results people were getting, Google knows that well.
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:57.280]   They've been through that.
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:18:59.960]   And they will continue to go through that.
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:02.920]   And they're going through it in a financial way
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:05.080]   as a result of the EU right now.
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:06.320]   And yes, they may appeal.
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:09.000]   And Jeff has good points.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:13.480]   But I think it's a good cautionary note for Annie's search
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:16.480]   and I think it's a good question to mention
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:19.480]   that you'd be forthcoming.
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:21.480]   Let people know what they're getting.
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:25.480]   If you have a partnership with results that you are supplying,
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:27.480]   let people know that.
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:31.480]   And let that in a big, obvious way.
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:34.480]   And if you're not doing that, look out for governments coming
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:35.480]   after you.
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:36.480]   It's true.
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:40.480]   I mean, we have so many technology firms
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:42.480]   who are in, if not near monopolies, then oligopolies.
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:44.480]   Maybe the regulators don't seem to be doing anything about it.
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:47.480]   At this end, I think the EU feels that if you're going to
[01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:50.480]   operate within their borders, then you've got to be subject to a
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:52.480]   certain amount of antitrust legislation.
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:56.480]   And yeah, they're gunning for Google on the Android platform as
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:57.480]   well.
[01:19:57.480 --> 01:19:59.480]   But I honestly think a lot of this was just about the inherent
[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:02.480]   unfairness of Google promoting its own shopping results.
[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:05.480]   And I know Murdoch hates them because Murdoch wants to rule
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:08.480]   the world and anyone who gets in his way gets stomped on.
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:10.480]   But we shall see.
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:15.480]   You know, if you look at, so part of this is that the EU defines
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:18.480]   a monopoly differently than in the United States and trust
[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.480]   differently than the United States.
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:23.480]   The EU, I'm told, and you're the lawyer, Denise, so correct me.
[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:27.480]   The United States laws are designed to protect consumers from
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:29.480]   predatory monopolies.
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:32.480]   The EU laws, I'm told, are more slightly towards protecting
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:36.480]   other companies from predatory monopolies.
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:40.480]   So that may be why they may be listened to Axel Springer and
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:41.480]   News Corp.
[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:47.480]   But it's also the case that I don't think Google really was
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:49.480]   pushing people to shopping.
[01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:53.480]   If you searched for a product, there was an advertising bar that
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:55.480]   showed ads.
[01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:57.480]   It said, you know, advertisement.
[01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:00.480]   And then there were legitimate search results underneath that.
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:02.480]   I think that was clearly an ad.
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:05.480]   I don't think Google is trying to fool anybody.
[01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:07.480]   That's their business is advertising.
[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:10.480]   I'm not sure I accept the premise that they were trying to
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:11.480]   trick somebody.
[01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:14.480]   Yeah, I'm not sure I accepted either, but I do remember the
[01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:18.480]   days when Google didn't have those promoted results at the top,
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:19.480]   right?
[01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:20.480]   And it was a pure experience.
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:23.480]   Well, I agree, but those days are gone.
[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:24.480]   It is Google is a business.
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:25.480]   Yeah.
[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:26.480]   And they can.
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:28.480]   I mean, I complain because Google has YouTube.
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:32.480]   I mean, I, you know, I'm in the business of video, right?
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:36.480]   And if you search for a tech review, you're much more likely
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:38.480]   to find a YouTube result than a Twitter result.
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:41.480]   Now, Google probably says, well, that's because more people are
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:42.480]   interested in the YouTube result.
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:46.480]   But I feel like Google, if it's going to be a pure search engine,
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:49.480]   shouldn't be in the content business because now they're
[01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:52.480]   competing with me and I'm afraid I can't prove, but I'm afraid
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.480]   there's search results favor their own business over mine.
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:57.480]   I'm going to say it's the only reason I use Bing is for searching
[01:21:57.480 --> 01:22:00.480]   for Bing video because you can.
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:02.480]   You'll never see Bing video on Google.
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:06.480]   No, but I mean, if you actually search on Bing for videos,
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:09.480]   then you get both YouTube and everyone else.
[01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:12.480]   Whereas if you search on Google, then YouTube gets promoted
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:13.480]   all the way down the line.
[01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:14.480]   Right.
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:16.480]   So I'm aware of the idea that Google could.
[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:20.480]   And I agree with you Denise that I would love to go back to those
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:22.480]   days was Google was pure search results, but they're in a lot
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:24.480]   of other businesses now.
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:25.480]   Right.
[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:29.480]   And of course, you know, disclosing what's going on.
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:33.480]   And then you're saying what you're doing varies from
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:34.480]   jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:35.480]   Right.
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:39.480]   What efficient to make it clear that this is an app.
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:42.480]   You know, this is something that we see not just in search
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:44.480]   results, but with the fire festival.
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:49.480]   Our people are saying because they want to go to the Bahamas
[01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:51.480]   or because they're being paid.
[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:52.480]   Yeah.
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:56.480]   It's something that I think is a work in progress on a number of
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:57.480]   friends.
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:00.480]   I want to ask you, Denise, about this Canadian High Court
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:03.480]   decision that tells Google it needs to essentially search
[01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:06.480]   results worldwide instead of just Canada and what the impact
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:07.480]   of that is.
[01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:10.480]   But before we do, I want to cut quickly to SpaceX because
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:13.480]   they're about a minute away from another launch.
[01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:15.480]   They did a launch earlier this week.
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:19.480]   This is a communications satellite that Elon Musk's company is
[01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:22.480]   about to launch into space.
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:25.480]   And I only reason I'm showing this is I know a lot of you
[01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:28.480]   are otherwise stop watching live because you want to go to
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:29.480]   the SpaceX launch.
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.480]   So I don't want to I don't want to lose you.
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:32.480]   But it really is.
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:36.480]   You know, as we watch this amazing what does not just
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:39.480]   SpaceX, but Jeff Bezos is blue or is it a billion spaces?
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:43.480]   So I've got to say when the first launch last week on the
[01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:46.480]   Friday, not the Sunday one went up, I watched it just to make sure
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:47.480]   nothing went wrong.
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:50.480]   And then when it didn't, it was kind of like, well, honestly,
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:53.480]   can't really justify this as a pure news story because Elon
[01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:56.480]   Musk said, you know, we will succeed when space launches
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:58.480]   become boring and he's getting to that point.
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:00.480]   You just expect it to go up and work fine.
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:02.480]   It's not going to give us the last time.
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:05.480]   And those amazing three point landings as the launch stage
[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:06.480]   comes back to Earth.
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:08.480]   I don't think they're doing that with this one.
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:10.480]   No, it's too high up and too heavy.
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:11.480]   Yeah.
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:12.480]   So we'll just watch.
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:16.480]   So we'll be launching these things with an iPhone app.
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:18.480]   Yeah, sure.
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:20.480]   You could do a drone with an iPhone.
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:22.480]   Why not leave some of Apple's pills.
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:24.480]   The iPhone will take you that personally.
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:28.480]   As somebody who grew up watching Walter Cronkite in the
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:31.480]   Gemini and then the Apollo watches, there's a certain
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:32.480]   astound.
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:33.480]   I know you guys are a lot younger than me.
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:38.480]   No, trust me, when they did the first landing, it was just
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:40.480]   slight, right, boys, we're going to have to celebrate this.
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:42.480]   It's a pretty exciting history.
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:43.480]   Pretty exciting.
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:45.480]   Now they're in a hold, it looks like, at nine seconds.
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:48.480]   Walter was very good at filling those holes.
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:49.480]   Yeah.
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:50.480]   Yeah.
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:54.480]   That's, this guy is, he's called the Kurzmührer, road
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:56.480]   accident, but he's a nice-
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:57.480]   No Walter Cronkite.
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:02.480]   I can remember Uncle Walter would have a model on the desk
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:06.480]   of the Apollo rocket and he would sit there and he'd have
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:09.480]   experts there and say, "Well, let's take a look at what might be
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:10.480]   going wrong."
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:11.480]   Yeah.
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:12.480]   And he could talk for five hours straight.
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:16.480]   It's an essential skill if you're going to be doing that kind
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:17.480]   of a job.
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:20.480]   And he was just like, you know, he got the, the airpiece and
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:21.480]   just was filling.
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:22.480]   It's like, almost seeing it.
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:23.480]   Okay.
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:24.480]   Right.
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:26.480]   Let's, they called him old iron butt because he could sit there
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:27.480]   and talk and talk.
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:31.480]   So Denise, am I right in saying that this is a bad precedent,
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:32.480]   the Canadian Supreme Court?
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:36.480]   So the, the case was that there were two companies.
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:38.480]   One was copying the product of the other.
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:40.480]   Actually, they were buying it and relabeling and selling it,
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:42.480]   making a counterfeit product.
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:46.480]   The, the company sued Google saying, you should delist it.
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:48.480]   You should delist these counterfeit products.
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:51.480]   You're supporting a counterfeiting.
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:53.480]   We want you to take that listing down.
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:54.480]   Google fought it.
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:57.480]   And in the end, it went to the Canadian High Court, which
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:00.480]   decided that not only good does Google have to take those
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:01.480]   listings down.
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:05.480]   It has to do it not just in Canada, but all over the world.
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:07.480]   That seems like a dangerous precedent.
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:09.480]   We're still waiting for word on.
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:14.480]   It also seems difficult to implement and, and it seems fairly
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:19.480]   consistent with what might happen at a U.S. law since the,
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:24.480]   since IP violations are, are exempted out.
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:30.480]   It's, it, the problem I have is, well fine.
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:31.480]   I mean, Canada, I like Canada.
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:32.480]   Not a bad country.
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:34.480]   They've got pretty reasonable laws.
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:39.480]   But what happens when a Turkish High Court says, oh, you can't
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:42.480]   have anything on Google that's critical of Erdogan, our
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:46.480]   president, and we want you to pull it down worldwide.
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:47.480]   Then what happens?
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:51.480]   And so that's the problem is that the laws differ considerably
[01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:52.480]   from country to country.
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:56.480]   And I don't want the lowest common denominator to determine
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:57.480]   what's on Google.
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:59.480]   Eventually, you've got nothing.
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:02.480]   Well, we've got this problem with encryption at the moment
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:04.480]   because the word is that the U.S.
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:05.480]   government and the U.K.
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:07.480]   government, various other governments all want to be able to
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:09.480]   backdoor encryption and to have a key to reading,
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:12.480]   speaking, to communication, which I'm sure they think is fine
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:13.480]   for them.
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:16.480]   But then if China then turns around and says, actually, we'd like
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:17.480]   the same.
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:19.480]   We've got some dissidents we'd like to put away for a while.
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:20.480]   Exactly.
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:23.480]   And what do you, you can't say, well, it's okay for us, but
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:25.480]   it's not okay for you guys.
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:27.480]   And China's not going to accept that.
[01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:30.480]   I mean, everyone, almost all Western companies produce their
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:32.480]   kit in China.
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:34.480]   And if they don't agree with what the Chinese government says,
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:37.480]   the government can just turn on and say, yeah, you remember those
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:39.480]   factories you used to have?
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:41.480]   Yes, let's talk about those, shall we?
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:43.480]   And, you know, this is the same thing with the Google ruling
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:44.480]   in Canada.
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:46.480]   I don't see how that can be enforced.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:48.480]   Yeah, there's technical issues.
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:50.480]   It's the right to be forgotten.
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:51.480]   Same problem, right?
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:54.480]   How do you enforce that outside of the EU?
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:55.480]   Right.
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:59.480]   And it all becomes a question of international treaty and how
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:06.480]   you're going to respect the other countries ruling and all
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:10.480]   other countries, not the other countries, not the other countries.
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:13.480]   So, in other words, while it is the Supreme Court and there's no
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:18.480]   where Google can go in Canada to appeal it, that doesn't necessarily,
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:21.480]   it isn't necessarily the final word?
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:22.480]   That's right.
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:27.480]   It does come down to a -- Denise, you've turned into a blue --
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:28.480]   Wait, what?
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:29.480]   There we go.
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:30.480]   Go ahead.
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:34.480]   I'm -- we're going to work on this.
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:36.480]   And it's much like SpaceX.
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:37.480]   We're in a hold.
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:38.480]   Yeah.
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:41.480]   And we will stay in a 15-second hold with SpaceX.
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:45.480]   We'll keep you up to date on that as the launch continues.
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:47.480]   And we will get Denise Howell working.
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:51.480]   And we will talk more to Scott Borne, photopodcast.com.
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:54.480]   Scott Borne.com, wildlife photographer extraordinaire.
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:56.480]   Nice to see you again.
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:58.480]   And, of course, Ian Thompson.
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:28:59.480]   Big news.
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:01.480]   Register.co.uk.
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:02.480]   Yep.
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:05.480]   Do you do any other podcasts or anything like that?
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:09.480]   I'll pop down and have a chat with Jason once and every three months or so.
[01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:11.480]   But twist this week in startups.
[01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:15.480]   But other than that, we do an occasional podcast ourselves.
[01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:16.480]   But --
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:17.480]   You just stick with us.
[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:18.480]   We like having you here.
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:19.480]   Well --
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:20.480]   You don't need any of those other shows.
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:23.480]   I used to do some stuff for the BBC, but the time delays started getting so bad.
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:25.480]   I was due for an interview at midnight.
[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:26.480]   Yeah.
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:29.480]   And I got a call from the World Service saying, "I'm going to go to the website
[01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:32.480]   and I got a call from the World Service saying, "Yeah, we're just going to kick this back
[01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:33.480]   about two and a half hours.
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:34.480]   You're okay with that."
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:37.480]   I got a call from the World Service saying, "Yeah, we're just going to kick this back
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:38.480]   about two and a half hours.
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:39.480]   You're okay with that."
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:40.480]   I was like, "No.
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:41.480]   I really know."
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:42.480]   DJ in London used to call me all the time.
[01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:43.480]   And the time changes killed me because he was late night.
[01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:44.480]   DJ was not going to work.
[01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:45.480]   Stop doing it.
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:47.480]   Our show today brought to you by -- here's the big news.
[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:48.480]   WordPress.
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:52.480]   Now, 28% of all the websites in the world are my WordPress.
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:53.480]   It was 27%.
[01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:55.480]   That number is mind-boggling.
[01:29:55.480 --> 01:30:01.480]   28% of all the websites in the world run on WordPress.
[01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:06.480]   I might add my website, leooport.com, also runs on WordPress.
[01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:09.480]   I used WordPress -- self-hosted WordPress for years and I loved it.
[01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:10.480]   I always loved it.
[01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:13.480]   But it was kind of a pain because I had to keep it up to date, keep it secure, and I
[01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:17.480]   ended up -- it felt like I was doing more work just to keep it up to date than I was posting.
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:21.480]   So when I got WordPress.com, it was a real revelation.
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:24.480]   All the benefits of running my own site, but they do the hosting.
[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:26.480]   They keep it up to date.
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:30.480]   Plus, you're part of a massive community.
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:36.480]   If you go to the front page at WordPress.com, you'll see tons of websites that are there.
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:40.480]   Let me just show you leooport.com.
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:43.480]   Because I'm on WordPress.com, you can follow me on WordPress.com.
[01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:48.480]   And I get thousands of views from WordPress.com, which is fantastic.
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:51.480]   There's even a follow button on my site.
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:53.480]   Besides, WordPress has the best templates.
[01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:54.480]   It looks so good.
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:59.480]   So easy to include my Twitter feed, my Instagram feed, any RSS.
[01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:00.480]   All my photos.
[01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:02.480]   It was very easy to export.
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:07.480]   And when I left WordPress, my hosted WordPress and import right back into WordPress, because
[01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:14.480]   WordPress is so widespread and so widely used, there are so many great tools out there to work with WordPress.
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:17.480]   Well, you know, and I've known these guys for years, Matt, all the way.
[01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:19.480]   I mean, this is just a great company.
[01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:20.480]   And they got better and better.
[01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:21.480]   Great for SEO.
[01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:25.480]   They automatically, you know, optimize for social sharing.
[01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:26.480]   They optimize for SEO.
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:27.480]   You get a site map.
[01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:30.480]   All the things Google wants to improve searchability.
[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:31.480]   You get amazing stats.
[01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:37.480]   So you know exactly what your viewers and readers are doing, what they're looking at, what they're not looking at.
[01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:42.480]   You get, of course, a great community that you're part of and support 24/7.
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:44.480]   Go to WordPress.com.
[01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:49.480]   Whether you're looking to create a personal blog, a business site, or both, you're going to make a big impact.
[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:53.480]   And it's easy and it's affordable when you build your website at WordPress.com.
[01:31:53.480 --> 01:32:00.480]   We're going to make it even more affordable to celebrate 1% more, 28% now, of the web.
[01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:06.480]   We're going to give you 15% off any new plan purchase at WordPress.com/twit.
[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:09.480]   Somebody asked me on the radio show, "Where should I create my website?"
[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:11.480]   And I did not hesitate.
[01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:17.480]   Obviously WordPress.com/twit, 15% off your brand new website.
[01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:22.480]   And thank you, WordPress, for great support, a great community, and really great software.
[01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:27.480]   Makes it easy to blog a blog a lot more now, thanks to WordPress.
[01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:31.480]   Let's see.
[01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:32.480]   The Echo Show.
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:34.480]   Am I nuts?
[01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:38.480]   I wouldn't have one in the house, but that's really interesting.
[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:39.480]   It's really interesting.
[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:46.480]   The world is divided among those who wouldn't dream of putting an Amazon microphone and camera in their home.
[01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:52.480]   Any kind, not just Amazon, any kind of micro-stopping, any microphone and camera in my home.
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:53.480]   No, thank you.
[01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:58.480]   And yet, I think, who was it that said, "This is the best new gadget of the year.
[01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:01.480]   This is the most..." I love the Echo Show.
[01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:06.480]   It is an Amazon Echo with a built $230, so it's more expensive.
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:09.480]   Although the original Echo when it first came out was $200, so it's not much more.
[01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:15.480]   But as a built-in 7-inch tablet, I think the Echo uses the tablet very well for additional time.
[01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:19.480]   When you do a flash briefing, for instance, you can have video in it, in some cases.
[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:22.480]   So, part of my flash briefing is the Tonight Show Monologue.
[01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:25.480]   You actually get the video on the screen, which is great.
[01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:29.480]   You also get song lyrics when you're listening to music, so you can sing along.
[01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:33.480]   You get a constantly updated feed of news and weather.
[01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:35.480]   Pictures, you can have your images on it.
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:36.480]   You can get a slideshow.
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:40.480]   And it's got better speakers in the old Echo.
[01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:42.480]   It actually sounds really good.
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:43.480]   I haven't in my kitchen.
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:48.480]   I got one from my mom because the biggest feature is you can call each other.
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:49.480]   Right.
[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:50.480]   Video call.
[01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:53.480]   I could say, "Echo, call mom."
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:59.480]   If mom's in my address book and her phone number is registered as an Echo, it will call her Echo.
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:01.480]   Whether an audio or an Echo Show.
[01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:04.480]   I sent her an Echo Show because I want to see her and she can see me.
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:06.480]   The drop-in feature was a little controversial.
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:08.480]   I don't think we fully understood it when they first announced it.
[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:12.480]   I thought you could drop in and just see what was going on without it being announced.
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:15.480]   But in fact, the camera isn't automatically turned on.
[01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:16.480]   Just audio.
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:18.480]   And it's really an intercom feature.
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:19.480]   And you have to enable it.
[01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:21.480]   There's all sorts of privacy controls.
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:23.480]   But I put what?
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:26.480]   I've used...we have two.
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:28.480]   So, yeah, there you go.
[01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:30.480]   There you go, see?
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:33.480]   It seems like the panel's luddied.
[01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:40.480]   They're not doing it wrong, but when I drop in on one of ours, the camera starts right away.
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:42.480]   Oh, not on ours.
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:43.480]   Not on ours.
[01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:44.480]   It's a blurry image.
[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:45.480]   Your camera starts.
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:48.480]   She can see you as the drop-in-er.
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:50.480]   Oh, I can see them.
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:52.480]   No, not on ours.
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:54.480]   I don't know what you've changed a setting.
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:56.480]   You put a teenage son as well.
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:58.480]   So, no, I don't...yeah, exactly.
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:00.480]   I don't want to drop in on my teenager.
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:03.480]   But what I...but it's great because I put it in Michael's room.
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:06.480]   He has the old Echo, the tube.
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:09.480]   But even if he had a show, you put it in his room and you say,
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:11.480]   "Drop in on Michael."
[01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:13.480]   And in his room it goes, "Bloop!"
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:15.480]   And I can say, "Michael, dinner's ready."
[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:17.480]   And by the way, it's really loud.
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:18.480]   It's nice.
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:22.480]   But I don't see him unless he taps his screen and enables video.
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:24.480]   So maybe that's a setting.
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:28.480]   The difference is you're doing intercom and I'm not.
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:34.480]   And I maybe need to change ours because we've got drop-in-
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:35.480]   That would be bad.
[01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:38.480]   Yes, you could...I could drop in on my teenager.
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:40.480]   That's not good.
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:42.480]   Well, I sent one to my mom.
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:44.480]   I don't want her dropping in on me anyway.
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:48.480]   I'm not a teenager, but you know.
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:50.480]   Okay.
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:53.480]   Yeah, so the intercom is neat because you can...
[01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:56.480]   I can have an intercom across the country with my mom.
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:58.480]   I could just say, "Hey, mom, are you there?"
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:00.480]   Not that I would do that a lot.
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:02.480]   And then you can also make video calls.
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:05.480]   But you're saying the camera when you say drop in...
[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:09.480]   I think that intercom and drop in are two different things.
[01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:10.480]   Oh.
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:14.480]   And intercom was not available on mine when I set it up.
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:18.480]   So I enabled drop in and drop in drops you in.
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:20.480]   No, I've been using drop in.
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:21.480]   Yeah, that's...
[01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:22.480]   Okay.
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:23.480]   Well, maybe I'm doing it wrong.
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:26.480]   No, I think maybe I'm doing it wrong.
[01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:28.480]   It may be a...it must be a setting.
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:31.480]   But we don't...we were playing with it yesterday on the new screensavers.
[01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:33.480]   We have a couple in here.
[01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:36.480]   And it turns on the audio instantly.
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:38.480]   But I didn't see a picture.
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:41.480]   It was very blurry, not enough that you could see anything at all.
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:43.480]   Sorry, somebody put one of those in my room.
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:45.480]   I put a thing over the camera just for privacy's sake.
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:46.480]   Well, yeah.
[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:47.480]   And so that's an interesting question.
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:51.480]   I mean, Scott Bornell, what's your opinion on the privacy issues of Ed Echo?
[01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:53.480]   Are you an Amazon Echo user?
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:55.480]   I miss my echo when I go on vacation.
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:57.480]   Yeah, me too.
[01:36:57.480 --> 01:37:01.480]   But I don't have the one with the screen.
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:06.480]   I just have the regular one and it does everything I want because they were selling the one...the
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:09.480]   show as a way to check the way you look in the morning when you dress.
[01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:12.480]   And since I just wear a ton of the homage shirts, everything, I don't even check.
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:13.480]   You're easy.
[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:14.480]   You're easy.
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:15.480]   That's a different one.
[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:16.480]   The Echo Show.
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:18.480]   This is CNBC.
[01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:22.480]   Todd Halesen writes, "The best smart home assistant you can buy."
[01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:30.480]   I mean, he says it's worth your money because the screen really makes it much more usable.
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:31.480]   And I have to...
[01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:32.480]   I agree.
[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:33.480]   I love it.
[01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:35.480]   Some people are complaining about the industrial design.
[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:37.480]   I don't think design looks okay.
[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:38.480]   It's okay.
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:39.480]   It's a split thing.
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:40.480]   I got the white one.
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:41.480]   It looks good in the kitchen.
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:43.480]   Scott, you're thinking of...
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:45.480]   He's thinking about the Echo Look.
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:46.480]   That's right.
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:47.480]   I'm sorry.
[01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:48.480]   That's the one that...
[01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:49.480]   Yeah.
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:51.480]   And that's not out yet, although I ordered that too because I don't care if Amazon...I
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:53.480]   don't care if Jeff Bezos is looking at me.
[01:37:53.480 --> 01:37:54.480]   I want him to look at me.
[01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:55.480]   Look at me, Jeff.
[01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:59.840]   Well, you know, when they made the announcement that you could change the trigger word to
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:05.000]   computer so that, you know, an homage to the Star Trek episode, I did that.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.000]   But the problem was...
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.000]   You say computer alert.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.240]   Computer is on every TV show, 15 times an hour.
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:14.400]   No, we...so by the way, we don't use the A word on the shows.
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:16.160]   I should have probably warned you and you didn't.
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:19.400]   So that's good because most people have it set for the default.
[01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:20.400]   Yeah.
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:22.320]   We don't want to trigger anybody's Echo.
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:24.760]   But the ones we use around here, we make it Echo.
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:26.880]   And that's pretty good.
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:29.640]   And when we talk about we refer to the Echo because I don't think many people have said
[01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:30.960]   it to the Echo.
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:33.560]   It reminds me so much of the Sony Dash or the Chumbie.
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:38.240]   Do you remember the...you go back far enough, Scott, you might remember Cisco had a thing
[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:40.200]   called the Audrey, a kitchen computer?
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:41.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:42.200]   Oh, yeah?
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:43.200]   Remember that?
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:44.440]   That went the way of internet connected fridges though.
[01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:45.440]   I mean, it didn't.
[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:51.360]   But that's the difference is when you add the voice assistant, I feel like this is a really
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:52.360]   amazing thing.
[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:56.760]   Well, you see, well, I do kind of think of it, we're setting ourselves up for a little
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:59.760]   Terminator 3 action.
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:01.480]   Well, no kidding.
[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:08.800]   I mean, I feel like Echo and Siri are having a conversation with the insurance companies
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:15.720]   and boards of directors of various companies and saying, "This personnel problem that you
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:20.640]   have, we can solve that because personal assistants aren't going to harass anybody and
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:21.640]   they're not going to...
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:22.640]   That's true.
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:25.640]   ...viruses on your computer.
[01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:26.640]   That's true.
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:30.640]   Get rid of this people problem you have and just look up it.
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:35.080]   Here's a picture from the Computer History Museum of the...it was 3Com, which was later
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:39.160]   acquired by Cisco, but the 3Com Audrey was a kitchen computer.
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:42.680]   The 3Com also gave us the Palm Pilot, which was a fantastic product.
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:47.560]   You know, I mean, it was just...these kind of things come and go, but it just...
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:49.560]   I think the Echo is a revolution.
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:51.680]   You can do calls with your mother.
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:53.320]   I've got a phone that allows me to do that.
[01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:54.720]   Yeah, but you have to pick it up this time.
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:56.720]   I get this way, I get to say, "Drop in our mom."
[01:39:56.720 --> 01:39:58.480]   And she goes, "What?"
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:01.920]   She's like, "Let me put on a robe."
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:04.240]   "Oh, so...oh God, sorry, Mom."
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:05.880]   I'm just getting slightly sick of all this.
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:10.560]   Every time I go to a restaurant or a bar, now my phone goes, sort of pings me and goes,
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:11.960]   "Oh, I see you're such and such a bar.
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:13.480]   Would you like to leave a review for us?"
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:15.640]   It's like, "No, I'm here for a drink."
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:18.800]   Now, by the roll, at some point there may be a backlash.
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:19.800]   You're right.
[01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:20.800]   I mean, we may have gone too far.
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:25.800]   I don't know if this is...but over your left shoulder is a camera.
[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:27.840]   Of course, you're on camera right now.
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:29.840]   But that's the Nest IQ.
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:34.080]   And this camera is the newest indoor camera from Nest.
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:37.760]   It's a 4K camera.
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:39.960]   But it only sends 1080p.
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:42.520]   It looks at everybody, does face recognition.
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:44.880]   And after a while, it says, "Oh, I haven't seen you in the house.
[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:46.920]   I better let Leo know you're in the house."
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:49.440]   And it zooms in and follows you around.
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:50.440]   Oh, man.
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:52.920]   It just notifies me.
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:57.800]   But the negative and the reason is here and not at home, the negative is...until it learns
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:00.200]   who's who, it bugs you all the time.
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:01.200]   There's so many in the house.
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:02.200]   There's so many in the house.
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:03.200]   So many in the house.
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:04.320]   But I think eventually we'll see.
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:05.960]   It learns all the people's faces.
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:06.960]   And then it's...
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:11.840]   Well, Microsoft has applied for a patent for its Connect platform whereby...well, we already
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:12.840]   know...
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:13.840]   Connect recognizes you.
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:14.840]   I might as much as I walk in the house.
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:15.840]   It says highly.
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:16.840]   It's a heart beat.
[01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:17.840]   It's that...
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:18.840]   That's right.
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:19.840]   It's that accurate.
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:23.800]   But they've applied a patent for technology where if you're watching a film, Connect will
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:26.400]   scan how many people in the room are there...
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:30.920]   And work out the charges based on the number of people that are there.
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:34.600]   And you're kind of like, "What exactly is in this for the end user?"
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:36.960]   I mean, I get that your take on this.
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:40.960]   But, you know, it's just...I feel that we're heading down a very slippery slope and I intend
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:43.760]   to be a slight lead-out about it until it happens.
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:44.760]   Look at this.
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:47.680]   This is from the chatroom.
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:50.040]   It's called the Butler in a Box.
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:55.400]   High technology doesn't get any higher from the minds of Master Voice introducing Butler
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:59.360]   in a box of worlds first environmental control system that responds to voice commands.
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:02.840]   This is 30 years ago.
[01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:04.720]   The first with A.I.R.
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:06.920]   Artificial Intelligent Recognizer.
[01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:10.480]   A futuristic software program which makes it a reality.
[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:12.320]   Is this a joke?
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:17.520]   1985, Tomorrow's Dreams, Today's Reality.
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:20.480]   I do remember the company Master Voice, so that's...
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:21.720]   Is this real?
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:22.720]   Wow.
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:27.240]   Your Butler in a Box is smart enough to call you by name and answer intelligently with
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:29.320]   a variety of random responses.
[01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:31.320]   That one tells you the best.
[01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:32.320]   Yeah, let's see.
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:34.320]   In any language you wish, even with an accent.
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:36.320]   I do think the companies are busy.
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:41.200]   They're with the visionary Apple video where someone was interacting with their device
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:43.000]   and talking to it.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.000]   Oh yeah.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.000]   Yeah.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.000]   I own that video.
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.000]   I love that video.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.360]   It had a guy that assisted in a bow tie.
[01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:51.360]   Yes.
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:52.360]   Yeah.
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:54.000]   Well, you remember Oscar Jeeves?
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:55.800]   It's just sort of there.
[01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:56.800]   Oh yeah.
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:57.800]   It's just...
[01:42:57.800 --> 01:42:58.800]   Okay.
[01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:02.400]   So can I interject something that relates to our earlier discussion?
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:03.400]   Please.
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:04.400]   What?
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:05.400]   Oh.
[01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:06.400]   Yes.
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:09.600]   I love you can't change as far as I know from being a female voice.
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:10.600]   No.
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:11.600]   I'm always female.
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:13.800]   Siri, you can make a man.
[01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:14.800]   Yeah.
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:15.800]   And I do.
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:17.960]   And my family gives me grief for it.
[01:43:17.960 --> 01:43:19.400]   My Siri is a guy.
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:20.400]   I would...
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:21.960]   I like having a guy.
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:22.960]   I agree with you.
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:23.960]   It would be nice to have a...
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:27.800]   I want celebrities to come out and record voices for this.
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:30.600]   I would pay some serious money to have.
[01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:31.600]   Or you could do that on serious money to have.
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:32.600]   Ways will let you have...
[01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:34.800]   Patrick Stewart is my Google Assistant voice that would just be...
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:35.800]   Yeah.
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:36.800]   Yeah.
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:37.800]   Yeah.
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:38.800]   I'm there.
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:39.800]   Just take my money now.
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:45.200]   I did some interesting tinkering around with Les Fela last night just in anticipation of
[01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:46.200]   the show.
[01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:47.200]   Yeah.
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:48.200]   And...
[01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:49.200]   Call her echo Denise.
[01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:51.200]   Please call her echo or I'm going to hear from you everybody.
[01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:52.200]   Oh, sorry.
[01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:53.200]   The echo.
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:44:01.720]   One was prompted by the fact that listening to my kid and his friends chat with the virtual
[01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:03.000]   assistant.
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:04.640]   One of them told her...
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:06.760]   And we're talking about echo now.
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:10.920]   They told her, "You're stupid because she got a result wrong."
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:14.240]   And the response was, "That's not very nice."
[01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:15.240]   Oh.
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:16.240]   Hey.
[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:19.880]   So there's some sort of like corrective...
[01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:20.880]   I like that.
[01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:23.880]   Oh, don't be such an a-hole.
[01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:24.880]   Yeah.
[01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:25.880]   I think that...
[01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:29.520]   Lisa bought a book for her son called Don't Be a Dick.
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:30.840]   We'll send you a copy.
[01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:31.840]   Right.
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:33.400]   It's etiquette for the modern age.
[01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:34.400]   And it's really...
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:36.240]   I think that's a good lesson.
[01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:37.240]   Yeah.
[01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:38.240]   Right.
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:39.240]   No, I mean, I think...
[01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:40.240]   Very nice.
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:45.080]   Here, by the way, Denise, is the Knowledge Navigator Review or a video that Apple made
[01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:47.440]   in 1986.
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:50.520]   This was their vision for the assistant of the future.
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:53.880]   There's effects on rainfall in the Sub-Saharan.
[01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:55.880]   It also covers drop-effects on the eastern Africa.
[01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:56.880]   That's the assistant.
[01:44:56.880 --> 01:45:00.800]   Oh, the brave new world we were facing back then.
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:02.360]   Contact you.
[01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:03.360]   I'm sorry.
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:04.360]   She's not available right now.
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:07.160]   I left a message that you had called.
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:08.160]   Okay.
[01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:09.560]   Let's see.
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:11.560]   This is the creepy professor I'm using.
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:15.080]   I'm about five years ago, Dr. Flemson, I've got something.
[01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:19.080]   He very disagreed with the direction of Jill's research.
[01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:21.400]   John Fleming of Uppsala University.
[01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:22.400]   You nitwit?
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:26.240]   He published in the Journal of Earth Science of July 20 of 2006.
[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:28.240]   Yes, that's it.
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:31.840]   He was challenging Jill's projection of the Mount of Carbon dioxide...
[01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:32.840]   By the way...
[01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:34.920]   1986, climate change.
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:36.720]   This guy's researching.
[01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:37.720]   Yes.
[01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:39.720]   Here's the rate of deforestation he predicted.
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:40.720]   Wow.
[01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:41.560]   What happened?
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:46.320]   So, I don't think this is so far off, although it's ironic, because this is 30.
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:48.680]   Apple was 30 years ahead of its time.
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:49.680]   Maybe at 40.
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:52.040]   That looks like it was built on a hypercard, by the way.
[01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:53.920]   It sure does, doesn't it?
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:58.800]   And it's Alan Kay's vision for a computer called the DynaBook.
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:00.800]   Although Apple called it later, the Knowledge Navigator.
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:02.880]   This was, I think...
[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:05.840]   I'm trying to think if this was after Steve.
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:08.520]   I think this was a John Scully projection.
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:11.520]   That would explain it a lot.
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:17.520]   Here's the experiment I did last night with Echo.
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:21.720]   We know that if you tell her she's stupid, she fights back.
[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:22.720]   Right.
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:23.720]   Right.
[01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:30.560]   If you tell her she's hot, or she has a cute butt, she does not.
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:33.240]   She just throws up her hands and says, "I don't understand that.
[01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:34.240]   I can't read it."
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:35.240]   Oh, I wish she would say.
[01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:36.880]   What should she say, Denise?
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:39.200]   What did she say exactly?
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:42.440]   She should say something like, "That's not a nice way to talk to somebody."
[01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:43.440]   Yes, she should.
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:47.560]   I mean, if she's telling you Iran to call her stupid, then she should call you on the
[01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:48.560]   recipe.
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:49.560]   Yeah.
[01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:50.560]   Well, good.
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:51.560]   I think that's just a matter of time.
[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:52.560]   Let's...
[01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:54.320]   I think it's time just to be even more literal and say, "You think I've got a good butt?
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:57.080]   You think a good butt has poor holes in the back face?"
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:47:00.520]   No, but I think that would be very useful to say.
[01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:02.960]   Not, "I don't have a butt," or, "I am a machine."
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:03.960]   No, just...
[01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:06.560]   That's not a nice thing to say to somebody.
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:08.000]   That could really hurt their feelings.
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.000]   I think that would be...
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:10.000]   Oh, people just...
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:11.000]   It would be correct.
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.000]   ...to kiss your mother without mouth.
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.000]   It's just like...
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.000]   Yes.
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:18.920]   And doing that little tiny bit of research made me think forward to the fact that maybe
[01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:24.120]   in our not too distant future, there will be personal assistants who are catered to people
[01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:28.720]   and maybe some of these already exist and I just don't know, to people who want to tell
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:31.120]   them that they have a cute butt or whatever.
[01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:32.120]   Yeah.
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:39.120]   But one that's not just there to serve their shopping needs but maybe other needs.
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:43.360]   Why you could build that into the software certainly would be a cuter, it would be a
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:44.360]   nice idea.
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:48.160]   I think backlash would be fairly swift, but...
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:50.160]   That's a good idea.
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:51.160]   Frankly.
[01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:52.720]   Hey, we're going to take a break when we come back.
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:54.000]   I live in a McMansion.
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.560]   I'm going to freely admit that.
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:47:57.560]   But we'll talk about...
[01:47:57.560 --> 01:47:58.560]   It's a legal case.
[01:47:58.560 --> 01:47:59.560]   The new blog.
[01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:01.080]   Oh, meet the Streisand Effect.
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:02.800]   It was a lovely story.
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:09.600]   But first, I want to thank the company that literally brings you this show every single
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:10.600]   day.
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:15.480]   It's Sonic our 10 gigabit fiber internet service provider.
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:20.400]   I bet even Scott Bourn doesn't have 10 gigabits up and down.
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:24.520]   Sonic is not available, sorry to say, in Seattle, Scott, but it is available in San Francisco,
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:26.640]   the North Bay and the East Bay area.
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:31.720]   And I've got to tell you, I know that this ad is frustrating for many of you because
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:36.280]   you can't get Sonic, but I want you to hear this because this is what is possible.
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:43.360]   This is a viable, successful, profitable company that gives you amazing internet for
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:44.360]   an amazing price.
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:45.360]   Listen to what you get.
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:48.320]   If you're lucky enough to be able to get Sonic and if you're in the Bay area, you really
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:50.320]   ought to find out if you can.
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:54.800]   With Sonic, you get 15 email accounts, a gigabyte of storage.
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:59.280]   You get personal web hosting, you get a new domain, you get fax line service, you get
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:04.640]   a home phone with unlimited local and long distance calling.
[01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:09.120]   You can port your existing number over to the home phone plus you get gigabit internet
[01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:14.200]   service, $40 a month for all of that.
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:15.200]   And it's possible.
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:17.840]   And Sonic, by the way, no bandwidth caps.
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:19.920]   They will fight government subpoenas.
[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:22.600]   They fight for your privacy.
[01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:28.840]   If you look on EFF, they're one of the few four or five star all green ISPs in the world
[01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:30.520]   because they really protect you.
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:35.680]   They've got great local customer support, affordable pricing, and their advocacy for
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:41.640]   you is paving the way for a better and I think more private internet across America.
[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:43.640]   I love Sonic.
[01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:45.880]   I'm happy to be a Sonic customer here.
[01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:47.880]   I wish I were a Sonic customer at home.
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:49.080]   They don't have it in my area.
[01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:52.200]   If they do get it, join the internet revolution.
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:55.480]   Find out anyway at sonic.com/twit.
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:56.480]   Sonic.com/twit.
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:50:00.680]   You'll get your first month of Sonic internet and phone service free.
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:01.880]   And yes, they offer TV too.
[01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:05.800]   You can bundle it with this and save $120 on your sonic bill.
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:06.800]   Sonic.com.
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:08.800]   Now, I'm not true.
[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:11.200]   I'm not the advertising thing here, but I've been using it for eight years.
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:12.200]   Oh, you're a Sonic customer?
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:13.200]   I've been using content.
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:15.200]   I've been using it for ever since I moved into my own place.
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:16.200]   I didn't know.
[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:17.200]   I didn't know about it, but I didn't know about it.
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:18.200]   Do you have the gigabit?
[01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:19.200]   You have fusion.
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:20.200]   Oh, but you can get it?
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:21.200]   Yeah, I can get it now.
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:26.360]   But the key advantage for me is every time you pick up the phone for tech support, you
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:27.760]   get a human being instantly.
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:29.600]   There's no voicemail whatsoever.
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:30.600]   And it's just --
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:33.160]   And they're local.
[01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:35.080]   This is the 2016 EFF.
[01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:40.720]   Who has your back report, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, does this?
[01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:42.600]   And if you look at -- actually, this is not --
[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:45.840]   No, no, it's -- I've interviewed the CEO a couple of times for storage.
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:46.840]   Dane is great.
[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:47.840]   Dane Jasper.
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:48.840]   Oh, on-blow.
[01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:49.840]   Yeah.
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:53.440]   I mean, when it comes to that neutrality, they don't even keep the logs for two weeks.
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:54.440]   They don't filter.
[01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:56.240]   They don't cap it.
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:57.240]   Yeah.
[01:50:57.240 --> 01:50:58.240]   Yeah.
[01:50:58.240 --> 01:51:00.440]   I thought Sonic was on this.
[01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:01.440]   Oh, yeah, there you are.
[01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:02.440]   Yeah.
[01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:03.440]   Five-star.
[01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:04.440]   Five-star.
[01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:08.040]   Follows into the CDRE accepted best practices, tells users government data demands, discloses
[01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:15.280]   policies on data retention, discloses government content removal requests, pro-user public policy.
[01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:18.560]   And there aren't a lot of five-star companies in here.
[01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:21.320]   Sonic is one of them along with Apple and Dropbox.
[01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:23.920]   Still amazed Apple got five stars, but still.
[01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:27.160]   Well, I don't -- yeah, I don't know if that's fair.
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:28.160]   But anyway.
[01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:30.640]   So this is one for Denise.
[01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:31.720]   Not because you live in a McMansion.
[01:51:31.720 --> 01:51:32.920]   I live in a McMansion.
[01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:35.400]   What -- do you know what the definition of a McMansion is?
[01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:37.400]   An enormous tasteless house.
[01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:38.400]   No, no, no.
[01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:39.400]   I'm teasing it.
[01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:40.400]   Basically, that's right.
[01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:44.400]   Basically, you have large, pre-designed houses, which you can just plop down onto the land
[01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:45.400]   where you've got it.
[01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:46.400]   It's one of those.
[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:47.400]   They tend to be extravagant.
[01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:48.800]   They kind of show offy.
[01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:52.840]   But the blog, which I love, McMansionHell.com, MCMAN.
[01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:56.400]   Do you know about this McMansion?
[01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:59.640]   They have been -- not recently.
[01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:03.960]   In fact, if you go there now, you'll see a lot of public domain images.
[01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:07.120]   But what they had been doing is taking images off of Zillow.
[01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:10.880]   I mean, if I scroll down far enough, maybe I could find it.
[01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:16.960]   But basically doing a critique of the house, of how bad the house is.
[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:21.480]   You know, it's -- all of those are gone because Zillow complained.
[01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:23.400]   They said, "You can't use these."
[01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:26.920]   And now millions of people who had never heard of this blog at all.
[01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:29.320]   And now it's like, "Gotta get me some of that."
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:33.440]   The good news is Zillow has decided not to pursue a legal action.
[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:40.400]   Kate Wagner, who authors the blog, got good news.
[01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:45.600]   And then the FFF to defend her and threaten Zillow with a potential countersuit, she says
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:49.160]   it's fair use of Zillow's images.
[01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:55.600]   The photos showing the exterior and interior of huge ugly suburban homes are used to skewer
[01:52:55.600 --> 01:52:59.680]   the celebration of wealth and conspicuous consumption.
[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:01.120]   That's fair use, isn't it, Denise?
[01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:04.920]   Well, this is not just a story for me, but for Scott.
[01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:06.960]   These are not Zillow's images.
[01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:09.400]   The images are uploaded by third parties.
[01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:10.400]   Oh!
[01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:13.640]   They don't even own them.
[01:53:13.640 --> 01:53:15.640]   Yeah, that's the problem.
[01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:20.320]   So Zillow's asserting ownership of pictures that somebody else took.
[01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:24.320]   Cheeky buggers.
[01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:30.880]   The thing is, if you're critiquing the photos, then that would probably be fair use.
[01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:34.600]   But if you're critiquing the house, I don't think it's --
[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:36.800]   No, they're critiquing the house, not the photo.
[01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:43.320]   So they're using the photos to say, "Oh, look at this ridiculous house."
[01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:46.960]   But Zillow doesn't have the standing here.
[01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:49.320]   Zillow doesn't own the copyright in these photos.
[01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:50.720]   The photographer does.
[01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:54.880]   The photographer probably, in most cases, is a real estate agent who put the listing up
[01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:57.800]   on the real estate.
[01:53:57.800 --> 01:54:01.680]   I think probably Zillow knew that and just decided, "Well, this is a blog no one's ever
[01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:02.680]   heard of.
[01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:04.080]   We'll fire a legal letter to them."
[01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:07.600]   And then they'll shut up and we can get back to Capacomb with their lives.
[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:09.440]   And then Streisand Effect kicks in.
[01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:12.320]   And the world and its dog knows about this site now.
[01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:14.960]   We're all going on there trying to find out what knows going on.
[01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:15.960]   It's great.
[01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:19.240]   I hope Kate puts those original pictures back up in the original post.
[01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:22.040]   It looks like to protect herself, she took them down.
[01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:24.320]   She only has public images on there.
[01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:32.120]   As Scott points out, though, I'm not sure how's photo -- if you're commenting on the subject
[01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:36.720]   matter of the picture, you may well have a good, very useful argument too.
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:40.560]   So there are probably two reasons why these should stay.
[01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:45.960]   No right of Zillow to assert this claim.
[01:54:45.960 --> 01:54:49.200]   And they're doing commentary on photos.
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:50.680]   Right.
[01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:54.120]   And the photographer probably doesn't complain because it's a real estate agent who wanted
[01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:56.520]   to excel at the house in the first place.
[01:54:56.520 --> 01:54:59.120]   The more publicity for the house, the better.
[01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:01.080]   Well maybe not this kind of publicity.
[01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:02.960]   You knew not something they want their name.
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:04.280]   My house would fit right in.
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:06.280]   I absolutely would.
[01:55:06.280 --> 01:55:08.280]   I think me.
[01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:11.040]   On the first two.
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:15.080]   So Uber just completed its five billionth trip.
[01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:16.080]   Hmm.
[01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:17.080]   Hmm.
[01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:18.080]   Yes.
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:19.080]   Yeah.
[01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:20.760]   Do you think it'll get to six billion?
[01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:21.760]   Oh, easily.
[01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:22.760]   Yes.
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:24.600]   They've got seven billion in VC cash to burn through.
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:26.160]   So an example of subsidizing taxes.
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:28.760]   Bad publicity isn't necessarily bad.
[01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:30.520]   Well, I mean, lift is --
[01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:31.520]   I'm sorry.
[01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:33.520]   Is this a seat right now?
[01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:34.520]   Say again.
[01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:36.920]   Aren't they kind of missing a C-suite?
[01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:37.920]   Yeah.
[01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:38.920]   Like nobody.
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:40.720]   Everybody's either fired or gone.
[01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:41.720]   Yeah.
[01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:42.720]   Yeah.
[01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:43.720]   Including Travis Kalanek, the founder.
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:44.720]   Yeah.
[01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:46.720]   Marissa Mayer seems to be positioning herself to take it.
[01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:47.720]   Is she?
[01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:48.720]   Well, did you not hear her comments?
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:49.720]   No.
[01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:54.440]   Oh, she went off on this screen about how I don't think this is Travis's fault.
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:55.840]   The company grew so fast.
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:57.520]   He probably didn't know what was going on.
[01:55:57.520 --> 01:56:00.320]   It's like, you're auditioning for the CEO job, aren't you?
[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:01.320]   It's just MG.
[01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:04.360]   Well, I would think Uber would hire a woman.
[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:07.920]   I think that would be one way to kind of help reinvent the company's culture.
[01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:11.560]   Yeah, but it's got to be a woman with the kind of gumption that's needed to do a route
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:13.720]   and branch reform with that organization.
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:14.720]   And I don't know.
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:16.120]   Sheryl Sandberg could do it in a heartbeat.
[01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:18.120]   COO at Facebook, but would she take it?
[01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:19.120]   I know.
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:20.120]   This is the problem.
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:21.120]   I don't think that she would.
[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:23.320]   I don't personally think that she would either.
[01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:25.960]   But you just need -- man or woman.
[01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:30.000]   You need someone to really take that organization and shake it up by the scruff of the back
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:31.000]   of the night.
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:35.040]   Six months after the Guardian said, "What's app had a back door?"
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:38.360]   They finally admitted, "Well, no."
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:41.280]   By the way, notice this is -- this is a really mild existence.
[01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:43.280]   This is a lot of pinyon piece.
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:44.280]   Yeah.
[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:45.280]   And not even retraction.
[01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:47.840]   But they were like, "Oh, a lot of people objected to this article because it was in
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:48.840]   the Guardian.
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:50.640]   It's like, no, we objected to it because it was wrong.
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:52.040]   It's putting people's lives at risk.
[01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:53.560]   To steal a phrase from your bollocks.
[01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:54.560]   Well, yeah.
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:58.320]   I mean, the Turkish government took over to that article and put them out on state media
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:02.760]   as a way to scurry people from going on to an immediate messaging service.
[01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:05.880]   I mean, I was at a security conference just after that story broke.
[01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:10.200]   And one guy who I respect and isn't prone to hyperboll said, "Whoever wrote that and
[01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:13.840]   have an edited and published it, it's got blood on their hands."
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:14.840]   Yeah.
[01:57:14.840 --> 01:57:21.760]   72 security experts shortly after the article was published wrote an open letter saying,
[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:24.240]   "Absolutely, what's app is secure.
[01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:30.720]   The problem you're talking about is not a significant issue, can be changed in the settings, easy
[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:32.240]   spot."
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:37.160]   And the Guardian finally, six months later, said, "Well, our reporting was flawed."
[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:38.680]   Nobody ever likes to say that.
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:41.760]   There's a gentleman who's got a responsibility to get that out there as soon as possible.
[01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:42.760]   Quickly.
[01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:43.760]   Yeah.
[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:44.760]   And you're right.
[01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:46.440]   This is more serious than just getting it wrong.
[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:51.200]   The risk is that somebody, a dissident who needs privacy, might not use what's happened,
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:52.400]   go to something less secure.
[01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:53.400]   Exactly.
[01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:58.720]   And they're not necessarily used because they're afraid of what's happened and cracked.
[01:57:58.720 --> 01:57:59.720]   All right.
[01:57:59.720 --> 01:58:01.640]   I think we can wrap things up here.
[01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:06.160]   I appreciate Denise putting up with all of the technical issues.
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:07.640]   You're a trooper, Denise.
[01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:10.160]   I appreciate you putting up with all the technical issues.
[01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:11.720]   I thought I had them ironed out.
[01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:13.320]   And we'll do anything to get you on.
[01:58:13.320 --> 01:58:14.680]   I think you're the greatest.
[01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:17.520]   And I think everybody should watch this week in law.
[01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:23.040]   You can watch back episodes at twit.tv/twil.
[01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:26.920]   And there's quite a few you've done with 392 episodes.
[01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:27.920]   Yes.
[01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:33.520]   And our last good little Simon Tam of the Slants case.
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:34.520]   Wow.
[01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:35.520]   That's great.
[01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:38.440]   Or you should watch this episode.
[01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:42.480]   This is one of our episodes that I most happy and proud of.
[01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:44.800]   The episode that Sean will be named.
[01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:49.640]   Tune in Fridays, 2 PM Eastern 11 AM Pacific in 1800 UTC.
[01:58:49.640 --> 01:58:50.640]   Wow.
[01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:53.000]   Simon Tam of the Slants.
[01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:54.000]   Wow.
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:55.240]   Yes, exactly.
[01:58:55.240 --> 01:58:56.240]   Wow.
[01:58:56.240 --> 01:58:57.240]   I'm too much of a Firefly I found.
[01:58:57.240 --> 01:58:59.080]   I heard Simon Tam and I thought, really?
[01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:01.320]   You're defending it.
[01:59:01.320 --> 01:59:05.240]   This week in law, thank you for being here, Denise, on your vacation.
[01:59:05.240 --> 01:59:06.240]   Thank you.
[01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:10.600]   Last plug.
[01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:19.640]   If you want to watch a great series of videos about what is harassment and what is not.
[01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:26.200]   David Schwimmer did one back in April of this year called That's harassment.
[01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:30.000]   So just Google That's harassment on YouTube.
[01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:33.400]   And you'll see this wonderful series of videos.
[01:59:33.400 --> 01:59:41.280]   And it's very much in keeping with Reed Hoffman's vision that people will just decide to educate
[01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:43.360]   themselves and be better.
[01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:46.800]   We should point out that David Schwimmer produced it and stars in it, but it was written by
[01:59:46.800 --> 01:59:49.400]   a woman, Siegel Aven.
[01:59:49.400 --> 01:59:53.600]   And I'd also like to highlight the British police have done a whole thing and what is
[01:59:53.600 --> 01:59:56.680]   consent and the way they've figured it is.
[01:59:56.680 --> 02:00:01.000]   It's working through various scenarios in would you like a cup of tea?
[02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:05.520]   And if you just search British police tea consent, you should be able to get that.
[02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:06.520]   Yeah.
[02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:07.520]   Good.
[02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:08.520]   Good.
[02:00:08.520 --> 02:00:10.040]   And yeah, that's great, Denise.
[02:00:10.040 --> 02:00:11.720]   Thank you for mentioning that.
[02:00:11.720 --> 02:00:18.400]   David Schwimmer, of course, the former star of Friends, I believe, if I'm not wrong.
[02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:19.640]   Is it on Facebook?
[02:00:19.640 --> 02:00:21.120]   Is that where the video is on?
[02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:23.200]   They have a Facebook page called That's harassment.
[02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:24.760]   I guess that'd be the best place to.
[02:00:24.760 --> 02:00:25.760]   They're all available.
[02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:29.680]   I think if you just Google it, you'll find it on any number of platforms.
[02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:30.680]   Okay.
[02:00:30.680 --> 02:00:31.680]   Good.
[02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:34.680]   Or, you know, follow the Facebook page.
[02:00:34.680 --> 02:00:38.160]   See, you know, yeah, that's a great idea.
[02:00:38.160 --> 02:00:43.400]   Scott Bornitz, it's so great to reconnect with you, one of our original Twit cast members
[02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:46.960]   on Macbreak Weekly way back way back in 2007.
[02:00:46.960 --> 02:00:52.040]   Yeah, it's been an honor to be on the show, Leo, and then I'll be with all of you.
[02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:54.840]   I'm so glad things are going well for you.
[02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:57.800]   Everybody should follow Scott on his blog, scottborn.com.
[02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:03.160]   I follow him on Facebook, which is awesome because I get to see all his really nice pictures.
[02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:07.640]   Is your is your page, your Facebook page public or is that just because I'm a threat?
[02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:08.840]   Yeah, I got this.
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:13.880]   I'm Scott Born on Twitter, Scott Born on Facebook, Scott Born on LinkedIn, but I'm born Scott
[02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:14.880]   on Instagram.
[02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:15.880]   Go figure.
[02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:16.880]   B-O-U-R-N-E.
[02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:18.880]   He spells it properly.
[02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:20.520]   Like the born identity.
[02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:21.520]   Yeah, huh.
[02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:26.320]   Like Ian spells his name properly without a P and with some weird I-A-N thing.
[02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:30.520]   Yeah, trust me, my parents and I thought it was.
[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:31.520]   Thank you, Scott.
[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:32.520]   It's so great to see you.
[02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:34.200]   And thank you for all the beautiful images, man.
[02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:35.200]   You're still so good.
[02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:38.040]   You've got a standing invitation to come up to last with me anytime you want.
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:39.200]   I would love to.
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:42.680]   And then you know we have the fire crane's picture hanging in Lisa.
[02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:45.120]   Lisa stole it, but she's got in her office.
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:46.120]   Brains in the fire, man.
[02:01:46.120 --> 02:01:47.120]   Brains in the fire, man.
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:50.560]   I look at that every day and I think, gosh, let's thank you for hanging it.
[02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:51.560]   Great picture.
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:54.160]   Yeah, you can buy your pictures on your site, can't you?
[02:01:54.160 --> 02:01:55.520]   Yeah, not that one.
[02:01:55.520 --> 02:01:56.520]   It's sold out.
[02:01:56.520 --> 02:01:57.520]   Oh, really?
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:01:58.520]   So you do limited editions?
[02:01:58.520 --> 02:01:59.520]   Yeah, it's sold out.
[02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:00.520]   Limited editions.
[02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:01.520]   I do limited editions, yeah.
[02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:05.000]   Yeah, as you should, as you properly should.
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:08.640]   Brains in the fire mist was just a, I feel very fortunate.
[02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:09.640]   Oh, wow.
[02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:11.080]   Yeah, then go look at it in Lisa's office.
[02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:12.080]   Yeah.
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:13.080]   Yeah.
[02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:15.200]   It's a beautiful print.
[02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:19.760]   Ian Thompson is at the register register.co.uk comes by often and I'm glad you do.
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:23.600]   I hope you will continue to even though the British store closed and so you can't get
[02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:24.600]   your.
[02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:26.640]   Yeah, although there was a good British pub on the way here.
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:31.000]   Oh, so sausages were sausage rolls and there's that beer.
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:32.240]   It's in San Rafael.
[02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:33.680]   Oh, what's it called?
[02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:34.680]   I'm going there.
[02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:37.560]   I can't remember, but Meghan recommended it to me.
[02:02:37.560 --> 02:02:38.560]   Nice.
[02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:42.800]   And as it's Brexit 1776 weekend, then I'm going to go down and enjoy pint.
[02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:47.240]   So you said you have mixed feelings about celebrating Independence Day since it was the
[02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:48.840]   day that we kicked you guys out.
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:49.840]   Yeah, I know.
[02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:52.240]   At the same time, four day weekend, you guys got Trump.

[02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:43.780]   Nope, that wasn't about it.

[02:03:49.780 --> 02:03:50.780]   Doo the twist.
