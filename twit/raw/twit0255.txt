[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.760]   And tech, the show that covers your technology news.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.560]   We bring in brilliant pundits and analysts
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.000]   to talk about something that happened last week.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.400]   And that's kind of the model for the show.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.040]   And today, we live up to the models.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.040]   My good friend Steve Gibson is here of the GRC.com,
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.000]   the Gibson Research Corporation.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.280]   He's a creator of SpinRide.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.240]   He's our host on Security Now, our weekly podcast on security.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.040]   And you'll see why Steve's here when I introduce our other guest.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.240]   Hey, Steve.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.760]   Hey, Leo, it's great to be with you again.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.640]   And I'm sorry that this week we don't have any gurus
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.600]   and pundits for you.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.040]   Just wish we could only find some--
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.920]   Couldn't get them on the 4th of July weekend.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.440]   So you got us instead.
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.680]   Well, we had a bunch of young people
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.840]   on last week, Kevin Rose, Dan Shapiro.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.400]   We had a lot of entrepreneurial types.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.360]   So this week, I thought we'd bring out the gray hairs.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.320]   And I'm really pleased--
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.400]   We used to the other side.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.880]   Yeah, that we could get Jerry Pournell back on the show.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.840]   I love Jerry.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.680]   Everybody loves Jerry.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.040]   Jerry's, of course, a very famous sci-fi author.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.040]   Wrote so many great books like Lucifer's Hammer.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.920]   And he is also kind of the guy who inspired me
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.480]   to get started in this business with his Chaos Manor
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.360]   columns in Bite Magazine for many years.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.200]   He continues to write Chaos Manor online and publish it
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.280]   for people who want to read it and subscribe.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.840]   Is it chaosmanner.com, Jerry?
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.840]   No, somebody else got that and the terms under which they
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.080]   would sell it to me were not acceptable.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.920]   So it's just-- it's Chaos Manor reviews.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.800]   Perfect.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.040]   The easy way to find it is just me.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.280]   If you can spell my name, you can find me, gentlemen.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.880]   JerryPournell.com.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.280]   There it is, the view from Chaos Manor.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.600]   I thought it'd be fun to have--
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.640]   it's always fun to mix it up a little bit.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.960]   And I tried to get another gray hair, John C. Devore-Eckon.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.600]   But he's off for the 4th of July weekend.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.120]   So it's the three of us.
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.720]   Although I have another fellow joining us in just a minute,
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.720]   it was an RF engineer.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.320]   Our radio frequency is really a black art.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.240]   And I know you both know quite a bit about it.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.600]   But I thought we'd get somebody who specializes
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.760]   in this to talk about this iPhone issue.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.800]   iPhone, of course, the big story of the weekend,
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.920]   not so much that it came out.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.400]   That was last week's story.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.320]   This week's story is all the--
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.880]   ruhaha around the iPhone antenna.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.440]   Steve, you wrote a pretty good blog post on this,
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.440]   as a matter of fact.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.400]   Yeah, what happened was someone who was following me
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.600]   on Twitter created a video which just very clearly
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.280]   and graphically demonstrated that when he put his finger,
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.120]   just one finger in one particular spot on the band
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.000]   of his brand new iPhone 4, watching this video.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.840]   And the whole thing was like 53 seconds long,
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.200]   the YouTube video.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.960]   You could just see the bars drop down to nothing.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.280]   And some people had repeated it.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.160]   Other people couldn't.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.560]   They did the same things.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.240]   So I got feedback when I posted this.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.160]   And I thought, you know, the explanation for this
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:49.520]   is that you're seeing five bars through a large part
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.480]   of the typical reception power range.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:59.800]   So only toward the very end as you're nearing the point
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.080]   where the phone can't maintain a connection,
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.000]   can't do data reliably and so forth, only then do you begin
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.960]   to see the bars drop off.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.680]   And if that were the case, that explained what everybody
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.760]   was seeing.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.800]   And it turns out, you know, from an engineering standpoint,
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.720]   I guessed right.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.560]   That turns out to be what is going on.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.440]   Apple's defense was, I brought my phone.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.040]   By the way, I was able to demonstrate this
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.960]   and I'm demonstrating it right now for people watching
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.400]   on video.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.000]   I was able to demonstrate it the day we got the iPhone
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.880]   right away.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.240]   But we were also able to demonstrate it on a Palm pre.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.240]   People said the same thing happened with the 3GS.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.840]   Almost any phone.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.320]   If held improperly, will cause this problem.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.640]   Really, the problem is not so much that this is happening
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.760]   is that Apple's response to this has been pretty anemic.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.320]   You know, one of the nice things about being,
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.640]   what is it we are, old farts or gray hairs?
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.840]   Veterans old gray hairs.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.720]   And I'm sure Jerry will relate to this.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.480]   I was very concerned as an engineer
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.800]   when I started seeing antennas disappearing, you know?
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.720]   In the phone and physically.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.520]   Yes, yes.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.080]   I mean, there was something very comforting about like
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.640]   pulling the antenna up out of the phone.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.480]   You know, early cell phones had telescoping antennas.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.120]   And it was like, OK, now I believe that I really have an antenna.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.280]   And generation after generation, they just sort of went away.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.440]   They disappeared, didn't they?
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.000]   But they can't go away.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.960]   You got to have an antenna.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.320]   That's a radio.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.880]   Yes.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.800]   It's got to be up there and it's got to be able to receive a signal.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.680]   We're going to address this in two parts.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.200]   First, we're going to talk about the actual issue,
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.160]   the antenna issue.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.400]   And then we'll talk about Apple's response,
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.440]   which is really much more of an industry issue than the actual--
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.440]   Well, they were shocked.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.160]   Yeah, that was the letter they sent out.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.680]   And Steve Jobs himself sent out a few notes.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.840]   We're going to talk about that.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.440]   But let's get Spencer Webb on the line.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.920]   Spencer is a RF engineer.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.160]   This is his field.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.240]   He wrote a-- I thought-- day one.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.960]   He wrote a very cogent blog post at his blog,
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.520]   and tennissis.com.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.600]   Spencer, thanks for joining us on a twit.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.400]   My pleasure.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.240]   Good to be here.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.360]   So I know you were interviewed by everybody from PC Magazine
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.600]   to the networks about this post.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.000]   Indeed.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.040]   Your response was exactly what Steve just said,
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.360]   which is as soon as they took the physical antennas out
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.160]   of the phone, they had to put them somewhere.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.120]   Absolutely true.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.080]   What Steve was just saying about the history of antennas,
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.600]   especially in cell phones, is correct.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.960]   They have been pushed down into the housing of the phone
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.200]   and made integral to the little monolith
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.000]   that the phones have become.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.160]   And it has caused the consumer public
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.480]   to forget that there's actually a radio in there.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.680]   And the radio needs an antenna.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.400]   I have a little museum of old cell phones here,
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.720]   and it's pretty graphic how the pull-up antennas, which
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.000]   we loved on the flip phone.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.760]   I had a Samsung with a pull-up antenna
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.320]   that I wrote a blog post about.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.160]   That worked great.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.360]   And then we had little stubs, and then bumps,
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.320]   and then they were gone.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.480]   You said, in fact, that one of the Motorola phones
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.440]   had a pull-up antenna, but they knew that people weren't
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.920]   going to pull it up, so they put an internal antenna in as well,
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.440]   just in case.
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:28.000]   That was the classic flip phone.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.800]   The Motorola flip phone, the StarTAC, the little bump-out
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.640]   on the case had a helical antenna in it.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.560]   And when you pushed the extended antenna down,
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.480]   there was literally a switch that switched over
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.600]   to the helical antenna.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.880]   So you still had a real antenna, even though you
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.040]   pushed the antenna down.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:49.720]   And many people thought that the antenna was a pacifier.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.840]   And in fact, it wasn't.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.120]   It was the real thing.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.920]   So is it better to use an external antenna?
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.640]   It is absolutely better to use an external antenna.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.400]   And it does a bunch of good things.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.360]   It gets the point of maximum radiation away from your head.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.520]   It makes the antenna physically larger,
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.440]   so it can become efficient and broader
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:15.280]   band, which the RF designer of the transmitter really likes.
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.360]   And they have eliminated it on all the modern phones.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.360]   So it's really a design choice, a cosmetic design choice,
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.400]   that isn't optimal.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.000]   Right.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.320]   Purely consumer driven.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.040]   It's because people don't want to have an antenna.
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.840]   It's just sort of not cool.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.680]   And so unfortunately, the radio waves
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:35.600]   don't feel the same way.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.960]   They really want to have an antenna.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.600]   Now Spencer, your reaction was, well, this is life.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.440]   There's every phone.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.960]   There's going to be a way you can hold it that's
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.520]   going to kill a reception.
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.360]   But don't you think it's particularly bad in the iPhone?
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.760]   I mean, this is, in fact, in every Apple ad,
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.240]   this is exactly how the iPhone is held.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.040]   He's exactly like that.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.440]   In fact, if you go look at the pictures of Steve Jobs holding
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:05.760]   the iPhone at the keynote, in nearly every shot,
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.200]   he's holding it wrong.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.640]   He's holding it like you're not supposed to hold it.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:10.680]   Exactly.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.960]   Well, he probably had a bumper on it.
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:13.960]   Well, that's the question.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.360]   Is why didn't did Apple know about this?
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.240]   And why didn't they do something about it?
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.120]   Is this a necessity?
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.640]   I think Apple could have solved this problem
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:29.880]   right at product release by having a sub-1-cent piece of paper
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:34.640]   in the box that said that had an international line
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.800]   drawing of a person holding the phone with the correct Vulcan
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:38.320]   iPhone page.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:43.320]   No, no, but you shouldn't have to hold a phone like that.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.840]   But it has an antenna in it.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.760]   I think what we need to do is admit we only
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.680]   to just say phones have antennas in them.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.760]   And then if we cover up the antenna,
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.960]   we're going to kill the signal.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.760]   And it doesn't matter where the antenna is.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.640]   It just happens to be--
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.120]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.200]   I was going to say, didn't they really, though,
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.600]   exacerbate the problem by externalizing the antenna,
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.640]   by actually giving us electrical contacts with the antenna?
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.920]   That's kind of not normal, right?
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.720]   Normally it's insulated by plastic or something.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.240]   Well, we did a test yesterday.
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.080]   One of my engineer friends came over
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.320]   with his brand new shiny iPhone 4.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.600]   I still don't have mine.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.200]   I see you have a 3 there, yeah.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.520]   No, this is not a 3.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.160]   This is a primordial iPhone.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.080]   That's the original.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:30.560]   Wow.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.280]   That's the original iPhone.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.240]   It will not die.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:33.960]   It keeps working.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.440]   I love it.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.840]   But anyway, we had a test with the iPhone 4 here yesterday.
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.760]   And in fact, if you bring up my blog page,
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.920]   I posted a very brief blog entry showing some photos
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.040]   of what we did.
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:51.000]   But we held the phone with the dangling two hand grip
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.880]   and observed signal strengths during a call.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.000]   This is an important point.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.640]   We made a call.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.440]   And the goal was we were going to try to drop the call.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.280]   And when we--
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.200]   This is not the grip that you're recommending.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:04.920]   Is it this one here?
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.440]   No, that grip requires--
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.920]   Scott Johnson's cartoon.
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.280]   The fact that it requires federal certification.
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.600]   That's from myextralife.com.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.360]   So let me see.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.080]   Is this in your first impressions?
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:17.600]   Oh, here it is.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.440]   Yeah, right there it is.
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:21.160]   OK, there's the two finger suspension grip.
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.200]   You call this.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:22.720]   There we go.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.680]   You shouldn't need a freaking manual
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.600]   on how to hold the phone.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.400]   No, you shouldn't.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.200]   But let's just get through this.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.960]   And then I'll make mine.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:36.080]   I'll calm down, so it's important.
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:40.400]   So the two finger dangling grip in my office
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.920]   yielded a five bar response during a call.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.640]   And you could barely see it in that photo, but there it is.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.080]   And then when we went down to the grip of death--
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.800]   in fact, we didn't just do the grip of death.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.920]   We did the two handed grip of death.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.760]   Oh, wow.
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:59.920]   And yeah, we almost made it thinner.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.760]   In that case, we got it down to one bar,
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.080]   but we couldn't drop the call.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.320]   But the important thing is--
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.840]   Well, that's important to--
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.360]   but what you just said, and we're going to get back to,
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.520]   we couldn't drop the call.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.920]   Because that's, I think, maybe the important issue.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.480]   Here I am.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.760]   I'm holding it in the pleasant, accepted--
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.080]   whatever it is, the two finger Vulcan grip.
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.360]   And it's got five bars.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.960]   And I can-- I mean, I demonstrate this very clearly.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.960]   Is this only happening in places with a weak signal, though?
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.760]   There's four bars.
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.880]   Well, it depends on how strong the signal is.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.440]   If you're in an area that's marginal--
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.640]   Just went back up.
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.480]   That's not supposed to happen.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.320]   Stop it.
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.400]   Why does it fluctuate?
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.440]   It shouldn't go back up, shouldn't it?
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.680]   It wants to make you happy, Leo.
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.360]   Well, and see, that's, I think, part of the real controversy
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:54.800]   here is that by designing the bar formula the way Apple did,
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.320]   the consequence of that is you've got five bars almost
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:02.240]   all of the time until you really have very little signal
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:08.280]   left, instead of it being like a 0 to 100 or a much more
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.680]   useful scale.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.040]   Well, that's what exactly-- and let's go to Apple's letter,
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.880]   which they sent out.
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.720]   Apple's response to this has been kind of weak.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.120]   And we're going to talk more about this.
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.480]   First Steve Jobs says, hold it different.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.480]   My friend, Chris Dibona, said, no, that's nice.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.400]   Apple's philosophy went from think different
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.840]   to hold it different.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.000]   Credit Chris Dibona on that one.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.480]   The problem is that you actually relied on that indicator.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.640]   Right.
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:42.280]   And that turns out to be totally, only loosely
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.440]   coupled to the actual signal strength and perhaps not
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.880]   coupled at all.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.720]   Well, that's what Apple says.
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.640]   Apple said, we have discovered the cause of this--
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.640]   I'm just a direct quote from Apple's press release.
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:57.720]   Well, with it, if you get connection, then you had bars.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:02.720]   The notion of bars is a little odd in digital phones,
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.840]   anyway, isn't it?
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.920]   Well, that's a good question.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.000]   Spencer, does that make sense to have bars?
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   That's, is that an analog left over?
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.920]   Well, it's a human factors problem.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.640]   People want to see a number.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.520]   They want to see an indicator.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.840]   They want to have a feeling for signal strength.
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.840]   And the fact of the matter is--
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.080]   It's a binary situation.
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.880]   You've either got enough connection
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.200]   to be able to make a call or you don't.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.480]   It works or don't have.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:36.880]   Worse quality or better quality as you did in analog days.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.200]   Well, and when I went into complaining to the AT&T folks,
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.120]   and Apple's even said this, I've heard to other people,
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.800]   they said, AT&T said, OK, the bars,
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.280]   but are you dropping more calls?
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.000]   And I said, well, I hardly use the phone at all.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.040]   And no, apparently I'm not.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.360]   In fact, I tried after I went home.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.440]   And I said, well, let me see.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.760]   And I was able to get it down to zero.
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:53.880]   And the call still didn't drop.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.880]   So maybe it doesn't affect the call.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.200]   Leo, we don't know what the bars mean.
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.360]   The bars are a relative indicator, OK?
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.200]   Nobody knows what the bars mean.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.320]   But they like the bars.
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.040]   Apparently, even Apple, Apple said, upon investigation,
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.080]   we were stunned to find, stunned to find
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.680]   that the formula we use to calculate how many bars of signal
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.120]   strength to display is totally wrong.
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:18.880]   Our formula in many--
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.480]   Strong mean.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.680]   Well, look, you know what?
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.960]   You know what they did.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:27.160]   They made sure that they showed five bars all the time
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.040]   in previous phones.
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:32.000]   Our formula, in many instances, mistakenly displays two or more
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.240]   bars than it should for given signal strength.
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.400]   I'm shocked.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.360]   Shock, the gambling is occurring.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.400]   For example, we sometimes display four bars
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.200]   when we should be displaying as few as two bars.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.000]   Users observing a drop of several bars
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.920]   when they grip their iPhone in a certain way
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.560]   are most likely in an area with very weak signal strength.
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.320]   But they don't know it because we're
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:55.440]   erroneously displaying four or five bars.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.200]   It's like they're saying, well, we kind of fudged it before.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.280]   Is that true, Spencer?
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.040]   Or go ahead.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:06.720]   Well, I think the fact that AT&T has a standard for the signal
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:10.160]   strength and Apple wants to adhere to the standard,
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.800]   that's a wonderful thing.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.840]   But it doesn't mean anything.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.840]   It doesn't change the performance of the phone.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.880]   It doesn't change the number of dropped calls people
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:18.880]   are going to get.
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.080]   They had to make a response.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.360]   This is the response they made.
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.000]   I don't think it has any particular validity.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.920]   I also think that the measure of whether the system's working
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.160]   well or not is whether you drop calls or not.
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.080]   And that really has nothing to do with what the bars mean.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.560]   But the marketing guys won't take the bars off the phone
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.360]   because everybody expects them.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:43.600]   The one other sort of really interesting conspiracy
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.320]   theory side also is that with the release of iOS 4,
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.640]   they removed the field service screen.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.640]   You could enter a really bizarre phone.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.200]   You can't do it anymore.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.800]   And you could see the true--
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:03.640]   I mean, like a screen of true data that meant something.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.800]   And that disappeared.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:06.480]   It's like, why?
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.840]   Everyone liked that except maybe at the market.
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.240]   The smartest thing Apple could do
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:19.520]   is quietly put the field service screen back in the iPhone 4
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:23.520]   and just leak the information and not officially acknowledge it.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.120]   And I think people will start making measurements.
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.400]   And I honestly believe they'll find that the iPhone 4
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:34.680]   is a more sensitive radio than the previous models.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.040]   And getting back to something Leo said,
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:41.520]   is the iPhone 4 more sensitive to having
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.280]   the human hand interfere with the antenna?
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.640]   And I think the answer is yes, because they've
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.600]   moved the antenna action from the back of the phone
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.400]   to the side of the phone.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.200]   Right.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:58.520]   And really, it's a beautiful piece of design.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.240]   But you need to give it a case.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.440]   Put it in a case.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.720]   If it's a little rubber band around the antenna,
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.400]   that's fine or whatever.
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.160]   Well, but then you really solve the problem.
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:07.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.800]   And that's what I did.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.320]   I got a case for the thing.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.040]   And you're right, because it doesn't happen anymore.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.720]   I have to take the case off to do it.
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.040]   Don't you think-- as long as we're talking conspiracy,
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:18.360]   that's a little suspicious that Apple releases the first case
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:18.920]   it's ever done.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.760]   And it's this weird bumper case that doesn't release--
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.040]   And it's $30.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.560]   And it's $30 for a piece of rubber
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.760]   that, just by coincidence, happens to insulate the metal band
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.760]   and nothing else.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.560]   Apple must have known.
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.360]   Jerry, we cut you off.
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.280]   No, that's all right.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.680]   I find it all amusing, because I think the whole thing
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:42.520]   is to protect AT&T from people finding out
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.080]   that their service sucks.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.880]   No, he's paying attention AT&T at this point, are they?
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.520]   No, I mean, look, I used to have--
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.960]   back when bars meant something, and I
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.120]   had a different kind of phone--
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.840]   I used to have four bars here, but that
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:06.200]   was when my wireless service was from a thing called Singular.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.840]   And then AT&T bought it.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.080]   And what do you know?
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.360]   Half my house, I don't get any at all.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:16.200]   And even up here, I have to stick my head out the window
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:21.360]   to get cell phone service in my house.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:26.280]   So if I like Apple stuff, I'm kind of stuck with lousy service.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.960]   I wonder how long Apple will continue to do that,
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:33.320]   because I suspect I'm not the only one who has that problem.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.200]   Rumors abound.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.800]   Of course, these rumors have been going on ever since the iPhone
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.600]   came out that Verizon--
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:42.960]   and this is now coming from good sources like Bloomberg.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:46.440]   The Verizon will have this phone in January.
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.360]   But then we'll lose that one nice feature of the phone,
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.760]   which is that you can surf while you're on the phone.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:55.960]   Because we'll be on CDMA, not GSM.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.040]   So there's a very good article.
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:01.160]   I don't know if you saw it Spencer on a non-tech.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:01.960]   In which they--
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.120]   Yeah, it looked like they did a very good
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.280]   analysis of the antenna.
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:09.000]   This is the actual physical antenna that's in there.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.800]   Yeah, that was one of the slides at the keynote
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.040]   that Apple showed.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.320]   Apple-- at the keynote was very proud about how good
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.560]   this antenna was.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:18.440]   They were.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:22.880]   And one of the questions I got asked during the last couple
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:29.160]   of weeks is, do I think that the disguised cases that they
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.000]   had the company phones in for evaluation
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.080]   might have hidden the severity of the problem?
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.840]   And I thought about that.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:40.600]   And it's very possible that that could have been true.
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:46.320]   However, the thought that Apple didn't have a clue
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:50.800]   that the hand interference was going to be an antenna issue
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:51.920]   is preposterous.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.800]   They had to not only know about it.
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.160]   I'm sure they quantified it.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.800]   And they took a risk and decided that it was worthy of it.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.680]   And they shipped it like that.
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.880]   I still think the little piece of paper in the box
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.560]   would have solved the whole problem.
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:08.640]   I wonder if the whole deal with Apple and the iPhone
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.160]   and the signal strength and the deal with AT&T even
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.920]   is a consequence of the fact that maybe they're
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:18.600]   in the shadow of a huge AT&T cell tower.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.440]   And no one ever realized that, you know,
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.560]   at Apple, you get really good AT&T performance.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.000]   That's true, by the way.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:25.960]   And nowhere else.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:26.320]   Yeah.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.520]   Apple has unusually good signal.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.840]   You mean there is a place where you get good AT&T service?
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.720]   Yeah, it's called One Infinity Loop, Cupertino, California.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.320]   9-5-1-4.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.080]   Well, I have to move to Cupertino to be
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.320]   able to get decent cell phone service.
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:40.200]   Well, I don't know.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.000]   Maybe it's a coincidence.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.320]   But I wouldn't be surprised if AT&T's executive said,
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.800]   make sure that Steve gets a good signal.
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.320]   But it doesn't make it hard to test, doesn't it?
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.880]   So a non-conclusion--
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:56.000]   in fact, they have a chart, which must make it true.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.160]   It's a nice chart, by the way.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.120]   Nice chart.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:01.840]   Signal attenuation comparison in DB lower is better.
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:06.960]   And you can see that the attenuation goes from holding
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:12.040]   it naturally inside a case of 7.2 dB to 24 dB, if you cup it
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:15.960]   tightly, much more than you see on the 3GS or the Nexus 1.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.480]   I don't know about their methodology.
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.960]   Spencer, does this make sense, though, to you,
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.880]   as an RF engineer?
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.960]   I think the most impressive thing that Anantec did
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:29.520]   was hack the phone so that they can get DBM numbers out
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.760]   of the receiver.
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:32.800]   Yeah, that's amazing, isn't it?
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.640]   They did a wonderful job doing that.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.560]   And they actually have numbers here on the bar.
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:41.600]   Yeah, they hacked it and reverse engineered it
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.120]   to find out what the numbers meant.
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.760]   Of course, that's all going to change as soon as Apple
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.760]   releases the patch.
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:51.600]   But what they did was pretty good with the tools they had.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.640]   I was actually reasonably impressed.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.320]   One of the things that we have to keep in mind
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.720]   is that when the phone is being observed and tested,
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:03.120]   regardless of what change you're trying to make
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.440]   to observe if it's better or worse,
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:09.080]   you don't know if you're sitting on one cell site
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.880]   or you're switching between three different cell sites
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.520]   as conditions change.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.600]   And there is nothing on the phone
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:19.480]   save that service screen that will tell you that.
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.600]   So all of the tests, 100% of the tests
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.960]   that have been published, including my own,
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.840]   if you can't be certain that you haven't switched cells,
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.400]   then you don't know if your data is valid.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.240]   Oh, that's very good.
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.400]   So you can't move around, but you could even switch cells
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.440]   while you're sitting still?
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.840]   Absolutely, yes.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.800]   In fact, if you're covered by two cells
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.160]   and how you hold the phone or even where in your house,
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.000]   you're standing, it might change the directionality
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.040]   of which side of your house the signal squirting out
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.280]   and you could be switching back and forth between cells
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.200]   and not know it.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.480]   And that's the beauty of the cellular system,
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.640]   but that's also what obfuscates the ability
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.480]   to make any observations.
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:04.640]   I think Apple should re-enable the field service screen
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.080]   and let us nerds play.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.080]   I wonder why they turned it off.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.680]   I mean, that's highly suspicious.
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:13.640]   Isn't it?
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.640]   Probably all it did was cause them problems.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.800]   He, you know, the word got out the screen was there
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.640]   and you know, users are gonna complain.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.040]   They're gonna say, "Hey, wait a minute."
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.760]   It's like too much information
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.160]   and Apple would just rather we had five bars.
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.600]   They'd rather we read the press release
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.240]   and just, you know, listen to them.
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:34.600]   And we're sorry that they were shocked and hold it to fright.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.560]   I keep coming back to wondering
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:40.400]   what's the difference between one bar and five bars?
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.840]   Apparently none of four, actually, Jerry.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:46.840]   Steve, we know you can do arithmetic.
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.440]   Spencer, Spencer, what is it?
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.120]   It's a logarithmic scale, isn't it?
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:56.120]   Apparently the anantec chart, if you could put it up,
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:00.120]   shows a DBM on the bottom.
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:03.360]   And for those of you that don't know what a DB is,
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:08.360]   a 10 DB change is 10X in the signal, 10 times.
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:11.600]   A3 DB change is two times.
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.520]   So that chart will,
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.840]   is actually makes the bar as useful
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.360]   and lets you make some evaluations.
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.600]   Well, it can make some evaluations,
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.280]   but what is your different expectation?
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:27.600]   If I have one bar or I have four bars,
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.240]   what should I expect to see differently
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.320]   when I'm actually using the cell phone?
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.600]   So Jerry asked the question,
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.080]   and this is why K.S. Manor was such a great column.
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.080]   You're a user.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.320]   You asked the legitimate question the user should ask,
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.000]   "How does it affect me?"
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.480]   It doesn't get better data transmission.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.520]   Are you going to sound better if I have four bars?
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:53.520]   Then if I have one, my understanding is that bits is bits.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.160]   Bits is bits.
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:00.840]   And when you hit a bit error rate or a BER
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:04.200]   that is below what is acceptable to the system,
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.680]   you fall off a cliff.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.080]   So I have to agree with you 100%
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.040]   that you either have it or you don't have it.
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.720]   In which case, why shouldn't it have a light bulb
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.240]   that says yes or no?
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.080]   Good or not. Yeah, good or bad.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.480]   Yeah. It's binary, isn't it?
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.120]   I think in this august group,
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.320]   we've already made the argument
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:25.760]   that it should both have a light bulb that's green or red
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.720]   and that it should have a bit error rate readout
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.760]   on some screen that you can only get to if you're a certified nerd.
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.560]   It needs an analog meter with ballistics
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.560]   so we can really see what's going on.
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:38.560]   And to Jerry's point, when you think about it, really,
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.880]   the question, "Can you hear me now?"
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.240]   That's binary.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.720]   Yeah, that's the binary question.
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:47.320]   If you're going to have a nerd screen,
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:52.320]   it probably ought to also use some kind of location system
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.000]   to point to where the signal is coming from
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.160]   so that you know which tower it is.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.200]   Is it a Spencer a warning that I might get a drop call
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.600]   'cause my bars are plummeting?
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.800]   Yeah, and you know that it is a warning
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.960]   and I think if we grow an ear inside of our ear canal,
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.680]   I mean, an eye inside of our ear canal
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.000]   'cause when you use the bars-- Exactly, too bad
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.600]   we can't see them, if they say--
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.880]   (laughing)
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.680]   And then it becomes really useful.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.560]   I think we should work on that.
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.800]   Little genetic engineering, we'll have it solved.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.000]   Well, you can have a tone.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:25.840]   You can have an envelope.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.280]   You're gonna have to have a doubt of that.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.360]   You don't want that?
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:31.040]   No ears in your ears, Jerry?
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.840]   I don't think I need that.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:36.840]   The maintenance sounds expensive.
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.920]   This is great stuff.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.320]   Spencer, I said I'd only take 15 minutes.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.240]   I know you've got a lawn to mow or something.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.600]   If no, I'm good as long as you need me.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:48.680]   Well, stick around if you'd like.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.480]   You can continue with a discussion.
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.040]   I mean, this is such a great conversation
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:55.160]   and we rarely actually have anybody
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.080]   with any technical standing on the show.
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.680]   So it's kind of nice to have somebody
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.760]   who knows what they're talking about
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.240]   and I've got three people who know what they're talking about.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.000]   Jerry Pournell, the legend, the myth.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.360]   It's so great to have you here.
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.760]   Myth, the myth, no that's--
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.040]   Non-mythical, how am I?
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.720]   The mythical Jerry Pournell, he's like a unicorn.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.560]   So it's so nice to have you.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:18.960]   Steve Gibson from grc.com and of course from
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.720]   andtentacist.com.
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.880]   Spencer Webb who is an RF, an actual RF engineer,
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.160]   which is mythical like a unicorn.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:30.440]   RF is a black art as far as I'm concerned.
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.640]   You design cell-tenters, right?
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.240]   You know I use to argue.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.920]   No, no, I design antennas.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:35.760]   Antennas.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.440]   And most of the antennas that I design,
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:42.320]   the majority would fit in a bread box.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.800]   And then there's a song that gets pretty big.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.720]   But I'm an antenna designer.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.680]   I have done RF design, but that's not my specialty.
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.440]   If it radiates, that's what I make.
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.160]   Spencer, you probably heard that Apple
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.920]   is hiring antenna engineers now, right?
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:57.240]   Desperately, quickly.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.040]   It's a steal from the coincidence.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.520]   You're the,
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:05.200]   Stevie the 57th person to remind me of that.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.160]   And every person that reminds me of that,
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.920]   they tell them the same thing and that is,
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.600]   Apple knows how to find my phone number.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.720]   Yeah, they do now.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.000]   We're gonna take a break, come back.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.760]   If you guys wanna take a break, please do.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.360]   We got a minute, but I wanna talk a little bit
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:22.240]   about my friends at Ford and the fabulous Ford Sync
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.880]   that's in my Mustang and many Ford,
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.120]   Lincoln and Mercury vehicles.
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:29.600]   It is the best hands-free out there bar none.
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.320]   I mean, I can just say that absolutely
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:32.600]   without equivocation.
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.280]   You've got true hands-free calling.
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:35.960]   And by the way, I tried it.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.600]   It works fine with iPhone.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.320]   Works great with Android.
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.680]   Android, by the way, is an example of a phone
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.960]   that in many cases does not have hands-free
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.520]   because it wasn't built into the Android operating system,
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.040]   doesn't stop the sync.
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.560]   When you pair it up on the Bluetooth,
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:52.640]   it downloads the phone book and I can now call for anybody
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.400]   by name, I press the button on my,
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.680]   I don't have to take my eyes off the road,
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:56.680]   my hands off the wheel.
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:58.760]   I press the button on the steering wheel.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.320]   I say phone and I can call anybody from my Android phone,
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:04.120]   my iPhone, I can even have multiple phones in the car.
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.000]   I just love that.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.080]   Turn by turn directions too.
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.320]   You don't have to have the big display.
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.560]   It'll talk you through your route.
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:13.240]   If there are traffic problems ahead,
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.840]   it will reroute you automatically.
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:18.040]   It's got 911 assist, which is very nice.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.920]   I hope I never have to use it.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.760]   It's a feature you don't want to have to use.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.840]   If the airbags are deployed at any time in your car,
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.440]   it will call 911 from your phone.
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.560]   It'll automatically send your GPS coordinates
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.840]   from your phone, or actually it has its own GPS,
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.200]   so it's not from the phone, but through the phone.
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.840]   And play a prerecorded message
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.480]   and then give you a chance to talk as well.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:41.480]   So a great feature should the worst happen.
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.640]   I use it for music all the time.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:46.080]   I just, I have to say, I love the Ford Sync
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:49.400]   and I have tried many others, but there is none better.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.120]   You can take a look at, of course, Sync
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.880]   at your favorite Ford Lincoln or Mercury dealer.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.600]   It's a standard in some Ford Lincoln
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.680]   or Mercury models optional in others,
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:01.800]   or go to the website, SyncMyRidepodcast.com,
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:04.640]   and they have videos and so forth, you can see.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:08.080]   I can get sports scores, I can get movie listings.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.960]   Elyf, this is fun, you can say.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.520]   Where's the cheapest gas and it'll steer you there?
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.320]   Sync, are you not in 'cause you have one
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.760]   or just 'cause you want one?
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:16.800]   It's great, isn't it?
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:21.400]   SyncMyRidepodcast.com.
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.720]   We love Ford and we thank, and by the way,
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:26.880]   we're gonna be going to Dearborn, Michigan,
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.000]   at the end of this month to cover Maker Faire,
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.640]   which is in Detroit for the first time,
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.720]   the Detroit area for the first time,
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.200]   which will be a lot of fun.
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.520]   And we are also getting, I am told,
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:39.000]   an exclusive tour with our cameras live
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.960]   of the Ford assembly plant in Dearborn.
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.520]   So that I'm really excited about,
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.040]   because talk about high tech,
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:48.200]   this stuff is really advanced in so many interesting ways.
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.760]   That's coming up at the end of the month,
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.880]   we'll see that on Twit Live.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:55.160]   Back to our conversation, Jerry Pournell is here,
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:58.440]   as well as Steve Gibson and Spencer Webb, we're talking.
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.480]   Spencer, is your name really Webb,
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.640]   or did you make that up just for the website?
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.360]   I'm not at Liberty to say.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.360]   It's a great name.
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:13.280]   Apple says in their PR release to fix this bar problem,
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:16.840]   we are adopting AT&T's recently recommended formula
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.440]   for calculating how many bars display
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.840]   for a given signal strength.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.280]   The real, and this is important,
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.800]   the real signal strength remains the same.
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:27.360]   But the bars will report it far more accurately,
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.040]   providing users a much better indication
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.200]   of the reception they'll get in a given area.
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.480]   We're also making, and this is the real fix,
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.640]   we're making bars one, two, and three a little taller,
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.360]   so they'll be easier to see.
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.800]   They're gonna make them bigger,
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.760]   so you'll think you've got a better signal.
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.440]   This is in a free software update.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.960]   What do you think Spencer, the chances are
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:48.440]   that Apple will also slipstream without any notice,
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:51.080]   and maybe a little rubber thing on the,
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.360]   I mean, couldn't they easily just code it with something
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.080]   or do something to insulate a little bit better?
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:00.560]   I think they would have, any change they would have made
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.280]   to improve antenna performance would have made
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:07.480]   the product bigger, and I think that's the important key.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:10.240]   There are a lot of pressures on the design of this product,
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:13.920]   and the antenna performance is only one of them.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.080]   The industrial designers, the artists,
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.400]   have a lot of say at Apple,
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.120]   probably more than other companies.
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.600]   The mechanical engineers have something to say.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.560]   The battery engineer wants more battery volume.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:27.680]   They're all competing for this volume in the phone,
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:30.560]   and I'm sure that there was a meeting,
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:34.720]   in some dungeon at Apple, where somebody innocently said,
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:39.280]   "Well, can't you use the band on the phone as an antenna?"
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:43.240]   And the antenna guy said, "Well, I probably could."
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:44.200]   And that was the end of that.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:47.960]   He lost any volume inside the phone.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.440]   Yeah. It would have been a mistake.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:54.440]   Don't you just hate it when art gets upset by physics.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:57.760]   The immutable laws of physics, sorry, art guys,
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.240]   but you're just not gonna have what you want.
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.040]   Well, and this is the sad irony of it,
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.720]   is that, well, so now I have this,
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.000]   what is truly a work of art?
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.320]   The iPhone 4 really is gorgeous.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.600]   I have it in a case, because it's the only way
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.360]   I can keep those bars from going down.
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.880]   And I think that's probably gonna be the solution.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:13.640]   And maybe at some point, Apple PR will say,
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.640]   all right, give anybody who complains of free bumper.
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:16.880]   How much can it cost them to make?
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:19.280]   I know they sell it for 30 bucks, but seriously.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.160]   It's a piece of rubber.
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.160]   We try to live strong bracelet.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.720]   Those rubber band bracelets that you get
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.920]   from Lance Armstrong's Foundation, live strong,
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.000]   they work fine.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.720]   Anything, anything to insulate would work fine.
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:33.560]   It's a piece of scotch.
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.560]   If you go to it, if you go to my blog,
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:40.560]   I wrote a little bit on why the thicker the bumper,
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:45.440]   the more it pushes your lossy hand away from the phone,
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:50.440]   and it's gonna reduce the sensitivity to your hand.
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:55.200]   And I'm not so sure that Apple hadn't considered this
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.040]   from the beginning.
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.840]   Obviously the evidence is that they came out
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.160]   with the bumper so quickly.
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:03.520]   But you used electrical tape, and did that work?
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.680]   I used electrical tape.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:08.800]   In fact, here's the actual role of electrical tape.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:11.720]   This is exclusive to this week in technology.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.560]   I thought electrical tape was black.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.840]   No, antenna engineers are permitted to buy
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:17.680]   white electrical tape.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.680]   Oh, you have to have a license.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.720]   You do, you have to show it at Home Depot.
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:24.720]   So we used white electrical tape.
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.640]   This is serious.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:30.160]   And we did the insulation.
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.000]   And we did the grip of death,
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.800]   and it had no absolutely no change on our experiment.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.640]   And I have to admit, it wasn't a rigorous experiment.
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.080]   It wasn't a very carefully controlled experiment.
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.720]   But it was enough of an experiment for two RF guys
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.960]   sitting next to each other to look at each other and say,
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.880]   "Yeah, okay, no change, no difference."
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.200]   So it's not that the moisture in my hand
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:53.160]   or somehow bridging this plastic gap,
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.320]   that's a misnomer.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.040]   That's not what's happening.
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.000]   That's DC think.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.880]   That's light bulbs and flashlights think.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:04.960]   We're dealing with radio frequency currents
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:08.320]   that are switching back and forth at,
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.680]   in this case, about a billion times a second.
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:12.560]   RF acts differently.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.560]   And if we take a thin insulator
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:17.680]   and put it over that band,
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.600]   the RF actually doesn't know the difference
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.840]   because we're making so much capacitance with our hand.
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:27.840]   So it's not really what we would call a galvanic connection
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.120]   that's causing the problem.
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.840]   It has nothing to do with that.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:35.040]   It is a combination of detuning the antenna
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.280]   from putting our hand there
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.840]   and literally attenuating the signal
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.400]   as it's coming off the antenna,
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:43.840]   which means it's turning into heat inside of our hands.
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:48.280]   - So the farther away the bag of moisture
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:51.720]   that is your body is from this part of the phone, the better.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:54.360]   - Yeah, to a certain point, obviously,
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:57.600]   if you're six inches away.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:02.120]   - But it only takes one thin piece of tape to do that.
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:02.960]   Is that correct?
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:05.000]   - No, no, it doesn't, it sounds like.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.120]   - No, you need to, the bumper case pushes your hand.
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:10.400]   I don't have a bumper case in front of me,
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:13.680]   but I have the case I use on my primordial.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:15.040]   - Okay, I just understood you
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.400]   and I suspect if I did, some others did.
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.720]   - Yeah, no, thanks for clarifying.
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.200]   - You're saying that a piece of tape won't do it.
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:24.120]   You have to have something that has a physical difference
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.960]   to actually affect the capacitance
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:30.440]   of the connection between your hand and the antenna.
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.040]   - Yeah, I predicted that a thin piece of tape
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.120]   will have no effect.
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:36.120]   We observed that a piece of electrical tape
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:37.880]   didn't seem to have an effect.
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:40.400]   And next week, I'm gonna get much more detailed
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.640]   in the measurements.
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:44.240]   - Of course, if you use something other than white tape.
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.400]   (laughing)
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.280]   - People have reported scotch tape works,
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.720]   but it sounds like that wouldn't.
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:53.440]   - I think plastic tongs, maybe that would be a good thing.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.640]   - The Vulcan grip of death, we've already established,
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:57.560]   Spencer told us, you have to hold the phone
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:59.360]   with two fingers like that.
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:00.960]   - Three fingers. - Three fingers.
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:04.160]   - Oh, is that one on the top back?
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:05.160]   - Okay. - All right,
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:06.560]   and then one on each side.
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:07.400]   - Like that.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.400]   - And that's right.
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.440]   - Is it necessary to extend one's pinky
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.200]   or is that just a finesse?
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:13.680]   - Only in polite company.
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.880]   (laughing)
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.200]   - Hold it like a teacup.
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.120]   (laughing)
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:19.200]   - That's right, absolutely.
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:22.760]   - And it's a shame to cover up this work of art
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:27.760]   with a case, but when I bought the primordial iPhone,
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:32.200]   it had a case on it before I left the Apple store.
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.560]   And it looks great now, and it's been dropped,
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.720]   and it's still working awesomely.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:39.160]   - Just every once in a while, I take it out,
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:41.160]   I polish it up, I look at it, I go, ooh.
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:45.400]   So let me ask you, so Spencer, you are an iPhone user.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:46.240]   - I am.
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.480]   - Will you get an iPhone 4?
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:52.080]   - Not only will I get one, I'm wondering where it is.
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:55.080]   Actually, it should be delivered here on Tuesday, so yes.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:58.120]   And I have to make a confession.
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.080]   I've said that I'm getting one.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:03.320]   It's absolutely not true, I'm getting two.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.680]   My wife is getting one, and I've told her
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.080]   that she's getting one, and I've told her
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:07.920]   that she'll like it.
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:08.760]   - There you go.
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:11.520]   - So she has reluctantly agreed to give up
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:16.400]   her Motorola Razr, which by the way, strangely enough,
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:19.040]   I did a little research, and the Motorola Razr
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:21.120]   has the antenna right on the bottom.
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:22.480]   - My bottom, just right with the front.
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:25.080]   - That's right, so if we do the grip of death
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:27.120]   on the Motorola Razr, guess what's gonna happen?
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.000]   The exact same thing.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.760]   - Steve, you're an iPhone user, or no?
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:36.600]   - Nope, 'cause I'm like Jerry, I feel the same way about AT&T.
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.000]   The only account I have with them is the iPad,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.560]   'cause I had no choice.
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.320]   That was good enough to drag me over there,
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:44.640]   and I'm a BlackBerry user also.
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:47.040]   - And Jerry, what do you use for phone?
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:52.040]   - I use an iPhone long ago when they first came out.
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:57.760]   One of my readers said, "Hey, this is the pocket computer
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.760]   "from your old novel, The Moten Gods."
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.320]   - It is, isn't it?
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:04.320]   - And you ought to have one, and the next thing,
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.600]   you know, one appeared in the mail.
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:10.640]   So this one, 'cause I've still got the ancient one.
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.840]   - Yeah, you and Spencer.
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:13.840]   - You and Spencer.
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.280]   - It works, it works for, I don't like you,
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.920]   I don't do much talking on the telephone,
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:23.920]   but I also don't tweet, so it works just fine for a phone,
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:26.720]   and it's very good for looking up things
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:30.160]   when I'm getting online,
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:32.800]   and I Google more with my iPhone
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.640]   than I do with anything else.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.640]   - You maybe should have a Google phone.
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.640]   - Well, actually, what I really want
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:43.080]   is a stylish carry bag for my iPad.
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.640]   I was gonna say the iPad has probably replaced
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:49.560]   Jerry's use of the iPhone, 'cause it's just so right.
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:52.680]   - That's exactly correct, I use the iPad
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:55.120]   when I have it with me for almost every,
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:58.800]   I would now accept that my iPad just did something goofy.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.560]   Well, I've got two experts on the line.
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:03.800]   Can I ask some advice?
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.120]   - Go right ahead.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:10.000]   - Okay, my iPad connected to my network,
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.960]   but it would not use it, that is,
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:16.040]   it kept saying that it couldn't get email or Safari.
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:18.040]   You sent me an email, and I sent that,
[00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:21.240]   I forwarded it on to my Mac account,
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.680]   so I could be looking at that at the same time
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:26.640]   I'm looking at this, which didn't work,
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:31.000]   although it appeared on the MacBook Pro I'm using.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.800]   So I thought that's very interesting.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:36.280]   The iPad, which was working fine down at the beach,
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:38.280]   with a different network,
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:42.040]   seems to believe it's connected to my internal network,
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:44.520]   and my wifi here, but it isn't.
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:48.600]   So I pushed the button, the two buttons,
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.620]   which makes it do a hard reset,
[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:53.560]   and it came up and it worked fine.
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:58.320]   And now I've got the, it connects to the internet just fine,
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:01.640]   it believes it's connected to my local internal network,
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:05.960]   but when I turn it, it no longer re-oriented itself.
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:08.320]   It's now locked into--
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.440]   - Well, you know about the switch at the top, Jerry,
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:11.800]   the lock switch.
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.080]   - Wow, switch 'til that's what it is.
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:14.160]   - Unlocked that switch.
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.480]   - Switch at the top and I hit it wrong.
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.120]   - So it's easy to hit that.
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:20.680]   Hey, but let me ask, this is actually a germane
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:23.080]   because Apple has had problems with the wifi
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:26.240]   and the iPad problems, which they've denied,
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:28.640]   and then said, well, you know, in Princeton University
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:32.280]   said, well, it's doing DNS wrong, it's not--
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:33.760]   - That was a switch.
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:35.480]   - And I had inadvertently hit it,
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.440]   and I'd forgotten about it,
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.120]   which tells you the problem with being 80 years old
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:42.560]   if you forget there's a switch at the top.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.760]   - There is something still not right, Leo.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:48.920]   My, remember this is my second 3G iPad
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:52.200]   'cause the first one was locking up all the time,
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:54.200]   and I remember mentioning to you
[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:57.640]   that at the time I was switching back and forth actively
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.920]   between the wifi and cellular,
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.920]   so are depending upon where I was.
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.960]   Well, I've just left everything in cellular mode
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:08.040]   because I'm grandfathered in, thank goodness,
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.800]   to the unlimited account--
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:11.480]   - By the way, never let that lapse
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:13.320]   'cause I'm told that if you let that lapse once,
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:14.680]   you never again get unlimited.
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:17.520]   - I got one and I guess I'll never let mine lapse.
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:20.280]   AT&T swears to heaven that they're gonna put
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:23.160]   a new tower in our neighborhood shortly.
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:24.280]   - Well, if anything-- - Well, that's good
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:26.560]   'cause you'll get a tan that way too, so.
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:34.200]   - Anyway, when I do mess with the turning on and off
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:39.200]   the land, the wifi, I, every so often, the pad locks up
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:41.640]   and I've gotta do Jerry's two finger salute
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.960]   in order to get the thing going again.
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:47.240]   I mean, so something's not right somewhere.
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.760]   - Yeah, Steve, when it locks up,
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:53.000]   do you mean it stops working or it just simply
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.840]   believes it's connected to wifi
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:57.320]   but it's not really connected to the net?
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:01.400]   - I've seen both behaviors, a complete freeze of the UI
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:04.160]   just that it never recovers from
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:07.520]   or sometimes it's got problems.
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:11.160]   I found that from my particular email servers,
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:15.840]   the UI on the iPad didn't give me enough flexibility
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:16.920]   for configuring it.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:21.280]   I had to set up the email on my Mac
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:24.960]   and then dock the iPad in order for the Mac
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:28.680]   that had more sophisticated email UI
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:30.920]   to then synchronize into the iPad.
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:32.960]   Then it was able to work with my email.
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:36.320]   - I did, mine was just, it was,
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:39.120]   it was connected to the wifi but it didn't,
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:42.120]   but it really wasn't if you see what I mean.
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:45.320]   It gave all the indications, the settings said so.
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:48.840]   I went into settings and turned wifi off
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:51.440]   and then back on again, no effect.
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.520]   But when I did that hard reset,
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:58.120]   it reset itself connected to my internal chaos manner
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:01.640]   wifi network and it's working just fine,
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:05.760]   which is great, I was horrified because my whole,
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.880]   I never had a real problem with it before.
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:11.840]   - When I first got the iPhone, I had a similar issue.
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:17.760]   It would get on the wifi and after a while,
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:20.600]   it would simply act like it wasn't connected to the wifi
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:25.600]   but it was and I had to turn wifi off on the iPhone,
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:28.160]   turn wifi back on on the iPhone
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:29.760]   and everything worked okay.
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:34.360]   And I exchanged iPhones and that didn't cure the problem.
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:37.880]   And then finally, I took my blue,
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:39.840]   Lynxis wireless access point.
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:44.000]   I think it was a WAP54G if I'm remembering correctly
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.960]   and I took it offline and I went
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:49.200]   and I got an Apple Airport extreme and the problem went away.
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:54.640]   - Yeah, that generally works but I use D-Link
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:59.640]   and Belkin here and they both work very well.
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:03.320]   I'm very fond of those two companies for that sort of thing.
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:07.600]   But this was interesting but I thought it was a tragedy
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:10.240]   because I'm getting kind of dependent on this iPad.
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:13.640]   I think that's the big news of the week
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:18.640]   is that there's a huge race for making e-books
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:23.360]   and textbooks and magazines and everything
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:25.360]   wireless cheap now.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:29.000]   Readers, there's that price war on readers.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.880]   - Well, that's interesting and I wonder how much of that
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:32.400]   is in response to the iPad.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.840]   How much is it that Barnes and Noble
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:36.920]   is eating some of Amazon's business?
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:40.520]   As you know, Barnes and Noble dropped the price on,
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:44.280]   I'm sorry, borders dropped the price on their nook.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:45.440]   No, that's B&N, right?
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:49.280]   - B&N is nooks.
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:50.120]   - That's the nook.
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:51.120]   They dropped that price down.
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:56.120]   - The first one to cut and immediately Amazon retaliated
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:48:01.920]   and then the last I heard B&N is,
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:05.080]   I mean, that war isn't over.
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:07.640]   - So B&N, they dropped the nook to 150 bucks
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:11.040]   for Wi-Fi only 189 for Wi-Fi plus 3G
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:14.400]   and then Amazon responded dropping the Kindle price similarly.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.360]   This happened a couple of weeks ago
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:18.920]   and now Amazon's announced a new Kindle DX
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:20.720]   which has an improved e-ink screen
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.800]   and you said Steve, you've already ordered that one.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.600]   - The moment I found out about it,
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:25.720]   I got my order in.
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:27.400]   - You didn't like the DX or did you?
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:29.080]   Was it too big for you or?
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:30.520]   - No, I use it every day.
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:33.360]   It's the reason I upgraded to this latest one.
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:37.560]   I've got it rubber banded to the head of my stair climber
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:41.640]   and I read science fiction on it when I'm stair climbing.
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:44.880]   - But you're gonna like it better than the iPad, you think?
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:48.680]   - No, no, what I'm finding is that
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:55.560]   there's still nothing better than the Kindle for just reading.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:58.920]   It's lightweight, the battery lasts forever
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:00.160]   unless you're in the dark,
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.160]   then you're not gonna be able to read very much.
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:07.160]   But as a purpose specific just e-book reader,
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:10.080]   I really like it better than the iPad
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:13.920]   because I got used to the smaller screen.
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:15.400]   It's easy to hold it in one hand.
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:17.120]   You really can't hold the iPad in one hand.
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:19.600]   It's too heavy to hold it for a long time.
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.400]   - I expect your eyes are better than mine.
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:25.120]   I've got very, what I really like about the iPad
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:28.200]   is reading Kindle books on the iPad.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.240]   - Well, that's the beauty of it.
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:32.840]   - That's that little slide bar at the bottom
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:35.760]   and you can thumb through pages very rapidly
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:37.680]   and that's what's gonna cause it.
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:41.000]   And that feature is the difference between
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.920]   whether you can have textbooks on electronic books or not.
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:47.560]   You will never have textbooks on a Kindle
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:50.600]   as long as you don't have some faster way
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.600]   to flip through the pages,
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:55.520]   which you can do so easily on the iPad.
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:58.320]   That was genius on their part to have done that.
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:03.320]   So they got better iPad, the iPad app on the Kindle,
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:05.920]   I'm sorry, the Kindle app on the iPad
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:07.920]   is better for reading Kindle books
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:09.600]   than the Kindle itself.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:11.880]   - Yes, well, and they've put it on the iPhone
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:15.000]   and they've added audio and video to the iPad and iPhone
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.600]   and they've also put it now on the Android phone.
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:19.320]   I was told, and I don't know how true this is,
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:21.120]   that there's two different divisions at Amazon,
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:24.880]   one selling the hardware and one pushing the software
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:26.600]   'cause I could never understand why,
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.880]   I mean, is Amazon in the book business?
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:30.520]   If they aren't, put Kindle everywhere, right?
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:31.360]   You don't care about the business.
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:33.240]   - Oh, they're in the razor blade business.
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:35.520]   - Yeah, yeah, they just wanna sell the books, right?
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:38.080]   - They want you to have something to read it with
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:39.840]   which it's why they didn't resist
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:42.040]   having Kindle apps on iPads.
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:43.880]   - But why do they still make a Kindle then
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.920]   if they've got a platform now,
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.240]   they don't need to make the Kindle anyway.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:48.920]   - A lot of you think they will.
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:50.960]   - Well, I don't know, they just announced a new one
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:52.360]   on July 1st. - And that still
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:54.080]   makes razors too, I guess.
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:56.000]   (laughing)
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.760]   - I mean, they're making a big deal
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:00.880]   about the new Kindle DX, 50% improved contrast.
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:02.720]   By the way, they say this may be a first step
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:05.040]   towards a color Kindle.
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:09.200]   - Yeah, well, a color Kindle with an easy to thumb,
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:12.760]   look, there is an enormous potential in this business
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:14.000]   in textbooks.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:19.600]   College and high school textbooks are so dog-on expensive
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:22.800]   that if you can do them with ebooks,
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:25.600]   it's a lot cheaper for the schools
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:29.000]   and over time it'll be cheaper for everybody
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.480]   but you're not gonna do it unless you can thumb back it.
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:33.920]   You can do bookmarking and thumb back and forth
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:36.040]   between those pages much more rapidly
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:38.360]   than you can with a Kindle right now.
[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:40.960]   - The other interesting thing that Amazon introduced
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:44.280]   with the Kindle, I'm not so sure how I feel about it
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:47.840]   but they've had a sort of a social networking aspect to it
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:50.400]   where you're reading a Kindle book
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:54.440]   and you're seeing highlights that other people
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:59.040]   who read the same book made before you came along.
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:00.440]   - That's kind of weird.
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:03.000]   - Yeah, you can and I have been very careful
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.400]   to ignore all that.
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.280]   (laughing)
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:06.760]   - Can you turn it off?
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:07.760]   - You don't have to see it.
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:08.920]   - Okay, you turn it off.
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:12.560]   - I really, well, if I knew it was Steve Gibson
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:16.200]   or Leo, the port comments, I would probably leave them on
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:19.840]   but since they're more likely to be those of somebody
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:22.880]   who has picked up the book in a bookstore,
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:25.000]   who do I know?
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.920]   I mean, there are more, let us face it.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:30.480]   I think everybody on this program
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:33.560]   has more social contacts than we need right now.
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:34.400]   - Yeah.
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.920]   - Well, in this case, Jerry, you definitely,
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:38.200]   I just wanna advise you, stay away from Twitter.
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:39.840]   This is not where you wanna go.
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:42.480]   - Steve, I have never tweeted in my life
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:45.080]   and I am sorry to say I am Leo.
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:47.600]   I'm proud of you that you are the leading twit
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:52.240]   in this world, but I don't have any,
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:55.040]   I have never even been vaguely tempted
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:57.040]   to find out when you were having lunch.
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:00.000]   - Well, watch out, Jerry, 'cause Steve felt like that
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.600]   a year ago and now Steve's got three Twitter accounts.
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:04.440]   - Really?
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:05.480]   - He can't stop.
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:07.560]   - Gibson, are you now on Twitter?
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:09.280]   (laughing)
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:10.960]   - I didn't realize that.
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:14.920]   - Oh yeah, he's got @, what is it,
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:17.640]   @sgrce, what is it Steve?
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:18.480]   - What are the--
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.880]   - I have Gibson research for corporate stuff.
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:25.880]   I have SG-GRC for my, just like daily stuff
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:29.880]   that occurs to me and SG-pad.
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:31.880]   And what I'm finding is I've got, I don't know,
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:35.480]   like 11,200 some followers.
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:38.120]   And I'm deep into what's going--
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:39.600]   - Surprised, it's so cute.
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:41.840]   - Well, it takes a while, you gotta build up.
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:45.400]   - And so I'm following along what's going,
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:46.600]   what's happening with the industry,
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:50.840]   but for example, last Saturday when I realized
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:53.240]   what was going on with the iPhone,
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:56.440]   just based on sort of other people's experimental results,
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:59.360]   'cause I don't have one, I created a blog posting
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:03.480]   and then I was able to announce it on the Twitter
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:06.000]   and a lot of people found out about that way.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.680]   So for me, it's just a great communication medium.
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:11.120]   And for example, earlier this morning,
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:16.120]   I said, "Hey, Leo and you and I
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:20.000]   "are gonna be on Twitter at 2.15 PM Pacific."
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.680]   And I got a ton of feedback from people
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:23.880]   who are really happy to find out about that.
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:24.720]   - And I'm sure a lot more people
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:25.920]   are watching because of it.
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:28.960]   - I'm sure that's the case and I guess that's true,
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:33.120]   but can't you do it just by announcing it on blogs
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:34.640]   and I mean--
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:36.760]   - Twitter pushes it out as opposed to a blog
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:39.160]   where people have to go to your blog to see it.
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:40.840]   - No, they don't.
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:41.680]   - Well, they don't.
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:43.920]   - I don't want to subscribe to Feeds, don't.
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:45.160]   - Yeah, and you know what's happened, Jerry?
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:47.920]   I think if fewer and fewer people use feed readers
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.000]   and read feeds, that's become, I think,
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.400]   a little less popular thanks to Twitter
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:53.720]   where you get these little short bursts.
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:55.880]   Twitter, if you craft your list carefully,
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:58.160]   becomes kind of like a feed reader
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:54:59.280]   that's put together by other people.
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.520]   And this gets back to this idea that Amazon's having,
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:03.720]   which I think is very interesting,
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:06.200]   of including others' annotations in your book.
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:07.880]   And you hit the nail on the head, Jerry,
[00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:11.160]   if you could pick who's annotations you were looking at,
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:12.200]   wouldn't that be valuable?
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:13.840]   That's kind of what Twitter does.
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:18.200]   - Yeah, I suppose you have probably taught me
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:20.520]   into looking at it and that's horrifying
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:21.360]   because--
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:23.480]   (laughing)
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:27.840]   My notion of Twitter up to now has largely been,
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:31.160]   the only Twitter I ever saw was somebody was telling me
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:34.040]   he was about to have a sandwich and then go to the toilet.
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:35.200]   - Yeah, you don't need that.
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:37.200]   - Why was it that I wanted to know this?
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.480]   - Well, you don't follow that guy.
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:41.040]   You follow people like Steve who say interesting things.
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:42.680]   - And the fact is, Jerry,
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:47.680]   celebrities of various walks of life get a lot of followers
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:51.880]   and you'll be able to share things that you care about,
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:55.600]   you know, like little short bursts about a book you found
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:58.560]   or a movie review or a restaurant that you liked.
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:03.560]   - And that's what I do on my day book now.
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:08.360]   I mean, I invented the blog for heaven's day.
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:10.800]   Stick with the blog, it's okay.
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:14.440]   - I have a pretty good time to have been the first blogger.
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:17.880]   - And I don't know that I want to abandon blogs and tweets.
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:18.720]   - No, don't.
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:21.000]   - And how many people are reading the blog?
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.160]   Do you have a sense for a subscriber?
[00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:24.000]   No?
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.920]   - I know how many paid subscribers I have.
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:30.640]   I know the usual ratio and I know how many unique I get
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:33.360]   which is in the order of 100,000 a month.
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:37.080]   - So are you happy with the success of the view
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:37.920]   from Chaos Manor?
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:38.760]   Has it gone well for me?
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:41.440]   - Well, I'm not getting any 20,000 a month out of it.
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:43.880]   The way I heard you say on the radio you were doing.
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:46.040]   - But that's donations, Jerry.
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:48.680]   Those people are contributing to the cause.
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:51.120]   - Yeah, and it's because you don't have a Twitter account,
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:51.960]   Jerry, that's entirely--
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:53.600]   - Contributing to what?
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:56.560]   Contributing, I mean, is that just gifts to you?
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:57.400]   - Yeah, so--
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:58.600]   - What the calls were?
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:00.120]   - We did this a while ago.
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:02.880]   When we first started Twitter,
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:06.360]   it was all supported by donations
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:08.680]   because we didn't have any advertisers.
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:11.880]   And as we were gradually, the plan was always,
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:14.800]   well not always, but the plan after a few months of this
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:16.560]   was, I should get some advertisers
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:18.800]   'cause I'm not gonna be able to live off what people donate.
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:21.320]   And we now have a fairly good stable of advertisers,
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:22.800]   very high quality advertisers.
[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:24.760]   And I realized, well, why are people donating?
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:27.080]   It doesn't make sense to have donations and advertisement.
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:28.640]   But I still wanna encourage donations
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:30.080]   'cause what it really is is a buy-in.
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:32.040]   It's a way, we're only asking $2 a month,
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:34.800]   a way of saying, I'm part of this, I support it, I like it.
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:36.480]   And it's a way of feedback too.
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:37.520]   So I thought, well, here's what I'll do.
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:39.600]   I won't take a salary out of Twitch.
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:41.240]   We've got enough people taking money out of Twitch,
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:44.800]   including 10 employees now and about 30 or 40 contractors.
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:47.000]   Let, you know, they'll be funded by the advertising,
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.560]   but I'll take my salary out of donations.
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:50.960]   So that when you donate something,
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:52.960]   it really has a direct result.
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:54.280]   And that's worked out pretty well.
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:56.840]   And it, yeah, it went up to about 20,000 a month
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:58.320]   when I started doing that.
[00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:01.840]   I don't take all that money, Jerry, I take 10 out.
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:02.680]   - No, I understand.
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:05.160]   But I don't provide, I don't.
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:11.320]   Let's say my subscribers feel satisfied, I guess,
[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:12.320]   because I have--
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:13.160]   - They're supporting you.
[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:14.160]   - I'm gonna have to renew all right, sir.
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:15.520]   - Yeah, they're supporting you.
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:18.320]   And I think that that's a really worthy thing.
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:20.160]   - But it's not my full-time job.
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:22.240]   I'm still a fiction writer.
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:25.520]   And I don't have time to supervise employees
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:27.400]   to come up with the kind of content
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:29.880]   that would justify taking that kind of money out of it.
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:30.880]   - Well, exactly.
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:33.200]   And so-- - I just don't put that much in it.
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:37.320]   Back in the bite days, I had 30 editors working with
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:40.240]   and some of them for me back in New Hampshire
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:42.960]   and I could go to all of the conferences
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:45.600]   and keep up to date and have somebody,
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:47.440]   I want you to follow this for me
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:49.840]   and let me know if something interesting happens.
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:51.960]   Now it's all in fall, but you know,
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:57.840]   I think I have the most interesting mailbag on the web.
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:58:59.640]   - And you published this, by the way.
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:02.600]   - Yeah, I have my mail on the web
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:04.400]   as part of the Jerry Pinnell.
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:05.240]   - I think that's a great idea.
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:08.040]   - And I also have a mailbag in Casement is Review.
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:10.280]   Casement is Review is not political.
[00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:13.440]   It is purely technology and it's the old bike column
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:14.560]   and it's comments.
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:15.640]   - Right.
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:19.440]   - My website, that one, the one you're showing
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:21.720]   in the background now, that website
[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:23.800]   is whatever I think of, but I think of it
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:26.760]   as my technology and civilization seminar.
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:28.960]   (explosion)
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:32.320]   That background, Richard Feynman was getting me on
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:35.560]   to the faculty at Cal Tech to do a senior seminar
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:37.640]   on technology and civilization.
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:39.560]   - Oh, I would have loved to have seen that.
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:42.880]   - And this is basically what I do on that
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:45.120]   and that's what people are subscribing to.
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:45.960]   - Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:47.080]   I thought they were subscribing to Casement
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:48.080]   so it's Jerry Pinnell right now.
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:49.000]   - They get them both.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:49.840]   - You get them both.
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:51.480]   - The same subscription is to both.
[00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:54.480]   I don't try to distinguish it and I don't have any ads.
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:58.040]   - I, we're gonna do an ad 'cause we gotta make some money here
[00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:01.520]   but I do wanna talk about leaky capacitors
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:05.200]   and this is, you know, we were talking about apples problems.
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.480]   Well, Dell's got some big problems they're facing
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:09.840]   including some lawsuits over these leaky capacitors
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:10.920]   and I wanna get your take on that
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:12.720]   in just a second if I might.
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:14.680]   Before we do though, I do wanna talk a little bit
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:16.040]   about carbonite.com.
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.560]   Yes, another one of our great sponsors.
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:19.960]   They've been with us for a long time.
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.200]   In fact, I'm putting carbonite.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:23.360]   I mentioned this on my daughter's laptop.
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:25.280]   I just put it on last yesterday.
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:28.360]   She's got a Mac carbonite works on a PC or Mac.
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:29.960]   She's going off to college this fall
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.240]   and I can tell you right now,
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:34.000]   I know I'm gonna get the call at some point
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.880]   where she says, "Daddy, I lost my paper or the laptop
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:40.040]   "or the hard drive died and all my data too."
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.600]   And I'm gonna say, I'm gonna be the hero.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.560]   I'm gonna say, "Don't worry, dear.
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:45.320]   "You've got carbonite, carbonite,
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.480]   "the leader in online backup."
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.680]   We all know that computer disasters happen.
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:51.440]   Hard drives fail, Steve's made a living
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:52.860]   on failing hard drives.
[01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:55.680]   Laptops gets stolen right and left.
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:59.040]   Carbonite is the way to back up.
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:00.440]   It's automatic.
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:02.000]   Soon as you put carbonite on your system,

[01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:00.320]   So Dell, this is an article in the New York Times,
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.440]   came out a couple of days ago.
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:05.040]   After the math department at the University of Texas,
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:08.360]   noticed some of its Dell computers failing.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.600]   Dell examined the machines.
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.760]   The company came up with an unusual reason
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:13.880]   for the computer's demise.
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:16.960]   The school had overtaxed the machines
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.440]   by making them perform difficult math calculations.
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:22.960]   Not so.
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.400]   That's just their excuse.
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:27.240]   It turns out Dell knew, it's being sued right now,
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:29.320]   the lawsuit is in process.
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:32.840]   Dell knew at the time that they had faulty electrical
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.680]   components, they sold millions of computers
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:37.920]   with bad capacitors from 2003 to 2005.
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.720]   Dell more than any other, HP and Apple had the same problem.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:43.480]   This is what these capacitors are used widely.
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:48.480]   But Dell had a huge number of problems with these computers.
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:52.880]   And unfortunately, even though they knew what was going on,
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:55.760]   they decided to, well,
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:59.000]   basically sounds like lie about what was going on.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.480]   Now they're admitting it.
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:05.480]   These bad capacitors popped leaked fluid, caused crashes.
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:08.640]   And the documents that were recently unsealed
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:10.760]   in the case against Dell in the federal district court
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:15.520]   in North Carolina show that Dell had far more of a problem
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:19.480]   than others, 11.8 million computers in those two years
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:22.120]   that had the faulty capacitors from my company.
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:23.040]   - We had one of them.
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:23.880]   - Did you?
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:27.480]   - Are these on the motherboard or in the power supply?
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:28.760]   - I don't know. - On the motherboard.
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:30.000]   They're on the motherboard.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.840]   And we had a large, at the time,
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:37.240]   large Dell computer that we were using for simulations.
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:39.560]   And the same thing happened, we started getting--
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.320]   - Two much math. - Two much math.
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:42.160]   - Too much math.
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.360]   You've got to stop that.
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:45.400]   - Can you ever actually have too much math?
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:46.800]   - I don't think so.
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:48.880]   - You remember Intel had that problem
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:50.920]   with one of their math chips for a long time?
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:53.320]   - Yeah, they had that bad floating point, right?
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.840]   - Yeah, that's right.
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:58.640]   So we got a brand new motherboard under service contract
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:03:59.640]   in that computer.
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:03.640]   And it was obvious when you looked at the electrolytics,
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:07.160]   they were swelled and those were the bad caps.
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:09.080]   And the technician told me about it.
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:10.440]   - He admitted it.
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:14.080]   - Oh yes, he said, yeah, we have a bad load of capacitors
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:15.200]   and that's what's causing it.
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:16.280]   And when you looked at the board,
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:18.120]   it was obvious that that was so.
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:20.120]   - In the discovery of these documents--
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.520]   - I'm sorry, surely.
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:26.960]   Is this an ongoing problem or is it something that happened?
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.920]   They fixed it and now their big problem
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:31.320]   is they're going to have to replace a bunch of motherboard.
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:32.160]   - They fixed it.
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.440]   They said, if you had the bad capacitors,
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:37.200]   the chances of it failing were 97%.
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:39.400]   The problem is, and this is the smoking gun
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:41.600]   that's coming out now with discovery,
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:44.240]   is that Dell employees went out of their way to conceal it.
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:46.120]   In one email exchange quoting the New York Times
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.520]   between Dell customer support employees,
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:50.400]   concerning computers at a law firm,
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:51.920]   a Dell worker said, quote,
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:54.720]   "We need to avoid all language indicating the boards
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:58.840]   "were bad or had issues per our discussion this morning."
[01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:00.120]   Another quote, "Don't bring this
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:02.600]   "to the customer's attention proactively."
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:05.800]   Another quote, "emphasize uncertainty."
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:07.320]   That's why I was curious, Spencer,
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.560]   whether they told you what was wrong.
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:10.320]   So they admitted it.
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.120]   - Oh, the technician absolutely admitted it.
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:13.480]   But if you looked at the motherboard
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:15.680]   and you were an engineer, you couldn't miss it.
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:16.880]   - You couldn't miss it.
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:19.320]   It was just, you wanted to get under the table
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:20.440]   before they exploded.
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:22.240]   That's how bloated they were.
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.680]   - The thing that's interesting is that
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:27.800]   this has been a known vulnerability and problem
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:31.800]   that's been ongoing for like a decade.
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.680]   - It's been longer than that, Steve.
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:37.520]   We had those problems with S100 bus boards.
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:40.400]   - Well, in this case, I think what's happened is
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:44.400]   that no offense made to China,
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:48.720]   but we have very, very inexpensive Chinese manufacturers
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:50.240]   who are producing something,
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:53.120]   which is unfortunately not solid state.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:55.920]   The electrolytic capacitors on motherboards
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:06:00.200]   and power supplies are arguably liquid state
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:03.280]   'cause they have a dielectric in them
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.000]   in order to make them go,
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.200]   which can dry out over time.
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:11.280]   Or in some cases it can get punched through
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:13.160]   and so the capacitor starts to heat up
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:16.560]   and then pushes this dielectric out of itself.
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:21.560]   So unlike resistors and chips,
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:24.880]   which are like the other components on the motherboard,
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:27.280]   which really are sort of solid state,
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:30.040]   capacitors are not so much that.
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:32.480]   And the quality of manufacturer,
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:36.960]   when you really squeeze the price out of them,
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.520]   this is sort of a consequence of that.
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:42.880]   - Yeah, and that has been true since ham radio days
[01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:46.120]   in the 1940s for heaven's sake.
[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:47.880]   - So just bad manufacturing.
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:52.640]   - And you bought quality items for when you were building
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:55.360]   your stuff back in those days.
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:57.560]   You always paid attention to the capacitors
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:00.840]   'cause those were the ones that were most likely to fail.
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:03.160]   - Right, there's a $40 million lawsuit now
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:06.000]   from a North Carolina internet services company.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.680]   They say that Dell tried to hide the problem.
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:11.720]   There's also a risk because these capacitors
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:13.440]   could also burst into flame.
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:16.720]   You could have a, not merely bad math calculations,
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:19.000]   you could have a serious problem.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.920]   - But did anyone, did anyone get them burst into flame?
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.760]   Did anybody get hurt?
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:26.200]   Or is this just what some lawyers who have found a way?
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:27.160]   - Well, that's a good question.
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:28.160]   I don't know, Jerry.
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:30.320]   - Yeah, these are all pretty low voltage.
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:34.520]   Normally the symptom of this is just the machine locking up.
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:36.280]   It just, it freezes.
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:37.840]   And you say-- - The machine doesn't work
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:40.000]   and they replace some other boards, right?
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.520]   When you-- - Sometimes with the same bad--
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:45.120]   - Sometimes on the dongle, rather than it was
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:48.960]   a bad capacitor, but they still replace some other board.
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:50.280]   Is that not correct?
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:51.840]   - Sometimes with the bad capacitors
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:53.480]   on the new motherboard as well, yeah.
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:54.320]   - Yeah.
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:55.640]   - If you've got a bad supplier,
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:58.000]   you're gonna have bad capacitors.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.720]   - You know, that's a good question.
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:02.920]   11.8 million computers were shipped
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:05.320]   with these bad capacitors.
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:08.800]   - And these computers have like 15 or 20 of these capacitors
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:09.640]   on the motherboard. - Yeah.
[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:10.480]   - It's pretty-- - Yep.
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:11.320]   - They're even-- - For the most part,
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:13.960]   OptiPlex is again from 2003 to 2000.
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:16.440]   - So what's pretty likely the machine was gonna fail
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:18.360]   if it had that bad lot in it?
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:19.200]   - Oh yes.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:21.360]   They say 97% chance the machine would fail.
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:22.200]   - And or later?
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:24.400]   - They replace them all as soon as they--
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:25.880]   - Well-- - As something complained.
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:30.240]   - The issue is that Dell had an active policy,
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:33.840]   not according to these documents, had an active policy,
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:36.240]   not to say that's what was wrong.
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:37.080]   - Not to take the contact with--
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:37.920]   - Of course they do.
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.360]   Apple has an active policy not to admit anything.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:41.840]   (laughing)
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:43.760]   So you're just saying it's endemic.
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:45.280]   It's in the nature of business.
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:47.440]   - I'm saying that it's the normal way people
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:49.280]   do business for heaven's sake,
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:51.040]   and that it's the normal way that law
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.000]   you try to get themselves rich,
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.840]   'cause you can make certain that the client
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:58.000]   is never gonna get a dime out of this class action suit.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.520]   The client will get a coupon
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.360]   worth a new capacity or something.
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:03.240]   (laughing)
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:06.480]   - Well now we have these alleged lawsuits that are filed,
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:07.360]   actually they're not alleged.
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:08.760]   There are several lawsuits that were filed
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:10.200]   against Apple with respect to the--
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:11.040]   - That's right.
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:14.520]   - I phone for antenna, and they're saying
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:18.440]   that the antenna was defective and Apple knew it.
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:22.000]   And what do you have to say about that?
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.240]   I mean, the antenna was a design choice.
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:28.560]   - The only thing that could happen I think would be
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:33.040]   if the lawsuits don't get just dismissed out of hand,
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:35.040]   through the process of discovery,
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:37.240]   we would get access to documents,
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:40.800]   and it would be interesting to know what Apple knew
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:43.280]   and when they knew it, if anything.
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:45.680]   I think that's probably unlikely.
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:48.040]   - But it ain't my business.
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:50.520]   My business is to use Apple products
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:53.400]   until I don't like them, and then I'll go buy something else.
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:55.200]   - And that is Steve Jobs' defense.
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:57.560]   In fact, that's what it said in that press release is,
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:00.520]   "We'll give you 30 days to decide you want something else,
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:02.560]   and if you want something else, go out."
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:04.480]   - Pioneer's are the ones with the arrows
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:06.640]   in their box for heaven's sake.
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:08.760]   I mean, I've been doing that for 40 years.
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:11.080]   I've been using equipment, some of which wasn't.
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:13.280]   And I had two of those in until--
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:15.880]   - Well Jerry, wouldn't the bad chip sentence--
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.080]   - I think that's why you're sort of careful
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:18.640]   when you sit down, right Jerry?
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:19.920]   - Wouldn't you agree though, Jerry,
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.440]   that the right thing for a company to do
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:23.160]   would be to acknowledge the problem and fix it
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:25.720]   as opposed to Stonewall, Deny,
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:26.560]   put it off as long as--
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:27.720]   - Well it's the right thing to do.
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:29.160]   Now tell me who does it.
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:32.520]   - Well apparently not Dell or Apple.
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:33.640]   - Who else?
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:34.640]   - I don't know.
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:35.480]   That's a good question.
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:36.760]   - Thank you, somebody who does what you think
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:38.560]   is the right thing.
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:40.760]   - I can name one, but it's not a technology company.
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:41.600]   - Who's that?
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:43.280]   - LL Bean.
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:44.800]   - Yes, that's true.
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:46.280]   You have a problem with your water-proof foods.
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:48.840]   - And any flour used to be, it's no longer the case,
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:50.640]   but at one time Eddie Bauer's stuff
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:52.520]   was always guaranteed forever.
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:53.560]   If you didn't like something,
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:55.320]   you brought it back 20 years later,
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:57.200]   I didn't like this jacket very much.
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.120]   Oh, all right.
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:01.120]   - I don't know if you've seen these--
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:02.280]   - Notice they went out of,
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:05.440]   they didn't exactly go out of business with Eddie Bauer.
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:06.280]   - They're not flourishing.
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:08.480]   - Don't go wrong with Eddie Bauer.
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:09.400]   - Now I gotta warn you,
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:12.160]   there's a little bit of profanity in the video
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.080]   that I'm about to play.
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:16.280]   This is a very funny video.
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:20.720]   Everybody in our studio audience is now turning
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:23.040]   to face the screen and listening carefully.
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:26.920]   The very funny video made by a Best Buy,
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:28.680]   I believe a Best Buy employee.
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:29.840]   - Right, Best Buy.
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:34.840]   - About the typical iPhone customer.
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:36.920]   I'll just play a little bit of this.
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:38.600]   We'll bloop out in the download,
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:39.840]   we'll bloop out the profanity,
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:42.400]   but for those of you watching live,
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:45.160]   just cover your shell-like ears here.
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:46.960]   - Welcome to "Phone Mart."
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.200]   How may I help you?
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:49.520]   - iPhone 4.
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:51.400]   Where is the iPhone 4?
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:52.760]   I need an iPhone 4.
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:56.640]   - Oh, I'm very sorry, but we are currently sold out.
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:00.680]   However, we did finally get some more HTC Evo's in.
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:01.520]   - What?
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:02.800]   What is that?
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:03.920]   Is it an iPhone?
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:06.720]   - No, it is that 4G phone on Sprint.
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:09.080]   - If it's not an iPhone, why would I want it?
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:10.960]   - Well, it's similar to an iPhone,
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.600]   but has a bigger screen.
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:13.560]   - I don't care.
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:16.680]   - The internet speeds are around three times faster.
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:17.640]   - I don't care.
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:19.560]   - It has a higher resolution camera
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:21.160]   on both the front and the back.
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:22.160]   - I don't care.
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:24.400]   - And it doesn't require you to be on Wi-Fi
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:25.840]   to use video chat.
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:26.800]   - I don't care.
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:30.360]   - Its battery is replaceable, as is the memory card.
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:31.320]   - I don't care.
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:33.120]   - It is highly customizable.
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:35.480]   Everything from the widgets to the icons,
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:38.000]   the fonts and even has video wallpaper.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000]   - I don't care.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.680]   - The monthly bill is cheaper.
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:41.680]   - I don't care.
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:43.200]   - It prints money.
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:44.160]   - I don't care.
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:46.200]   - It's a red dot to three wishes,
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:48.960]   even if one of those wishes is for an iPhone.
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:49.960]   - I don't care.
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:52.280]   - It has an app that will build you an island
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:55.840]   and then it transforms into a jet and flies you there.
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:56.680]   - I don't care.
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:59.120]   - It is mother indestructible.
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:00.680]   - I don't care about any of that.
[01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:01.760]   - Okay fine.
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:04.880]   Then what the hell entices you about the iPhone for,
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.680]   if you don't mind me asking?
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:07.800]   - It is an iPhone.
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:10.120]   - You do realize that doesn't mean anything.
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:11.440]   It's a brand.
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:14.840]   They could put out a brick and call it an iPhone
[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:16.200]   if they wanted to.
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:18.560]   - Yes, but it's the best phone.
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.120]   - Can you explain how?
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:21.600]   - I can download apps to it.
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:22.680]   - Big deal.
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:23.600]   (laughing)
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:24.840]   - Anyway, it goes on.
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:28.960]   It's actually totally inspired.
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:30.760]   It's brilliant and the kid who made it
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:33.280]   is about to lose his job at Best Buy.
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:34.320]   - Aww.
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:36.400]   - Because I don't know why.
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:38.920]   I don't know what their justification is for.
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:40.760]   - Well in fact, he's been suspended
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:41.960]   and now they're trying to figure out
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:42.960]   how to make it permanent.
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:46.280]   So I don't think they know yet what the justification is either
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:48.760]   that would pass the attorneys.
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:49.880]   - Brian Mopen is a toy.
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:50.720]   - Oh, all right.
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:52.200]   Droid should hire him immediately.
[01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:53.680]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:56.040]   Get him a job at a sprint store.
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:14:00.160]   Brian Mopen is 25 year old Kansas City, Missourian.
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:02.280]   He's been working at the Best Buy selling mobile phones
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:03.720]   for the last three and a half years.
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:06.080]   They suspended him indefinitely
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:08.680]   because the video, which currently has millions of views
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:11.760]   on YouTube, offended somebody at corporate.
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:14.180]   They felt quote, "It disparaged a brand they carried
[01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:15.360]   "as well as the store itself
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.840]   "and we're fearful of stockholders and customers
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:20.680]   "being turned off to Best Buy mobile."
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:21.840]   - Did it mention Best Buy?
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:22.680]   - The video mentions Best Buy.
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:23.840]   - Not once.
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:25.800]   - In fact, at the beginning, it says some,
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:29.480]   you know, random name for a phone store.
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:31.000]   - Yeah, they don't have a case.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.440]   I think he may make his next couple of years salary
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:35.360]   in the lawsuit.
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:36.360]   - Yeah.
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:39.840]   - Well, I don't know if Missouri is an at-will state.
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:42.240]   I mean, in California, they can fire him for any reason at all.
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:44.360]   - Well, they ought to move him into creative services.
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:45.200]   - Yeah, they're carrying like me.
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:46.600]   - They'd have to have him be able to fire him
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:48.080]   because they don't like his look.
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:48.920]   - Right.
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:49.840]   - That's...
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:50.680]   - Right.
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:52.600]   - He did make, by the way, a rebuttal video.
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:56.840]   It's not as funny, but it's a video to...
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:58.800]   I don't know if this was after he got in trouble,
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:01.480]   probably not, but I think he felt bad about the iPhones.
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:03.160]   - Welcome to the Apple Store.
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:04.600]   How may I help you today?
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.320]   - Can you fix my phone?
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:08.680]   I heard you have the genius leagues here.
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:09.920]   - Can they fix phones?
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:10.920]   - Yes.
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:12.320]   Which iPhone do you have?
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:14.400]   - I have the HTC Evo.
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:15.240]   - Oh.
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:16.440]   I see.
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:17.960]   That's not an iPhone though.
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:21.160]   - I read on the internet that it was just like the iPhone,
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:22.000]   but better.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.160]   - I see.
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:24.960]   Well, what is wrong with the phone?
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:27.080]   - It keeps saying my app has crashed
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:29.760]   and the battery only stays charged for one hour.
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:32.480]   - Well, it could be caused by Google's programming.
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:33.720]   - Oh, my goodness.
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:34.960]   - We've done with the takeaway
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:36.520]   and then for just an iPhone.
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:39.240]   But there's more MPs than the iPhone.
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:41.240]   - So it's actually, he's quite fair to both.
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:44.200]   In two videos, he definitely gives you
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:46.440]   the pros and cons on both.
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:48.080]   So I think the guy, you're right.
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:51.520]   He's, at this point, it's all good for him.
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:53.440]   - Let's just all pay him to keep making videos.
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:54.760]   - Yeah, no kidding.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:56.120]   - Yeah, subscribe.
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:59.240]   - Yeah, yeah, he needs a donor base.
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:03.120]   I talk about making money.
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:05.760]   I'm gonna talk about a viral video
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:10.760]   that made the family $150,000 in merchandising and more.
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:12.920]   But before I do that,
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:14.360]   I wanna make a little money myself
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:17.120]   and tell you a little bit about Audible.com.
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:20.080]   We all know Audible is the bookstore online.
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:22.200]   Jerry, you have some books on Audible, as a matter of fact.
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:23.600]   - I have lots of books on Audible
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:27.000]   and I can tell you that they are very fair to authors.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:32.000]   They have, I have been getting quite reasonable,
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:36.000]   royally checked from Audible for some time now.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.480]   - That's good to know.
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:39.240]   - I endorse Audible.
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:41.080]   My notebook's on Audible.
[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:43.080]   They actually do a very good job.
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:43.920]   - Oh, I love them.
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:47.280]   - I got to do your commercial, but I can tell you,
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:49.240]   they get good readers.
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:52.160]   The people who read them actually have read the book
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:54.520]   and understand something about them.
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:57.840]   I've even gotten questions on pronunciation
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:59.000]   from some of the people.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.920]   And you know, in mid-aliens and alien languages,
[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:05.400]   it is not always obvious how those words
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:07.680]   would be pronounced like the intro.
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:10.280]   - Oh yeah, that's the Larry Niven, the protector book.
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:11.640]   They did a great job with it.
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:13.760]   - It's quick as our moten gods die.
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:14.600]   - Oh, they have that.
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:16.800]   - It was in fact Larry Niven's phrase, not mine,
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:19.080]   but it wasn't, but it from Mo.
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:24.120]   In any event, Audible just does a very good job
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:25.560]   of reading those books.
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:28.720]   They've got most of the ones Niven and I have done
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:32.680]   that many of mine alone are unaudible and they're very good.
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:35.280]   - Well, as you can see, it's in my library, the Moten's God's Eye.
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:37.840]   I listened to both Lucifer's Hammer and the Motes in God's Eye,
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:41.120]   one right after the other, which is about 40 or 50 hours
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:42.640]   worth of entertainment.
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.720]   You can get them both absolutely free
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:46.160]   and Jerry still gets his royalty.
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:51.000]   All you got to do is go to audible.com/twit2.
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.200]   You sign up for the Platinum account.
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:54.040]   That's the one I have, it's two books a month,
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:55.400]   which is my minimum.
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:56.920]   I know people have multiple Platinum accounts,
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:58.320]   people with long commutes.
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:17:59.920]   Two books a month is about right for me.
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:01.080]   Those first two books are free.
[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:04.800]   You can cancel at any time and you get to keep the books forever.
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:08.520]   But don't just stop with the Moten God's Eye or Lucifer's Hammer.
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:12.680]   There's also Star Swarm and Footfall and Oath of Fieldy.
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:17.240]   I mean, there's a great Jerry Parnell collection right there in Ferno.
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:19.800]   What's your favorite of these, Jerry, Escape from Hell?
[01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:24.040]   - Well, the collaborations are one there.
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:25.120]   They're only one of those.
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.520]   It's a single one so far, but they're coming out
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:29.840]   and more from Audible later.
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:32.480]   It starts with one which is a juvenile.
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:33.400]   - Oh, that's right.
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:34.640]   That's right.
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:36.840]   So that's another thing that's great about Audible.
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:39.640]   Kids love Audible and it's a great way,
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:41.960]   believe it or not, to get them reading.
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:46.840]   I have a friend who, daughter is a big Harry Potter fan.
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:47.960]   She's only in second grade.
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:49.400]   She's actually reading the books,
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:50.320]   which is pretty impressive.
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:51.480]   This is a very smart kid,
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:54.400]   but she loves listening to them as well.
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:57.080]   Audio books are a great way to introduce kids to chapter books,
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.760]   a little ahead of time, get them reading ahead of level.
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:01.680]   And kids just love them.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:05.000]   For long card trips, for dad and mom too, in the car,
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.480]   or at the gym, I listen all the time at the gym.
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:10.640]   Audible.com/twit2, give it a try.
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:12.840]   We're Audible fanatics here at the Twitcottage,
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:14.280]   and I know you will be too.
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:16.440]   In fact, I hear from people all the time say,
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:18.280]   I stopped listening to your show.
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:20.040]   I'm just listening to Audible now.
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:22.520]   That's Oke, you're allowed.
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:24.480]   It's okay, I understand.
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:28.440]   So did you ever see the viral video David after Dennis?
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:30.640]   I'll play a little bit of it.
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:32.360]   It's a pretty old viral video.
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:33.800]   It's kind of a--
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:35.080]   - It's a tree.
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:36.520]   - Yeah, I know.
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:39.840]   - This father videotapes his kid who's just had dental surgery
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:42.000]   and is still stoned out of his gourd.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.640]   He's seven years old. - Did it go?
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:48.280]   - I didn't steal anything.
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:49.120]   - Yeah.
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:54.160]   - Whoa, I'm so sorry.
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:56.280]   So this video, believe it or not,
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:20:01.280]   they have made $150,000 off of it.
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:04.560]   Not only from Google ads, but they sell T-shirts.
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:08.600]   Kind of an amazing story.
[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:12.200]   The guy shot it on a flip camera just intending it
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:15.160]   to share it with friends, not put it publicly,
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:18.120]   but he didn't have a choice on YouTube.
[01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:19.360]   It had to be public.
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:20.760]   And now, I should check,
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:21.800]   I didn't see what the numbers were,
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:23.920]   but millions of people have watched this video.
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:27.440]   It just shows you, it's possible to make money
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:28.280]   on YouTube videos.
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:32.080]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, 62 million views.
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:32.920]   Wow.
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:35.680]   62 million views.
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:37.720]   - Good grief.
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:42.360]   - And so it's because there's also ads on that YouTube page.
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:43.840]   - There's ads on it,
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:46.160]   and YouTube shares some of that revenue.
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:51.360]   Kind of amazing that there's that much money
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:52.760]   in viral videos.
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:55.600]   I don't know if there's anything more to say about that.
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:59.680]   Rumor that Google is gonna do a Google Me,
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:00.880]   we talked about it last week.
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:03.240]   Kevin Rose spread that rumor originally on Twitter.
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:04.520]   He was asked by somebody,
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:05.760]   we don't know who to take it down.
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.640]   He did, didn't matter, it was too late.
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:10.040]   And now, the world seems to agree,
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:12.960]   Google's gonna do a Facebook clone called Google Me.
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:15.920]   Eric Schmidt was asked about it
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:17.640]   during a speech in London this week.
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:19.840]   His denial is a non-denial denial.
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:22.280]   He said, "That would be a product announcement,
[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:24.040]   "and I won't say."
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:25.400]   (laughing)
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:28.120]   - Well, I love Jerry's Facebook page.
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:29.400]   - What's your Facebook page, Jerry?
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:31.400]   I don't have a Facebook account, so I can't see it.
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:32.240]   - I have never seen it.
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:35.040]   My daughter had it up, and they maintained it,
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:37.680]   and at some point I suppose I should go look at it,
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:40.880]   but in fact, I have never seen my Facebook page,
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:41.800]   isn't that awful?
[01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:42.640]   - So I probably--
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:44.400]   - It's hooked right into Twitter.
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:46.240]   (laughing)
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:48.240]   - I suspect it does.
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:52.920]   - My daughter was an Army Intelligence Officer,
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:56.920]   and she's now in publication.
[01:21:56.920 --> 01:22:00.560]   She's got a PhD in anthropology.
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:04.080]   She barothesis has changed a lot of what we knew
[01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:06.760]   about 5,000 years ago.
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:08.720]   So she's a pretty sharp girl,
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:10.560]   and she pretty well runs that thing.
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:12.440]   I haven't paid much attention to it.
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:13.840]   - Boy, you look good on that page.
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:15.600]   - You do, look at that sharp tuxedo.
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:17.120]   And Jerry, when you post on here,
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:20.080]   then it's your words, but your daughter's writing them?
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:21.000]   'Cause I see posts.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.120]   - I was able to assume that so.
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:25.600]   She probably takes them out of my books and things.
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:26.600]   (laughing)
[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:27.440]   - This is--
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:30.720]   - We've never really even corresponded on it.
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:33.960]   She just said she thought that somebody out to have one,
[01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:37.080]   so she's got it going, and she's done a good job with it.
[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:38.600]   - It could be worse, she could name it.
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:39.760]   My dad says, and--
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:40.600]   - I was just gonna say--
[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:41.960]   - That's from the dinner table.
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:43.280]   - Yeah, wouldn't that be wonderful.
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:45.840]   - And publish a, you know, this guy,
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:47.000]   this talk about guys made money.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.040]   This was a Twitter account.
[01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:50.640]   The guy, he's 29 years old, lives with a 74 year old dad
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:53.480]   who is a little outspoken, shall we say.
[01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:56.560]   It is now a book, it has been an option for,
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:58.040]   is it a TV show or a movie?
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:22:59.880]   - Shat, Shatner is gonna do a series.
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:02.200]   - William Shatner is gonna be the dad.
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:06.480]   See, Jerry, there is some value to Twitter.
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:09.320]   - You're convincing me, maybe.
[01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:12.240]   I still get rich of Twitter by telling people
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:14.080]   when I'm going to have a peanut butter sandwich.
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.520]   (laughing)
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:18.120]   - Don't knock it, don't knock it.
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:19.200]   So this is--
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:21.360]   - I have a very brief Twitter story.
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:22.200]   - Yeah?
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:26.160]   - When this first blog post I put up,
[01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:28.680]   last week was published,
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:31.440]   I went on the Antennasys Twitter account
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:34.480]   and I tweeted just the fact that there's a new blog post,
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:36.360]   which I do every time I do a new blog post.
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:37.200]   - Right.
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:42.200]   - And the next day, my unique visitor account,
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:46.360]   which is typically around 11 to 15 unique visitors
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.280]   and one of them is my mom,
[01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:53.400]   went to 89,000 unique visitors.
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:54.440]   - And I'm one of them, by the way.
[01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:56.280]   First time I've been there and you know what Spencer,
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:58.440]   I booked Marked it and I'm gonna come and back there.
[01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:00.040]   So this is good for you.
[01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:02.720]   - Okay, you got me convinced.
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:04.480]   Thank you Spencer.
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:05.560]   - You're welcome.
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:07.240]   - This is fantastic, I'm not sure.
[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:09.680]   I'm a worthy old codger, I'm not sure.
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:13.600]   - I can think of anything worth saying in 128 characters.
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:15.720]   - Oh, I think you, that's what's so nice
[01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:17.680]   is by being limited to 140,
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:20.040]   you sort of, you know, you're not being expected
[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:21.720]   to write a book every time.
[01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:24.560]   It's just, you know, how dry was the peanut butter?
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:28.720]   - All of those courses I took in formal English
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:33.360]   on poetry on odes and sonnets and that sort of thing,
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.760]   maybe that will help.
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:37.320]   - I think Jerry, you should write all your tweets
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:39.640]   in the form of a sonnet.
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:42.760]   - It should all be an iambic pentameter, there you go.
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:43.680]   - Do you know, what is that?
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:46.240]   - The dot that I would follow Jerry.
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:47.080]   I would follow.
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:49.960]   - Who wouldn't the drum and makes a dreadful noise?
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:50.800]   That's one.
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:51.640]   - The tongue.
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:53.800]   - Or not to be, that is the question,
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:56.960]   but you'll notice that question ends with a soft sound
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:59.240]   and it has 11 beats in it.
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:00.240]   - And besides that, there's a text-
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:01.600]   - That's sweet, it's already been taken.
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:04.240]   - But it is an ambic pentameter as well.
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:06.680]   - I think Jerry, this is how you make it interesting
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:07.800]   for yourself.
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:10.000]   You create this artificial structure.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:10.960]   You say, okay, I'll tweet,
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:13.400]   but it has to be iambic pentameter or something.
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:15.880]   - There's a thought.
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:19.520]   - Or maybe all of it put together will become an ode.
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:21.640]   - Be right in a sonnet there.
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:24.560]   - Oh, there's not a sonnet.
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:25.760]   - I'm sorry.
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:27.160]   - Shocking, shocking.
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:30.080]   - And I have to say, for me, it's great feedback too.
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:33.280]   I learn as much from the people who follow me as,
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:35.840]   as I think, or more than they do for me.
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:37.600]   So it does create something.
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:40.480]   - I did just leave on mine, but that's just on the mail.
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:43.640]   I mean, I don't need to tweet to do that.
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:45.680]   - Something about it, give it a shot.
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:46.840]   I'll bet you get hooked.
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:48.960]   - Oh man, this just cracks me up
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:50.600]   'cause Steve was so resistant for,
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:53.480]   Steve echoed everything you've ever said, Jerry.
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:55.560]   - Well, you know, for many years,
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:58.760]   I used to say that I wasn't the smartest guy in the world,
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:01.520]   but I had such a long enough readership
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:03.000]   that there were very few questions
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.160]   I couldn't get an answer to because somebody--
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:06.000]   - Right.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.360]   - Reads me, knows the answer.
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:08.200]   - That's right.
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:09.240]   - And he's going to send it to me.
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:11.160]   Well, that's still the case.
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:14.840]   There is very little I can say in my day book,
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:16.840]   I hate the word blog,
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:19.520]   but there's very little I can say in my day book
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:21.120]   that doesn't get me some answers
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:24.320]   from people who really know the subjects a lot better than I do.
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:25.160]   - That's kind of--
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:26.640]   - It might actually be more true today, Jerry,
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:27.880]   than it used to be, even.
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:28.720]   - Yeah.
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:30.280]   - Yeah, and I think that's kind of what happens on Twitter.
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:32.920]   - Well, you may remember that in 1980,
[01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:35.400]   I said that by the year 2000,
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:38.080]   everybody in Western civilization
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:40.440]   will be able to get the answer to any question
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:42.680]   that actually has an answer.
[01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:44.280]   I said that in 1980,
[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:46.400]   and everybody said I was crazy,
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:49.440]   and of course I had to say Western civilization,
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:50.720]   'cause I certainly didn't believe
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:53.960]   the Soviet Union would be gone by 2000.
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:56.120]   - Well, now in fact, I mean, Twitter's very much global.
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:58.080]   In fact, the new Twitter statistics are
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:26:59.920]   that Asia tweets more than anybody.
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:00.760]   - Yeah.
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:02.960]   - And it kind of does center the internet on a bio-
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:03.800]   - It does.
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:04.640]   You can't tweet from China.
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:06.440]   I found that out when I was in China.
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:08.280]   One last story, and then we'll move on,
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:11.840]   and I wanna pose this question to you, gray hairs,
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:14.960]   because I think this is unprecedented.
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:17.320]   Microsoft announced a phone six weeks ago,
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:19.240]   and they called it the Kin.
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:23.040]   They released it, and they have canceled it in six weeks,
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:24.320]   and I cannot think of another time
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:25.560]   that Microsoft or anybody else
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:28.320]   could have killed a product this fast.
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:30.280]   - I'm so impressed by the speed.
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:33.200]   (laughing)
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:36.120]   - The fastest failure in I can think of,
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:40.100]   six weeks from announcement to you can't buy it anymore.
[01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:45.080]   - It took 'em longer to kill their stupid soundboard than that.
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:47.560]   - That's right, that was an early Microsoft flop.
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:54.520]   - In that phone, in fact, the antenna was your ear.
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:57.440]   That you had a hook a wire to your ear.
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:58.280]   - What?
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:00.120]   - No. - No, it's true.
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:01.920]   - And if you hook one wire to each ear,
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:03.560]   it actually was a smart ear.
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:04.400]   - He's teasing us.
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:05.400]   He's teasing us now.
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:07.000]   I can tell he's teasing us.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:07.840]   (laughing)
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:09.520]   It is a funny looking phone.
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:11.280]   It's a little tiny little pebble of a phone.
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:14.560]   I don't know where you would put the antenna in this thing,
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:16.640]   'cause there's nowhere you cannot hold it.
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:19.280]   I mean, you have to hold it in your hand.
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:20.200]   - That is tiny.
[01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:22.320]   - If this phone doesn't have an antenna problem,
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:24.560]   then Apple's got a PR problem.
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:27.600]   - Well, the evidence is that it disappeared in six weeks.
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:28.440]   - Yeah, maybe.
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:29.280]   - Isn't it?
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:30.120]   You can buy it.
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:33.120]   This is the Amazon page for the Kin One,
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:38.120]   the list price, $349, the sale price, one penny.
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:42.040]   - Yeah, this just shows how clueless Microsoft is.
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:42.960]   - What went wrong?
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:46.320]   - That they could think that they were just envious
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.240]   of everybody else doing it right.
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:49.720]   And they said, well, we're Microsoft.
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:52.280]   So we're just gonna do one too.
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:55.120]   And you know, I mean, you know, Jerry knows
[01:28:55.120 --> 01:29:00.120]   that Microsoft doesn't create things for a market.
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:04.320]   They just force what they have to fit into
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:05.640]   where the market has gone.
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:10.720]   It's like they didn't have an internet network capable OS.
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:13.040]   So they just stuck it on the internet,
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:15.160]   you know, stuck windows on the internet.
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:17.440]   And then we had years of security problems.
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:20.360]   When phone started getting smart,
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:22.360]   they didn't have a smartphone OS.
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:25.200]   So they just tried to sort of squeeze windows down
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:26.880]   and we know how well that worked.
[01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:32.920]   - Well, I am not as anti-Microsoft as you seem to be
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:36.080]   as you historically have been,
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:40.920]   but I am hardly one of their toadies either.
[01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:41.760]   - What do you do?
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:42.760]   What do you do for Microsoft now?
[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:43.640]   Where are you struggling?
[01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:45.640]   You're just struggling to keep up.
[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:46.840]   - I don't think they have.
[01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:51.640]   I think that Bill Gates always ran scared, you know.
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:55.040]   I mean, I knew Bill back when he was actually running
[01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:58.040]   the company, I used to could win bets from people
[01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:00.960]   by saying I could get Bill Gates on the telephone.
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:02.880]   And the way you do it is you style
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:05.840]   the Microsoft switchboard number at night.
[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:08.080]   He'd be the only one there.
[01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:09.720]   - Those days. - And he'd answer the phone?
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:11.280]   - Those days are long gone, Joe.
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:13.600]   - They are long gone, but he ran scared
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:15.200]   and he paid attention.
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:18.880]   There isn't anybody doing that now.
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:19.720]   - Right.
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:22.960]   - And he understood that his company was number one
[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:25.320]   for as long as he could keep it there.
[01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:28.160]   And he had some fiefdoms at work.
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:31.880]   The office fiefdom was run very well by,
[01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:36.080]   oh, come on, we both know all know his name.
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:38.400]   He bought a bowling alley after he retired.
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:43.400]   Anyway, but it isn't the same Microsoft anymore.
[01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:48.480]   And it's trying to be run by different crews
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:50.160]   and they don't have the same,
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:52.600]   they're not scared and they're not as hungry.
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:56.240]   I don't know that they can survive this new wave.
[01:30:56.240 --> 01:31:00.320]   - You know, it might be time for them to be done.
[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:03.040]   - The interesting thing, and Paul Thoreau,
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:04.040]   if you were here with Pointless,
[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:05.760]   at his there are Windows weekly hosts
[01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:07.760]   and a really, really great guy.
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:11.240]   Microsoft's revenue is still huge.
[01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:13.160]   You know, you talk about the market cap,
[01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:15.800]   the Apple beat Microsoft's market cap,
[01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:17.520]   but there's no question that Microsoft
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:19.800]   is still extraordinarily profitable.
[01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:20.800]   - Yeah.
[01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:22.640]   - A massive company.
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:23.720]   I guess the question is,
[01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:27.160]   is the trend in Microsoft's favor or not?
[01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:29.240]   In other words, is Microsoft,
[01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:31.720]   clearly Microsoft is still doing very, very well.
[01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:33.240]   - Right, so they have a ton of inertia.
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:35.960]   And I would have to agree that the trend
[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:37.560]   is not in their favor.
[01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:40.600]   When you look at open source in the long term,
[01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:44.480]   you look at all of this next generation portability.
[01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:47.120]   I mean, you know, Jerry is jumping up and down
[01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:49.440]   and carrying an iPad around, as am I.
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:51.760]   I mean, we're traditionally Windows people.
[01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:54.000]   - Microsoft said this week that a billion people
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.520]   use Microsoft Office, one billion people.
[01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:58.560]   - Yeah, and Office is pretty good.
[01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:00.680]   For all the people who say they don't like it,
[01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:03.560]   the fact is that most of the books written in this world
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:05.200]   are written on Microsoft Word.
[01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:06.680]   - Except Jerry, I remember very well
[01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:08.640]   that you were the guy who wanted a clean screen.
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:10.080]   You didn't want Microsoft Word to write with us.
[01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:13.000]   - I didn't want Microsoft Word for a very long time,
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.180]   and Bill, was it Peter's?
[01:32:17.180 --> 01:32:18.620]   - The-- - It took the boss away from us.
[01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:20.980]   - The product manager came down here and said,
[01:32:20.980 --> 01:32:23.620]   "What would it get to cause you to use it?"
[01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:25.980]   So I told him three things to put into it
[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:29.380]   and by God they did, and at that point I was doomed.
[01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:30.260]   - You had to use it.
[01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:31.100]   They'd done it for you.
[01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:32.220]   It was the Parnell feature.
[01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:36.700]   - You will notice that with Office 2009,
[01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:40.140]   with Word, you can do that Control F1 feature,
[01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:42.700]   and most of that ribbon goes away,
[01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:46.220]   and you've got what amounts to the old clean screen again.
[01:32:46.220 --> 01:32:48.620]   - So you use Word to write?
[01:32:48.620 --> 01:32:53.540]   - I use Word to write, but I use it with using that Control F1.
[01:32:53.540 --> 01:32:54.420]   - Right.
[01:32:54.420 --> 01:32:55.540]   - To clean it up.
[01:32:55.540 --> 01:32:57.740]   - To clean it up so there's nothing up there,
[01:32:57.740 --> 01:32:58.860]   except what I do.
[01:32:58.860 --> 01:33:01.060]   Oh yeah, I like type ahead, Leo.
[01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:03.180]   I like automatic word correction.
[01:33:03.180 --> 01:33:04.780]   I'm a sloppy typist.
[01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:06.980]   I type TEH quite a lot.
[01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:07.820]   - Right.
[01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:09.820]   - And I don't like to have to go back and correct,
[01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:13.020]   and I like it that it automatically corrects that.
[01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:17.900]   Also, I like being able to have special dictionaries
[01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:20.020]   because I have a lot of character names
[01:33:20.020 --> 01:33:21.900]   that I don't want in a normal dictionary.
[01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:24.300]   I don't want them to be specific to the work
[01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:25.300]   I'm working on.
[01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:29.900]   - Well, I guess it's not over for Microsoft,
[01:33:29.900 --> 01:33:32.900]   but it's certainly no longer a Microsoft era.
[01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:33.740]   - That's true.
[01:33:33.740 --> 01:33:37.060]   - The Kin is a surprising,
[01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:39.140]   surprising stumble for a company that's done
[01:33:39.140 --> 01:33:40.340]   really so well.
[01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:41.860]   - But wasn't it inevitable?
[01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:44.500]   The problem is that the hardware
[01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:46.380]   that is available to everybody
[01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:49.420]   is so much better than software.
[01:33:49.420 --> 01:33:51.100]   That nobody really can keep,
[01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:53.340]   but there is enormous room for--
[01:33:53.340 --> 01:33:55.740]   - Well, let me put in everything we do.
[01:33:55.740 --> 01:33:56.540]   - Let me say this again,
[01:33:56.540 --> 01:33:58.180]   'cause I think it's really important what you just said.
[01:33:58.180 --> 01:33:59.980]   The hardware available to us today
[01:33:59.980 --> 01:34:01.900]   is better than the software.
[01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:03.020]   - By a lot.
[01:34:03.020 --> 01:34:03.980]   - Why is that?
[01:34:03.980 --> 01:34:06.660]   - Because--
[01:34:06.660 --> 01:34:07.740]   - Isn't hardware hard?
[01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:08.740]   Isn't hardware hard?
[01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:09.580]   - Hardware harder?
[01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:12.020]   - Of course, law doesn't scale for software
[01:34:12.020 --> 01:34:13.700]   that takes smart people,
[01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:15.700]   and we don't have any way of doing that.
[01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:19.660]   And until we get the singularity,
[01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:23.740]   where you have computers designing themselves,
[01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:25.220]   if that ever happens,
[01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:30.220]   AI and you get assisted evolution
[01:34:30.220 --> 01:34:33.420]   rather than Mendelian evolution and so forth,
[01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:34.660]   the Markian evolution,
[01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:37.940]   then maybe we will software will begin to catch up.
[01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:40.340]   But the hardware is gonna get better again.
[01:34:40.340 --> 01:34:41.220]   - And the other thing is--
[01:34:41.220 --> 01:34:44.020]   - Mendelian tell's got in the queue for heaven,
[01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:48.380]   and we can't use the capacity of the hardware we have.
[01:34:48.380 --> 01:34:51.940]   - The other thing is that hardware has to be correct,
[01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:55.540]   and software, sadly, doesn't have to be correct.
[01:34:55.540 --> 01:34:57.580]   It can be sort of approximate,
[01:34:57.580 --> 01:34:59.220]   and the system appears to work,
[01:34:59.220 --> 01:35:02.100]   but if the hardware is not correct, it doesn't go all.
[01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:04.300]   - It's built Microsoft.
[01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:09.300]   Everybody, the OS2 Windows War was very instructive.
[01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:12.300]   IBM was a company that
[01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:17.740]   fried itself on doing it right,
[01:35:17.740 --> 01:35:19.860]   and they weren't gonna put things out there
[01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:22.300]   until it was really done well.
[01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:25.660]   Meanwhile, Gates would share the ship tomorrow
[01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:28.940]   because it doesn't matter how bad it works
[01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:31.220]   on the equipment people have now.
[01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:33.020]   The next generation of equipment,
[01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:35.660]   it's going to work very well.
[01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:40.660]   And he essentially bet everything he had on Moore's law,
[01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:43.220]   and he won. - Yep.
[01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:46.460]   - But that was Gates,
[01:35:46.460 --> 01:35:49.380]   and he was willing to take chances like that.
[01:35:49.380 --> 01:35:52.380]   - I think Microsoft needs an injection of new blood,
[01:35:52.380 --> 01:35:57.380]   young engineers who are given the freedom and the cash
[01:35:57.380 --> 01:35:59.460]   to go out and design something
[01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:03.180]   that will have to be better than what Apple can offer.
[01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:05.900]   - Sure, and they wanted them for a very long time,
[01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:07.740]   but to trouble is Google got them all.
[01:36:07.740 --> 01:36:09.100]   - Google got all the brains.
[01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:10.060]   (laughs)
[01:36:10.060 --> 01:36:12.900]   One of the things that addresses me about Apple,
[01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:15.060]   which also upsets people about Apple,
[01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:19.300]   is that Apple is willing to obsolete their stuff very quickly.
[01:36:19.300 --> 01:36:21.540]   I mean, it upsets people when a new version
[01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:25.100]   of the phone comes out after two days before
[01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:26.940]   they bought the prior version.
[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:29.180]   And one thing that happens when companies
[01:36:29.180 --> 01:36:30.820]   get big like Microsoft,
[01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:33.540]   is they have so much investment
[01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:37.180]   in their own existing product line
[01:36:37.180 --> 01:36:39.140]   that they cannot obsolete it.
[01:36:39.140 --> 01:36:42.700]   They have to simply creep it forward very slowly.
[01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:44.380]   - Well, Gates wouldn't have put it that way.
[01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:48.540]   He'd tell, and I know this, I mean, he's told me himself.
[01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:50.700]   He felt an obligation to people
[01:36:50.700 --> 01:36:53.220]   who had bought previous generations of the stuff
[01:36:53.220 --> 01:36:56.860]   that they wouldn't just be suddenly left in the large.
[01:36:56.860 --> 01:37:01.860]   And his choice was to make a lot of concessions to legacy.
[01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:06.260]   Apple doesn't have to do that and didn't.
[01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:10.340]   Further as the result was until not very long ago,
[01:37:10.340 --> 01:37:12.640]   Apple had what, 2% market share?
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:14.780]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:17.300]   In fact, Jerry, I'm sitting here looking at,
[01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:18.860]   I'm not typing into it right now,
[01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:21.260]   but I'm still in a DOS based text editor
[01:37:21.260 --> 01:37:22.980]   for writing my code.
[01:37:22.980 --> 01:37:24.380]   - But what's interesting is that both of you
[01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:28.780]   are using iPads and iPhone, well not iPhone for you, Steve,
[01:37:28.780 --> 01:37:29.940]   but--
[01:37:29.940 --> 01:37:33.380]   - And I'm on here on a Mac.
[01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:34.740]   - A MacBook Pro.
[01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:35.740]   - Yeah.
[01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:37.940]   - So what does that tell us?
[01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:39.940]   - Tells us how I can both.
[01:37:39.940 --> 01:37:42.300]   It tells us that the operating system
[01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:44.060]   is becoming irrelevant.
[01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:48.460]   No user gives a damn what operating system is using.
[01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:50.380]   What he wants is the ding machine to do
[01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:52.220]   what he wants it to do.
[01:37:52.220 --> 01:37:55.300]   - Yeah. - What about Google's Chromium OS?
[01:37:55.300 --> 01:37:58.140]   Google's moving towards an OS that's in the cloud.
[01:37:58.140 --> 01:37:59.980]   Do you think that's reasonable?
[01:37:59.980 --> 01:38:02.060]   That kind of is the ultimate response to that.
[01:38:02.060 --> 01:38:03.820]   - It wouldn't be for me.
[01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:05.500]   - 'Cause you don't wanna live in the cloud.
[01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:06.980]   Twitter, Jerry, Twitter.
[01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:08.220]   (laughing)
[01:38:08.220 --> 01:38:12.780]   - I don't want copies of my novel out there
[01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:15.820]   where somebody else can get at them if they know how.
[01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:17.940]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:19.620]   You're afraid of the security issues.
[01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:20.980]   - It's not just security.
[01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:22.700]   It's privacy.
[01:38:22.700 --> 01:38:23.740]   - Right.
[01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:27.260]   - Also, I've had enough interruptions
[01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:29.700]   in my high speed service,
[01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:33.540]   especially since I've depended on AT&T for some of it,
[01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:36.180]   that I want to make dang sure
[01:38:36.180 --> 01:38:39.140]   that anything I do can be done with stuff I have here.
[01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:41.220]   And why in the world should I have,
[01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:43.820]   sitting here, I'm talking to you on the equivalent
[01:38:43.820 --> 01:38:48.300]   of what would have been considered a supercomputer in 1990.
[01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:52.460]   Why in the world should I want to go out to do the way
[01:38:52.460 --> 01:38:55.660]   I used the supercomputer back in 1990?
[01:38:55.660 --> 01:39:00.300]   In 1990, I used to have to go to the University of Illinois
[01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:02.420]   to get the solution to some tensor,
[01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:05.220]   which I don't do anymore, but I did know it stays.
[01:39:05.220 --> 01:39:08.620]   I can do all that stuff on my machine here.
[01:39:08.620 --> 01:39:12.140]   Why would I want to go back to having to use the web
[01:39:12.140 --> 01:39:15.180]   to do things, which I thought was wonderful
[01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:17.660]   that I finally got a machine to do it here?
[01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:19.300]   - Well, what about the notion that you've got
[01:39:19.300 --> 01:39:20.660]   a bunch of devices?
[01:39:20.660 --> 01:39:21.500]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:23.340]   - And having them all say the same thing is valuable.
[01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:25.380]   So it makes sense if, Jerry,
[01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:27.140]   you got one computer, a desktop computer,
[01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:30.500]   but now I got an iPhone, iPad, laptop, desktop.
[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:32.540]   Shouldn't they all have access to the same data,
[01:39:32.540 --> 01:39:34.500]   the same information, the same?
[01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:35.940]   - Don't yours mind do it?
[01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:38.140]   - Well, that's thanks to the cloud, right?
[01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:39.980]   - No, I network right here.
[01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:41.700]   - Oh, you do your own network?
[01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:43.820]   - I have a perfectly good network here.
[01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:45.460]   - That's 'cause you don't get out of the house much.
[01:39:45.460 --> 01:39:49.300]   - My machines is available to every other man on my machine.
[01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:51.900]   - What happens when you hit the road?
[01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:56.260]   - When I hit the road, I carry terabytes of information
[01:39:56.260 --> 01:39:57.900]   with me when I hit the road.
[01:39:57.900 --> 01:40:00.860]   Don't you?
[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:01.980]   - No.
[01:40:01.980 --> 01:40:03.060]   - No.
[01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:04.460]   - I have it all in the cloud.
[01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:09.220]   - I think it's clear that the future is for us
[01:40:09.220 --> 01:40:13.380]   to carry viewers and that will be connected amazingly enough.
[01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:16.820]   I mean, the fact that this is really happening
[01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:18.300]   as an old gray hair just--
[01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:19.140]   - It does surprise me.
[01:40:19.140 --> 01:40:19.980]   - It's amazing to me.
[01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:21.140]   - Because I had the same objection, Jerry.
[01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:23.060]   - Well, I just grabbed it, molten gauze, you know.
[01:40:23.060 --> 01:40:23.900]   - Yes.
[01:40:23.900 --> 01:40:25.740]   - One of the things that they were carrying,
[01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:27.500]   the pocket computer they were carrying,
[01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:29.500]   really had very little internal storage.
[01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:30.340]   - Right.
[01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:35.340]   - It connected to what we would call a desktop now
[01:40:35.340 --> 01:40:37.860]   in the room they were in,
[01:40:37.860 --> 01:40:40.980]   and that connected to the ship's main library.
[01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:42.020]   - But here's the good news.
[01:40:42.020 --> 01:40:44.820]   You don't have to make the choice, you can do both.
[01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:46.020]   - Yeah.
[01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:47.820]   - So you get what you want.
[01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:52.060]   - Oh, I, to that extent I do, but I don't really want,
[01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:57.060]   I, well, okay, there was a proposal in the Congress last week
[01:40:57.060 --> 01:40:59.740]   that the president should have a big red button
[01:40:59.740 --> 01:41:01.660]   that allows him to shut down the internet
[01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:04.820]   whenever he thinks that there's a national security reason
[01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:05.660]   to do so.
[01:41:05.660 --> 01:41:06.620]   Do you remember that?
[01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:08.380]   - Uh-oh, yeah, Stephen and I talked about this,
[01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:10.020]   the so-called kill switch.
[01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:12.300]   The big kill switch for the president.
[01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:15.300]   Now, when that happens, Leo, where are you?
[01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:19.220]   - Well, now Steve, you didn't think it really was
[01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:20.460]   a kill switch. - You can never know where Leo is,
[01:41:20.460 --> 01:41:22.220]   'cause he won't be able to tweet his looking.
[01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:24.380]   - You'll have no idea where I am, exactly.
[01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:26.340]   (laughing)
[01:41:26.340 --> 01:41:28.180]   - I'll be right here in chaos, man.
[01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:30.060]   (laughing)
[01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:33.780]   - I have no physical locus, Jerry, I am everywhere.
[01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:37.740]   Unfortunately, virtually, there are limits
[01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:40.100]   and we've run against the limit called time.
[01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:42.940]   I wish I had a day for this show,
[01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:47.100]   but Jerry would just have to get you and Steve back.
[01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:49.380]   And Spencer, you too, this has been a lot of fun.
[01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:52.780]   You guys are, sometimes the gray hairs have some perspective
[01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:53.860]   that the young guys don't have,
[01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:56.420]   and that's, I think, often much more interesting.
[01:41:56.420 --> 01:41:58.740]   - The young guys think things were always connected,
[01:41:58.740 --> 01:42:00.940]   and we remember when things, I mean,
[01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:03.500]   when the idea of connecting things was like, wait a minute,
[01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:05.700]   how can we have all these computers network together?
[01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:06.700]   You can't do that. - Exactly.
[01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:07.540]   - Exactly.
[01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:11.380]   Jerry Bernal is the author of so many great books,
[01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:14.700]   The Motions, God's Eye, Dante's, I mean, sorry,
[01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:16.460]   Lucifer's Hammer.
[01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:18.500]   I always wanna call it Dante's Inferno for some reason.
[01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:20.380]   - Inferno is an anvil.
[01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:21.380]   - Inferno's another book.
[01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:25.460]   - The Niven and I wrote in Escape From Hell is its sequel,
[01:42:25.460 --> 01:42:28.940]   and they are essentially Dante's geography
[01:42:28.940 --> 01:42:32.820]   and Vatican II theology.
[01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:34.380]   - Jerry, let's pick a Twitter handle
[01:42:34.380 --> 01:42:35.700]   and create a Twitter account for you
[01:42:35.700 --> 01:42:37.100]   before we get off the air.
[01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:39.260]   What do you wanna call yourself on Twitter?
[01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:40.180]   - Big red button.
[01:42:40.180 --> 01:42:43.180]   - Twitter. (laughing)
[01:42:43.180 --> 01:42:47.220]   - What do I wanna call myself on Twitter?
[01:42:47.220 --> 01:42:49.260]   - I guess probably the best would be Steve learned this.
[01:42:49.260 --> 01:42:50.900]   The best is to, is something short,
[01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:52.780]   but your name is always good, right?
[01:42:52.780 --> 01:42:54.900]   - Chaos, manor?
[01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:55.820]   - Oh, Chaos, manor.
[01:42:55.820 --> 01:42:57.700]   Now, there's a good-- - You're--
[01:42:57.700 --> 01:42:59.060]   - There's a good hander handle.
[01:42:59.060 --> 01:43:00.540]   - Let's cross our fingers.
[01:43:00.540 --> 01:43:02.180]   - Well, I'm not gonna sign up for you, Jerry.
[01:43:02.180 --> 01:43:04.420]   I want you to sign up for yourself.
[01:43:04.420 --> 01:43:06.780]   - I'd have to figure out how, but I can do that.
[01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:08.060]   - I'm sure you can figure that out.
[01:43:08.060 --> 01:43:10.260]   - Twitter.com and JerryPornell.com
[01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:12.660]   is a place to go to read Jerry's postings, his musings,
[01:43:12.660 --> 01:43:16.140]   do donate, take a take $2 from Leo
[01:43:16.140 --> 01:43:18.220]   and give it to Jerry instead.
[01:43:18.220 --> 01:43:19.860]   He certainly earned it.
[01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:21.620]   We all are here because of Jerry Pornell.
[01:43:21.620 --> 01:43:23.380]   Jerry, it's great to have you here.
