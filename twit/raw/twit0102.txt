[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Did you see this?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Apparently they changed the -- they got a new hand model.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   A guy with really big hands to make the iPhone look smaller on the Apple site.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   >> I absolutely love that.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   >> I think if Apple had a sense of humor, they color that new hand green.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   >> Oh, oh, oh, the iPhone.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Sorry.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Sorry.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   We would expose the model to gamma radiation, but the phone is perfectly unchanged.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Just to show you, you know, it's built for punishment.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   >> I guess that's -- I don't know.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I guess that's fair play in the ad business, but didn't they think anybody would notice?
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   >> Well, yeah.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   It may be fair play in the ad business, but it's changing the photo.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   >> I get some obvious attention.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Too bad they can't change the hand to make the battery life look longer.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   I don't know how they would do that.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   >> No, apparently they're now saying they're swearing that you'll be able to talk for eight
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   hours.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   >> That would be amazing because typical smartphone usage is my N95's four-hour talk time.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   >> Eight hours seems ludicrous.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Or, you know, you'll be able to surf the web for three minutes or talk for eight hours.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   >> They said the movie time is seven -- now remember, when the manufacturers give back,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   when the manufacturers give battery time, I don't know.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   I usually divide in half.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   >> Nevertheless, it's still longer than anybody else's published times.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   It's like you get like eight hours of surfing time.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   As long as it takes you like six hours to read the New York Times front page.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   >> Right.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   >> John, have you recused yourself from all iPhone coverage?
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   >> You know, the problem I've had is that because I was critical only based on the fact
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   that people were praising it without seeing it, I find that to be offensive.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   >> I agree.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   >> And then I ended up being like the guy on CNBC.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   They keep dragging me back to do, you know, be the anti-iPhone guy.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   >> I phone Haida.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   >> You're the official basher.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   >> The official basher.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   And I find now I'm kind of getting sympathy for, you know, the whole project.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And I'm kind of rooting for the thing.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   >> I'm looking for --
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   >> If for no other reason just to make it, you know, because what -- you know, we had all
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   these smartphones all this time and then nobody's cared much about them or they didn't -- they
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   rejected them actually, especially the Microsoft ones.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   And, you know, I have these -- is it possible for Steve Jobs to just waltz in and become
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   the hot phone, you know, worldwide?
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Because everybody else is just out of touch with how to even do a phone and they're all
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   phone companies.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   >> He did that with the iPod.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   >> Oh, well, all he really has to do to get a huge success is develop the first smartphone
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   that actually works as advertised.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   I love my Windows Mobile smartphone.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   I think it's the nicest smartphone ever made.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   But still, at this moment, it won't get my mail until I pull the battery and restart it,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   which is a recurring problem.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   There are many times when --
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   >> And you love it?
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   >> -- I love it because unfortunately I have -- I get to use every single smartphone that
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   gets released.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   >> It's the best of a bad bunch is what you're saying.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   >> I get to see a single smartphone that just keeps working.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   >> Which one?
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.200]   >> At some point, you're not going to find yourself taking a picture that you then can't email
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.000]   someplace because for some reason it lost its connection to your --
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   >> Which one do you like?
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   >> Which one do you have?
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   >> I really like singular cells that as I think the 2125, it's a folding like star --
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   >> It's an HTC phone, yeah.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   >> HTC Star Trek.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   I really wanted a phone that was like that but in a folding format because it protects the
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   keyboard, protects the screen.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   >> But that thing is huge.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   >> Oh, no, no, no.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   It's no bigger than --
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   >> It's a thick, high-quality --
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   >> -- larger than a razor.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   >> Okay.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   >> The other thing, by the way, we should mention about the iPhone, which is the crazy idea of
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   putting a glass front on it.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   >> That's the other news.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   >> Along with the new battery, they're going to replace the plastic.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   A lot of people complain that the iPod scratched, so they're going to put tempered glass on it.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Why is that crazy, John?
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   >> Well, I don't know.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   You see, I mean, there's one --
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   >> Bigger glass on your ass is what I'm always talking about.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   >> Well, I don't think you'll want to sit on the iPhone anyway.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   I mean, this is going to be a precious device.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   You'll probably cover it in gold, carry it in a special leather pouch that might attach to the inside of your coat.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   >> I don't know about you, but I have on occasion shoved the phone in my back pocket.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   You know, sometimes you just want to go somewhere.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   You think you're going to remember it's back there and you're not going to sit on it.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   You know, I mean, there is a thing called butt dialing.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   It's a term that for a reason because people sit on their phone and make their call on their buddy.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   >> Well, one thing we're sure of is that the iPhone will not butt dial.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   >> That's true.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   >> That's true.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   >> But the touchscreen, it does, too.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   >> It may not dial at all.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   >> A little baby butt.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   It may not tell.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   >> It might have a bunch of boils back there.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   >> I think the glass compared to the plastic is not a bad idea, but I do wonder about whether it'll make it a lot heavier.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Glass is heavier than plastic, absolutely.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   >> Also more reflective, right?
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   I mean, it makes it a different.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   >> How does the touch work on the glass?
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Is it got some sort of a coating on it?
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Is there like a matrix across the top?
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   I mean, how does it work?
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   >> No, there's the Palm glass.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   >> When you look at a real iPhone, you don't see any sort of matrix.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   You don't see any sort of micro wires across it.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   It just looks like clear plastic or clear glass.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And even back in January, I was trying to go them into outlining a scenario in which my iPhone would get really, really scratched up.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   So I'm saying, so I'm not going to need a slip case for it.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   No.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   I don't have to worry about putting a special pocket.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   No.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   And then I showed them, I absolutely filthy.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   I usually wear it when I'm a trade show.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   I wear this gun belt.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   It has a couple of pouches on it for my camera, so I can keep recording devices handy.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   And it's like it's Army surplus inside.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   There's no coating.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   There's no nothing.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   I'm not really ragged canvas.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   So I could drop the iPhone in here and carry it around.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   You're telling me it's not going to scratch.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   And he said, nope, it's not going to scratch.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   It's harder.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   It's going to be harder even than an iPhone.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   >> Maybe it'll be a sapphire.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   >> Maybe it'll be a sapphire.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   >> And did you believe them?
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Because they had a lot of denial about the iPod scratches too.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   >> Did you believe that?
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Well, they said it didn't scratch for like the first month.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   They swore up and down that it was not, you know, I don't know what people were seeing, but it wasn't scratch.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   >> No scratches.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Nope.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Not here.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   >> No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   >> No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   I was like, oh, I'm not going to be like eight times in one week.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   And I had to make, I made myself a fake looking, a fake iPhone.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   I printed out the picture off the website at one to one, paste it on a phone.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   It looks good.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Like if you don't look at it.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   >> It's on TV.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   >> On TV.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   >> And so of course I held it up to them and I said, ooh, it's the iPhone.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   And because the devil was sitting on my shoulder, the back of it, I pasted the same screen only the landscape version.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   And I was like, oh, I've probably pushed this too far.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   >> Actually, you know, you can take a Kodak 610 black version of the 610 camera or even the 7, I think it's a 705.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   If you can get a black version.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   And you can run a movie on the screen that shows all the iPhone things.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   You'd have to put it on the screen.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   And then you'd have to put it on the screen.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   And you can run a movie on the screen that shows all the iPhone things.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   You'd have to, of course, coordinate your movie to the iPhone.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   And the cool thing about both those cameras is that as you change the, you can move it horizontally and it will flip the screen.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   And you can turn it upside down.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   It'll flip the screen.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   It keeps flipping the screen around so it has that same effect.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   So you could be like turning the thing around, flipping the screen and fingering the thing.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Well, I was actually playing a movie and convince somebody.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   >> I think that's how they made the commercial actually.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   That's exactly what they did.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   >> They made the movies.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   >> Giant hands.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   So Levi's got one and Walt's got one.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   I think that's, so you think there are a number of journalists, John, who have one?
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Do you have one?
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   >> I would think if those two guys have, there's got to be another half dozen at least.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   >> Pogues got to have one.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   >> Right.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   >> Pogues.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   >> Basically, anybody that's seen that have one now?
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   >> Anybody who's a big fan of the company probably has one.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   >> Right.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   >> Well, what it comes down to is the top of the pecking order are people who have an international base.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.440]   See the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the international paper record, they're definitely
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.440]   going to get things first.
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.440]   Next one.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.440]   >> New York, yeah.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.440]   >> Next one.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.440]   >> Oh, it's not really with the need.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.440]   Sometimes he's a contractor.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.920]   Markoff doesn't have one and he's with the time.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:24.920]   >> Ah, Markoff, you'd think would have one.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.400]   >> They wouldn't, he can't have one because he's covering it.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.680]   >> Oh, I see.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.400]   So that, so he's not reviewing it.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.560]   He's covering it.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.560]   >> They do have rules.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.320]   >> Well, they have stupid rules.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.960]   >> It's a good rule.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:40.120]   Anyway, I'm sure we're all going, well, no, I know John won't, but the rest of us will
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.000]   be somewhere waiting in line on Friday the 29th.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.560]   Veronica, I'm in line right now.
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.040]   You won't be, you're going to let Veronica do it for you.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.880]   >> I also know, I have no interest in the iPhone.
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.000]   I mean, I have a professional interest in the iPhone, but I do not want to buy it.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.680]   >> All right, I'm going to play a little game with you guys.
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:58.040]   This is called iPhone headline predictions.
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.640]   So the iPhone comes out Friday.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:05.000]   We'll see headlines in all the papers and the websites on Monday.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.960]   What is your, what prediction do you have for these headlines?
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:14.000]   >> Now I'll give you my prediction, iPhone more Newton than iPod.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.320]   That's my prediction for Monday.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.320]   I think people are good.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:21.760]   So Andy, you have a prediction for the iPhone headline for a week from Monday.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:27.160]   >> Unfortunately, a comic strip called PvP Online already stole the best headline possible.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.160]   >> Scott Kurtz.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.160]   >> Scott Kurtz.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.160]   >> Scott Kurtz.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.160]   >> Scott Kurtz.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.160]   >> Molly, what do you think?
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.160]   Will they love it?
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.880]   Will that be kind of medium?
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:47.160]   >> I think the headline will be iPhone sales not as brisk as expected.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.160]   >> Oh, interesting.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.960]   >> 600 bucks, two-year contract.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:51.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:52.960]   >> I got the headline.
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:53.960]   >> What's the headline?
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.960]   >> I got the headline.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.960]   >> What's the headline?
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:56.960]   >> Man killed in iPhone debacle.
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.960]   >> You might be right.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.560]   >> Fingers crossed, you can't buy that sort of publicity.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.560]   >> My headphones are so lame.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:08.120]   >> I mean, I can't think of a consumer product introduction except maybe the PS3 that's anywhere
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.880]   near this kind of intensity.
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:10.880]   >> It's unbelievable.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.080]   >> Windows 95, which is just like this.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.080]   >> It was?
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.080]   No.
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.320]   >> Oh, they had the big banners off of that tower in Toronto.
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:21.720]   They had lines, people that were being covered, all the 11 o'clock news had a bunch of guys
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.920]   lined up sleeping in front of the stores.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:24.920]   >> Oh, okay.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:25.920]   >> Same thing.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.880]   >> Yeah, that's what I was wondering about.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.560]   It's like how many people are really going to be in line for the iPhone?
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:37.080]   >> I think that the potential audience for the iPhone seems to me to be smaller even
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.880]   than the audience for the PS3.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:39.880]   >> I agree.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.800]   I mean, if Mac users first, I mean, we don't even know how it's going to work on Windows.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.240]   You have to get -- they've told us you have to get iTunes to start.
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.360]   >> Remember that there were people who were waiting in line to buy the Newton message pad.
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.360]   And that cost $199.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.960]   It was a totally unknown and unproven product.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:58.080]   I think -- see, what I find interesting is the 6 p.m.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.080]   launch time.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.840]   On the one hand, I think that this might be brilliant because they want to make sure that
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:06.640]   local news can get live coverage of people lined up for the iPhone.
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:12.240]   On the other hand, if you release something at 6 p.m. on a Friday, historically in the
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.580]   news business, that means that you want to announce something after the stock market
[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.520]   closes before anything can possibly affect trading.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.520]   I don't think that's the reason why.
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.760]   >> No, I think that is the reason why, Andy.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:23.760]   I'm sorry, Don.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.760]   >> Are you shorting Apple?
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.960]   >> No, I'm not shorting anything.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:31.120]   It would be too much of a hassle.
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:36.000]   The fact of the matter is that they want to do this after the market closes on a Friday.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.480]   So the weekend -- in case something weird happens, so the weekend people would calm
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.840]   down and set a panic over the weekend and kind of reanalyze things.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.160]   And then on Monday, you won't have any kind of crazy --
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:50.240]   >> More like so, Apple has a chance to respond to anything that's starting to spread.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.920]   Remember how quickly they were talking about clamping down rumors about the AT&T service
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.080]   plan.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.600]   And down on rumors about the battery life being only like 90 minutes or something like that.
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.400]   That was a really quick response.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.040]   >> And probably so they can get a handle on bug fixes.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.200]   >> Because it does feel a little rushed.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:11.480]   >> Here's what I'm being told right now is that all the stores AT&T and Apple stores
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.480]   are closed at 4 p.m.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.080]   FedEx will arrive between 4 and 5 with the phones.
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.840]   They won't have the phones till then.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:22.520]   They'll open at 6 and there will be a forced firmware update that the phones as shipped
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.120]   do not have the most recent firmware.
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.120]   There will be a forced firmware update on the phone before you could take it out of the
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.120]   store.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.360]   >> I bet there will be three or four forced firmware updates over the course of the weekend.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.640]   >> Yeah, probably over the year.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:34.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:41.960]   >> They've said that they will announce data plan pricing and availability before the phone
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.960]   ships on the 29th.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.960]   So at least to have some time to think about it.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.960]   >> Now that's just from -- you know, here's something that I noticed about this.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.040]   The reason they're doing that is to get some more news out.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.600]   Don't forget this phone was supposed to come out in the 15th or something along during
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.600]   the development.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.840]   >> Well, no, I've never seen it.
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:03.680]   >> So they had all the public relations machinery ready to go for the timed for the 15th or
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:04.680]   whenever.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.080]   The timing is now off by two weeks.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.080]   So they got to come up with the focus.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.080]   Yeah, the stretching.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.080]   They're filling.
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.080]   Exactly.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.080]   Which is why the glass front and all that glass front has that.
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.760]   >> You don't think so, Danny and I go?
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.720]   >> I don't buy any of that.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:22.680]   For one thing, Molly's fallen over or Eli just took the phone.
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:23.680]   One of the other.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.680]   I'm not sure.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.080]   >> No, I really don't buy any of that.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.760]   I do think that there's going to be a lot of stuff that's going to be happening in the
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.760]   first week.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:36.840]   If we only get like two or three major patches within the first seven days, that's going
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.160]   to be, I think, a very, very short stack.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.920]   >> If I didn't have to review this thing, I would not be buying it, but I do have to
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.240]   review it, so I'll be in line.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.640]   >> Well, you have to review it.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.640]   >> I have to.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.680]   >> Next day, I'm going to go on the radio and say, "Yeah, the iPhone's out.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.920]   We'll see what it's like as soon as somebody else reviews it."
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:52.920]   >> I have to review it.
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.720]   >> We'll say something about it the next day.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.760]   Well, that's always good advice.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.360]   Anytime you're buying new technology, particularly when you're buying an Apple product.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:06.280]   Apple is not a company that stays with one build or one mechanism or one way of putting
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.840]   things together for all their hardware.
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:11.760]   Every time they come up with a redesign, it's not just new features, it's not just new
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:12.760]   hardware.
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.920]   It's also a new method of assembling the damn thing.
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:19.200]   I got a new headline, "Record Number of eBay Listings for iPhone on Monday."
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.680]   >> There you go.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.600]   I think that every headline you're going to see is, "You want that one instead?"
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:30.080]   >> Well, no, I do think it's going to sell out, but I can't.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:34.520]   I don't think maybe that the response to it will be as universally.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:39.080]   >> I do have the winning headline.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:43.600]   If you want to pay me five cents for every person who uses this headline or variation
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.920]   of it, you'll be out of business and I'll have a million bucks.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.920]   >> What is it?
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.480]   >> It's a variation on, "I was right.
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.480]   I called it."
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.480]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.480]   >> Yeah.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.480]   >> Whatever I said.
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.480]   >> All the people who said it was going to suck.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.480]   Yes, indeed, it sucks.
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:58.520]   While you have to use your finger to dial things, instead of just simply letting it hover in
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.720]   midair and barking questions at it.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.560]   >> Well, for all the attention, the iPhone is getting--
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:07.680]   >> My cat's glaucoma is now gone because I just put in my iPhone added and it was
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.680]   heel.
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.680]   Thank you, Steve.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.680]   Thank you, Steve.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.680]   Thank you so much, Steve.
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.880]   God bless you, Steve.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:18.560]   >> Have you guys seen the parody of the Microsoft Surface on Break.com?
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:19.560]   >> Yes.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.280]   >> I have to play it.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.280]   I have to play it.
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:27.880]   >> One day, your computer will be a big-ass table with pictures of other people's kids
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:28.880]   all over it.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:33.480]   Instead of actually playing with your kids, you could just look at video of them playing
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.480]   by themselves.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:40.880]   You'll smile knowing you've only paid $10,000 to do it.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:45.800]   And if your mom has $10,000 laying around her house that she has nothing to do with,
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:46.800]   she can get one, too.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.600]   And then you can send her a postcard for free.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.040]   That's the power of Microsoft Surface.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.560]   Now consider this.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.680]   Instead of using one of today's more popular compact devices to get directions to where
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:10.720]   you're going, why not use a device the size of a small car to do this in job?
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:17.960]   In the future, getting tanked with your friends is going to be a whole lot more fun because
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:23.360]   you'll be sitting at a table that makes something cool happen every time they bring you a drink,
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.640]   which you'll want to do over and over.
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.160]   >> Pressing on the table.
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:31.840]   >> Instead of interacting with actual human beings, you can just order your food right
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:32.840]   at your table.
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:38.200]   If you've still got any credit left on your card after you buy the table computer, why
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.400]   not think about a new phone or two phones?
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:47.760]   That's when you can do some really cool stuff.
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:51.600]   And remember all that money you spend on iTunes to get your favorite songs?
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:58.640]   Get ready to do it again, but this time for your new table computer, the future is here
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.400]   and it's not an iPhone.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.120]   It's a big-ass table.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.280]   Take that, Apple.
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:11.480]   >> And credit to sarcasticgamer.com for that.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.280]   That is, I have to say, very good.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.280]   >> That is clever.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.560]   Although, I think the big-ass table looks kind of cool.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.360]   >> It looks cool, but you're not going to, you wouldn't buy one.
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.200]   >> No, but I wouldn't buy a night phone either.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.200]   >> There you go.
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.000]   >> I think they both look equally cool.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   >> They had one thing right.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.360]   If that thing's ever had a bar, that's going to be quite cool.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.120]   >> You think it's glass or plastic?
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.120]   >> They have to be glass, come on.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.120]   >> How does it interact with the bomb?
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.120]   >> It would be plastic.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.520]   >> Well, you're missing it.
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.000]   You actually have to go to--
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.160]   >> Happy Lucite.
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:44.000]   >> You have to go to sarcasticgamer.com to see the video.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   >> Your computer quality carbonate.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.360]   >> Because, of course, when they put the-- and this was in the-- they're just re-narrating
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:53.480]   the Microsoft Surface video, but you know, you put the glass down and it knows the glasses
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.480]   there, you put a phone down and it knows the phone.
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.280]   >> Finally, Microsoft has the Roan Knowledge Navigator video.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:01.000]   >> It's exactly-- that's a cool video.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.760]   Please spend the money on actually building something one-tenth this cool even though I
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:04.760]   know you're not going to.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:09.040]   >> You're talking about the famous-- what it was about, 1988 and 1889 Apple video.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.400]   >> Yeah, under-- under Scully, this one, he has-- he had his picture taking-- I think
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:16.040]   he actually had this made so he can have his picture taken on the cover of Fortune holding
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.040]   something really, really cool.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:21.280]   It's the fold out one that turns into one-- actually one big, like 11 by 17 surface.
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.120]   >> It's got a guy with a bow tie in it.
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:26.080]   >> Some twerp and a bow tie says, "You got mail today, Stephen.
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.720]   Should I read, Drew?
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.880]   >> You're-- >> Your mother called.
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:30.880]   >> Yes.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.080]   >> Yeah, that was it.
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:34.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.160]   >> All right, let's move on.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:41.520]   I think we've done enough iPhone news and gosh knows, we'll know everything by Friday.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:44.440]   And I-- you know, it's just fun to watch.
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.800]   It's interesting to watch all the hype.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.960]   Apple certainly has done a good job of getting the attention.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:51.200]   We'll see if they've done a good job of building the phone.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.000]   Time will tell.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.520]   In the age-old TV trope, only time will tell.
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:02.040]   Michael Moore said, "Steal my movie, last time he put out a movie."
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:06.520]   And this time, they took him out his word, "Sico," which won't come out until iPhone
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.520]   day, June 29th.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.720]   It's already on YouTube.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.960]   It's been there for a week.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.960]   And well, I guess they pulled it down, but it was up on YouTube and it's on all a bit
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.920]   torrents.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.480]   He says, "He doesn't care.
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.280]   He's just glad people are watching his movie."
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.400]   Some say it might even be his idea because there is stuff shot in Cuba.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:29.000]   He's afraid the US will interdict the movie because of-- he's violating the ban on Cuba.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   >> Yeah, really.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   >> There's a new--
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   >> I've totally said it, so yeah.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.800]   >> There's a new way to protect your movies.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:34.800]   Put them on YouTube.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:38.480]   >> I don't think I would put it-- well, that's-- I don't think I would put it past them entirely.
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.880]   I mean, there have definitely been rumors for a long time that networks have done similar
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.880]   things with shows that they kind of wanted to pilot on the fly.
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.880]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:47.880]   >> Or build buzz for.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:48.880]   >> There's a--
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:54.560]   >> Well, you know, Michael Moore was on the Sunday morning shoot out with Peter Goober
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:59.920]   and Peter Bart discussing this issue about the Cuban footage.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.360]   And they actually tried to confiscate the movie.
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:07.600]   He tried to take-- when he took it to Cannes, they almost kept him from getting it into
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.600]   the show at all.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:09.600]   >> Really?
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.600]   >> Not in the US government.
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.600]   >> Wow.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.240]   Just for shooting video-- just shooting that tape in Cuba?
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:19.560]   >> Yeah, it was-- you know, it kind of surprises me because you're-- you can legally go to Cuba
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.640]   if you're a journalist.
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:25.200]   >> Or you're on a cultural exchange.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:30.960]   >> There's different-- there are mechanisms that you can legally go to Cuba without worrying
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:31.960]   about it.
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.400]   Because I mean, a lot of people just go there just as a kick and they go through Mexico
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.920]   or they go through Canada.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:40.240]   And you know, they have a special procedure where they give you a kind of a visa that
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:45.040]   they remove from your passport because if the US sees the-- any stamps from Cuba, you
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.040]   can get-- >> Oh, interesting.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.840]   >> -- it's a-- you get fined.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:48.840]   >> Huh.
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.400]   >> Well, actually, there's a lot of events that also take place in Cuba, like fishing tournaments
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.920]   where you're-- it's OK for you to go there as long as you don't spend any money there,
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.320]   as long as you have a special documentation.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.920]   >> Don't dare make a movie there, I guess.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:03.840]   >> Now, now, what's the source on the idea of the government trying to confiscate the
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.080]   movie, especially at Cannes?
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.080]   >> Michael Moore.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.000]   >> OK, there you go.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.480]   [ Laughter ]
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.080]   >> I risked my case.
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:15.840]   >> No, I'm not saying-- yeah, I'm saying that, you know, I don't even say trust but verify
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:16.840]   with Michael Moore.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.960]   I'm saying say, that's nice, Michael, and then do your own research.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:19.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.360]   >> Well, it could be bull.
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.800]   >> I mean, he does have a bone to pick, let's face it.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:24.800]   >> Yeah, he won't.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.800]   >> But I like it, it sounded good, it sounded-- it's believable.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:27.800]   >> Yeah, but--
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:31.360]   >> You know, because, you know, he has a promotional machine, I agree with you, 100% the guys like
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:36.880]   a-- you know, I mean, we find out much-- many years later that he could talk to Roger Smith
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.760]   at GM and much of that movie was a bunch of BS.
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:40.760]   >> Oh, really?
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:41.760]   >> Oh, interesting.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.000]   >> Yeah, that's why there's a whole expose on that.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.840]   He apparently had a lot of footage, but he created this phony documentary that he could
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:48.840]   never get a hold of the guy.
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:49.840]   In fact, they had meetings.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:50.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:56.920]   >> And he spoke to him twice once before he started filming, once on a different project.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:57.920]   >> Oh my.
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:03.320]   >> There was a group that was making a documentary on Michael Moore that was not out to get him,
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.920]   but they started to get-- they started to have the move-- the terms of the movie dictated
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:11.120]   them by the way that Michael Moore's people were, you know, were dealing with him.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.320]   So that's why that hit the press like about two or three months ago.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:19.920]   I mean, I did-- I spent a lot of time researching, only for Columbine, and I interviewed a lot
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:24.880]   of the people that he interviewed, and I was doing fact checking all the way through it,
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:29.360]   and actually wound up getting-- having an email exchange with Michael Moore.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:33.800]   And I'm saying that I don't believe anything in his movies until I verified myself or someone
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.440]   that I know verifies it.
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:36.680]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.880]   >> I wouldn't argue with it, but I'm just telling he's the one who said that.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:40.880]   >> Okay.
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:41.880]   >> And it could be a promotional BS.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:46.440]   >> It looks like Harvey Weinstein also said it says that the US government is attempting
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:50.680]   to impound the negative, the US Treasury, but is the Weinstein Company funded the movie,
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.680]   so.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.680]   >> Not a bad thing to happen to a movie.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.880]   Remember when Band and Boston met that movie who's going to sell some tickets?
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:01.600]   >> Well, you know, there is-- I think there's some laws against pretending that the government's
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.360]   doing something that they're not doing, so it'd be interesting to see other shicks out.
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:06.360]   >> Unless you're the government.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:09.200]   >> The government could say that as much as they want.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.200]   Stop pretending.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:13.000]   >> Those government guys are outside my door.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.080]   >> Yeah, I mean, I guess I wouldn't be surprised if Michael Moore made it up, but
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.080]   Weinstein does seem pretty detailed.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:20.920]   He said they had to fly the movie to another country and try to--
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:21.920]   >> Wow.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.880]   >> Yeah, there's the information.
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:28.320]   >> The information and the incredibly super top secret release that he put on his website
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:32.800]   was that he sent a print of a negative of the film to Canada for safekeeping just in case
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:38.040]   the government decided as retribution for Fahrenheit 9/11.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.800]   They're really, really angry with him for helping Bush get elected.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.800]   >> Help me, yeah, I'll never forgive him.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.800]   >> Don't ever forgive him.
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:44.800]   >> Boy.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:48.560]   >> I'm like, okay, that's very, very nice.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.560]   I want to keep the momentum.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.760]   >> Well, I can see that Andy Anatko is no fan of Michael Moore's.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:57.560]   >> Yes, and I feel we may be veering into distinctly non-technical territory.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.720]   >> Okay, we'll move on.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:00.720]   >> Which is fine.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.520]   >> You might want to trust this.
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:07.400]   You might want to verify this according to a user at UbuntuForums.org.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:13.360]   He was able to get an Ubuntu installation of Linux to validate as a genuine copy of Microsoft
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.360]   Windows.
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.080]   >> That's a great story.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.080]   >> There's a video of it.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.320]   I suppose he could have faked the video.
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:28.720]   He used wine the Windows emulator and IE for Linux to actually say, "Hey, I'm Windows,"
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.760]   and Microsoft said, "Sure, go ahead and download that copy of Windows Defender."
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:36.800]   Wow, you just got to really sting a little bit when you're...
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.080]   >> If it's true, but it is funny.
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.080]   >> It's a great story.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.080]   >> It's a great story.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:47.600]   They're all for security, security, security, and something waltzes in as a fake and just
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.600]   waltzes out.
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.800]   >> Well, the thing that's heard even more is that even Microsoft admits that I can't
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.600]   remember what the number was, but something like one in 20 legitimate Windows users still
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.720]   get dinged by Windows genuine advantages being pirates.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.720]   >> I think it was an actual number.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.440]   It turned out to be something like 5 million.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.440]   >> It was a lot.
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.600]   >> Like really a lot of people.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:07.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:12.080]   >> I've had a run in with the once in a while.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.720]   I've changed a hard disk or something.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:17.720]   All of a sudden the machine decides to tell me that this is no good and I can't use the
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.960]   XP, whatever anymore.
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:24.040]   But they do give you a phone number to call and it's always been resolved, at least for
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.800]   me, within five minutes.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.120]   You just tell them whatever it is.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.120]   They give you a code.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.680]   You punch it in and bang your back in business.
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:30.680]   It's never really been...
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:33.120]   >> Hi, this is John C.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.120]   Devorex.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.120]   >> No, no, they don't know me from Adam.
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.120]   These are people...
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.000]   I mean, these people are in Bombay.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   >> They do not know.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:39.520]   >> John C.
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:43.080]   >> But still it does rankle, doesn't it?
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.080]   I just had update.
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:48.040]   I took an old Dell laptop out of storage and had to update everything to get it working
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.040]   right.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.600]   And it validated just fine, so props to Microsoft.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:55.000]   But even though I'm like, I have to prove to you that I have a right to use the software
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   that I purchased.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   >> Oh.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   >> That's what rankles the most.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   I think you're right.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   >> Why do I have to do this?
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.400]   >> Mother Minix, you won't have this problem.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.400]   >> Thank you, sir, may I have another...
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.920]   >> Thank you, sir, may I have another...
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.320]   >> I should probably have put this in the iPhone segment.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:17.560]   Teenagers, according to the register, prefer mobile phones to sex.
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:18.560]   Actually it's...
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.040]   >> Depends on what they're doing with the mobile phone.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.040]   >> Well, maybe...
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.040]   >> ...sex is definitely involved.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:25.760]   >> This is a mobile life survey from Carphone Warehouse, so maybe you consider this source.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.360]   >> I think we keep it on vibrate.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.880]   Maybe that helps.
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:34.280]   >> One in three people would want one million pounds to give up their mobile, and those
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:38.480]   age between 16 and 24 would prefer to give up sex for a month than to do without their
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.480]   hands.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:43.400]   Actually, you know, I have given up sex for a month to keep my cell phone, so I don't
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.880]   think that that's so far.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.640]   Of course, I'm a little older.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.120]   >> Your wife plays hard songs.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.120]   >> She says she says...
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.120]   >> Wow.
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.120]   >> It's me or the cell phone, honey.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.120]   >> But then again, I've seen your phone.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.120]   It's a Nokia N95.
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.120]   >> That's right.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.120]   I love that.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.120]   >> Yeah, I love that.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.120]   >> That's not quite so hair-brained.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.120]   >> I always give up a lot for that phone.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.800]   >> I'm very happy with this phone, and you know, if you know what to do with it, if you
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:06.720]   know how to treat it just right, the battery life actually will get you through it.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.720]   >> I know, man.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.720]   >> I know.
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.720]   >> Can't get enough of your phone, baby.
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.160]   >> Baby, baby, baby.
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:19.120]   >> New Wi-Fi distance record recorded by Amano Pietros Nolle.
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:23.400]   He's president of the Escuelo Latina Marica de Redes, which is the networking school of
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.400]   Latin America.
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:30.920]   A Wi-Fi link between computers in Algila and Plattio Mountain in Venezuela, 382 kilometers.
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.960]   It's 238 miles.
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.320]   He wasn't using a Pringles can, I don't think.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.320]   Got three megabits.
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.720]   >> No, it's like who cares.
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.120]   This is like bogus news.
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.840]   >> All right, I'm giving you a good--
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:41.840]   >> All right.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:42.840]   >> This is clearly--
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:46.000]   >> It's not even real Wi-Fi when it goes that far, because Wi-Fi's got a timing loop
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.080]   in it to keep it from going that far, so they have to disable that.
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.880]   So now it's just-- it's hacked.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:51.880]   >> All right, all right.
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:52.880]   How about this?
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.480]   >> This is obviously just deployed to get hackers to go outside.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.840]   >> Quick, no, another three miles into the woods.
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:30:59.840]   We almost got it.
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:00.840]   >> Get some more buzz.
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:01.840]   Come on.
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.040]   >> Outside and to take a real leave on walk.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.240]   >> Far, far away, yes.
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.240]   All right, this is actually--
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.320]   >> You're protected, you get a tan.
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.760]   >> I've been actually-- I buried the lead.
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:09.760]   I apologize.
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:14.800]   The real big story of the week is Terry Semmel stepping down at Yahoo or being pushed.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.800]   I'm not sure which.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.200]   >> We talked about that last week?
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:20.640]   >> No, we haven't talked about it.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.600]   Semmel-- if I could happen on Monday, so we couldn't have talked about it.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.560]   Semmel was the guy brought in from Hollywood to turn Yahoo around, obviously, and in John,
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:31.160]   he's been very critical of Yahoo's strategy.
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.160]   >> Oh, my sweetie.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.160]   >> He didn't do that.
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.160]   It's that.
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:38.600]   >> So I got to-- I wrote up here and there, and I actually wrote about why this should
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:39.600]   get rid of Semmel.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.480]   I submitted it to PC Magazine like a couple of weeks ago.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.480]   >> You were right.
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.160]   >> So now it's going to come out in the magazine.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:48.880]   It looks like old news, so it's going to make me-- which I find annoying.
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:49.880]   But I have--
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:52.080]   >> That's why you do more net casts of fewer--
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.080]   >> --couling.
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.080]   >> Hey, I can believe it.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.080]   I can say this after it happened too.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:00.000]   >> The point is, this was a stupid idea from the beginning, but the interesting thing to
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.640]   me is the fact that he walked out of there, besides his $71 million a year that he was
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:08.560]   making, and he only apparently only showed up two or three times a week if he was ever
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:09.560]   there.
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:10.560]   >> Was that true, really?
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:11.560]   >> Well, that's what somebody said.
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:12.560]   >> He was really hand-punch.
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:13.560]   >> That's a legend, a legend.
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:14.560]   But anyway--
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:15.800]   >> I'm glad you heard him far.
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:20.720]   >> --according to Market Watch, he kept cashing out the whole time he was there, and he's
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:28.480]   walked away with-- in stock, he's cashed out over $680 million with the stock more than
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.200]   anybody else in the company.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:34.400]   And what this says to me, the guy gets brought in, he doesn't really do anything.
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:38.900]   He's credited with saving the company, but he got in at the bottom, so a monkey would
[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.600]   have saved the company.
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:41.600]   >> I think we could prove that--
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:45.200]   >> --and he walked away a billionaire, basically a billionaire for doing nothing.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:49.440]   >> I can prove that everything you say is true, because Eric Schmidt, his rival at Google,
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:54.200]   said, quote, "Tarry has shown great leadership at Yahoo, and will be much missed."
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.960]   >> We love that guy.
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.880]   >> Come back, Terry.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:05.040]   >> Well, anyway, I mean, you can't fault the guy for taking advantage of a bunch of dummies,
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.040]   but that's what he did.
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:10.400]   >> 38-year-old Jerry Yang back on top one of the original Yahoo founders.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.400]   He's going to run--
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.400]   >> Yeah.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.400]   Jerry's going to brought him in.
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.400]   >> Oh, really?
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:19.400]   >> Oh, there's another article, by the way, in 2003 in Fortune magazine, they've mentioned
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:24.720]   how when Samuel came in, he didn't know how to use email.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:25.720]   He never surfed the web.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:26.720]   >> Oh, good.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.240]   >> His email was done.
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.960]   His secretary would go to the computer and print out all his email to give it to him.
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.760]   He'd scribble notes, and then she'd go finish--
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:34.760]   >> Oh, dear.
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.760]   >> --send the email back to whoever it was that sent it.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:37.760]   >> Oh, dear.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:38.760]   >> Which I thought was pretty funny.
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:39.760]   >> Actually, that's the system I'm using these days.
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.760]   >> Well, it's very effective.
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:45.400]   >> You don't-- you just basically abandoned email, but that's another story.
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:49.040]   >> I have my secretary printed out and throw it away.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.680]   I find that works even better.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:54.560]   >> So anyway, so everything he added up to this being just a big joke, and it was amazing
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.600]   that he was there as long as he was.
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.600]   >> He was brought in-- he was what?
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.560]   At Warner Brothers, he was a Hollywood type.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:00.560]   He was a big shot in Hollywood.
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:04.680]   >> And that's what Yahoo started doing was just bizarrely throwing money at kind of this
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:05.680]   Hollywood image.
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:11.080]   They had that weird tent at CES a couple of years ago where they had Tom Cat and Nicole
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.200]   Richie and Paris Hilton coming and going.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.200]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:15.200]   That--
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:18.960]   >> When you're big-- yeah, when you're big as press is a Tom Cruise visit to the Yahoo
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.840]   campus, like what are you guys doing?
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:22.840]   What are you spending money on?
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:23.840]   >> Right.
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:27.280]   And then acquiring a lot of companies that haven't turned-- I mean, they have a great
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.280]   portfolio.
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:33.400]   They've got delicious and flicker and I mean, it just goes on and on, but they're not turning
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.400]   in a profit here.
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.400]   >> Right.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:39.600]   Well, they're making-- they've got good revenues, but not for-- I mean, not compare.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.440]   I mean, Google is just killing them.
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:45.440]   >> 18-- or sorry, 16% fallen profits in the first three months of 2007.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.440]   I think that probably really did it.
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:48.440]   >> Right.
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:49.440]   >> As things are booming.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.680]   >> Yeah, it shouldn't be going that way.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.160]   Of course, the stock price is probably the real reason he's gone.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:57.640]   While Google's, you know, well over 500, they're down in around 25 bucks.
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:01.480]   >> Well, it's interesting because they're in kind of media company territory.
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:06.440]   Like Google has managed to say-- Google's managed to tie all of the weird things they
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:11.040]   do together with this idea that they're either organizing or creating a giant advertising
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.040]   network.
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.920]   Whereas Yahoo doesn't seem to have that focus.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:17.240]   They've got this kind of weird media company thing going on in addition to trying to be
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.240]   utilities and advertising network.
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:23.320]   And they just need to quit buying things for a while and figure out what they want to be.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.040]   >> There's no coherent strategy.
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:28.360]   And then what is her name, Decker, the woman they brought in as president?
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.360]   >> Susan Decker.
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.360]   >> Susan Decker.
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:31.360]   Do you know anything about her?
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.360]   >> The CFO.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.760]   She's a bean counter.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:34.920]   She has a very interesting background.
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.280]   If you really start checking her out-- >> Somebody needs to count beans at Yahoo?
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:42.000]   Well, you-- if you really check her out though, you'll find that her background is in M&A.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   >> Oh, we talked about this before.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   >> That's right.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   >> So they brought her in.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   She became the CFO.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.560]   And now they're pushed her as president.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:53.880]   But because of her background, I'm suspicious that the whole thing may not be part of some
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:57.920]   scheme to like, I don't know, sell off parts of the company.
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.080]   You have to merge with somebody else.
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.080]   Buy somebody else.
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.080]   Be bought.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:02.080]   Not sure.
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:06.280]   >> Weird rumor floating around that Google might buy Apple.
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:07.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.280]   >> That's just-- >> I love that one.
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:11.080]   >> That's just-- >> That's just kind of one of those drooled rumors.
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.080]   >> Like along the lines of Apple buying Nintendo.
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:14.080]   >> Right.
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.080]   I'd like Apple buying Nintendo.
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:17.080]   >> But Google buying Apple's CFO.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:18.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:21.200]   That's-- you know, it's really very sad when it's Thursday afternoon and you're contracted
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.600]   to submit something to the website.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.600]   You just don't have anything.
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:25.600]   >> Oh, oh.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:28.440]   >> I mean, just a way of it, this blog post I was about to write-- about to write, what
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.480]   if I just delete the words, wouldn't it be cool if from the lead paragraph?
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.240]   Hey, look, it's a newest item.
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:34.240]   >> Oh, amazing.
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:37.640]   >> I can go home and get waffles now.
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:38.640]   >> So you know--
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.640]   >> One of the time the lead is rumors have circulated.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:41.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:45.360]   It's like the rumor that Microsoft would buy Yahoo, which keeps going around too.
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.560]   >> Do you think though now that we-- that's a little more credible with Susan Decker in
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.560]   charge?
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:53.400]   >> Well, that one is that Microsoft admitted that they had been in talks.
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:54.400]   >> They-- >> Well--
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.400]   >> I think that one was a fairly credible.
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.400]   >> Talking about something, yeah, we don't--
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.040]   >> That at least was in the Wall Street Journal and not Mashable.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.600]   >> That just doesn't make a lot of sense to me.
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:02.600]   >> No, that's the math.
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.760]   >> I've said this before, but I was also dubious about a couple of other things that
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:06.920]   actually came true.
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:13.800]   So my idea-- or my track record on these short-term predictions has not been good recently.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:14.800]   >> It's pretty hard.
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:18.480]   >> Well, the solution is usually ask yourself, what's in it for Apple and what's in it for
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:22.400]   Google and the answers are nothing and a little more than nothing but still not very
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.400]   much.
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:25.720]   >> Oh, you mean like the AOL time-warner merger?
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.720]   >> Yeah, kinda.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:27.720]   >> Well--
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.400]   >> Yeah, but that-- okay, that was fueled by money.
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:31.400]   >> Oh, well--
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.760]   >> I think it's even worse.
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:38.280]   I mean, I think there-- at least both Google and Apple don't do exactly the same thing.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:42.040]   I don't see any connect any way that Microsoft and Yahoo could ever merge because--
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.040]   >> Yeah, it makes no sense.
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:47.320]   >> They're both, you know, kind of in the-- except for the operating system part of it,
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.320]   they--
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:52.080]   >> Well, no, 'cause, you know, MSN and Live Search and all these other Net services are
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:55.760]   just not getting as much traction as they should be getting given how much work that
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.160]   Microsoft is putting into them.
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:00.400]   I mean, Microsoft is in the business of taking the sticker off something they bought and
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.040]   putting a Microsoft logo on it.
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:06.560]   I really think that, you know, again, we're firmly in the realm of the rumor, but I could
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:10.640]   see Microsoft saying, "Look, let's just buy the portal technology we want.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.760]   Let's just buy the search technology we want and call it done and move on with it."
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:14.760]   >> That's kinda what Yahoo!
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:15.760]   >> And buy the user's loyalty.
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:19.760]   >> It's like a little fish getting eaten by a bigger fish bag and eaten by a bigger fish.
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:20.760]   >> Right.
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.000]   >> And I guess Microsoft's the top of that food chain.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.200]   >> Well, I think Microsoft is buying an inferior product if they do it that way.
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:29.400]   It's like, "Let's take our goods-- let's take--" and here's a Cadillac company decides
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:33.320]   to buy some-- the Hugo company slapped a Cadillac logo on it.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.640]   It doesn't make a lot of sense to me.
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.960]   >> You think Amazon search is the Cadillac compared to Yahoo!
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:37.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:38.960]   >> Or Hotmail?
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:39.960]   >> Hotmail?
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:40.960]   >> I exaggerate.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.160]   Maybe I should have said a Renalt or a 2CV.
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.160]   >> Really?
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.160]   They're more than more.
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:46.160]   >> Hotmail is the Lincoln town card.
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.160]   Yahoo!
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:48.160]   Male's Hugo.
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.160]   >> Really?
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.160]   You like it that much better?
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.160]   >> No, no, I'm saying that's kinda crazy.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:52.160]   >> I think they're the same.
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:53.160]   >> I don't buy that at all.
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.160]   >> They're parallel tracks, really.
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.520]   There is a Google Apple Nexus, though.
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.320]   I mean, Eric Schmidt's flashing his iPhone.
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:58.320]   The YouTube is now--
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:00.080]   >> Yeah, Eric Schmidt is on the board.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:03.040]   >> Yeah, YouTube is now for sure on the iPhone.
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.680]   I just installed the YouTube update to Apple TV.
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:09.880]   Now I can watch Dick in a box over and over again on my widescreen TV.
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:12.640]   Never mind.
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:17.480]   I don't understand why that Avril Lavigne video is the number two most 37 million downloads.
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.760]   I'm trying to figure out what's the appeal.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.000]   >> Oh, that reminds me.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.840]   Thanks for the reminder.
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:25.840]   I ran into this guy that-- I forgot all about this too.
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:26.840]   This is embarrassing.
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:30.840]   But I ran into this guy-- I'm not gonna go into too many details, but he says he knows
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:37.760]   how he can game any video system, any video system, especially YouTube, to get what you
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:38.760]   just described.
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:39.760]   >> Oh, really?
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:42.480]   >> Why is this getting so many numbers?
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:46.040]   >> I believe this, I believe this because I can't see any reason why that should be the
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:47.040]   number two video.
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.040]   I mean, it just makes no sense.
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:49.040]   >> It's just not the cue.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:50.440]   >> Yeah, it's just he can game anything.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.680]   I said, "Well, help me out here."
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:53.680]   He says, "Yeah."
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.080]   I said, "Well, let me find some."
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:40:00.360]   Now, just like somebody gives you this opportunity to run your numbers up and then you got nothing.
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:04.000]   >> Especially when there's so many other great videos on YouTube.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.040]   There's a 12-year-old kid in Fresno who just learned how to play the Super Mario theme
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.040]   in his bedroom.
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.040]   How come that video gets ignored?
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.040]   >> That couldn't be the wrong one.
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.040]   >> It's a real gun, man.
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:15.280]   >> I'd rather watch.
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.280]   There are some-- it's funny to see this.
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.880]   The video really is bad quality.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:23.000]   So when you blow it up to 50-inch screen, it really doesn't look so good.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.760]   But at least, you know, if you squint and you get far back from it, you know, you get
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.720]   at least you go get an iPhone.
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:32.720]   Apparently, they're going to do H.264 for the iPhone.
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:33.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:34.720]   >> That's interesting.
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.960]   >> Well, I'm just concerned about it.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:40.040]   So make sure that they don't really limit access to the whole library.
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:42.640]   It's not the permitted videos that are cool.
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:46.720]   It's the ability to see like tonight shows from 1981 that are just--
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.520]   >> Well, on Apple TV you can't.
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.800]   >> Definitely going to be the permitted videos, don't you think?
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:51.800]   >> On the iPhone, yeah.
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:52.800]   >> They're putting their library.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.240]   They're not going to re-encode copyrighted stuff material.
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:58.680]   >> For sure on the iPhone, they've even said it's going to be this selected short.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:59.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.360]   >> But on the Apple TV it's not.
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.560]   >> On the Apple TV it's not.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:06.920]   It's actually taking the top most watched videos just like you would see on YouTube.
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:07.920]   So you can see a lot.
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:11.920]   I mean, I was watching all sorts of Dave Chappelle stuff, Viacom stuff, all the stuff that's
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:12.920]   on those lists.
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:15.080]   >> How do you have time to watch anything?
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.080]   >> Well, they're short.
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:18.520]   >> Well, he's watching stuff now.
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:19.920]   We're just not being very interesting.
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:20.920]   >> That's actually true.
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:21.920]   Sorry.
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:24.480]   I thought this was an interesting story.
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:29.920]   The head of the US Air Force Intelligence and Surveillance on Thursday said data available
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:34.560]   through online mapping software like Google Earth is a dangerous security.
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.480]   >> Yeah, I've heard that.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:44.600]   >> He said you can't undo it, but he says it's really, it gives it's huge.
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.480]   It's something that was a closely guarded secret not that long ago.
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:50.680]   Now everybody has access to it.
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:51.680]   So what?
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:53.920]   >> Yeah, I mean, add another one to the list.
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:56.560]   >> I was a little bit like the albany.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:01.880]   I come look over the Albany Berkeley area thing and they still got big ditch where a big target
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:02.880]   story is.
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:03.880]   I mean, it's the story.
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:04.880]   >> Well, it's not completely up to date.
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:08.480]   >> But they have to date and the end that's nonsense.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.680]   I mean, these guys are just freaks.
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:14.040]   >> Well, I'm sure that's people like with guns.
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:16.240]   >> They're freaks with guns.
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:19.520]   >> I'm sure people like this would like us to know nothing.
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:22.960]   >> Yeah, you know, they want to keep that in a box.
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:23.960]   >> Although it's just-
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:29.520]   >> It's probably somewhat reasonable that you could use it for strategic planning in
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:30.760]   a way that is not desirable.
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:33.280]   >> How about you send somebody over and walk in the area?
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.280]   I mean, come on.
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:36.280]   >> Yeah, I mean, I guess if you're really very terrible-
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.280]   >> The aerial trail, very helpful.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.520]   >> You can use Google Earth.
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:39.520]   That's a good one.
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:42.600]   >> Well, it's not like it's valueless.
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:46.200]   It's just that I find it hard to really take these sort of complaints seriously when-
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:49.000]   >> I was at the MIT flea market on Sunday.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.440]   These are the sort of conversations you have at the MIT flea market.
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.760]   I met a guy who had to give a presentation.
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.360]   I shouldn't give any details.
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:59.880]   But at an office that you've all heard of for a person in the military who you've all
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:05.240]   heard of, and he was setting up his presentation and he had to get a password to activate the
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:07.880]   console and he just guessed and said, "1, 2, 3, 4."
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:08.880]   >> Oh, no.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:09.880]   >> And of course it was the right password.
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:10.880]   >> It worked.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:11.880]   >> It worked.
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:12.880]   >> It worked.
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:13.880]   >> It worked.
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:14.880]   >> Now three minutes later people with guns were asking him who the hell he was and what
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:15.880]   he was doing with the computer.
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:16.880]   But it's like-
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:17.880]   >> But those three minutes.
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:21.760]   >> You're worried about Google Maps and you're not willing to change your password to something
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:25.240]   that you would not use on a pair of tourist or vinyl dip luggage.
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:26.240]   It's like, "Come on."
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:29.760]   >> If you believe Ocean's 13, those three minutes were enough to break the bank.
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:32.400]   >> Don't he gave away my luggage combination.
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:37.240]   >> I'll tell you, spoiler, there's no kissing in Ocean's 13.
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.800]   My wife was very upset, Molly.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:39.800]   >> There's no kissing.
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:42.160]   >> She got all these good looking guys and there's no kissing.
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.160]   >> Of each other.
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.160]   >> No, of girls or anything.
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.160]   There's only one woman in it telling them-
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.160]   >> They're taking the same thing.
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.160]   >> Nobody's kissing.
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.160]   >> They bring the right date.
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:50.160]   >> This is- >> They bring the right date.
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:53.160]   >> This is- >> This is- >> This is- >> This is- >> When I get out of the house, the way it's
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:55.160]   the baby I need to find a kissier movie.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:56.560]   >> Somebody's asking- >> Yes, that's what Jennifer says.
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:57.560]   >> Who cares?
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:00.560]   >> That's what- >> People on the Internet care, John.
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:04.160]   >> We're going to get to the ten most hated words on the Internet.
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.160]   >> There's no kissing.
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:06.160]   >> This is from Buzz Hellow.
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:07.160]   >> Yes.
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.160]   >> Hey, no kissing.
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:10.040]   >> Right above, Lavin.
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:16.480]   >> But it does explain why there were 800 and 44 breaches of the Department of Homeland Security
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:18.480]   computers in 2005-2006.
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:20.480]   >> Yeah, Andy, you're right.
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:21.880]   They've got bigger problems.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:22.880]   >> That's a huge problem.
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:27.000]   They're being grilled in Congress right now once they admitted that.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:34.300]   Now these are the non-secure computers, however, they admit that some classified leakage may
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:35.300]   have occurred.
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:41.120]   >> Why does the Department of Homeland Security- >> My pastor is out in a restaurant in action.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.520]   >> You guys are like 13.
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:46.440]   Why does the Department of Homeland Security have any unsecured computer?
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:47.440]   >> Well, a good point.
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:48.440]   A good point.
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:50.280]   They found- I mean, this is unbelievable.
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:56.000]   They found on DHS machines password dumping programs, multiple viruses and spyware computers
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:01.360]   containing IRC bots, misconfigured firewalls, and I'm sorry, I said leakage.
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:03.360]   I think it's a funnier word.
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:06.360]   Classified data spillage, actually, is the word- >> Spillage.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:10.920]   >> The word for spillage is the technical term.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:14.920]   They plan to spend $332 million on security in 2007.
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:16.920]   >> Oh, what a scam.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.920]   >> A third of a billion dollars.
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.440]   >> One of the three of us get to get informed some security company.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:22.440]   >> No, kid.
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.440]   >> They always just tell them to change their passport.
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:26.720]   >> Yeah, I could be a consultant for the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:30.760]   >> Well, this is what lends color to every time I hear about these massive government
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.400]   conspiracies and these massive plans.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:38.960]   The government consists of tens of thousands of individual people, some of whom just screw
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:39.960]   up.
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:45.360]   >> I don't think this is a problem of one failed agency or one failed policy, there are so
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:49.120]   many little offices that some of them follow the rules, some of them don't.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:50.120]   >> How about this?
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:55.280]   >> I worked in a company that did SEC filings where you could not get onto any part of the
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:56.280]   Internet at large.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:59.480]   Everybody's worked for a company that won't even let you check your email.
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:04.120]   If that organization existed, ought to be Department of Homeland Security, that says,
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:08.960]   "I'm sorry, you can't get to a website that's going to pop up an auto-downloader from Gator."
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:09.960]   >> Right.
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:10.960]   >> Well, how about this?
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:14.000]   A hacker has penetrated the Pentagon's email systems.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.840]   Officials have taken 1,500 accounts offline.
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:21.760]   No classified information, but they got in.
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:23.240]   >> That's an inside job.
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:24.720]   >> That's an inside job.
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:25.720]   >> They got in.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:29.040]   I mean, it's got to be humiliating.
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:31.640]   All right, this is stolen from Buzz out loud, Molly.
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:32.640]   I admit.
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.040]   The 10 most hated words on the Internet.
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:35.880]   >> I wasn't even there for that one.
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:36.880]   >> Good.
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:37.880]   Perfect.
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:38.880]   >> I know.
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:43.720]   >> UK pollsters have completed a survey on the web's most hated words.
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:49.080]   The abominations that threaten to turn English into a long series of utterances at the top
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:51.480]   of the list, the word "foconomy."
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:52.480]   Oh, God.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:55.640]   >> Oh, I'm on time with that.
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:58.440]   >> Followed by blogosphere.
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:00.200]   Even blog people don't like, "Nedicate."
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:01.200]   >> Blook.
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.040]   >> I don't know what "blook" is.
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:04.040]   >> What is that?
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:05.040]   >> Where is this list?
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.040]   >> Books based on blog.
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:07.040]   >> Ours Technica.
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.640]   Actually, it's not because I pulled it from the Buzz out loud list.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:11.560]   It's just good Ours Technica.
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:13.680]   It was published a couple of days ago.
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:15.680]   Actually yesterday.
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.200]   Webinar, ooh.
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:18.200]   >> Ew.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.200]   >> Vlog, which I've never liked.
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.200]   >> Vlog video.
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:21.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:22.200]   >> Social networking.
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.200]   >> Vlog.
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:25.200]   You know, it's a video.
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.200]   >> Vlog video.
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:27.200]   >> Vlog video.
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:30.000]   >> Remember, don't you remember, don't you remember "Twit 57" John?
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   >> Vlog.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.760]   >> The Twit that will live in infamy.
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:39.240]   I was at a Jiku party on Tuesday.
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:40.240]   It's really fun.
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:42.320]   Somebody came up to me and said, "Twit 57."
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:43.320]   I was there.
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:45.240]   >> Oh my god.
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:48.920]   >> That's the one at the vloggies when I was asking everybody what vlog meant.
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:50.840]   >> Over macho grandi.
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:52.640]   I'll never be over macho grandi.
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:54.200]   >> What's the rest of the words?
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:55.200]   >> Cookie.
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:56.200]   I like cookie.
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:57.200]   That's a good thing.
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:58.200]   >> Another just thing that I eat.
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:47:59.200]   >> I'm busy.
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:00.200]   Come on.
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.200]   >> Wiki.
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:02.200]   >> Wiki.
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:06.240]   >> I like it because you know, " Wiki Wiki," like when you're a boy.
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:09.960]   I hate it because it's become the preferred method for product management at a certain
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:11.560]   company that you may not have named.
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:12.560]   >> Right.
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:13.560]   A lot of companies.
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:14.560]   I like Wiki.
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:15.560]   But I can tell you what's sick of it.
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:16.560]   >> I don't mind the word.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.560]   I like it because, you know, " Wiki Wiki," like when you're a boy.
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:19.560]   >> Wiki Wiki.
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:20.560]   >> Wiki Wiki.
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:21.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:23.760]   >> Ours Technica suggests some others.
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:24.760]   Ajaxify.
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:25.760]   >> Web 3.0.
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:26.760]   >> Oh, god.
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:27.760]   >> Crowdsourcing.
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:28.760]   See, I use that a lot.
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:29.760]   >> Oh, god.
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:30.760]   >> Oh, god.
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:31.760]   >> Oh, god.
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:32.760]   I use that a lot.
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:33.760]   I like crowd sourcing.
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:37.760]   Flash mobs and ladies and gentlemen, I should get a drum roll podcast.
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:38.760]   >> Aww.
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:43.680]   >> Hey, but before we wrap this podcast up, I want to thank Audible.com for their support
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.800]   of the show and all the shows on the Twit Network.
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:46.800]   They've been just really great.
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:47.800]   I am an Audible subscriber.
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:50.280]   I know you are too, Molly, for years.
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:54.520]   If you have a commute, it's just, and this was before podcasting even, but I got all my
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:55.520]   reading done.
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:59.920]   I've read hundreds of books by downloading them from Audible.com and putting them on my
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.920]   iPod or other MP3 device.
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:05.240]   The nice thing is you can get those books back.
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:07.360]   I have some great kids books too.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:10.320]   There's some wonderful -- you'll see Molly in a couple of years.
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:11.840]   Boy, for travel, it's great.
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:15.760]   So both Molly and Andy have books to suggest.
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:18.880]   They're a little book club portion of the show.
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:19.880]   You'll have to pick one.
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:24.920]   You can't get both for free, but you can pick one and get it for free at Audible.com/Twit.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:29.600]   Now, I have to make a couple of caveats here because I played with it and I made a few
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:30.600]   mistakes.
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:31.760]   First of all, it is US only.
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:34.440]   You do have to have a credit card and you will be signing up for an Audible account,
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:36.960]   but you can cancel that account any time in the next two weeks.
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:40.320]   So it's free in the sense that if you cancel the account, you owe nothing.
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:43.320]   However, I should mention you do sign up for an Audible account when you do that.
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:44.760]   I have a suggestion too.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:45.760]   Yes, sir.
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:46.760]   No, three books.
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:47.760]   All right.
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:49.720]   Nixon and Kissinger, everyone's raving about it.
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:50.720]   Nixon and Kissinger.
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:52.160]   I write that down.
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:53.160]   Is that Audible?
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:54.160]   Yep.
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:56.880]   You know, I read a book on Audible, and by the way, I hope you don't mind.
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:58.880]   I say read because I really feel like I've read them.
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:49:59.880]   It's not listened to.
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:01.600]   Do you say read or listen?
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:02.600]   I say read.
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.120]   Yeah, because it's confused with people who said I listened to.
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:13.640]   But there's a great book on Nixon and Kennedy that Chris Wallace wrote, not Chris Matthews
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:16.280]   wrote, that is fantastic.
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:19.520]   Did you know that Nixon and Kennedy were best buddies when they were in Congress?
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:24.680]   And in fact, Nixon made a contribution to Kennedy's campaign fund.
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:25.680]   Really?
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:30.520]   They were both junior congressmen and really liked each other and respected each other
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:31.520]   quite a bit in the '50s.
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:34.200]   It's very interesting before they ran for president in 1960.
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:36.120]   But it's a fascinating, I'm sure it's like Nixon and Kissinger.
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:37.360]   I'll have to read both.
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:38.520]   So that's one.
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:41.280]   What's your recommendation, Annie Anaco?
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:43.440]   This is one of my favorite books on tape ever.
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:48.920]   I actually bought it originally on tape for $1.98 at a salvage sale because it was an
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:51.200]   autobiography of a Star Trek cast member.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.520]   And it was like, "Oh, it's going to be horrible.
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.600]   It's going to be like funny stories about Schatner."
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:56.920]   But it actually was one of the best books.
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:51:00.160]   I actually wanted to buy the real book and read it to get all the parts I missed.
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:01.160]   Not "I, Kirk."
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:07.160]   No, no, it's "To the Stars," the autobiography of Star Trek's Mr. Sugu by George Takei.
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:09.760]   Oh, and he's totally cool now again.
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:11.600]   Yes, read by George Takei.
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:13.840]   And that's part of the grandeur of this book.
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:16.320]   Now, you take it just because you do a George Takei impression.
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.320]   I think so too.
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:19.760]   The "To the Book" is too good.
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:21.320]   That's the only way you're right.
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:22.320]   No, no, no.
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:26.960]   I must have listened to this book all the way through three times because, again, first
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:30.840]   of course, you just want to see the-- I want to see all the awful stories about Schatner.
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:37.600]   But actually, he starts about his childhood as growing up, the son of Japanese immigrants,
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:42.280]   being in a tournament camp, his role as an actor, and then being politically active and
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:43.280]   in the growth of LA.
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:44.280]   All right, let's do it.
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:45.280]   We're going to do a contest here.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:46.760]   Because yours is so good.
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:47.760]   Who is this?
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:51.760]   Is this Anionaco or George Takei, ladies and gentlemen, listening closely?
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:54.840]   It's held in Los Angeles.
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:57.800]   Fans flew in from all around the world.
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:02.080]   The convention was a tribute to Gene Roddenberry, the creator of Star Trek.
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:03.400]   All right, what's your guess?
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:08.400]   So, you know, the difference between Anionaco's imitation of him and the real guy who was
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:13.360]   that was is that Anionaco, you've got to slow it down just even more.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:15.920]   It's not quite malefluous enough.
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:17.560]   Who singing was sublime.
[00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:20.600]   Now you got it.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:21.600]   That's the drinking game.
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:24.720]   Every time you hear him say the word sublime, you take a drink.
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:25.720]   Take a shot of Jaeger.
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:27.520]   You'll be on the floor in like 40 minutes.
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.640]   But you're saying it's a good book too.
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:31.320]   It really is a good compelling book.
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:34.960]   Again, not only did I buy the book on tape, I actually paid full price for the actual book
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:36.360]   itself because I wanted to read.
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:40.280]   Though the version I had was slimmed down a little bit.
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:42.560]   But this is also the abridged version.
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:43.560]   But it really is.
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.000]   It's like three hours long.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.320]   It really is a very good book.
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:49.520]   To the stars, the autobiography of Mr. Swear.
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:50.680]   There is dirt against Shatner.
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:54.440]   So don't be disappointed there for all the wrong reasons if you want to listen to this.
[00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:56.040]   It's so Molly, what's yours?
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:53:00.280]   I think just because the audio format suits it so well, I really enjoyed listening to
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:01.880]   Al Franken's "Lies and Lying Liars."
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:04.040]   Oh, it was so I listened to that too.
[00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:05.040]   He reads it.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:07.160]   So it's read by Al Franken.
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:08.160]   And then he's got all the great--
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:09.160]   Okay, do your Al Franken imitation.
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:10.160]   Come on.
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:11.160]   I know.
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:12.160]   I didn't know.
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:13.160]   Why do I have to go after it?
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:14.160]   Come on.
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:15.160]   He had a good headline.
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:16.160]   He is so funny.
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:18.240]   And you're absolutely right.
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:20.480]   And he reads it.
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:23.240]   You hear his voice, frankly, when you read the book, you hear his voice.
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.240]   You do.
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:25.240]   And so then to listen to it is outstanding.
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:29.160]   And he has a bunch of the actual media clips, like clips from the Rush Limbaugh Show and
[00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:30.160]   clips from Radio.
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:33.600]   Like, it's just a really rich listening experience, very good book to listen to.
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:36.200]   Yeah, they make it a-- here's my impression of him.
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:37.200]   Chemistry department.
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:41.440]   Most of the graduate level courses are Harvard was boring me.
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:43.240]   I got to run Harvard.
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:44.240]   Thanks.
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:45.240]   Pretty good, huh?
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:46.240]   This is just like a minute.
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:47.240]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:49.240]   Yeah, especially when you talked over it.
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:50.240]   Yeah, I like that.
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:51.240]   You're like a ventriloquist.
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:53.240]   That's amazing how you can fade in.
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:54.240]   You're impressed.
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.240]   Like that.
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:57.240]   All right, you got me.
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:58.240]   I have to learn that.
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:00.240]   You got me.
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:02.760]   You can pick one, not all three, but you know what?
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:05.240]   This is why you have to subscribe because you're going to want to hear all three.
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:07.240]   What do you-- you should subscribe to it.
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:08.240]   You should subscribe to it.
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:09.240]   You get unlimited books or what?
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:10.240]   No, no.
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:11.240]   Here's the audible.com/twit.
[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:14.240]   They have a number of subscription policies.
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:16.240]   I don't know what you call them.
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:22.240]   But the 1495, you get a book a month plus additional credits.
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:24.240]   And then there are other levels you can subscribe.
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:28.240]   That's kind of like Netflix where you get-- but the nice thing is you don't send them back.
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:29.240]   You get to keep these books.
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:31.240]   So you can listen to them again.
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:33.240]   How many books a month do you get on the molly?
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:38.240]   I do the yearly plan because I think it works out to 12.
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:40.240]   I guess 12 books, one of them.
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:41.240]   Right, yeah.
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:43.240]   But it's like a little deeper than the 1495.
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:45.240]   I was doing two a month for a while.
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:47.240]   When I drove, I drove in two hours a day.
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:49.240]   Yeah, I started it when I was commuting to.
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:52.240]   I actually had to downgrade the plan because I was listening to the company by Robert Latel,
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:53.240]   also very interesting.
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:54.240]   Oh, but long.
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:56.240]   And it's 50 hours.
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:59.240]   But that is one of the best-- that is worth 50 hours.
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:00.240]   It's so worth it.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:01.240]   You know what?
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:04.240]   And I had to downgrade my plan because I was spending so much time--
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:07.240]   It's a history of the C-- a fictionalized history of the CIA, but it's interesting.
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:08.240]   Yeah, but--
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:09.240]   And it's so true.
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:10.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:14.240]   What's interesting to me, I think people overlook is the poor announcer.
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:16.240]   He has to talk for 50 hours?
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:17.240]   Yeah, 50 hours.
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:21.240]   You know how many hours of podcasts I do every month, John C. de Vorat?
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:23.240]   Well, yeah, but you could talk forever, Leo.
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:26.240]   I do well over 50 hours a month, so I have no sympathy.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:28.240]   Well, I think you should get some--
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:29.240]   You should get some books.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:30.240]   Do some books.
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:32.240]   And then Leo and I should compare our favorite.
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:38.240]   I have my favorite readers, like the-- I have my favorite narrators, and I always look for books that they do.
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:39.240]   Me too.
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:40.240]   Yeah, and you start to become a fan of the narrator.
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:41.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:42.240]   And you can search by narrator.
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:44.240]   But I don't think George Takeda-- does he do a lot of them?
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:45.240]   I don't think you--
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:46.240]   Yeah, he does anymore.
[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:47.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:48.240]   Actually, yes.
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:50.240]   There's quite a few-- wait a minute.
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:50.240]   There are--
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:51.240]   I don't know.
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:53.240]   George Takeda can't a couple of the different star--
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:54.240]   He does.
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:55.240]   He does.
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:58.240]   He and Leonard Nimoy rate Star Trek Enterprise the first adventure.
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:55:59.240]   Outstanding.
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:01.240]   That would be great.
[00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:02.240]   Oh, no.
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:03.240]   See, this ad has gone on way too long in the format.
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:04.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:06.240]   See, I've just been looking to three more books.
[00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:09.240]   I want to recommend the books we've been talking about before.
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:10.240]   They've got it.
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:11.240]   They've got it.
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:13.240]   You can go to audible.com/twit.
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:14.240]   Pick a book.
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:15.240]   You get it for free.
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.240]   You'll subscribe to Audible.
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.240]   You can quit if you want.
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:19.240]   But I have a feeling after you hear all these.
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:20.240]   You'll want to download some more.
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:21.240]   They're just wonderful.
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:22.240]   Thank you.
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:24.240]   We do thank Audible for their support.
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:25.240]   And they sponsor the segment.
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:26.240]   It's not all ad.
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:27.240]   I mean, we're also doing books.
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:29.240]   That's how it works.
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:30.240]   But that's fun.
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:32.240]   See, it's so fun to talk about books.
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:33.240]   I just-- I enjoy it.
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:35.240]   I think I see another podcast.
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:36.240]   You know, I think you might be right.
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:37.240]   The Leo Lebord.
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:38.240]   Leo Lebord.
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:39.240]   Leo Lebord's book club.
[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:40.240]   Yeah.
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:41.240]   They were thinking about Audible.
[00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:42.240]   Bigger than Oprah.
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:43.240]   I don't know if they would do this.
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:48.240]   But Audible did-- maybe they were just holding this out as a, you know, just to tease me.
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:50.240]   But they were thinking of doing like a--
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.240]   --twit pics on the front page there.
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:53.240]   You know how they have the pics section?
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:54.240]   They should.
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:56.240]   They should because we've come up with like a dozen great books.
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:57.240]   I don't know.
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:58.240]   I don't know.
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:56:59.240]   Do a show.
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:01.240]   I mean, I think we ever-- I could come up with like-- just browsing now.
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:02.240]   I'd find like six.
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:03.240]   I'm like, wow.
[00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:04.240]   They got the king with comedy.
[00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:05.240]   Oh my god.
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:06.240]   They've got the--
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:07.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:08.240]   The king comedy's on there.
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:09.240]   Yeah, it's not read by Jerry, though.
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:10.240]   And then--
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:12.240]   --on Chris and the hotel hotel.
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:13.240]   I can't finish this.
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:14.240]   Onward.
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:21.240]   A proposed amendment to the current copy protection license covering DVDs would ban all DVD copying.
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:23.240]   That'll solve the problem.
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:24.240]   Gee.
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:25.240]   Done and done.
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:27.240]   What an interesting idea.
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:29.240]   Unbelievable.
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:34.240]   It's the-- the amendment is formally referred to as the Unknown Specification Amendment.
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:39.240]   It's being considered by the Content Protection Advisory Council of the DVD CCA.
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:44.240]   If it's enacted, it would be combining in 18 months.
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:52.240]   It's not a-- it's an amendment that would be adopted-- I'm confused-- adopted by the CCA.
[00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:53.240]   Yeah.
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:55.240]   Which is-- which--
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:57.240]   Well, it's a front for somebody else.
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:58.240]   It's a front, right?
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:04.040]   But doesn't this come at a time when at least one network is already experimenting with your-- the
[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:05.040]   ability to allow backups?
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:12.040]   Well, the reason this happened is because of the DVD Jukebox, which won its case, right?
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:16.040]   They defeated a suit by the Control Copy Association-- Copy Control Association.
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:18.040]   Because, you know, they copied the DVD.
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:21.040]   And the reason the court said, "Well, look, you have to buy the DVD.
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:22.040]   It's not going away.
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:23.040]   It's in the machine.
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:25.040]   So what's the problem?"
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:30.040]   Anyway, if the-- I'm not sure what happens if the CCA adopts this.
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:32.040]   Does it make it law?
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:33.040]   I mean, what does it mean?
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:35.040]   Does it mean you go to jail?
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:36.040]   Or what?
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:37.040]   They come knocking?
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:38.040]   Time to--
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:39.040]   I'm going to get into it.
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:43.040]   It's the-- it's Blu-ray and HD DVD who are worried-- were already working on a final spec
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:45.040]   for legal copies, for managed copies.
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:46.040]   Really?
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:47.040]   Blu-ray and HD DVD, yeah.
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.040]   Huh.
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:50.040]   Something along the lines of the old DAT tape.
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:58.040]   Yeah, it would be, you know, heavily DRMed, but it's-- they're working it into the AACS.
[00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:00.040]   There's another rabbit-proof, friends.
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:01.040]   It's ridiculous.
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:02.040]   Yeah.
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:03.040]   Well, I got a take-off.
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:04.040]   Yeah, me too, actually.
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:05.040]   All right.
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:05.040]   I'm not--
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:06.040]   I'm not--
[00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:07.040]   I'm not--
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:07.040]   I'm not--
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:08.040]   I'm not--
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:08.040]   I'm not--

[00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:19.040]   I'm not--
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:20.040]   I'm not--
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:21.040]   I'm not--
