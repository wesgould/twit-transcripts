[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.120]   all up at a tiny little package. Put a bow on it every Sunday afternoon. And part of the
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.120]   thing we do here is we bring in some of the best people to really analyze the week's stories.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.440]   And what a week this has been. Let me start all the way on your right, John C. DuVorak.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:31.360]   Your left, I guess. John C. DuVorak is here. Hi, channeld DuVorak.com. He's a good looking
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.480]   fell. I'm sorry, did I wake you?
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.400]   No, I was going to say you didn't mention no agenda show. No agenda show. No agenda show
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.560]   dot com twice a week. Yeah. Double the pleasure of the last no agenda show dot com. That's
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.760]   the money maker. And also with us brand new first time, right? Yep. Nathan Oliveris.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.240]   Giles. He is one of the newer guys at the digits blog at the Wall Street Journal. Welcome.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.920]   Thanks for having me. Where are you before that? Before that the verge most recently
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.160]   and why are the LA Times? We're so glad to have you. Thanks.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.440]   Yeah. And I work together at the LA Times. There you go. Mark Millian, formerly LA Times.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.520]   He's now at Bloomberg Business Week. It's great to have you, Mark. Good to be here.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:15.600]   We have some really good people to talk about the very, very big story. What's up? So it's
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.320]   a really fascinating story from a lot of angles. And of course, the big angle is $19 billion.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.400]   350 plus million per employee. Yeah. That works there. That's the highest. First of
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.720]   all, it's the largest acquisition of a VC funded startup in history. It's one of the largest
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.000]   acquisitions in history. It actually dwarfs HP's acquisition of Ross Perot's EDS. It's bigger
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.640]   than the Skype acquisition. It is the biggest internet deal since AOL Time Warner. And look
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.160]   how well that worked out. It's actually close to what they paid $22 billion or something
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.080]   like that. I can't remember. But it's at $19 billion now. So it's $12 million in Facebook
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:59.960]   stock. It is $4 billion, which is 35% of Facebook's cash position, $4 billion in cash. And so that
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.880]   makes six of these treasury stock that dilutes the value for everybody or not. It is, I think,
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.680]   a class C. But I don't know. I'll have to look at that. That's a good. That's actually
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.800]   a very interesting question for the Bloomberg guy. He should know that Raft the top of his
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.400]   head of yours for boom. And then another $3 billion in potential stock grants over the
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.200]   next few years, depending on performance. So it could be it's any somewhere between 16
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:31.600]   and 19 billion. You probably saw the Time magazine graph. It's the biggest acquisition.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.240]   It's a whopping acquisition, a deal of historic proportions. Terry McCracken put together a
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:43.200]   graph of other acquisitions. Motorola was only $12 billion for Kukul. And remember, gosh,
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.960]   it only seems like a few years ago that Facebook blew us all away by paying a billion dollars
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.480]   for Instagram. That's nothing. That was jaw dropping at the time. They should have held
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:05:00.520]   out. They're essentially paid per customer. They paid $100 ahead. No, actually, that's
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:09.000]   what's interesting about this. Facebook stocks values it around $147 per head user. Yeah.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   What's app was only $42? I thought it was a hundred. No, 42. So they have because they
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.360]   have $450 billion users. Is that reasonable? You always talk about that number that that's
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.680]   often a number used for this kind of calculation. During the dot com era, we used to watch that
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.440]   number all the time. How much a user is worth? Yeah. And it tended to be for cable TV. It
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.320]   would approach 50 bucks in some situations. So this isn't a weird number. But generous
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:39.760]   10. Yeah. Yeah. I remember that when Paul Allen bought charter, he paid something like
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.840]   $50 a subscriber and everybody bemoaned. It was outrageous. Yeah. Actually, it was more
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.880]   like a hundred, I think, outrageous inflationary amount. All right. Well, there's so many ways
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.760]   to slice this. First of all, congratulations to Yang, Coom and Brian Act and the founders.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:00.840]   Yeah. They're buying. You know, the big one of the big winners, of course, is Sequoia
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:07.080]   Capital. They're the only investors in this. They had put in about $60 million into WhatsApp.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.120]   They're going to get a return of around of over $3 billion. They got to feel pretty good
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.160]   about that right now. That's a good. Yeah. That was a good bet. And like you said, they
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:21.440]   were the only VC firm that got in. It seemed like Jan wanted to avoid having a bunch of
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.160]   VCs in there with voting power who were trying to tell them to put ads or whatever in there.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.680]   So I think he found a believer in Sequoia and they kind of let him do his thing and it paid
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:40.520]   off for them. According to a fortune, Sequoia's stake in WhatsApp is less than 20% high teens.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.840]   Which means more than 80% stays with the founders and the employees. That's a pretty big thing.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.120]   Jan especially is a multi-billionaire. Many times over, like 45% of the company or somewhere
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:56.720]   around that I think is Jan's. Yeah, that's a lot of the six plus billion dollars. It's
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:04.080]   an interesting story. When he was 16, he and his mom moved out of Kiev in the Ukraine,
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.160]   leaving his dad behind. They were Jewish and there was widespread anti-Semitism at the
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.240]   time. Came to the United States. According to a really good article written by Forbes,
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.560]   where she did the research, his mom brought a suitcase full of Soviet era notebooks with
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.480]   her because she was afraid they wouldn't have the money to buy notebooks for Jan's schooling.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.680]   He didn't like school very much but was a computer whiz, studied networking, was able
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.200]   to get a job, didn't go to college, was able to get a job out of high school, didn't go
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:35.000]   to college right away. At Ernst & Young working as a technical auditor, that's when he first
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.920]   met Brian Acton at Yahoo. He sat across from him. Acton employee 44 at Yahoo. He had some
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:48.400]   money. He'd been investing in the tech bubble but lost a lot of it in the tech crash. Both
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:54.600]   he and Jan hit it off after Acton left. They both actually, Jan joined him at Yahoo. They
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:02.040]   both left Yahoo. Around 2007, I think they went for a year traveling around South America
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:09.400]   playing Ultimate Frisbee and just hanging out. Sounds like fun. They can do that for the
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.400]   rest of their life now. They can play a lot of Ultimate Frisbee for that amount of money.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:22.920]   That's some very high quality Frisbee diss. Interesting post. This is on Flyer Talk which
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:31.760]   is a forum for frequent flyers. May 9th, 2009, JKB76. I don't know if this is Brian or
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.640]   Jan but he says, "Hi, there's shameless self promotion. I couldn't resist posting here
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:40.400]   because I wrote this app with people like us in mind. Those who travel a lot. Ever since
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.640]   I semi-retired a little over a year ago, must be Brian Acton. I've been traveling a lot
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.080]   and hated it when people tried to reach me when I'm on the planer out of the country.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.360]   So I asked myself, "Wouldn't it be cool if I just set a status for my iPhone similar
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.800]   to how you could set a status on Yahoo Messenger or Skype?" Problem found, problem solved.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:01.520]   I spent a couple of months developing a little tool called What's App. You can let you set
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.960]   a status like on the flight to Munich, send an email instead of calling me. I would like
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.160]   to hear your feedback and suggestions on the idea. This thread is still alive and if
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.680]   you go to the last page, there's quite a few people saying, "Hey, I like that app. Nice
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.680]   job. You made some money, didn't you?" Pretty amazing story.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:23.480]   And the BlackBerry app is coming, he says, in the announcement.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.760]   They did in fact. One of the real success stories of What's App is it's totally class
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:33.840]   platform. Except for iPad and desktop. No desktop, which is weird, isn't it?
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.080]   Which is kind of annoying. Hopefully, Facebook will maybe help them out with that.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:43.960]   Did you use What's App before this? I had it. It's obviously not big in America. So most
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.280]   of my friends here I wouldn't talk to. But I spoke with some of my colleagues who are
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.720]   based overseas. I had one friend who did a lot of overseas traveling. That's how I got
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.240]   to know What's App because she would use it all the time. And it's the only reason
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:00.720]   I had it. I'd uninstalled it a long time ago because I didn't need to talk to her anymore.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.320]   When I reinstalled it, it's not changed much over the last few years. It allows you to
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:13.720]   send text messages, video, audio, pictures. You could do group or single contact messaging.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.280]   It takes a context from your contact book because it uses your phone number as your
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.920]   contact name.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:25.640]   Which a number of apps, even Facebook Messenger does that now they let you use your phone
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:31.440]   number to find other friends to connect with. But it's become huge. It's become big in parts
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:37.280]   of Asia, but huge in Europe because the European carriers tend to gouge customers and charge
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.760]   extra if you're texting with someone who's in another country. I mean, going to another
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.920]   country in Europe is like going to another state here. You can road trip to another country.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:51.040]   So this has really taken off there as an alternative to having to pay per message through your
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.840]   carrier.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:56.800]   Another reason my friend Alan Tepper who's from Spain and speaks Castilian, he'd want
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:03.560]   me to say that Castilian says it takes diacritical marks very well, accents and circumflexes,
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.640]   Sidias. And that's something a lot of text messaging apps don't do very well. You know,
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.760]   Facebook acquired Beluga two years ago.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.760]   Yeah, did all the same things, right? It's identical. That's what they made Messenger.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.400]   But they didn't have 450 million people using it.
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.800]   That's the key, isn't it?
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.840]   Have you used anything that you used before this?
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.240]   Yeah, actually earlier this week I wrote a story just kind of rounding up all of the
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.120]   different apps out there. So there's like Kakao Talk, there's Line apps that are a lot
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.280]   more popular in Asia because they have stickers and you can share like animated little like
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.640]   characters that are dancing around stuff. Those apps can do far more stuff and they're
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:41.600]   actually way more popular in Asia. But like Mark said in Europe, what's app is kind of
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.560]   where it's at because there's just this big big momentum. Everyone's on it. And really,
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.720]   I mean, when I look at WhatsApp, I don't really see too much that I want to do with
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:55.320]   it. I don't use it very much, you know, because a lot of my friends in the US, but you know,
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.360]   messaging services only as good as the people who you're messaging with. So if all your
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.360]   friends are on it, it kind of makes sense.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.480]   It's the network effect. That's what made Facebook successful.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.480]   Exactly.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.800]   Is it in fact, they say in Spain, it's almost 100% penetration. Nobody uses text messaging
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:14.160]   in Spain. What's app? There were 54 billion messages December 31st of this year for New
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:21.280]   Year's Eve, 54 billion. Yeah, 450 million users. It's currently more text messaging goes
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.360]   over WhatsApp than all of the SMS services worldwide.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:29.360]   There's not 54 billion users. No, it's 450 million users, but they sent a lot of
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:34.840]   messages. 54 billion messages. Yeah, I know. Then you said, I'm sorry. You can listen
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:39.680]   to the tape, ladies and gentlemen. I said it right. No, you'll see. It's a good thing
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:44.040]   you're here to keep them in line. Thank God. We're taking this. In any event, it's clearly
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:48.440]   successful, but my question is what keeps it successful? This is the problem with a network
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.840]   effect. If somebody leaves as they did my space and uses something else, remember ICQ?
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:57.840]   It was pretty popular in the day. Well, once the messenger was somebody bought ICQ and
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.840]   screwed it up though. It was an L.O.L.C. Yeah. And at the time, somebody was tweeting a
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.960]   New York Times story that they covered at the time saying, "A well's acquisition of
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:11.320]   ICQ gives them access to a new user base, a younger audience that may not like..."
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:17.200]   Same thing. Yeah. Well, this used to be predating all this to be one of the older
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:23.120]   farts here. This used to be the reputation Xerox had. Xerox used to buy a company and
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:27.400]   then the thing would just fold and they bought Shugart Drives. Boom, no more disk drive
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.040]   company there. They had to go off and spin off another one. There's one after the other
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:36.280]   and there's a bunch of jinx companies. I think AOL was one for a long time and it hasn't
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:42.240]   happened yet with Facebook. But Yahoo is the best example of this. They buy a bunch of
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.520]   stuff and then they let it languish and it drops dead. But Yahoo tends to buy back to
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:52.040]   the ones like broadcast.com. You know, when they threw $3 billion down the drain. Yahoo
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:57.680]   tends to buy things that don't fit into its mission, whatever that may be. I mean, delicious
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:03.560]   was an example of just buying something because it's available. That was a product a lot of
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:11.640]   people liked. Yeah. But it didn't fit it. Yahoo's core audience is sort of mass consumption.
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:18.720]   They're a portal and it's the home page that my mom has on her computer. And to go after
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.440]   sort of this like niche, techy audience that delicious was big in was just a weird pick
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:27.960]   for them. But I think WhatsApp, their user base pretty much fits into where Facebook
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:32.120]   wants to be. That raises a couple of questions because they already had the technology. Oh,
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:37.360]   they get right. They didn't gain anything. By the way, WhatsApp has written an Erlang
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.280]   scales nicely, but I don't doubt it will integrate well into the PHP infrastructure
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.600]   over at Facebook. In fact, that's they say they're not going to integrate it that it's
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:49.760]   going to be they're going to ask us actually wise that's smart. You'd lose it. Well, you
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.880]   got to be careful because you don't want the real challenge here is you can't monetize
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:58.400]   it very well because one of the things that is a big deal at WhatsApp is no ads. They
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:02.160]   even say that when you first sign up why we don't take ads and they're saying they're
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.600]   going to keep it that way, add free, which you have to because all right, I'll go out
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:12.200]   on a limb. This is a disaster. It's the stupidest thing these guys could have possibly done.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:17.840]   It's I agree with you 100%. You agree? You know, I think 19 billion dollars right now
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:23.000]   seems like an insane amount of money and it could end up being early stupid move, but
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.600]   they need to get more and more users. They need to grow and they just got 450 million
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:33.080]   people who are using their service. Isn't that aren't all of those people also using
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:37.680]   Facebook already? They might be using Facebook, but they're not using Facebook for a messaging.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:43.400]   Yeah. So maybe they're using Facebook to see like their friends, baby pictures or sharing
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.680]   a news story. So maybe they're not sharing every day in the same way. Here, this is a
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:52.240]   very sticky app. I think there's something like 70% of the people who use WhatsApp use
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:59.920]   it every single day. 40 averages of 1200 messages a month sent to over 2000 received
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:04.880]   40 pictures a month. The trouble is that with these types of apps, the way that they're
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:09.640]   designed, the way that they become so popular is that there is no lock in into these apps.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:14.440]   Your contact list is what's on your phone. It could have backed any other app. Take it
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:19.160]   and go anywhere else you want. So and even think it wasn't a bad idea, Mark?
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.200]   I think there are two schools of thought. Like we talked about earlier, the price per
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:29.200]   user is not crazy compared to Twitter or Facebook and this that's as valued by the stock market.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:34.040]   But before you go on with that argument, the reason that price per user was extremely
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:41.400]   important as a metric in the in the late 90s in particular is because those users translated
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:46.600]   to dollar revenue. There's no revenue in there. It's a bucket year, baby.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.000]   So if somebody is so you have a guy and you're paying if you say you're paying 10 bucks a
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.600]   head, that guy has to generate $10 in revenue at some point to get your money back. If you're
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:01.840]   paying like 50, 60, 70, whatever these guys paid, you say 60, 50, say 45, 45 is a lot.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:07.640]   Well, especially since it's a bucket year, 45 years to pay a new model they have right
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:12.000]   now. It's still relatively young app. They could introduce stickers, which has been actually
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:19.920]   a surprisingly big business. Well, not stickers is not a million dollars for a company.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:30.400]   It's past entire model. Well, miss you websites. There are other conceivable models like micro
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:36.280]   payments that perhaps could be big multi-billion dollar businesses if you can integrate them
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:39.800]   into WhatsApp and not lose the user base. I don't think they can add ads, but they could
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.680]   add functionality. Well, seriously, you bring that up because a lot of the Asian messaging
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:49.240]   apps like Line and others are actually using their messaging apps as kind of like a platform
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:54.880]   to get payments to get stickers, but then also to serve up games to serve up like ebooks,
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.880]   all sorts of things on the top of it. So they're trying to kind of leverage that network that
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:02.080]   exists. I think you can bet that Facebook is aware of that and says this is what we're
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.720]   going to have to do with WhatsApp, but you're never going to get in China because China's
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:10.160]   already occupied. You're going to get the countries you've got. I don't know if the
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.040]   growth, the growth, they more than doubled this year. It did, but I don't know if that
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.640]   growth curve can continue. One thing that was interesting, there's a story that I think
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:21.560]   it was like the China Daily Morning Post or something like that that was in 2012. It
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:26.120]   said 45% of Hong Kong was using WhatsApp. So it is popular in China.
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:31.240]   In China. In mainland China. I was talking to one of my colleagues in Taiwan after the
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:36.800]   deal went down in Taipei and he was telling me, we were talking about this sort of lock
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:41.520]   in effect and he was saying him and all of his friends in Taipei have WhatsApp, but they
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:46.880]   also have Line and WeChat. They have them all and they send stickers online and then
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:53.240]   they'll switch over to your new app to chat. But don't you know, if you're in WhatsApp,
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:57.360]   you can only message WhatsApp users. You can't go across platforms. Which is why you have
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.360]   all the app.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:03.000]   Any media product that we could all four of us can design right now and they could do
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.960]   talk to all these different Facebook. I think there's certain amount of this. By the way,
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.520]   it could be called Facebook because you could say, well, okay, this will inter-optorate with
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.360]   Facebook Messenger. Maybe we'll acquire another one.
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:18.640]   But you don't want to be a Facebook member. But you are by the, I bet you, I'm not. But
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.960]   I bet you as a WhatsApp user, you become a default Facebook user.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.760]   They'll use your Facebook lock in or something. I refuse. Oh, good luck.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:31.600]   They're literally pretty far. They're going to have to be careful with how they play this
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:36.240]   because already the acquisition has gone down and you can see a lot of users online who
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:44.480]   are scared that Facebook is going to eat up all their data and ship it over to the NSA.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:50.400]   And you know, I've been talking with the Mark Zuckerberg of Russia, this guy, Pavel
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:55.880]   Duroff. Oh, he's an interesting character. So his new project is Zuckerberg of Russia.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.160]   Yeah, I've been reading your articles about it.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.960]   It's been like TACTA, which is the biggest social network in Russia. His newest project
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:11.000]   is called Telegram. It's essentially a WhatsApp clone for messaging and their usage has skyrocketed
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.520]   since the deal because they play up their encryption and the security of the messages
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:22.600]   that you sent on their service, how it's unbreakable. And so you've already seen a lot of people
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:27.280]   in Spain and the Netherlands and some in Germany and some of these very privacy privacy
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.160]   conscious markets jumping from WhatsApp to Telegram.
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:34.560]   This should be a smart thing to do with WhatsApp. Maybe Mark Zuckerberg steps forward and says,
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:39.320]   I want to be the Pavel Duroff of the United States. No, we're going to actually in serious
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.080]   and steps forward and says, we're going to make this like three more. We're going to
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:46.240]   make this encrypted end to end. We're going to make it secure. We know your privacy counts.
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.240]   We are going to.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:52.520]   When is he going to believe it? Nobody's going to believe it. He doesn't believe that himself.
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:57.400]   He likes the world and life is better when you're connected. He likes the idea of no privacy.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:02.640]   So here's the other possibility. This was a pure paranoia play. I mean, this is a company
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:07.240]   that's growing at a faster rate than Facebook. Yeah. They're a threat to Facebook. Instagram,
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:10.880]   I think was a paranoia play. You buy Instagram not because you plan to do anything with it.
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:16.200]   You've thought this out. That's why this segment's so long. Sitting there, stewing with
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:20.200]   this information because you're like, is that what we're supposed to do? You're not popping.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.840]   You're popping with one idea after another. It's nonstop. Well, here's the one rumor,
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:31.880]   according to, I think was a fortune said that Google had offered them 10 billion earlier
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:32.880]   this week.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:36.760]   Fortune and the information have done some reporting. The information said that Google
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:42.600]   crazy six months ago offered WhatsApp an unspecified amount of money to let them know
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.920]   before they made a deal with anybody else. Apparently, according to the information I'm
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:50.720]   here at Friday, writing this, no, they did they what's up turned them down. I think that's
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:54.720]   a funny thing to say. Look, we don't want you, but please, if somebody else tries to
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:59.280]   buy you, let us know, especially Facebook. Yeah. Is it credible that Google could have
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:03.760]   offered them 10 billion? Oh, Google has more cash than Facebook. Google could have offered
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:10.240]   however much. Fortune says they have two sources that say this, but the Facebook offered,
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:16.560]   WhatsApp, a seat on the board and Google did not. That doesn't surprise me because Yankum
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.880]   and Brian Acton clearly want to maintain control. If they have a seat on the board,
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:26.720]   they have a shot at derailing any effort to absorb the company and things like that. They
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:31.480]   want the power. They don't just want the money. They want to protect their baby. But I think
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:38.320]   Facebook did this because they were scared of what of some, but very rightly of getting
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:45.680]   my spaced. That's their biggest problem right now is that Facebook needs to it. I'm sure
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:49.480]   that they have a metric in their mind. If we get to this certain point, then we've got
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:54.120]   critical mass and we can't be my spaced. We cannot be replaced by some other social network,
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:59.220]   but we've got to get to that point. And Mark is all in. This is basically him pushing
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:04.580]   in every bit of his chips. 10% of his cash position, though 3% of his cash present, 10%
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:09.420]   of his company's value. I'm going to go all in because we just have to survive several
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:15.080]   more years and then no one can assail us. That's laughable. You think there's nowhere
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:19.620]   you can get to that you're safe? Right. Yeah, you have to just be running all the time.
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:24.780]   He reminds me of like there's different. He'll be fine, but as opposed to my space, which
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:29.200]   stopped running. He's all but remember, Mark's only spending inflated, mostly spending
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.980]   inflated stock. Right. He's taking advantage of this idea.
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:36.320]   This is the time to do it. Yeah. You do it when you can. And it's like, but the main
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:41.920]   to maintain a running position like Adobe does, let's say with Photoshop, they keep changing
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.820]   it. It's like as though somebody's chasing him, even though I'm sure there's nothing
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:52.000]   changing as chasing them as what the gimp on Linux. And so they keep modifying and they're
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   moving ahead as if someone's chasing them. And that's how you stay. That's how you do
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.160]   it at the top. What was it? Andy Grove wrote his book Only The Paranoid.
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:04.840]   You can look at Instagram as kind of a similar defensive move. I mean, Facebook became this
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:08.840]   place where everyone was sharing their photos so much to the detriment of Flickr. Now Instagram
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.200]   is becoming the one place where everyone is sharing the photos, especially younger user
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:16.880]   base. So what they do, they bought Instagram and they left it alone. They didn't absorb
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:21.120]   it in the company. They didn't potentially ruin it. Now here you have another thing.
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.920]   Instead of folks messaging on Facebook, they're messaging on apps like what's that right?
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:29.760]   So they're going to buy it. Ideally, if they do what they say now, leave it alone. So maybe
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.600]   there's other defensive plays like this.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.280]   Where the Snapchat fit into the picture? Well, now I don't laugh so much.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:39.840]   No, we're never. Snap Chat saying, I'm not going to take your three billion that maybe
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:46.680]   they were right. Three billion is a paltry sum. Well, what's that? Snapchat doesn't really
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:50.400]   talk about their user number. So we don't really have a good sense of how big they are.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:54.800]   Generally, when you don't talk, that means you're not as big as people think you are.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:25:00.480]   That would be your normal guess. Yes. What's that has talked about message message numbers,
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:05.760]   user numbers, 450 million. I can assure you, Snapchat is nowhere near. That's a lot. That
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:12.960]   big. No one. It's primarily a US twice Twitter size. Snapchat. No one's that big except Facebook.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:18.160]   I think Snapchat needs to be kept. You have to keep an eye on that company. I'm just saying
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.800]   this is something I like the app. I think it's fun. Really? For changing the next thing
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:30.000]   or what do you do with it? You're like all other other dog. Yeah, you're like all us
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.080]   other old guys. We assume they must be sending dirty pictures. A picture. Kids go, what?
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:42.840]   I just my partner who keeps asking for pictures. Oh, really? Adam? Yeah. Adam Curry wants pictures
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:50.440]   of your junk? Not me. That's good. He'll he'll have something to say on the next show.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:54.960]   Usually has something profane to say to Leo. Did he did he like the bobble head by the
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.680]   way? I still have it in a box. I haven't shipped it yet. Oh, come on. I'll help you.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:03.840]   We'll ship it. Next time bring it. We'll ship it. You got to give it to Adam. No, I have
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:07.720]   it aside. I put it aside specifically to say. So, Pawfel Durov is an intro. I've been reading
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:12.480]   your articles and I think this is fascinating because we don't know about him because he's
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:20.320]   Russian. But is he really like the next Mark Zuckerberg? Is he building an empire in Russia?
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:26.000]   He's he's certainly already built an empire. I talked to him very secret days ago after
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.400]   the WhatsApp deal. Yeah. And he's becoming less so now. We did a feature in Business
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:38.440]   Week a little while ago about how he may have been a Kremlin target in Russia because he's
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:46.160]   sort of a big, you know, successful self-made entrepreneur in Russia who is a contrarian,
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:50.400]   especially politically. I mean, I talked to him a couple days ago. We were talking about
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:55.920]   libertarianism. He's a libertarian. And, you know, he's very against the grain in Russia.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:01.360]   He's spending some time in Berlin right now working on Telegram. So he I mean, he was
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:06.680]   essentially telling me I have all the money I could possibly ever need just after VK.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:12.080]   And now all I want to do is build products that the whole world can use. And that's what
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:16.560]   he's doing with Telegram, which is he's set up as a nonprofit entity, which is kind of
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:22.640]   interesting. Yeah. He has he says he has absolutely no plans to sell. His engineers are well
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:29.160]   compensated and he doesn't need the money. And yes, and the Russian internet market is
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:33.800]   Telegram is targeted at the whole world. It's not very big in Russia. The Russia.
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:38.640]   He did it like a Facebook basically or a social network. It's more of a war.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:43.600]   VK is a social network just like Facebook. It looks very similar to Facebook. His new app,
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:50.320]   Telegram, is essentially what's that. Interesting. The Russian internet market is interesting
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:56.160]   because their language is so different from any other language on earth pretty much. So
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:01.680]   Facebook, Google, all of these companies that have essentially taken over the world,
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:06.320]   except for China, Russia has been the exception for all of them as well. So VK
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:11.920]   is much bigger than Facebook and Russia. Yandax is the Google of Russia.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:18.880]   They have vastly more market share than Google. So Russia has been an interesting market to watch
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:25.840]   just because of it's almost like a little melting pot that's isolated from the rest of the internet.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:31.680]   You were smart to move to global tech because this is it's very clear that nobody succeeds in the
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:37.600]   US alone anymore. What's app is Facebook saying, this was not used in the US. We need to have
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:45.120]   a presence globally in markets. If you listen to Mark Zuckerberg's conference call, he had to
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:49.520]   take great pains to express to shareholders why they should believe in this acquisition.
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:54.800]   You may not have heard of this. It's not big in America. But if you look at Latin America,
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.960]   if you look at India, if you look at Europe, what's app is massive.
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:05.360]   The story that I wrote after the WhatsApp deal is that this is essentially buying markets that
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:10.640]   Facebook for the most part already has a hold in. They're essentially buying more attention
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:17.440]   from their users there. But it's not going to make much headway in Asia. We chat has China
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:22.880]   locked down. That's the WhatsApp of China. Like we were talking about earlier line is the WhatsApp
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:28.720]   of Japan, Kakao is the WhatsApp of South Korea. And all of these big developed markets where
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:32.640]   there are a lot of smartphones, WhatsApp is not going to be making much of a dent there. So
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:39.200]   Asia is still going to, Facebook is still going to need to figure out how to do something big in Asia.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:45.920]   I just have to feel like Zuckerberg must feel like he's on a hamster wheel.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:51.280]   That it's, there's always going to be these up and coming. And now more than ever, we just raised
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:55.200]   the ante. Robert Reich, the former secretary of Labor wrote an article saying this is bad
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.280]   for America because it doesn't create jobs. It's just a huge, you're going to bail that Detroit.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:05.280]   He literally could have less money. Yeah. He could have bought the Bahamas.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:11.120]   Yeah. Several times. I think Reich is right. And so I'm sticking with my position with this.
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:16.400]   This is a bad thing. I'm with you. I think though, I have to say that it probably is the case
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:21.680]   that Facebook felt like it had to do it because if they don't, their position slips away.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:25.280]   I think Yahoo felt they had to buy broadcast.com. Yeah, that was a mistake.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.720]   More so because he gave Mark Cuban a pulpit. Now he's got the
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:35.440]   basketball team. He's on TV all the time. He's on that TV show, the shark tank. That's really
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:40.080]   the cost of buying a he's done. Yeah. He's done. He's a call championship. It hurt the call.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:45.520]   Her America. Mark Cuban bad for America. He'll tell you that company that's bad for America.
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:49.760]   It's calm. Yeah. Talk about that. You think Mark's listening? He listens to everything.
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:54.240]   I wrote something once he sent me an email like the next day. Okay. So the only time I've
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:58.240]   never met the guy, one time I ever I was at South by Southwest. He was going to give a lecture
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:02.720]   and he started off so confrontational and annoying and then accidentally the fire alarm
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:06.160]   went off in the building. I think somebody went and pulled it and we all filed out
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:12.880]   relievedly and he never came back. That's my only experience of Mark Cuban saved by the fire alarm.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.720]   Boy, you got a good panel today and on Fuego as well.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:20.480]   After John's eating during the show, apparently. Oh, don't listen to them.
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:26.000]   You're having lovely nature box snacks, a South Pacific plantain that's better for you than
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.680]   a Pringles, but tastes everybody's good. I like the sweet blueberry almonds. Yeah.
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.840]   That's an up and coming sponsor. I shouldn't give them a plug. What? Yeah. Nature box.
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:41.120]   Stonishing, stonishing. We also have Nathan Oliveris Giles, who's brand new at the Wall Street
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:45.440]   Journal digits. Yeah. So when Mossberg left, how many people did it take to replace him?
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:53.120]   Eight? How would you wait at the time? Well, there were two gadget calmness. We now have two more,
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:56.560]   but then there have been a few other jobs created. It's great. I'm not complaining.
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:02.800]   Yeah. So, yeah, there's a big team there when all things D as a whole left.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:07.360]   I think the journal clearly realizes how important this is. The Times has done the same thing with
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:11.760]   a replacement of a pog. They've replaced him with a few other people. This is a big beat.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:16.080]   Thank goodness. Well, it's kind of becoming ubiquitous. I mean, tech, everybody cares.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:21.600]   It's in politics. It's in education. It's in all facets of her life. So, can't really ignore it.
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.000]   We're glad to have him. Yeah, you can. Thanks for joining us.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.360]   Oh, you can ignore it. You just ignore it. Well, you're not even on Facebook. So, I'm
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:32.960]   you know, I can't cover this space without being a member. I don't want to be a member, but what?
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:36.560]   You can't be a member without being on Facebook. Are you kidding me?
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:41.600]   But he is in Snapchat. So, I'll get some cred there. So, he's only for the sexting. Yeah, I thought so.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:45.280]   Also, Mark Millian is here from Bloomberg. He says, you don't have to say business
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:49.200]   week unless you want to do a droopy dog. Thank you for that. Releasing us.
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.360]   Come on. Thank you. You, good beat.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:33:13.480]   Show today. Sh

[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:09.880]   or something. I think they're like taking off. They did one round taking off a few years ago.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:14.280]   But they, they, they're revenues insane. I know. It's all. I'm so proud to be
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:20.200]   subscription based and great. If ever a company deserves a succeeded Squarespace and Facebook,
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:26.200]   you better not buy Squarespace. I'll be peeved. I'll be miffed. All right. Speaking of miffed,
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:32.600]   and this is complicated. So I understand this is complicated. And I'm going to give you a little
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:38.920]   backstory before we talk about this. But essentially, the story is that Netflix has agreed to pay Comcast
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:46.920]   for high speed streaming to Comcast customers. Now, here's why it's complicated. If Netflix were
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:51.800]   just using the public internet, they, they would, you know, like anybody, like we do,
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:58.280]   they could just go in on the network. But they understand that 40% of all prime time traffic in
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:03.400]   the US is Netflix traffic that they use a lot of bandwidth that if you can give them two or three
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:09.880]   megabits per second, consistent, sustained, they could do 2K and now on some things, even 4K video,
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:14.360]   and they want that bandwidth. So what they've been trying to do is get appearing arrangement
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:20.520]   with Comcast. That's where basically it's a direct connect between Comcast and face and then Netflix.
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:28.920]   In fact, they tried to get Netflix servers in Comcast operation centers inside the data centers.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:32.920]   Comcast hasn't agreed to that, but they will connect to Netflix servers at data centers
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:37.560]   operated by Cochin and other companies that provide the bandwidth for Netflix.
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:44.200]   Comcast said, if you want us to do that, you're going to have to give us money. Netflix said,
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:54.120]   no. And according to Reed Hastings, since October, the bandwidth for Comcast subscribers, available
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:59.960]   to Comcast subscribers and Netflix place close attention, this has dropped 27%. And of course,
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:04.600]   my presumption is that somebody at Comcast has got a knob and they're turning that knob.
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:08.760]   They're turning the knob down until they squeeze them hard enough. And then Comcast,
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:15.480]   I mean, Netflix says, well, all right, fine. Why wouldn't you do that? Well, if I were
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:19.080]   Netflix, I might do that. Depends on whether they can afford it. I mean, one of the issues
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:23.480]   that's come up is this could put them out of business. It depends on how much they're paying,
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:27.800]   but there's a point beyond which they can't afford to pay for appearing. And then they'll raise
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:32.040]   prices on customers. And this is what, yeah, we'll end up paying for this. I'm not sure they
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:36.520]   have to raise the price to pay for this, whatever it is. It can't be more dollar. I think they're in
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:41.320]   a very price sensitive business. There's charges $7.99 a month. Who's charge $10 a month? People
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:47.080]   are going to go, you could jack it up. When the cable business began, it was dirt cheap. And then
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:53.320]   all of a sudden now it's like a hundred bucks. I'm not, I'm not convinced of this. My issue is
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:57.800]   it's a surprise that Comcast and these guys haven't gouged these characters long ago. It's it. Well,
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:02.600]   and by the way, it's just the beginning because Verizon and AT&T are both trying to get deals like
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:08.600]   this. It's the end of net neutrality as we know it is very bad news for consumers. And here's my
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:14.280]   point of view. It's basically setting up toll roads on the internet. It's as if UPS said to you,
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:21.560]   John C. Devorek, you know, when I I'm Amazon, I'm shipping to John C. Devorek. I pay UPS to ship
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:26.120]   the product out is as if the driver pulled up to you and said, Hey, John, you want this package?
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:31.480]   Give me a buck. Otherwise I'm bringing it tomorrow. It's just like that. It's double dipping. Yeah,
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:38.840]   we pay Comcast for full and unfettered access to the internet. It's in Comcast's interest to give
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:43.560]   Netflix a nice fat pipe because that makes me a happy customer. Right. But you know why this
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:49.160]   doesn't work as Comcast has a monopoly. There's nowhere else to go. Well, maybe that's the problem.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:52.760]   I agree. It's the government regulation. They let this stuff go out of control like this. We
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:58.440]   used to have when I was a kid, we used to have ISPs all over the place. Not anymore. That's
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:03.080]   those in the days of 300 bond modems. Well, whatever is beside the poor kid.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.240]   When I was a kid, I did.
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:14.760]   So we had to work for the year for so we still have my place. I got AT&T. I can use it. It's a
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:20.840]   duopoly. I've got sonic.net, but that's over the AT&T copper beside the point. Not really. I pay
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:25.400]   a heck of a lot less than I would if I was on AT&T. I pay almost nothing for the sonic.net. Third
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:29.560]   party ISPs on DSL the way to go. But it's not as fast as your cable.
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:33.960]   No, cable's faster, but it's more reliable and it has a steadier connection. It's much better
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:38.600]   for podcasting, by the way. In most places, we are in a duopoly where you have the cable company
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:43.240]   and the phone company in that. Google's trying to move in to make it a triple. That would be awesome.
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:47.480]   Of course, you're moving into the weirdest places. I'll give you the argument on both sides.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:53.000]   On the point from the point of view of Comcast, they're asking Comcast to peer with Netflix.
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:56.520]   And Comcast is saying, "We'll do it. We'll give you better access to our customers,
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:01.480]   but you've got to pay for that." From next to the point of view, Comcast is basically holding us up.
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:10.440]   Is there a network? It's your own network up. It's called the internet, John.
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:15.320]   So Google's doing? I don't think Netflix has Google money.
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:22.760]   So who's at fault here? The government. Unfortunately, the chairman of the FCC,
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:29.800]   his former cable company, is a law enforcement company. The FCC, by the way, I think this is related, has decided,
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:34.920]   remember, they lost in court over the attempts to enforce net neutrality regulations.
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:40.920]   They could have appealed. They could have declared internet service providers common carriers.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:46.200]   That would have given them jurisdiction. They have decided not to. They've basically folded.
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:51.720]   They plan to rewrite the Washington Post report. You don't have to rewrite the rules, Congress.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:54.920]   I don't think the Fs. I think what the court was saying is you don't have a congressional
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:42:01.160]   mandate to do this. Unless you declare it common carriers, then you have a mandate.
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:03.240]   And they weren't willing to do that. They're not going to do that.
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:06.760]   So I think Congress is going to have to step up and say, "But I don't think they're going to,
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:10.920]   because do you know how many lobbyists Comcast has in Washington, DC?"
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:13.560]   More than there are Congressmen. 100 lobbyists.
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:17.480]   There you have it. They pump millions of dollars into the Congress.
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:20.200]   Of course. There's no way Congress is going to stand up to them.
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:23.000]   Well, and no way the Fs is going to blame for that.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.880]   The corrupt Congress or Comcast doing their job.
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:33.800]   Well, the X-Factor is this Comcast charter deal. That's going to come under some antitrust scrutiny.
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:39.160]   And I think Comcast is going to try not to step on any toes as that sort of...
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:41.480]   You know, okay. Let me give you an example.
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:46.600]   Comcast recently bought NBC Universal. One of the deals that they made on that was that
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:52.120]   Comcast would not slow down internet traffic for it. It would preserve that neutrality.
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:56.040]   And then blatantly just said, "Yeah, we're going to screw with Skype.
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:59.320]   We're going to screw." You know, the real problem is that Comcast is in the streaming video business.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:03.240]   They have, they have StreamPix. They're doing the same thing Netflix does.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:06.440]   They are a competitor. Who let the camel in the tent?
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:12.280]   Who? You? Oh. Well, I'm apologized. So it's all his fault.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:17.560]   Well, I mean, you voted these guys in. You... The people... Nobody...
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:21.560]   If you ever voted for your Congressman out and just rotate through people,
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:23.560]   I mean, the entire Congress is a bunch of...
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:25.080]   Oh, that'll fix it.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:28.680]   Well, if everybody voted everybody out every two years, it would.
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:32.200]   No, we're screwed.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:34.920]   Okay. I like your optimism.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:36.440]   'Cause AT&T and Verizon and time.
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:38.360]   You know, they merge with time-borne. Nobody's going to stop.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:41.640]   By the way, O'Malley was on the show last week. He says, "There's no way they're going to stop this
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:47.240]   merger." His opinion is, and this is Comcast's position, "Hey, there's no overlapping customers."
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:49.160]   Yeah, you're not buying out your competitor.
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:50.360]   It's not any competitive.
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.600]   No, I know. It's a great argument.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:55.000]   Because we set up a monopoly...
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.600]   To begin with, because the whole thing was set up with all these people taking pieces of
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:02.680]   different parts of the country and then... Oh, because we don't want one big company running
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:05.640]   everything. And so, whether or not my competitor and they buy them all up,
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.720]   this is what happened with AT&T and the phone business.
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.240]   Basically, Ma Bell's back.
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:14.040]   Yeah, I guess who was the first one of the South West Bell or one of these really
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:16.360]   sleazeball companies? They just bought everything.
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:18.360]   It's like a snowman, a snowball rolling down.
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:22.040]   It's the government. They don't stop this. They should just say no.
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:23.800]   What's the big deal?
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.960]   They said no to AT&T, T-Mobile.
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:29.480]   That was... I actually was stunned.
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:31.000]   I was surprised that I was here.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.640]   Advocating that every call, I would write about it constantly.
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:35.880]   But thinking that the time, I got no...
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:39.640]   It didn't go through. I was stunned.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:48.360]   Eric Lipton wrote in the New York Times this week on Comcast's web of lobbying and philanthropy.
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:55.400]   We don't know the number because they have more than 100 registered lobbyists in DC alone.
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:56.360]   Nice.
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:45:00.600]   The team includes five former members of Congress.
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:05.240]   It also Meredith Atwell Baker, a former FCC commissioner,
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:11.720]   the one, in fact, who voted to approve the deal for Comcast in NBC to unite.
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:16.200]   If you've been watching House of Cards, this all sounds extremely familiar.
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.040]   Yeah, the storyline is the same thing.
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:18.440]   Same thing.
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:21.480]   Comcast has also done an interesting thing.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.920]   They have a non-profit foundation.
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:26.520]   They fund groups like the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, who,
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:31.560]   interesting enough, mere hours after the Time Warner Comcast merger announcement
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:35.160]   issued a statement saying it was a win-win for America Business.
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:38.040]   A win-win.
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:42.760]   Yeah, a win-win for Time Warner Cable and Comcast.
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:43.560]   It's a win-win.
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:47.880]   It's a little depressing, frankly.
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:52.040]   But does anybody want to defend Comcast here?
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:52.760]   Anybody?
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:54.200]   What's not me?
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:54.760]   I'll do it.
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:56.840]   Surprise there.
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:58.600]   There's a guy out there raising his hand.
[00:45:58.600 --> 00:45:59.880]   Who do you work for, sir?
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:00.680]   Comcast.
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:01.000]   Charge.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:07.560]   Mine with pairing agreements is that pairing agreements are typically beneficial for both.
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:09.720]   That's what cogent.
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:13.160]   In this case, you got Netflix sending an awful lot of data to Comcast.
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:16.920]   So that's your typical pairing arrangement is symmetrical.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:17.880]   You send me data.
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:18.840]   I'll send you data.
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.640]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:25.320]   One of the reasons, frankly, we get sweetheart deals on bandwidth because some of our providers...
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:25.960]   There you go.
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:28.520]   ... want to have a backstream so that they, you know,
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:32.120]   AOL for a long time carried our content because they wanted to have
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:33.960]   peering relationships with systems...
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:34.280]   Yeah.
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:35.400]   ...and we're sending them a lot of content.
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:37.400]   Why don't you ask me why I'm going to defend Comcast?
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:38.920]   Why will you defend Comcast?
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:40.280]   Because it's Comcastic.
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.000]   Oh, shut up.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.240]   I haven't used that gate for a long time.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:44.360]   Oh, shut up.
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:51.080]   So, you know, I agree that there are some not unrealistic arguments for why cogent,
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:56.760]   among others, should pay for access that these peering relationships aren't symmetric.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.680]   But on the other hand, I think Comcast...
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:03.800]   It's in Comcast commercial interest to provide fast access to YouTube, Netflix.
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.160]   By the way, there's some...
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:09.480]   I was told by another networking fellow that Amazon is coming up against this.
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:14.200]   Amazon Web Services, another example of a company that's pumping a lot of data,
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:17.160]   almost all apps nowadays run on Amazon Web Services.
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:21.240]   They're to get a peering relationship with a company like Comcast.
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:22.280]   Comcast wants money.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:25.240]   But don't we pay Comcast for fast access?
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:25.880]   There can be access.
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:26.840]   Here's what's going to happen.
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:28.600]   The whole idea is just to get more money.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:29.640]   What?
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:31.240]   That's not going to happen.
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:33.240]   You're going to be the big Netflix guy.
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:33.640]   I'm not.
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.520]   I don't need...
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:35.720]   And there's going to be a special...
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:36.760]   It's going to be like the cable.
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:38.200]   But this is stuff with Netflix.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:38.200]   It goes to Netflix.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:39.880]   It goes to YouTube.
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:40.920]   It goes to Amazon.
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:41.960]   It goes to Twitter.
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:42.920]   They're going to come to me and say...
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:43.880]   It's the same model.
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:45.880]   If you would like full access to what users...
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:47.960]   It's the same model they use for show time.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:49.080]   And HP on all the rest.
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:50.360]   You pay a little extra.
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:51.720]   Or you pay an extra dollar,
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:54.040]   you get a fast connection to Netflix.
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:55.880]   You pay an extra dot another extra dollar,
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:57.800]   you get a fast connection to Amazon.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.400]   You pay another and it would be packaged.
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.000]   But they're not charging us.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:01.960]   They're going to do that.
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:03.080]   And charge Netflix.
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:03.560]   Yeah.
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:04.040]   Why not?
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:05.720]   Why wouldn't they charge?
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:07.480]   They need more money to pay for the public.
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:08.920]   The public is more...
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:14.280]   Once there's a direct relationship showing harm to the consumer,
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:17.640]   then that's when the government stands up and is...
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:18.280]   At arms.
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:19.240]   You're cracking me up.
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:19.640]   This is...
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:22.200]   This is a theory.
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:22.920]   It's a theory.
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:24.920]   And...
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:26.920]   When do consumers stand up and say,
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:28.600]   "Hey, I'm getting crap service?"
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:30.600]   See, what happens really...
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:31.640]   This service isn't that bad.
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:34.680]   What happens is that most people don't know any better.
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.640]   And they say, "Geez, Netflix really sucks.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:38.840]   They don't cancel Comcast
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:39.480]   because they don't have a choice.
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:40.360]   They cancel Netflix."
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:42.040]   They will get to do this.
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:42.520]   There's going to be...
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:43.960]   Because they're used to this model.
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:45.160]   It's a little HBO.
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:45.720]   You get to see...
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:47.400]   You never know how many HBO movies do you watch?
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:48.040]   A month.
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:50.600]   One, two, maybe you watch a couple of...
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:51.800]   Things that's not worth the money,
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:53.160]   but you'd pay for it.
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:56.120]   It's just the old menu thing, the item, the bundling.
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:58.520]   That's not how it's going to play out on...
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:00.680]   For the web, for the internet.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.200]   I mean, that might be the cable model.
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.400]   Nobody likes the cable model.
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.320]   Everybody hates their cable bill.
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:05.960]   It's inflated.
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:07.080]   We know we pay too much.
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:09.080]   Everybody's been complaining about it for a long time.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:11.720]   On the web, the expectation is everything is free.
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:15.080]   Then you have access to it at equally.
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:17.240]   Not choked down, not one slow.
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:18.120]   That's not true.
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:20.680]   If you see a Netflix charge on your Comcast bill,
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:21.320]   it's not going to work.
[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:24.760]   Comcast has the business service, which costs more.
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:26.920]   They have the high speed, doesn't that cost more?
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.360]   There are some of us, and I'm one of them,
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:30.600]   who will pay anything for fast internet.
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:31.320]   There are some...
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:32.520]   I'm not one of those.
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:34.760]   I mean, maybe you can pay it or anything,
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:36.520]   but I think there's a lot of folks who can't.
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:38.680]   I think what we'll see instead is we're going to see more
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:39.800]   of this kind of deal where,
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:42.440]   instead of the customer paying a little bit more
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:44.760]   for access to whatever services they want,
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:46.520]   you're going to see companies paying the...
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:48.840]   the guys controlling the pipes, in this case Comcast,
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:50.200]   and then you're going to see the charges going up
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:52.360]   for how much we pay for Netflix,
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:55.160]   or how much we pay for Spotify,
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:57.160]   or anything that we're using and subscribing to.
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:58.360]   We're going to pay more, whatever.
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.800]   We're going to pay more, no matter what.
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:01.880]   It's not going to come in the bundle bill.
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:03.640]   It's going to come in these little fractured pieces.
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:07.880]   Dave, you were subscribing to a startup ISP in San Francisco, right?
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:08.760]   I was, Monkey Brains.
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:09.480]   Yeah.
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:10.680]   How did that go?
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:11.800]   I mean, it was fantastic.
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:13.000]   It was super fast.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.600]   It wasn't the most reliable and steady.
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:16.840]   I mean, there were times when we would kind of fall out,
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:21.240]   but yeah, I made that decision and I was glad I did.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:23.400]   It's incredible that there's still a startup in the ISD.
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.520]   It is still in business, yeah.
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:25.800]   Can you show using him?
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:28.840]   And I actually got, I guess, pushed out of the mission
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.520]   once my landlord tried to jack a print price,
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:31.720]   so now I'm in the inter-sunset.
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:32.120]   You're playing Google for that?
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:33.080]   That is Google's fault.
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:34.120]   Go like that.
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:37.000]   And I can't get Monkey Brains in the inter-sunset now,
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.160]   so now I'm actually on, I think it's Comcast.
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:41.800]   You can't even get the sun in the inter-sunset?
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:42.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:44.360]   It's walkable.
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:45.800]   There's fantastic food out there.
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:46.760]   Great food.
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:47.160]   Nice food.
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:47.640]   Nice food.
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:48.200]   That's gold.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:48.920]   Close food.
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:50.920]   So what do you even call it the sunset?
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:51.640]   I mean, you know, 18--
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:52.760]   You can't see the sunset.
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:53.800]   Yeah, there's never so much.
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:56.040]   But AT&T is talking about this, right?
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:57.960]   Talking about doing things with specific companies
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.720]   where maybe like Facebook pays for the data
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:00.840]   that you use for Facebook.
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:02.760]   So whenever you use Facebook, it doesn't fight into your data.
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:03.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:06.280]   Again, in my opinion, undermining net neutrality,
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:07.640]   because I don't think any of these people
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:10.360]   want to see net neutrality kind of really work out that way.
[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:11.320]   But we do.
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:12.760]   Of course we do.
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:15.640]   But if net neutrality existed, deals like this
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:16.680]   when you get to take off.
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:17.160]   It's a great place.
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.600]   Exactly, exactly.
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:21.960]   So therein lies the AT&T sponsored content
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:26.680]   is a similar plan that would let some content providers
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:29.240]   have better access if they pay for it,
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:30.040]   ineffectively.
[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:32.760]   And that's a scary thought, because then services
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:34.280]   like Netflix or someone else won't
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:36.520]   be able to be displaced when a new upstart
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:37.960]   offering something genuinely better.
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:37.960]   That's--
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:40.120]   They won't be able to be my space, you could say.
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:41.080]   That's mine.
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.280]   To be that's a terrifying future.
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:47.000]   And as somebody who is creating an internet television
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:51.080]   station that rides on this free public internet,
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:51.880]   it's threatening to me.
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:53.640]   Now, I'm already entrenched and established.
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:56.040]   It probably doesn't affect me.
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:57.640]   But it's going to affect anybody who
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:58.920]   wants to start something like this,
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:01.320]   when no agenda finally starts doing video.
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:02.600]   We're not doing video.
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:04.200]   Can you go twice weekly?
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:06.760]   Yeah, we're going to do twice weekly Thursdays
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:08.680]   and Sundays at 9.
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:09.640]   9 AM.
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:10.680]   If you want to listen to life--
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:12.360]   Pacific, 12 noon Eastern.
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:14.120]   Whatever it is.
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:17.320]   I take the time to do the math from our listening
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:18.200]   so that they don't have time.
[00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:18.840]   Well, it's a podcast.
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:21.880]   We expect most people to download it when they feel like it.
[00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:23.480]   It's the convenience.
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:24.760]   Do you stream live, though?
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:25.160]   Yeah.
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:25.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:26.680]   It's people can listen live.
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:27.400]   They want.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:28.520]   No at jennithshow.com.
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:30.920]   We also-- but we added on the-- sometimes we stop the show.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:32.680]   I mean, it's not like this, where you're live to tape.
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:35.560]   And if you make a screw up, then you fire a Chad.
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:36.840]   So it's a lot different.
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:38.040]   You don't even have a Chad.
[00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:38.760]   No, we don't have a Chad.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:39.720]   There's no one to fire.
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:39.960]   No.
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:40.960]   That's why.
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.920]   Well, I can't imagine what he'd be like unfiltered.
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:44.480]   That's something I want to see.
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:45.680]   Devorak unfiltered?
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:46.400]   Yeah.
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:46.840]   That's--
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:47.200]   D&Q's?
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:47.480]   I think you--
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:47.640]   I think you--
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:48.840]   That's another choice you should listen to.
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:49.800]   I think you're seeing it, actually.
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:50.320]   I don't know.
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:50.320]   I don't know.
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:50.840]   I don't know.
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:51.320]   I don't know.
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:52.800]   I'm pretty unfiltered.
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:53.960]   I mean, I guess, you know, what's
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:55.480]   sad is there's nothing to say about this,
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:57.320]   except we're screwed.
[00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:58.800]   I took the Comcast.
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:01.040]   I think it just is the way it's got it going to go.
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:02.200]   You guys are bumming me out.
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:03.120]   Yeah, me too.
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:05.000]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   I'm confused.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   There may be hope, because Om Malek yesterday or last week talked about it, and he's talked
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   about it before, the fact that his apartment building buys bandwidth wholesale and in effect
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   becomes an internet service provider for the people who live out of it.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   He lives in an apartment.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   But one of the reasons he does is he gets amazing internet, because-- and this may be-- and another
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:37.160]   little bandwidth that they wire than the people of the town with bypassing all of this.
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:43.120]   And that is the risk, I think, for companies like Comcast is if you squeeze people enough,
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:44.680]   at some point, they revolt.
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:46.640]   Don't they?
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:47.880]   They could saw it down, though.
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:48.880]   It cut the wires.
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:49.880]   That's the way to go.
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:53.240]   I just-- well, that's the problem is we want internet.
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:54.240]   We're hooked on internet.
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:56.440]   They're counting on that, that we aren't going to quit Comcast.
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:57.440]   We are-- or--
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:58.440]   It is.
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:00.760]   Are you getting your money's worth?
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:03.800]   If you're paying 100 bucks a month for your internet, are you getting your money's worth?
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:06.600]   If you ask-- if you answer yes, what about 105?
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:07.600]   Right.
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:08.600]   What about 110?
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:09.600]   It has gone up.
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:12.600]   By the way, another interesting thing, these companies realized-- I remember talking to
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:15.720]   cable vision 10 years ago, and they said, "We don't want to be in the internet business.
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:17.120]   We need premium content."
[00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:20.680]   They knew it was coming, though, and so they carefully worked on their pricing.
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:25.960]   So the difference now between having Comcast, cable, and internet, and Comcast internet alone
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:27.360]   is $10.
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:28.360]   So different--
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:29.360]   So there's no difference.
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:30.360]   I don't even use it.
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:31.360]   It's not working.
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:32.360]   And then I--
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:36.960]   Because people end up-- it's so little difference buying the cable, so they get the best of
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:38.360]   both worlds.
[00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:41.080]   We're just getting used to paying 100 bucks and more for our cable.
[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:46.400]   But it's still hovering around a premium price point, and you still have a lot of folks
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:48.960]   who can't afford to pay 100 bucks a month.
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:53.520]   And it's becoming in our society where you need access to the internet to-- I don't know,
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:54.680]   like, go to school--
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:55.680]   Work complete--
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:56.680]   To vote.
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:57.680]   To homework assignments to vote.
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:54:58.680]   To be a citizen.
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:03.480]   If you're not literate online, you are screwed.
[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:05.280]   So I mean, this is becoming a social issue.
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:06.280]   This is not just an interest.
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:07.280]   I agree.
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:09.080]   I mean, it's great that you guys can pay 100 bucks a month.
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:10.080]   3999--
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:11.080]   I'm from Oakland.
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:12.080]   --for sonic.net.
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:15.120]   You get free internet, free national calls to Canada, everywhere in Mexico.
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:16.520]   All at long distances free.
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:18.440]   All your local services are free.
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:19.440]   It's unbelievable.
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:20.440]   3995--
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:21.440]   And it's fairly consistent.
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:22.440]   I like Sonic.
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:23.920]   I'll tell you, Jane Jasper runs that company.
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:24.920]   He's just up north a little bit.
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:26.920]   He's going to start laying cable, you know.
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:27.920]   He's fiber.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:29.680]   He's fibered a couple of towns up here.
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:31.800]   He is very forward thinking.
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:33.440]   We'll get him on and talk to him.
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:37.280]   But meanwhile, Comcast, a plea for poor struggling Wall Street Journal writers.
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:38.640]   Cheat the price low.
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:40.440]   Yeah, the guy's starving to death.
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:42.280]   They pake crap these guys.
[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:44.080]   Dow Jones.
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:45.280]   I'm doing right.
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:46.280]   Yeah?
[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:47.280]   Now don't ever say that.
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:48.520]   That's a huge mistake.
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:49.520]   He's not.
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:51.480]   He is struggling.
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:52.480]   Wow.
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:55.280]   The poor guy-- I had to give him some macaroni and cheese earlier.
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:57.240]   Never say you can't give me that.
[00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:59.240]   You guys did give me a shirt when I came out.
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:00.240]   You see?
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:02.200]   You're glad we get it.
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:04.200]   All right, Mobile World Congress is in Barcelona.
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:05.360]   Already some announcements.
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:06.480]   We will talk about it.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:10.880]   In fact, Samsung already pissing Google off.
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:11.880]   Well, they should.
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:13.200]   Didn't take long.
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:15.560]   But first, a word from fresh books.
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:16.720]   You know what pisses me off?
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:19.800]   We're used to every, at the end of our month, doing my invoices.
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:22.080]   If you're a freelancer, this is the worst time of the month.
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:25.520]   You've got to get to all the bills and pay an invoice.
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:28.640]   And then if you forget to invoice, then you don't get paid.
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:30.120]   And if you put it off for too long.
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:32.760]   And I was very relieved in 2004.
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:36.200]   That's how long I've been a fresh books customer when Amber McArthur told me about
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:38.040]   fresh books.
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:44.040]   She said, you don't have-- I was using Microsoft Word and Excel to keep track of receipts and
[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:46.280]   expenses and blah, blah, blah.
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:47.360]   It just saved me.
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:48.520]   I love fresh books.
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:51.600]   It's a simple cloud-based accounting system.
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:52.600]   Tax time's coming up.
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:57.400]   Your accountant will love you if you use fresh books or whoever does your taxes.
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:58.840]   If it's you, you'll love you.
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:56:59.840]   Self-love.
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:02.000]   It's the best kind.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   If you're not using fresh books, you better.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.920]   Hunting for receipts, digging through invoices, going through your records one by one, the
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:11.080]   worst.
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:12.080]   Fresh books makes it all simple.
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:16.520]   And of course, you create professional invoices, capture and track expenses, get real-time
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:19.200]   business reports, all with a couple of clicks.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:23.840]   You can work anywhere with a Fresh Books mobile app for your phone and your tablet.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:27.200]   The sooner you start using fresh books, the sooner you can start focusing on doing what
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:30.000]   you love, not paperwork.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   For a limited time, you could try fresh books free, not for 30 days, but for 60 days.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.360]   We've got a two-month trial for you right now.

[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:56.360]   tax time.

[00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:59.760]   That'd be nice, wouldn't I?
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:01.680]   I was glad to find out about them.
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:06.920]   Getfreshbooks.com.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:11.800]   We are on the air talking about the week's Tech News, John C. Devorek, Channel Devorek
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:14.640]   and of course snowagendishow.com.
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:22.160]   Nathan Oliveras-Giles who is new to the Wall Street Journal, the WSD.
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:23.160]   WSDD.com.
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:26.160]   WSDD.com is a place to go.
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:29.360]   It's on my beat check daily every morning.
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:30.360]   Thanks.
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:31.360]   Yeah.
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:32.360]   I appreciate that.
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:33.960]   Does the D stand for digits or just D?
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:34.960]   Digital.
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:35.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:36.960]   Okay.
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:39.320]   Big story on WSDD.com.
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:43.800]   Samsung, first of the announcements coming out of Mobile World Congress.
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:47.400]   The new Galaxy Gear, actually it's just the Gear 2.
[00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:48.680]   I'm sorry, I dropped the Galaxy.
[00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:49.680]   No more Galaxy.
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:53.680]   I also dropped Android, which is, these are actually pretty significant little moves for
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:54.680]   Samsung.
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:55.680]   This is Tizen.
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:56.960]   It's now running their own operating system.
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:58.760]   They made this all themselves.
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:00.880]   No Google here.
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:03.320]   It still does require an Android smartphone.
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:06.760]   Probably a Galaxy Note 3, Galaxy S4 or maybe the newer ones.
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:09.760]   Yeah, it's going to work with other Galaxy products.
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:13.320]   But, and they will continue to run Android at least for now.
[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:17.360]   The fact that they're dropping Android from the Gear 2 is interesting.
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:19.840]   Gear 2 is a simpler device.
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:20.840]   Doesn't have the camera.
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:21.840]   That was a weird thing anyway.
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:22.840]   Well, actually they have two versions.
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:26.080]   They have one with the camera and a lower priced one without a camera.
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:27.080]   Okay.
[00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:29.520]   But yeah, there's a lot of things that are interesting.
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:33.560]   One thing to me that's the most interesting is this comes out five months after the original
[00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:38.920]   Galaxy Gear, which was pretty much universally thumbs down in the reviews.
[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:40.680]   I don't see anybody wearing a gear anymore.
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:41.680]   It's not.
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:43.280]   The pebbles, the only one that seems to have any.
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:44.280]   Yeah, traction at all.
[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:47.000]   I don't know why I think that's dumb to.
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:50.960]   I've yet to find a smart watch that really makes me want to wear it every single day.
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:52.680]   I don't think this will be the one that converts me.
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:57.880]   But, you know, five months later, I don't know if I thought, if I bought the first one,
[00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:02.520]   I might be feeling a little bummed out that it's already obsolete less than half a year
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:03.520]   later.
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:04.520]   Yeah.
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:05.520]   Yeah.
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.800]   I was at David Hasselhoff.
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:11.600]   It was wearing a smart watch.
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:12.600]   He's talking into his watch.
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.080]   He's just like an old photo.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.080]   They photoshopped.
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:18.920]   No, remember the whole ad campaign for the Gear watch was you've wanted this forever and
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:21.640]   they had James Bond and they had our big Tracy.
[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:22.640]   All right.
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.640]   That was a great ad.
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:26.080]   That was the best thing about the first Galaxy year was that one ad.
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.560]   It made me want to watch.
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:28.560]   Did you know watches?
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:30.760]   No, but I love to tracing James Bond.
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:31.760]   That was cool.
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:32.760]   Nothing wrong with that.
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:33.760]   It's the Huawei Smart Band.
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:34.920]   Is there such a thing?
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:35.920]   Yeah.
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:41.560]   It's kind of their answer to the Fitbit, to the Nike Plus fuel band.
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:42.560]   Huawei is now making a...
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:43.560]   And here's the thing.
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:46.840]   It's more of a fitness band than a smart watch, but you know, they can still...
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:48.800]   All these things will tell you how many steps you took.
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:49.800]   Wait a minute.
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:53.080]   It has a pop out earpiece for your voice calls.
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:54.080]   There's that.
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:55.080]   Wow.
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.080]   That's actually kind of cool.
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:59.240]   Well, but do you want to really walk around with your headphones coming out of your watch?
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:00.240]   Yeah.
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.240]   You want to be talking to you like...
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:02.240]   No, no, I don't think you've built it.
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.240]   No, it's wireless.
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:04.240]   Oh, you put it in your...
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:05.240]   Oh, I see.
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:06.240]   It's like a blue cheese.
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.240]   Yeah.
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:08.240]   Yeah.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:09.240]   That's kind of a cool idea.
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:11.720]   It's like a perception you can lift your arm way up in the air.
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:12.720]   I like it.
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:13.720]   One more thing to get lost.
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:16.640]   I don't think I want an earpiece on my watch, personally.
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:17.640]   Somebody else will be making it all.
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.560]   Maybe that's just me.
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:21.800]   These help bands were huge at CES.
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.960]   It seems like every electronics company there has gone off.
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:25.600]   Who here sitting here has one on?
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.600]   I have one in my pocket.
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.600]   It's unusual though, because usually when I have Check Journalists on, they're all
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:30.600]   wearing...
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:31.680]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:32.840]   Is that the Fitbit Flex?
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:33.840]   One, one, one.
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:35.840]   That's the one they just recall.
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:38.920]   Yeah, so that's going to get a LexiCute to take it off.
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:39.920]   I don't know, it has nickel in it.
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:40.920]   It's not going to let you rat.
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:42.920]   Apparently it has nickel in it.
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:45.200]   And it's allergenic.
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:48.320]   Once you get a nickel allergy, your life is over.
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.160]   You can never touch a nickel again.
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:51.160]   I imagine.
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.160]   Can I just use nickels?
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.920]   I don't believe how many nickel in them.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:54.920]   Without a nickel.
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:55.920]   Oh, that's right.
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:56.920]   They're now zinc.
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:58.480]   So go ahead and touch a nickel.
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:03.760]   But if you found an old buffalo head nickel, don't touch that.
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:06.400]   Drop like a rock.
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.640]   Apparently there's a nickel allergy.
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:12.280]   And something like 12 or 14% of all the people who are wearing it, the force...
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:13.280]   We're getting some rashes.
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.640]   It's curious, the number would be that high.
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:17.160]   So it means that people with some sort of nickel weirdness.
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.160]   They're drawing to this device.
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.560]   We're attracted to this thing.
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:20.560]   It's common.
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:21.920]   That they're going to make the next one out of peanuts.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:22.920]   It's a common...
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:23.920]   And glue.
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:24.920]   Don't forget our glue guide.
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:29.040]   Well, you know what's weird is they've recalled them all to voluntary recall.
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:30.680]   So if you don't have a rash, I guess you can keep it.
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:34.080]   But they've recalled them all and they will send you a check in about eight weeks for
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.600]   the value of the force.
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.000]   They're not going to give you a new force.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.400]   I'm guessing that if you send them a nasty note saying, "I sent my thing in where's my
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:44.960]   money and kept the watch," you would get a check.
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:45.960]   Go ahead and try that.
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:46.960]   I don't care.
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.280]   I'm not really interested.
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.120]   This is a category that seems to have problems.
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:54.480]   Remember Jawbone's Up, which failed and they had to recall all of them.
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.360]   This is a tough category to make.
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:58.920]   Well, these are all companies that are relatively...
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:01.360]   I mean, this is such a new product category.
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.160]   These are companies that are trying to figure it out.
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:04.160]   This is the one way here.
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.160]   This didn't exist a few years ago.
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:07.960]   The whole story was a Kickstarter project.
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:11.200]   Now they're actually making a watch that looks like a watch as a metal band.
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.120]   It's kind of stepping up a little bit.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:16.880]   There were glitches in those first Kickstarter products that they sent.
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:22.200]   My brother slashes every second and dies after a few hours.
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:25.080]   Mine's in a drawer, so I don't know what it's doing right now.
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:26.080]   It's lonely.
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:29.720]   It's wishing it would be resuscitated.
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:33.080]   I think a lot of this is the market just saying, "Quick, get the market before Apple
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:34.720]   does it."
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:39.600]   I think this is the one product category where Samsung is racing and that's why five months
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:43.000]   after they've engaged the first one, the interest and the other one, they need to make
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.240]   this work before Apple comes in and acts like they invented the idea.
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.640]   It could be a bluff.
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:48.840]   Maybe Apple never does this.
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:50.720]   They look around and say, "This is crap."
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:53.040]   You know, Ford pulled this stunt once.
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:54.840]   You know when they're making the bigger and bigger...
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:56.280]   I remember the Model T?
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.280]   That was a great car.
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:59.080]   No, remember when they're making bigger and bigger?
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:02.880]   The first thing was the Explorer, then they made a bigger one.
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:03.880]   The excursion.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:11.840]   Then they showed and all you saw it in a six-door, this huge six-door Ford.
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:13.960]   There's the screw with GM.
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:15.200]   They did it just to...
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:17.960]   Yeah, they never released it.
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:18.960]   Just an artist's conception.
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:20.640]   I think this may be going on.
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.160]   There's great gags, by the way.
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:24.560]   They're screwing with Apple or is Apple screwing with them?
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:25.560]   No, Apple's screwing.
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:28.080]   I mean, we know for sure that Apple is working on it.
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:29.080]   They work on a lot of things.
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:30.080]   They work on a lot of things.
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:31.560]   It's entirely possible that they throw this out.
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:32.960]   Well, Ford showed a six-door.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:33.960]   They never brought it out.
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:35.120]   No, I think Apple's going to do it.
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:36.640]   They've hired too many people.
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:38.040]   It would be...
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:42.960]   I think the perception of Apple being a failure if they don't release it is a significant
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:43.960]   issue.
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:44.960]   They've got to release it.
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:49.960]   And Tim Cook has said they will introduce a new product category this year.
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:52.440]   So it could be a watch, it could be a TV.
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:56.360]   I think if it's a watch, I'm shorting a company.
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.880]   Just another Apple story, real quick.
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:01.960]   If you have iOS 7, you do want to patch it right now.
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:09.080]   There is a 7.0.6 update that went out yesterday, an emergency update because of a bug in SSL,
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:12.120]   making a man in the middle attack fairly easy.
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:17.600]   That means that somebody could hijack your SSL connection to a bank, to Amazon, to a
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:21.960]   YA tailor, get your credit cards and other stuff.
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:26.400]   It apparently is a flaw both in iOS and in OS 10.
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:30.240]   Apple says we are going to release an update for OS 10 as soon as we can, but nothing at
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:32.800]   least as we go to press.
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:36.600]   Do we go to press as we go to the internet?
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.000]   The internet.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.440]   They said go to press?
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:40.440]   He did.
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:41.440]   He did.
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:45.760]   Remember in the days when you were a young cub reporter for the Daily Club reporter?
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:48.560]   When I was a kid, I was a cub.
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:50.760]   I had a supervisor.
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.760]   Give me divorce.
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:54.520]   Superman's Pell, do you know where I came from?
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:55.520]   Copy.
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:57.520]   Remember that those days?
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:05:59.520]   Sure.
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:00.520]   Okay.
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:01.520]   What else is coming out of them?
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:04.520]   Anyway, update it because this is not an insignificant problem.
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.360]   I don't know what you do if you're on iOS 6.
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:09.320]   I guess they'll update that as well.
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:10.720]   More mobile world congress stuff.
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:11.720]   Just a program note.
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:13.720]   We will be here tonight.
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.520]   11.30 p.m. Pacific.
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:18.880]   That's 2.30 a.m. Eastern.
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:27.960]   Oh, 8.30 UTC to cover the, what could be a very bizarre announcement for Nokia.
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:31.760]   Nokia, which is in the process of being acquired by Microsoft, we're just waiting for Chinese
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:35.640]   regulatory approval, said to be announcing an Android phone.
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:38.440]   What does the Chinese got to do with it?
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:42.080]   What did the Chinese need to tell our American companies what to do?
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:43.080]   Well, Nokia's finished.
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:44.080]   Yeah, they're not.
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:46.080]   Well, I know, but Microsoft, there's obviously been a bit down.
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:47.080]   They do business in China.
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:48.080]   I don't know.
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.080]   That's the same question.
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:50.680]   In my mind, I didn't say that loud.
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:51.680]   They used to pull this crap constantly.
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:52.880]   Well, they got to do you approval?
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:53.880]   Well, yeah, I know.
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:56.880]   Nowadays, they don't, they don't buck so much, but they used to.
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.080]   Now, now you can't do that.
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.080]   You can't do that.
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.080]   It's two American companies trying to merge.
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:03.800]   There are two massive global companies that sell over the world.
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.640]   They have implications for those markets as well.
[01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:08.440]   I think the regulatory approval is for that.
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:11.480]   If you're going to do business here, if you're going to do business here, you got to meet
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:12.480]   our laws as well.
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:14.480]   And China's a very important market for Nokia.
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:18.480]   They're just pushing us around, telling us what to do.
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:20.120]   It's an abomination.
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.760]   You ought to write to Congress.
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.400]   I'm going to write to Congress.
[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:25.200]   Call our trade representatives.
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.520]   Anyway, we'll be here late at night tonight.
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:30.440]   And by the way, what give us a make to China?
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:31.680]   One way or the other?
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:34.560]   Well, maybe, maybe their government buys Nokia phones.
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:35.560]   No, it's not the other way.
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:36.560]   I'll tell you what it is.
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:37.560]   It's a wall way.
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:38.560]   It's from Nokia.
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:39.760]   They're protecting ZTE and Huawei.
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:40.760]   Yeah.
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:41.760]   Damn.
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:42.760]   Which do compete with Nokia?
[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:47.960]   Yeah, it's just go around since Huawei and ZTE got beat up in the US.
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:50.360]   Anyway, just my thoughts.
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:55.080]   So we'll be here at 11.30 PM Civic to be at the end of Easter time tonight.
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:57.560]   Mike Gallegon and I will cover the Nokia X phone announcement.
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:59.400]   We do believe it'll be an Android phone.
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:03.920]   I think Mobile World Congress is rapidly becoming the most interesting event of the
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:08.040]   year because mobile and wearables are the hot thing, right?
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:10.120]   You only got the best food.
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.120]   Barcelona.
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:17.400]   You can get your wack at that, and your paella about the ratatouille, but you like good food.
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:21.440]   The Barcelona and paella is different than the paella and other parts of Spain.
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:23.280]   Yeah, Spain is not really one country.
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:28.080]   It's a Catalan paella.
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.080]   Okay.
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:31.880]   That was that put a damper on things.
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:35.560]   You know, did I mention we'd be here at 11.30 tonight?
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:39.480]   You know, you've been complaining about this since this morning.
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:45.920]   And then tomorrow, the big Samsung unpacked event that'll be 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:47.400]   time 1900 UTC.
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:49.160]   We will be here for that as well.
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:50.720]   Likely to be the S5.
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:51.720]   Galaxy S5.
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:52.720]   What do we know?
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:53.720]   What do we think?
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:54.720]   What do we expect?
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:55.720]   I don't know.
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:57.280]   Hopefully you're following me to the higher quality material.
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:59.840]   It's going to be a phone with better materials.
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:01.320]   Well, that's one of the same things.
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:03.840]   That's slimy plastic, as then gadget said.
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:04.840]   Not a good look.
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:05.840]   Not a good look.
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:06.840]   No.
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:07.840]   Yeah.
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:09.640]   Plastic stitched leather look.
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:10.640]   Do you like that?
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:11.640]   No.
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:12.640]   And you have a Note 3?
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:13.640]   Seriously?
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:14.640]   Do you use that as like a tanning bed?
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:15.640]   Yeah.
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:16.640]   That's a wall.
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:17.640]   That's a wall.
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:18.640]   You know, hello, mom.
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:23.000]   I keep up on Samsung because they are, in fact, 80% of the smartphone Android smartphone
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000]   market.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000]   They are the dominant player.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   Yep.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.160]   But I got to say, I abandoned my Galaxy S4 and even more so than Note 3 because of the
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:31.160]   crap where.
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:32.280]   Where'd it happen to your Motorola?
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:33.280]   You were so happy.
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:34.280]   I still use my Moto X.
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:35.280]   That's what you use.
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:36.280]   That's what you use.
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:37.280]   It's got...
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:38.280]   Yeah.
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:40.320]   So it's AT&T only then, right?
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:41.320]   No, not anymore.
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:42.520]   The Moto Maker is everywhere.
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.800]   You have this thing monogrammed.
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:47.760]   It says "Chief Twit printed on the back."
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:48.760]   Same one.
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:51.960]   I wish they'd done it with one of those wood burning kits, you know, that they used to
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:52.960]   get in camp.
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:53.960]   That would have been...
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:54.960]   I can do that.
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:55.960]   Can you do that?
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:56.960]   I have one of those.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:57.960]   You can just burn it in.
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:58.960]   I'll do that for you.
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:09:59.960]   Would you just take this with me?
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:00.960]   Huh?
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:01.960]   Or a soldering on it.
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:02.960]   Yeah.
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:03.960]   Yeah.
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:04.960]   Here's what we know about the Galaxy S5.
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:05.960]   Thank you for taking us back on track.
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:09.160]   The larger 5.2 inch screen sharper display.
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:10.160]   Whoa.
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:11.160]   5.2.
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:13.320]   The S4 is fine.
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:15.120]   It just keeps getting bigger and bigger.
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:16.120]   It just keeps getting bigger.
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:17.120]   Bigger and better.
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:18.920]   I told you I had wood.
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:19.920]   Just because...
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:25.080]   This is what our reporter in Seoul and our reporter in Paris...
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:26.080]   Okay.
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:28.680]   One thing I think having a reporter in Paris...
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:29.680]   That's the gig you want.
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:31.480]   It's like reporter in Paris, yeah.
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:32.480]   It's pretty nice.
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:33.480]   Very expensive.
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:34.480]   Just expensive.
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:35.480]   Quasan.
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:36.480]   Quasan.
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:37.480]   Real.
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:38.480]   Shh.
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:40.160]   Improved battery, improved camera.
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.120]   What does that mean?
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.120]   What does that mean?
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:44.120]   Better.
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:45.120]   Oh, okay.
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:46.280]   Didn't quite get that first.
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:49.560]   We couldn't learn exactly how improved those two were.
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.240]   But you know what I've got?
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:56.080]   Samsung may start selling the phone for less than previous models.
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:57.560]   Does that mean unlocked off contract?
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:59.320]   They dropped the price a little bit off contract.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:03.280]   They've been able to get the model X down to like $300 off contract.
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:06.920]   I think that really is pressure to get the off contract prices lower.
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:09.920]   Because you can't grow the market if the off contract prices...
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:10.920]   Seven C-Dets.
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:12.920]   That's really only a play for Europe and Asia.
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:13.920]   The US.
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:17.520]   You almost have to maintain the price point because the iPhone is seen as like the phone
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.520]   200 bucks.
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:19.520]   We also have subsidies.
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:20.520]   We have subsidies, right?
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:25.120]   But the carriers may be more likely to push the Samsung if they can make it a little more...
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:26.760]   A little higher margins on that phone.
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:30.400]   But they're not going to charge us any less when we go inside a new two year contract.
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:31.400]   Probably true.
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:32.400]   One thing I'll likely...
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:36.640]   What I'll be looking for tomorrow with interest is the crapware issue.
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:39.120]   Because I really do feel like Samsung's gone too...
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:43.400]   It was pretty clear that Samsung wanted to distance itself from Google and Android.
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.400]   But Tizen is one thing they're doing.
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:47.960]   They had a developer conference last month.
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:52.120]   I think they really want to get to the point where they don't have to say we're a Google
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:53.120]   phone.
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:54.880]   Well, they're already kind of at that point.
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:55.880]   They're very close.
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:58.320]   And TouchWidge customizes it heavily.
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:02.360]   They've got apps in most cases that replace the Google equivalents that are Samsung.
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:05.000]   Samsung apps, not Google apps.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.640]   They don't have the Google services yet.
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:07.920]   That's a big issue.
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:11.760]   Things like location services, which you get from Google search, which you get from Google.
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:16.000]   But I really feel like Samsung has been moving away from Google.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:22.600]   I also feel like that's why Google got rid of Motorola.
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:25.920]   Because they really use that as a lever, I think, with Samsung.
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:31.800]   Remember, the South Korean government passed a law saying that a crapware has to be uninstalling.
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:39.080]   Samsung's made an agreement right at the same time as the Motorola Mobility sale was announced
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:40.880]   to Lenovo.
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.920]   Samsung announced, OK, we've made a deal with Google.
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:45.360]   We're going to make a pure Google phone.
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:47.320]   So I'm watching with interest to see this S5.
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:51.480]   Is it a pure Google phone or is Samsung continue to push away?
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:56.800]   I think this Galaxy Gear story might be an indicator that they're going to continue to
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:57.800]   push away from Android.
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:01.680]   Well, they've made it very clear that Tizen is where they see their software future.
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:03.760]   They're not necessarily going away from Android.
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:10.080]   They say, but they are trying to build up Tizen as a punch-or-punch counterpart, something
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.720]   that you can choose and walk you to the same experience.
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:15.000]   Just for developing nations or do you think that that's?
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.840]   I think it's intended for everything.
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:18.560]   I mean, Tizen's had a lot of setbacks.
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:22.200]   We've actually been covering this a lot at the Wall Street Journal.
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:25.880]   There have a lot of carriers that have kind of backed out of supporting Tizen phones so
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:26.880]   far.
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:28.400]   Right now they are kind of on--
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:29.400]   It's a Samsung product.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:31.320]   It is a fully Samsung product.
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:36.720]   And it's interesting because really software has been kind of a weak point for Samsung.
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:40.120]   I mean, yeah, there's touch with-- but a lot of folks aren't using these alternative
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:41.120]   apps at Samsung's preloading.
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:42.120]   It's horrible.
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:44.840]   Like you said, this is one of the reasons why you're kind of neglecting those phones
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:45.840]   for a mobile phone.
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:49.080]   I use them on the roller because it's as close to a pure Google experience you can get.
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:50.080]   Exactly.
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:54.320]   So, I mean, there's really kind of becoming a growing battle between Samsung.
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:57.040]   They've leveraged Android to get a foothold in market.
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:00.080]   Now they're going to try and take that next step and say, "Okay, we're our own thing.
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:01.680]   We have our own software.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:05.080]   We're still going to use Android here if people want that given the choice."
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:06.080]   And that's the thing.
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:11.160]   Samsung can deliver a new phone, tablet, tablet, smartwatch, anything they want.
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:14.760]   But how long have they been saying that a Tizen phone is going to come out?
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:15.960]   I mean, they've delayed this project.
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:17.440]   I've heard they're having trouble with it.
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:18.440]   They're having a ton of trouble with it.
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:19.440]   I think one of the--
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:20.440]   They're having a ton of trouble.
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:21.440]   What kind of trouble?
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:23.440]   Well, a lot of different carriers.
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:24.600]   Besides the carriers.
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:25.600]   Is there technical issues with--
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:26.600]   There have been--
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:28.960]   There have been technical issues as well.
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:31.760]   They've also had a hard time attracting third party developers.
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:33.000]   I think that's the big one.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.840]   How do you start with a smartphone platform now?
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:40.880]   I mean, look at Microsoft started two or three years ago and get developers excited
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:42.200]   enough to build apps for it.
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:47.240]   Well, I mean, that might be if Nokia, as the rumors say, if they're building an Android
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:49.680]   phone, why else would you do that if not?
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:51.280]   Because people want Android apps.
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:52.280]   They want Android.
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:53.280]   Why?
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:55.280]   I mean, this is why Amazon's using Android and the cable.
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:58.800]   Why can't they make an Android compatible phone?
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:01.960]   So in other words, you have the Tizen OS and it's compatible with Android apps and they're
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:03.600]   both problem solved.
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:07.080]   Is there a sense it's supposed to be all open source and everything?
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:08.800]   And I'm sure the developers, I'm a developer.
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:11.640]   I don't care if it goes on the Tizen phone.
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:13.520]   Why don't they go in that route?
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:14.520]   Maybe--
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:20.200]   Well, while Android is open source, there's very specific guidelines that Google sets
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:26.320]   for operators or for phone makers on how they can design the software.
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:32.160]   So you can do it, whatever you want with Android, as Amazon has shown and Xiaomi has
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:37.360]   shown, but then you can't put the Google apps on it and you can't put Google's App Store
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:38.720]   where all the apps are.
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:39.720]   That's the big one.
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:40.720]   And so--
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:45.680]   According to App Rain, there are 1 million, 132,053 Android apps right now.
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:49.760]   Now, I should also point out that only 22% of them are any good.
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:51.600]   I would say less than that.
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:52.600]   Actually, they do a graph.
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:53.600]   I say only about 22.
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:57.440]   They do a graph where all apps, that's the red line.
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:01.720]   And you see it's jumped significantly in the last couple of months.
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:03.520]   Regular apps, that's the blue line.
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:04.520]   Low quality apps.
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:05.520]   This is a green line.
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:09.960]   I don't know what low quality apps are, but look at the number of new apps added.
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:10.960]   I mean, it is a--
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:12.960]   Oh, like the flashing light would be called.
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:13.960]   Stunning number.
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:18.200]   The new-- of decent quality apps, we're talking over 100,000 added in December.
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:19.200]   In a month.
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.200]   It's a lot.
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:24.480]   Whenever somebody looking for a phone, I think that's something you consider.
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:25.480]   It's one of the reasons why this phone is not.
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:27.480]   How do you find a good app?
[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:29.840]   You need to do it more app reviews.
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:35.400]   We actually already have an app show for the iPhone I5 for the iPhone.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:39.120]   We have a very good Android show all about Android, which has the app arena, which is
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:43.960]   fabulous, where each of the hosts suggests an app and then they fight it out.
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:46.280]   And whoever has the most physical strength win.
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:47.800]   That sounds like a winner.
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:48.800]   And then--
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:49.800]   Good TV show.
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:52.240]   And Jason really wants to launch-- yeah, Android deathmatch.
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:55.600]   Jason really wants to launch a new Android app show, so I think we will do that.
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:56.600]   Because you're absolutely right.
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:58.680]   Discovery is tough when you have a million plus apps.
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:16:59.680]   It's impossible.
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:03.080]   Well, there's that and there's also the issue of Android runs on so many different things.
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:06.480]   And there's so many different screen sizes and processors and options as to what the
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:07.480]   hardware can be.
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:11.320]   So you can't really have a consistent user experience when you have inconsistent hardware, which
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:17.400]   I mean, the gear has like a two inch screen and one and a half inch screen, so like that.
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:19.240]   And then the angry birds impossible.
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:21.960]   And then you have the note-- how big is your note?
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:22.960]   Three screen.
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:23.960]   How big is that?
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:25.200]   It's 5.7, I think.
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:26.880]   So, you know, not to mention they just--
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:32.200]   Now there's like a 12 inch Galaxy Note Tab Pro extra 13, something super-sized.
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:34.680]   I mean, that's just the reality situation.
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:35.680]   Bigger is better.
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:38.200]   Seems like another reason not to be in Facebook.
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:40.880]   We have more from Barcelona coming up and a lot more too.
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:44.680]   You know, if you-- speaking of all about Android, if you missed this week at Twitch
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:50.400]   boy, there was-- fortunately, we have a little minute long piece that will give you
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.400]   something--
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:52.400]   I know this is a house ad, John.
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:53.400]   What do you think?
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:55.720]   It's not you, 2 million.
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:56.720]   I think so.
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:58.960]   Let's see what you missed this week on Twitch.
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:02.880]   Previously on Twitch, Tech News Tonight.
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:08.160]   Facebook has announced it's buying a messaging app WhatsApp for $12 billion in stock, $4
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:09.640]   billion in cash.
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:12.240]   WhatsApp dominates around the rest of the world.
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:15.640]   They're super popular, and they were going to put as much money as they could possibly
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:19.640]   get behind the largest messaging service in the world.
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:20.960]   Security now.
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:26.600]   Remotely control WeMo home automation attached devices over the internet.
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:33.400]   And this is WeMo access than you intend to give to your household appliances.
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:34.680]   Matt break weekly.
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:40.200]   I think we should just sit back and enjoy these pictures of David and his Mac Pro.
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:41.200]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:43.200]   He's having my baby.
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:45.440]   I can never unsee that.
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:46.440]   Twitch.
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:47.440]   Kid tested.
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:48.440]   Mother approved.
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:51.440]   And we have a big week ahead.
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:55.760]   Mike Elgin in our news department has the look at the week ahead, Mike.
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:59.480]   Coming up this week, wall to wall mobile world congress coverage starting with the Nokia
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:01.840]   event tonight at 11.30 p.m. Pacific.
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:08.120]   We're also covering Samsung's big unpacked five event tomorrow morning at 11 a.m. Pacific.
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:12.600]   And in fact tune in all week for our extensive mobile world congress coverage back to you,
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:13.600]   Leo.
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:17.480]   Thank you, Mike Elgin, news director here and host of TNT every morning, Monday through
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:23.120]   Friday, 10 a.m. Pacific 1 p.m. Eastern time, 1800 UTC.
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:24.320]   We also have tech news tonight.
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:27.360]   You know, we have a night news show now with Sarah Lane is our anchor.
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:28.360]   That's at 4 p.m.
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:32.000]   So you can't get your Pacific falling behind and advertising.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.200]   You have to run house ads.
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:35.200]   You know, that's you always count house ads on NBC.
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:37.880]   No, we still have plenty of ads because here comes one right now.
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:38.880]   He's a gentleman.
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:41.720]   He's for reminding me, John.
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:42.720]   You're welcome.
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:44.900]   No, you know, I don't want to do house ads.
[01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:49.080]   It's not like we have an avail, but I feel that if I don't let people know all the great
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:53.640]   stuff, they just won't realize how rich and fully experienced here a twig can be.
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:58.200]   Do when you run the house ads on the other shows, because you run house ads apparently
[01:19:58.200 --> 01:19:59.200]   just all the time.
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:00.200]   No, no, I actually don't.
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:01.440]   Does the only time you run house ads?
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:02.440]   Yeah.
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:05.040]   So you never promote this particular show that we're on as we speak.
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:10.040]   I don't need to.
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:11.400]   So you just about twist.
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:14.000]   So now it's essentially the cash cow, which you just said.
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.000]   It's a cash cow.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.000]   It's a cash cow.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.640]   And you are just letting the cash cow die.
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:20.200]   What you're not promoting it.
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:21.200]   All right.
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:22.200]   Let's get right on that.
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:25.640]   Actually, you know, Lisa wants to buy billboard ads in Silicon Valley.
[01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:26.640]   You think that's a good idea?
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:27.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:28.640]   Absolutely.
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:30.280]   She wants to buy television ads around the country.
[01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:31.280]   I think that's good.
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:32.520]   Television ads is a little less important.
[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:34.240]   I think I think billboard ads is a good deal.
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:35.240]   And then we're going to get a bus wrap.
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:37.040]   Depends on what your CPM is on the billboard.
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:39.520]   We're going to get a bus wrapper on the 15 mission.
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:41.040]   I think that's going to be big.
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:42.520]   Oh, or the Google bus.
[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:45.040]   Or the Google bus would be great.
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:46.040]   That's a great idea.
[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:47.360]   The problem is the people want it.
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:48.920]   We want to know about the show are in the bus.
[01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:50.640]   They don't see what the outside is.
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:51.640]   Mm.
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:52.640]   Mm.
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:53.640]   Problem.
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:54.640]   Yeah.
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:56.240]   You just want to know they see what the outside is because they're standing in line waiting
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:57.840]   for the zidiotic bus to come by.
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:59.640]   You get a picket line there with Twitter.
[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:00.640]   Right.
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:01.640]   That's marketing.
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:02.640]   That's marketing.
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:03.640]   That's marketing.
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:04.640]   I want to it is.
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:07.040]   It's gentrifying Petaluma.
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:09.640]   Ruining the rent here in Petaluma.
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:10.840]   It's gone through the roof.
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:11.840]   And I blame Twitter.
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:12.840]   That's a great idea.
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:17.600]   We're going to have protesters outside these windows for every show from now on our show
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:20.160]   today brought to you by Citrix.
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:21.640]   We love these guys in there.
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:26.280]   Go to meeting is absolutely the best way to hold meetings.
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:27.720]   Meeting who likes meetings.
[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:31.400]   And yet without them, I think a lot of stuff doesn't get done.
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:33.360]   Sometimes those email exchanges go on for hours.
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:34.600]   Lisa's got a great thing.
[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:36.880]   She says, after three emails, we're having a meeting.
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:41.840]   We got to have a meeting because you can cut through the garbage and get to the get to
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:43.040]   the solution.
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:48.120]   It's also great for brainstorming, meeting and collaborating with coworkers and clients,
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:49.680]   developing quality ideas and solutions.
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:51.600]   We had a great creative meeting the other day.
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:52.600]   And you know what we use?
[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:54.760]   Go to meeting those HD faces.
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:22:00.280]   Cameras mean I can see people all over the country, all over the world.
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:04.360]   Of course, we share the screen so we can see the presentations that collaborate on the
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:05.360]   documents.
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:06.360]   Go to meeting is phenomenal.
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:07.680]   And I want you to try it.
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:10.320]   It works Mac, PC and mobile device.
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:15.800]   In fact, pretty much everything you've got, you can even present from an iPad.
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:17.040]   You can share the same screen.
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:18.440]   You can see each other face to face.
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:23.400]   You can use the audio on the iPad or the computer or the device so that you don't have
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:25.040]   to get a conference bridge.
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:28.440]   The audio is part of the Go to meeting software.
[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:29.920]   I just think it's great.
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:30.920]   As well as video.

[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:44.120]   Speaking of smart watches, you know, we keep hearing a rumor that Google is going to do
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:45.120]   it.
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:47.080]   They patented stuff.
[01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:51.520]   According to this story also from the Wall Street Journal, such a great publication.
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:52.520]   Oh, it's so weird.
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:55.400]   And you're still friends with him?
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:56.880]   You know, Bloomberg's good too.
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:58.240]   The French of a strain.
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:00.760]   Bloomberg is good too.
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:06.800]   There may be an Android Power Smart Watch by Google made by LG, which is what they did
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:09.000]   with the Nexus 4 and 5 smartphones.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.360]   So they know each other well, LG and Google.
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:15.040]   They seem to work, you know, well with each other.
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:19.640]   What we're seeing and what some of our sources are telling our reporters that they're in Barcelona
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:24.480]   is that this will integrate really nicely with Google now, which if you guys have an
[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:27.240]   Android smartphone, you know, like sends you kind of information.
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:29.440]   So before you go looking for us.
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:33.000]   Yeah, so you check in my flight reservations coming up.
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.080]   There's a Google now card.
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:35.080]   The weather is there.
[01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:38.840]   It tells me what games are coming up for my favorite sports teams.
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:40.280]   All sorts of really fantastic stuff.
[01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:42.480]   So imagine that on your smart watch.
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:44.640]   It could be potentially be pretty cool.
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:48.800]   It seems to me Google's got the inside track because of Google now that makes it more valuable
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:50.440]   and just something that's going to give me no suggestions.
[01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:51.760]   Something pebble doesn't have it.
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:55.880]   Something gear doesn't have it's really no one else can really match.
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:59.320]   Your story won't be announced at mobile world Congress will probably be announced at Google
[01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:01.200]   IO, which is this year in June.
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:02.480]   They moved it back to June.
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:06.040]   That would make sense if it's a Google device, Google branded device.
[01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:09.760]   And the IO has been so popular because they give away crap.
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:12.680]   Yes, lots of the Oprah thing, you know.
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:14.280]   Look under your seat.
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:15.600]   This year's a car.
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:16.840]   I don't think they're going to do it.
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:17.840]   I run this car.
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:18.840]   No, everyone gets one.
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:19.840]   A driverless car?
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:20.840]   Everyone gets one.
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:21.840]   Just waiting for you outside.
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:22.840]   I bet you'll get a watch.
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:23.840]   You're talking about Hot wheels?
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:26.440]   Are you talking about something I can actually make up a minute?
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:27.440]   Well, you wouldn't be driving it.
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:30.720]   It's going to be driverless Hot wheel.
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:34.160]   But this year they're having a lottery to get into Google IO.
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:35.660]   It's so jammed.
[01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:38.880]   You have to send them an application and they're going to have a random drum.
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:41.200]   How do I know why they don't just get their act together?
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:42.200]   What do you mean?
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:43.200]   Well, there's other ways.
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:45.280]   I mean, people need to go to this because they're developing stuff or they need to
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:46.280]   cover it.
[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:49.360]   I didn't promise the people like us who fill it up because they were just pressed.
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:50.360]   And there's no room.
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:53.800]   No, they should just stop giving stuff away and make it for what it's for.
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:54.800]   All right.
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:58.080]   Well, they do stream over the web so you can watch it.
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:59.840]   You can still get a lot of valuable information.
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:01.160]   Yes, but it's still a networking thing.
[01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:02.160]   You have to be there.
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:03.160]   That's what's really fantastic for them.
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:04.920]   Oh, hey, Bill, I haven't seen you for a while.
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:05.920]   Hey, let's have lunch.
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:06.920]   Yeah, sure.
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:07.920]   Exactly.
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:08.920]   That's the end of it.
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:09.920]   Delicious.
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:10.920]   That sounds not valuable.
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:13.920]   Well, it's kind of valuable because you get to tick it off.
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:15.880]   I asked him for lunch.
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:21.960]   So, is this one of them Google April Fool's jokes or is this real project tango?
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:25.280]   It is real is very, very real.
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:30.520]   The idea is that remember Google sold Motorola mobility but kept the R&D division.
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:31.520]   Yep.
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:33.480]   And this was apparently something they were working on.
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:39.200]   The project tango is a device that has a connect like camera built into it.
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:46.200]   The prototype is a five inch phone software designed to track the motion of the device
[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:50.160]   while simultaneously creating a map of the environment.
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:55.040]   A quarter million 3D measurements every second updating position and orientation in real
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:59.880]   time build a 3D model of the world around you with your phone.
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:00.880]   They say, imagine.
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:05.600]   John, I'd like you to imagine this playing hide and seek in your house with your with
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:06.600]   Super Mario.
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:10.440]   Why aren't we talking about something like this about six months ago when Google is trying
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:11.440]   to collect photos?
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:13.000]   Do you remember this one?
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.360]   I remember a photo sphere where you can take a photo of like your environment.
[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:17.360]   And we were deciding.
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:22.160]   Yeah, it was either that or something other Leo and I were discussing it and I was complaining
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:27.240]   that was just a cheap way for Google to get a bunch of pictures for their Google.
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:28.240]   Oh, yes.
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:29.880]   Don't you remember this discussion?
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:35.400]   You know what this reminds me a lot though of is Jerry Ellsworth and her Caste Art glasses
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:36.920]   which did almost the same thing.
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:40.040]   They would project a game space into your real world environment.
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:41.520]   This is actually even more sophisticated.
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:43.520]   Yeah, this is what we were talking about.
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:44.520]   Yeah.
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:48.720]   You can look at the screen and see the augmented reality.
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:50.960]   There's level that there's also outside of gaming.
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:55.520]   I mean, you know, say that you're visually impaired and this phone has a 3D model of your
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:57.480]   house and you're walking around.
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:59.960]   It could tell you, you know, hey, make a left here, make a right there.
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:01.680]   There's going to be a doorknob here.
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:03.600]   Not just your house, but the world around you.
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:05.160]   Well, yeah, you see pennies.
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:06.240]   It could walk you through it.
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:09.000]   Maybe you go to public space you've never been to before, but they already have an indoor
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:13.280]   map and they've actually been working really hard to get indoor mapping off the ground.
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:14.280]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:15.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:16.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:17.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:18.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:19.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:20.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:21.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:22.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:23.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:24.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:26.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:27.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:28.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:29.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:30.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:31.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:32.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:33.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:34.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:35.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:36.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:37.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:38.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:39.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:41.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:42.280]   Yeah.
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:43.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:44.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:45.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:46.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:47.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:48.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:49.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:50.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:51.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:52.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:53.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:54.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:55.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:56.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:57.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:58.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:27:59.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:00.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:01.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:02.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:03.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:04.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:05.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:06.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:07.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:08.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:09.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:10.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:11.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:12.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:13.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:14.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:15.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:16.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:17.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:18.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:19.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:20.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:21.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:22.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:23.280]   Yeah, yeah.

[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:21.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:22.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:23.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:24.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:25.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:26.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:27.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:28.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:29.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:30.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:31.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:38.280]   This is Jacob Miller, who is a UX designer for Microsoft on a Reddit conversation. He says Metro was created for casual users first and foremost. Our hands were bound.
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:39.280]   Why?
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:43.280]   Well, maybe it's a sex thing. And our users were in...
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:47.280]   He compares Windows 8 to a rented tuxedo coat.
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:48.280]   Design.
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:49.280]   Okay.
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:51.280]   Now, bear with me here.
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:56.280]   Designed to fit a variety of people, but not tailored to any one specific customer.
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:57.280]   Ill-fitting is the word.
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:36:58.280]   Ill-fitting.
[01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:05.280]   Features added to Windows had to be simple enough for casual users. Because that's what they're trying to do. Is it tracked casually? I don't know why. Why? There's none left.
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:06.280]   Right.
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:20.280]   But can't turn off power users as a result. Many features were cut on the first go round. And that, according to Miller, led to Windows 8 split personality. Our hands were tied. Our users were annoyed with their reded jackets. So what did we do? We separated the users into two gals.
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:26.280]   Casual. You could wear maybe a turtleneck. And power.
[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:28.280]   So which is Metro and desktop.
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:29.280]   Yeah. Right.
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:31.280]   So we made two separate playgrounds.
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:32.280]   Why did it boot to...
[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:33.280]   Well, yes.
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:38.280]   All the casual users would have their own new and shiny place to look at pictures of cats. Metro. This is him.
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:47.280]   The power users would then have free reign of their native domain, the desktop. Why was Metro the default? Because casual users are very inquisitive.
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:50.280]   So if we didn't make it front and center, they'd never find it.
[01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:53.280]   So we'd like classic shell so great, by the way.
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:56.280]   By the way, this is why Windows 8 is so bad.
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:38:01.280]   Now that the casual users are aware of their new passenger, says Miller, we could start tailoring.
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:07.280]   Oh, please. What is this? Our hands were bound. Name names.
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:15.280]   Well, I mean, just look at the company. Look at the way it's structured. The whole one Microsoft movie that was started, well, really put in place by Steve Ballmer.
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:24.280]   The whole entire push from Microsoft saying, Windows, one operating system on both your desktop, your laptop, and your mobile devices, your tablets.
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:26.280]   I mean, the entire company bought into this.
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:33.280]   Anyone who was involved with actually making decisions there, Ballmer all the way down, these are the guys making that push.
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:37.280]   And that's a really different kind of philosophical difference on how to view computing.
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:42.280]   I mean, Apple says you have a desktop operating system, then you have a mobile one for your phone or your tablet.
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:46.280]   Windows is saying you have one operating system for your tablet and your one operating system.
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:48.280]   It's single user experience.
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:49.280]   Exactly.
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:50.280]   What they were working on. And it's idiotic.
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:57.280]   Do they think people are so stupid that they can't have a phone with that they act a little differently than their desktop?
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:03.280]   So everything has to look exactly the same. Oh, look, my desktop is exactly like my phone. That's great.
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:06.280]   Yeah, but it's kind of confusing because it doesn't run the same software.
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:07.280]   No, you write exactly.
[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:09.280]   But it looks the same, behaves the same.
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:12.280]   Microsoft confirmed this guy does work for them. They wouldn't say what he does.
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:16.280]   There's some speculation. Maybe it's just a nobody who I accept.
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:19.280]   What he says is exactly right. Makes perfect sense.
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:24.280]   That's what you got. And that's exactly why you got it. So whether he's a who or not.
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:30.280]   I mean, if he's not a UX designer and he purports to be one on Reddit, I wonder how long he'd remain a Microsoft employee.
[01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:34.280]   You got a wonder. I mean, I don't know. Anyway, our show today brought to you by Gazelle.
[01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:35.280]   You got old gadgets.
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:39.280]   Maybe you've got an old Windows phone you'd like to unload.
[01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:40.280]   Gear one.
[01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:41.280]   Gear one.
[01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:43.280]   You got a Galaxy Gear one. I don't know if they let me look.
[01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:46.280]   They should buy the Gear ones. That would be great. I don't think they do.
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:49.280]   They pretty much focus on phones, iPods, tablets.
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:53.280]   They'll buy anything made by Apple because they've got a great resale value.
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:56.280]   Even a Newton? No, no, no, anything recently.
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:40:01.280]   They do buy Blackberries, HTCs, LG phones. You can sell your Motorola, your Nokia.
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:05.280]   Yes, you can sell your Samsung phone. And they pay good money.
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:07.280]   They even buy broken iPhones.
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:10.280]   What's great about Gazelle is how easy they make it.
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:12.280]   When you go to Gazelle, get a quote.
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:13.280]   Give them all your stuff.
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:19.280]   Find that gadget drawer that's filled with garbage, old gadgets you don't use anymore.
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:21.280]   Get it all. The quote's good for 30 days.
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:26.280]   So if you, you know, this would be a good time right before Mobile World Congress to spend some time gazelling stuff.
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:28.280]   Get those quotes you're locked in.
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:31.280]   If you see something in Mobile World Congress, you know you're going to want to buy.
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:35.280]   You could take advantage of it. If not, no loss. You didn't have to.
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:40.280]   The 5C, I hear Apple's discontinuing the color 5C.
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:43.280]   Maybe I actually have, let's see, is 32.
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:47.280]   That's a great deal. Unlocked 255 bucks.
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:52.280]   And they even give you instructions on how to unlock your iPhone 5C.
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:55.280]   Now, once you get it all together, you pull the trigger.
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:41:03.280]   If you decide this is it, they will send you a box prepaid mailer so you don't ever pay for the shipping on anything worth anything more than a buck.
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:07.280]   And then, as soon as the gadget comes to their offices, they check it.
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:09.280]   If you leave data on it, they will remove it.
[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:14.280]   They will upgrade your offer if it's in better condition than you said.
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:16.280]   And then they'll send you a check.
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:18.280]   Or if you're in a hurry, get a PayPal credit.
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:24.280]   Or if you buy a lot of Amazon, my suggestion is get the Amazon gift card because they bump that value up 5%.
[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:28.280]   So, risk-free offers good for 30 days.
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:29.280]   It's trustworthy.
[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:33.280]   They've paid out now more than $100 million to over 700,000 customers.
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:34.280]   And it's easy.
[01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:39.280]   Free shipping fast processing, great value for your used gadgets.
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:43.280]   Gazelle.com, take advantage of it right now.
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:49.280]   Gazelle.com, right before mobile world Congress, that's the time to get those quotes.
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:53.280]   The new malware is called the moon.
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:56.280]   This is a nasty bit of malware.
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:58.280]   We talked about it on security now.
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:04.280]   This week, it would allow a hacker to gain control of your computer, your network remotely.
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:09.280]   Linksys said all it only affects a few of our routers.
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:14.280]   However, it turns out it affects pretty much every Linksys router.
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:16.280]   Belkin now owns Linksys.
[01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:19.280]   And they confirm the exploit.
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:22.280]   You should turn off remote management access.
[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:26.280]   That is turned off by default.
[01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:27.280]   You should always turn that off.
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:31.280]   And then we'd be router unless you want to manage your router from the office or something.
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:33.280]   I can't think of why you'd want that.
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:35.280]   But this is a fairly serious defect.
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:38.280]   You know, routers are full of bugs.
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:41.280]   And because it's firmware, they're not patched very often.
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:45.280]   You know, the untold story that was never really written up by anybody because I happened with me
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:48.280]   and my Sonic.net connection is the pace.
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:52.280]   And it turns out, you know, that exploit that this French guy wrote about,
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:55.280]   about DSL modems being hackable.
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:57.280]   They were all hacked, almost all of them in the country.
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:42:59.280]   And many of the DSL connections.
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:02.280]   And it only didn't show up necessarily so it was obvious.
[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:08.280]   But when we tried to use it for the podcast, we were just having all kinds of problems with those.
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:10.280]   Because your router had been hacked.
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:11.280]   The routers have all been hacked.
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:12.280]   Yeah, most of them.
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:14.280]   And hacked to what end?
[01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:15.280]   Would they give them access to your network?
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:20.280]   No, actually they could access the network and spam without the computer through the router.
[01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:22.280]   They were using the router to forward spam.
[01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:23.280]   Yeah.
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:24.280]   Holy moly.
[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:26.280]   And so most of the DSL routers were compromised.
[01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:31.280]   And as far as I could tell, took them over a week to get the pace modems back online working, right?
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:35.280]   They gave me a special IP address so I could avoid the whole thing.
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:37.280]   But these sorts of things are just going on constantly.
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:38.280]   Wow.
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:39.280]   These routers.
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:42.280]   Well, I think routers are just carelessly written.
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:43.280]   I think so.
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:44.280]   Yeah.
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:46.280]   And we've seen a lot of malware of late.
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:51.280]   And one of the things that's happening is because Microsoft has done a pretty good Java patching windows.
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:53.280]   It's no longer the automatic updates.
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:54.280]   It's no longer the people have gotten more.
[01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:56.280]   We're no longer the vector it used to be.
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:59.280]   So malware authors are looking at other avenues.
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:02.280]   They're infecting third party software like Flash and Java.
[01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:06.280]   And they're looking at things like routers.
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:08.280]   And you know, there's no software.
[01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:09.280]   There's no software written.
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:11.280]   It's not got some flaws in it, right?
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:12.280]   Yeah.
[01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:14.280]   A couple of go to fails.
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:17.280]   And it's just what happens.
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:20.280]   If you're using a router, you should certainly update the firmware.
[01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:37.280]   I would say if you're using a router, buy a router that gets compatible with DDWRT and install it because it's an open source firmware that has always been much more reliable, much better, hasn't had the problems that the commercial router firmware has.
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:39.280]   Mark Millian, thank you for being here.
[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:40.280]   We appreciate it.
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:41.280]   Bloomberg Bigs this week.
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:44.280]   You're covering the global environment, the global world.
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:45.280]   So it right.
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:46.280]   Right.
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:48.280]   Bloomberg.com/globaltech.
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:50.280]   Bloomberg.com.
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:51.280]   That's it.
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:54.280]   You know how to get there.
[01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:56.280]   Just can you say WSJD like that?
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:44:57.280]   I just want to.
[01:44:57.280 --> 01:44:58.280]   WSJD.
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:00.280]   I certainly can.
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:05.280]   And then when you think, "Nate in the very strong, I'm here."
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:06.280]   It's my pleasure.
[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:09.280]   Congratulations on the new gig.
[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:11.280]   Wall Street Journal is doing a great job.
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:12.280]   Thanks.
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:14.280]   Good you got rid of that stuffy old guy with a goatee.
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:16.280]   He was boring.
[01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:21.280]   But really the WSJD, go to WSJD.com and great tech coverage.
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:25.280]   Much better than the Yahoo Tech page at POGS doing.
[01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:26.280]   I mean really.
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:27.280]   Is there any tech on that page?
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:29.280]   I can't figure it out.
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:30.280]   I like David.
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:31.280]   He's a friend.
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:35.280]   But boy, they're trying to be, they're aiming at people who don't care about tech.
[01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:37.280]   Which is the mistake every week.
[01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:38.280]   Tech TV started doing that.
[01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:39.280]   Yeah.
[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:40.280]   We didn't even care.
[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:41.280]   Kenny Rogers.
[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:42.280]   What's on your iPad, Kenny?
[01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:43.280]   Yeah.
[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:44.280]   It's bad, bad, bad.
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:45.280]   It's not good.
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:46.280]   People aren't interested about tech.
[01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:48.280]   They're not going to read a tech page no matter what you do.
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:49.280]   I agree.
[01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:52.280]   But see, this is what I like about WSJD.
[01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:56.280]   Besides the fact that it's harder to say than a radio station.
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:59.280]   It's unabashedly geeky.
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:04.280]   We have a good mix of some consumer friendly stuff, some business analysis, breaking news,
[01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:05.280]   features.
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:06.280]   What happened by the way?
[01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:09.280]   What's app was out for three, almost four hours yesterday?
[01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:10.280]   Something like that.
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:11.280]   Was it a DDoS?
[01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:13.280]   I don't think it's really quite clear on what happened.
[01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:14.280]   It was a DDoS.
[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:16.280]   Don't you think?
[01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:18.280]   Some snotty script kitty?
[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:20.280]   Hopefully Facebook's going to help them out with that.
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:23.280]   I mean, you know, $19 billion are going to want that to work.
[01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:25.280]   They have been, they probably, they're probably super reliable.
[01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:29.280]   They had probably seen a huge uptick based on all the attention from the headlines.
[01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:30.280]   People wanted to check it out.
[01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:33.280]   New folks downloading their app could be, you know, more than they can handle.
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:34.280]   Overloading this.
[01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:35.280]   210 minutes down those.
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:36.280]   It should have been on square space.
[01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:38.280]   It wouldn't have been a problem.
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:40.280]   It wouldn't have been a problem.
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:43.280]   Somebody told me that they had 99.9% upto that point.
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:44.280]   Up to date.
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:45.280]   Up to that point.
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:46.280]   Yes.
[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:48.280]   It's not for being very reliable in terms of about nine hours.
[01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:50.280]   First time I got so much security wise.
[01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:51.280]   Oh, really?
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:52.280]   Have there been security flaws with that?
[01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:54.280]   There have been some publicized polls.
[01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:59.760]   Actually, I remember just last week four Android malware applications, which have since been
[01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:00.960]   removed from the Play Store.
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:02.280]   So you don't have to worry about them.
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:09.100]   But they, what they did is they signed you up for paid text messaging, expensive, paid
[01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:13.280]   text messaging service where you get a buck 50 message every three minutes.
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:15.280]   And it comes out on your phone bill.
[01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:19.640]   But the way they did it, of course, they need your phone number, is it turns out WhatsApp
[01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:23.880]   puts your phone number in the clear in the data of the WhatsApp application.
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:24.880]   Nice.
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:26.280]   They were just pulling the phone number from WhatsApp.
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:27.280]   Oh, fantastic.
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:28.280]   What is this guy's phone number?
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:29.280]   Oh, WhatsApp knows.
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:30.280]   Let's ask it.
[01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:31.280]   Oh.
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:38.500]   This was actually a scam from an organized cyber crime ring based in Russia that racked
[01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:43.840]   up huge amounts of profits by targeting expensive text messaging scams.
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:45.480]   It's the Russians.
[01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:46.800]   It's the Russians.
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:49.400]   When they're not busy fixing the Olympics.
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:52.440]   You're talking about the skater.
[01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:53.440]   Yeah.
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:54.440]   Yeah, that's pretty bad.
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:57.440]   Who has the most medals in the Winter Olympics this year?
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:47:58.440]   The Russians.
[01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:01.200]   I thought we ended up with the most.
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:02.800]   Well, there's a couple of who knows.
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:03.800]   You know, I could ask Google.
[01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:04.800]   Yeah, don't ask Google.
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:05.800]   Okay, go now.
[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:06.800]   Who has the most?
[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:08.800]   Oh, you brought my desk.
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:09.800]   You can't even know how to ask.
[01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:10.800]   It's like ridiculous.
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:14.560]   Don't you notice though that that's the problem with this stuff is that you have to formulate
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:18.960]   the query because inevitably if you just launch into it, you'll get it all screwed up.
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:19.960]   Yeah.
[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:21.400]   So it's a waste of everybody's time.
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:27.600]   The most likely problem, I don't know the stuff that you still recording.
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:28.600]   Still recording.
[01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:29.600]   Try it again.
[01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:31.800]   How to ask questions to smart.
[01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:33.920]   Well, at least it's got some brains.
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:35.760]   I use the key word.
[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:37.400]   It's something you can use.
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:38.400]   It's Russia.
[01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:41.560]   13 gold medals at number one Norway was number two.
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:42.560]   Total medals.
[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:43.560]   Total medals.
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:44.560]   We don't care.
[01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:45.560]   33 total medals Russia.
[01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:46.560]   What about us?
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:49.160]   North we were in fourth place with 28.
[01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:50.160]   Shaders.
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:53.560]   Well, actually we were in second place on total medals.
[01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:55.440]   We were in fourth place on gold medal.
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:59.280]   That's Vladimir Putin looks good on a horse spearback.
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:02.160]   But didn't this happen in Beijing two years ago?
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:03.160]   Were they won all?
[01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:04.160]   The Chinese.
[01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:05.160]   Apparently it's Chinese.
[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:06.160]   Yeah, it's just one of the games.
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:07.160]   Nobody cares.
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:11.200]   Well, isn't there something to be said for like, you know, the the boost that would give
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:14.440]   you for performing in front of your own country and doing it at home.
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:15.440]   Yeah, you can't go.
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:16.440]   You can't go to the box.
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:18.440]   Let it's a time to van it.
[01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:19.440]   You can't do it.
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:22.440]   Yeah, the famous second man syndrome.
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:23.440]   12th man.
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:24.440]   12th man.
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:25.440]   Yeah, but if you're seeing it.
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:26.440]   In figure, in figure skating.
[01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:28.960]   No, it's just you and the second man.
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:29.960]   You're a pretty hook.
[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:30.960]   So that's all.
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:33.920]   I'm just saying in figure skating, there's there's not 11 men on the field.
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:34.920]   You're only one.
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:35.920]   You were doing it.
[01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:37.920]   Yeah, you were out drawing everybody and I was waiting.
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:38.920]   Hey, you know what?
[01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:39.920]   I got to be back here at 11 30.
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:40.920]   Do you mind?
[01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:41.920]   Can I wrap this up?
[01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:42.920]   I'm waiting.
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:43.920]   That's what I'm sitting here waiting for.
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:45.160]   I've been gone by now.
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:50.480]   He wants you to do the boy's John he Dvorak is it.

[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:14.200]   There you go.
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:15.200]   I never alone.
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:17.080]   I have John C with me every day.
[01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:18.080]   All the time.
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:19.480]   All the time.
[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:20.480]   Okay.
[01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:22.000]   You didn't do the German voice.
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:23.000]   Come on.
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:24.640]   I'm saving it.
[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:26.360]   I got my Audi back though.
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:27.360]   Oh yeah.
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:28.360]   By the way.
[01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:29.360]   Where is this Audi?
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:30.360]   There's a big talk about the Audi.
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:31.360]   Oh, you got an Audi.
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:32.360]   I've never seen this car.
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:34.480]   For a long time with the Audi.
[01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:37.280]   It's thought I was driving in Bodega Bay.
[01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:39.120]   It had a beautiful, I have a picture of it.
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:42.280]   A beautiful Google map of me in the Bay.
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:43.280]   In the Bay.
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:44.280]   In the Bay.
[01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:45.280]   Which Audi did you get?
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:46.280]   Oh, very nice one.
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:47.280]   I got to eight.
[01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:48.280]   Eight.
[01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:49.280]   That's the big one.
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:53.080]   I was 125,000 dollars for that car.
[01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:57.280]   I was told that the bigger the numbers, the better the car.
[01:50:57.280 --> 01:50:58.280]   Yeah.
[01:50:58.280 --> 01:50:59.280]   Well, you should have won the A9.
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:00.280]   They don't make a nine.
[01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:01.280]   Well, I asked.
[01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:03.680]   I asked with some more cash.
[01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:06.480]   I said Fritz, I wish to have the nine.
[01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:08.280]   He said, we do not make a nine.
[01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:09.280]   He said nine.
[01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:10.280]   Nine.
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:11.920]   Should have went straight for the R8.
[01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:12.920]   I would have liked it.
[01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:13.920]   On R8.
[01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:14.920]   Look at the R8.
[01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:15.920]   R8.
[01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:17.080]   That's too much car for me.
[01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:19.080]   R32 is four times better.
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:20.080]   The Volkswagen.
[01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:24.760]   He actually tried to get an A8 with a six in it.
[01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:27.600]   So here I am driving down the street of Petaluma.
[01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:30.080]   Although it looks like I am in Bodega Bay.
[01:51:30.080 --> 01:51:31.080]   Mm.
[01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:32.320]   Right in the water.
[01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:33.320]   So I bought it.
[01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:34.320]   So it's Audi dealer.
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:39.760]   And he says, we know there's a problem, but we cannot fix it.
[01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:42.720]   So what are you talking about?
[01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:43.720]   That is a big problem.
[01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:45.440]   Is it going to be in the Bay?
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:47.240]   He said no, and it's no fixed foot.
[01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:50.040]   So then I tweeted it at a Google+ that I use social media.
[01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:51.040]   OK.
[01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:53.040]   And rattled some cages.
[01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:56.600]   And the guy called me and said, I just got a call from Audi America.
[01:51:56.600 --> 01:52:00.760]   They wished me to fix your car.
[01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:01.760]   So they have fixed it.
[01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:02.760]   Just squeaky wheel.
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:05.520]   It's squeaky, but it gets the race.
[01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:09.360]   By the way, they've done something nasty to that car now.
[01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:10.360]   Now what?
[01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:11.360]   Yeah, the guy gets a call from headquarters.
[01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:12.360]   He gets chewed out.
[01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:14.920]   You're going to have something cars going to stink like a fish.
[01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:17.280]   Spitting the ashtray.
[01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:18.920]   I've been cooking my fish in there.
[01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:24.000]   I have the sauerkraut queuing in the glove compartment.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, we do this show, and sometimes we wish we hadn't.
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.440]   But we do do this show every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m.
[01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:30.280]   Pacific, 6 p.m.
[01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:34.000]   Eastern Time 2300 UTC on Twitter.TV.
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:35.880]   Please join us live.
[01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:39.680]   Because if you don't, well, we'll just have to sit here all by ourselves.
[01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:44.680]   On the other hand, like tonight at 1130, tonight is going to be very slow, very quiet,
[01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:47.800]   2.30 Eastern in the morning.
[01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:51.440]   But if you can't watch live, you can get on a man audio and video of every show we do
[01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:52.440]   with Twit.
[01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:59.600]   Just go to twit.tv or your favorite netcast distribution client, iTunes, Stitcher, something
[01:52:59.600 --> 01:53:00.600]   like that, and subscribe.
[01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:01.760]   You get it every week.
[01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:04.080]   If you'd like to be live in a studio, we have a wonderful studio audience.
[01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:06.560]   Thank you for joining us this week.
[01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:08.360]   You can always email tickets at twit.tv.
[01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:09.560]   We'll put a chair out for you.
[01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:11.720]   Put a nice automobile under the chair.
[01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:14.480]   A little hot wheel for you.
[01:53:14.480 --> 01:53:15.480]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:18.720]   And we'll see you next time on another Twit.
[01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:20.360]   I do it like this, right?
[01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:21.760]   Another Twit is in the can.
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:22.760]   Hey, it works.
[01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:23.760]   Hey.
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:24.760]   Thank you very much.
[01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:25.760]   Do it the Twit.
[01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:26.760]   All right.
[01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:27.760]   Do it the Twit, baby.
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:28.760]   Do it the Twit.
[01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:29.760]   All right.
[01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:30.760]   Do it the Twit, baby.
[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:31.760]   Do it the Twit.
[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:32.760]   All right.
[01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:33.760]   Do it the Twit, baby.
[01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:34.760]   All right.
[01:53:34.760 --> 01:53:35.760]   Do it the Twit, baby.
