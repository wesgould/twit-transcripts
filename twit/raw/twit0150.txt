[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   This is Twit, episode 150, our Cescuiset Tenial Edition,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   and joining us today on this Fourth of July Independence Day weekend,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   which is meaningless to everybody except those of us in North.

[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   and above the...anyway.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   It is joining us on the panel today, Jason Calicanis,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   the lovely and talented Mahalo Man.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Hey, Jason.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   How you doing, Leo? Thanks for having me back.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   So glad to get you back on.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   I apologize for the length of time between visits.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   But popular demand has said he has to come back.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   I think the tide has changed since sweat 57.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   It is.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   You know what?
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   People tell me this all the time.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   They said, "Boy, I first hated..."
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   When I first heard Jason on Twit 57, I hated him.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Now I love him.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Right.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   You conscious...
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Typically how my life goes, people are like...
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   They say, "I really enjoy hanging out with you."
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   It's incredible because when I first met you,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   I just thought you were the biggest beep.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   What is that? Why is that?
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Yeah, why is that?
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   I guess my therapist this week was...
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Everybody hate me the first day and then love me the second.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Let's ask Tom Merritt who still hates you.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Tom Merritt from Buzz Out Loud and CNET TV.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Hi, Tom.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Hey, Leo.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   No, I don't hate anybody.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   I was thinking that reminded me of the movie Hancock in reverse though because I love the first half of it but then hated the second.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Oh, I'm disappointed.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   You're like the opposite of Hancock.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   So he starts out as superhero ends up a bum?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Well...
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Or the other way around.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   He liked and unliked of the movie going popular, yeah.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Tom is the host of Buzz Out Loud on CNET TV soon to be the anchor of CBS Evening News.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   No, that would be Molly.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   So it's like that katie character out of there.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Molly may be.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Molly's good.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Love Molly.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   She's out of town, I think, this week.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   That is correct.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   She went to get in line for the iPhone.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   They're lining up already in New Zealand.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Also here from the Houston Chronicle, Mr. Dwight Silverman.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Leo, please, no spoilers on these movies.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I haven't seen either of them.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I haven't either.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   I haven't either.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   So I'm with you on that.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Although my wife hated Wally, she said it was too grim, it was too industrial.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   She wasn't into it.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   And she seems like the only person in the world who hated it.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   A Pixar movie that was grim?
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I know, it doesn't sound right, does it?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   No.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   But she went with her little mentee who's a second grader and she loved it, so there you go.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Grim enough for the second grader.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Hey, how are the Raspberry Crazy Ants in Houston, by the way?
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   We've got them on the run.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   You're winning?
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   We're well-known, but we have a weapon.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   We have a weapon.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   They're too crazy for us.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I think it was 1.43.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.400]   It was the first one I was on and we talked about these Raspberry Crazy Ants, which are
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.760]   these little bizarre ants.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.080]   They don't move in a straight line.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.840]   They move at different angles.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.680]   And they just act crazy and they love electronics.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.160]   They've been crawling into people's computers and anything that has an electronic signal.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.400]   And they've been driving people crazy here.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:22.000]   They can easily take over a house and the EPA gave an emergency approval to a new pesticide
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.120]   for use with them called Fipranil.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.520]   Oh, that's good.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.840]   And so now we have something that can deal with them.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.480]   And when everybody in Houston has four noses, we'll know.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.120]   Well, at least we don't have a Raspberry.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.120]   It is a known carcinogen, but damn it, we'll kill our ants.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.120]   No ants.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.120]   How are you going to kill the ants if you don't use something deadly?
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.120]   I mean, that's the trade on the run.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.360]   But that's right.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.200]   So I haven't seen them except I think maybe several years ago I may have seen them in
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:54.200]   a house I used to own up by the old compact headquarters.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.440]   But they are mostly the southwest part of town.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.160]   Sounds like a haunted house.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.400]   Up by the old compact place.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.120]   It is haunted now.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.120]   Yeah.
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.240]   They moved out a few years back and people say it's haunted.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.240]   That's right.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.240]   The ghost of Eckerd Fiverr, haunted house.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.680]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.360]   So is it deserted, the old compact place?
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.600]   Well actually it's got, you know, it's owned by HP now.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.600]   There are HP signs out there instead of compact signs.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.160]   It's, they moved into about half of the buildings on the campus and they are leasing the others
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.080]   to other businesses out there.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.560]   So there's definitely a reduced presence.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.080]   But you still go out there and it's still called Compact Center Drive.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.080]   Oh, wow.
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.080]   That's for the old timers.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.240]   So it brings a tear to my eye.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.360]   Well now that we're all assembled, let me bring up there.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.560]   You know, this is, this is not a great time of year for tech news.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.760]   Almost everybody's out of town and taking it easy and nobody's, nobody's doing anything
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:59.960]   except for, well, one activist judge who decided that, well, Viacom deserves the IP address
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.160]   of every single person who ever watched a Viacom video on YouTube.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.920]   Is it just a Viacom videos or any video?
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.920]   Well, that's a good question.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.400]   It was 12 terabytes of data.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.400]   Maybe it's everything.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.000]   I think it's everybody else.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.720]   Holy cow.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.840]   That's even worse.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:17.840]   So what's the story here?
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:25.400]   Viacom, Tom here, Viacom sues YouTube for $1 billion, a very nice Dr. Evil number.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.400]   Right.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:32.160]   And then as part of their discovery, they want to show that pirated videos were popular
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.360]   on YouTube because they're trying to make this inducement argument.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.320]   The YouTube is actually encouraging people to use pirated video and building their business
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.320]   on pirated video.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.640]   So they want to show that this idea that people were watching cats on skateboards or
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.240]   whatever is ludicrous and that, you know, that's not what they're there for.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.040]   All the video on YouTube was pirated.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:58.760]   And to do that, they asked for Google to hand over all of this data so that they can
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.280]   comb through it and show what people were watching.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.080]   Now as part of the court order, only outside experts get access to the data.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.520]   Viacom doesn't actually get direct access to the data.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.360]   And they can only use it to prove that one specific fact.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.520]   If they try to use it for any other reason, they'll be held in contempt of court, which
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.040]   disbars their lawyers.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.840]   So there are some good effective restrictions on this, but it's still uncomfortable to think
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:30.600]   that every video that you watched on your IP address is going to be in that box and somebody's
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.280]   going to have access to it.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:38.480]   And Google has asked that it only be allowed to present the viewing data and not necessarily
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.480]   the IPs.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.480]   Yeah, what do you need the IPs for?
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.480]   Yeah, right.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.840]   Oh, no, there's a reason for the IPs.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.800]   I think probably the reason they want that is to see if repeat offenders were allowed to
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:54.280]   just keep uploading stuff, have their accounts disabled, start a new account.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.400]   I think they want to see also if they did enough to protect against it.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:04.120]   And also, they're probably going to just sift through this and look for examples of YouTube
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.440]   doing any kind of curation, any type of interaction.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.240]   That's what's important in this.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.320]   Because if that breaks your DMCA protection.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.360]   Your safe harbor goes away if YouTube has done anything.
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.360]   Right.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:22.800]   So that's why on YouTube, there is only the most commented on, the most viewed, the highest
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.320]   rated as opposed to his curated list by a human.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.960]   If they were to make a list of, here's our top 20 editors picks.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.560]   They would break the DMCA because they would have been editing it.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.560]   Same thing with Wikipedia.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.920]   If the staff of the Wikipedia starts editing it, they lose their DMCA protection.
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:39.920]   Same thing with dig.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:43.480]   If they start editing their homepage, they would lose their DMCA protection.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:48.040]   So all the copyright stuff that goes on on dig or other services like that, once you
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.680]   start editing it, you all of a sudden become liable.
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.680]   Somebody made, I think it was on Friend Feed.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.280]   Somebody made a very good point though.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.680]   Doesn't Google keep pornography very effectively keep pornography off YouTube?
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.000]   With an algorithm.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.040]   So why can't they do that for copyright material?
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.040]   Exactly via Comms Point.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.240]   Well, aren't they doing that for copyright material now?
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.400]   I think all they're doing right now is waiting for a takedown.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.960]   Yeah, I think they take the...
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.960]   They're still doing it.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.960]   They're not doing it.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.960]   No.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.960]   They don't have the hash for the...
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.960]   And remember, this is what...
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:17.960]   We're going to have this hash for copyright material.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:23.960]   I mean, Google had indicated that they were indeed going to run some kind of program that
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.400]   would watch for it and kind of bar it.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.800]   And in fact, they talked quite a bit that this was in the works and they were certain
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.800]   they could do it.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.000]   I haven't seen any announcement that they have.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.160]   Isn't that what killed Napster?
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.960]   Napster never could come up with a way to prevent pirated music from being shared on
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.600]   Napster.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.960]   From what I understand, what Google's allowing people to do is if you become a partner with
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:51.520]   Google's YouTube, this is what I've heard from people who are partners, they will let
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.920]   the partners, I don't think this has ever been come out, but they will let partners go and
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.320]   turn off videos of stuff themselves.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.120]   That themselves.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.400]   So like if basically, and that's their way, it's sort of a little heavy handed.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.360]   It's like, if you do a deal with us, we'll let you take it down.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.240]   If you don't do a deal with us, you have to file DMCA stuff.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:15.600]   So it's a pretty clever way to get people to sign up to be partners, which is you want
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.960]   your South Park stuff taken down to become a partner.
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.840]   Well, let's put that up and you can go take it down yourself.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.120]   We're a partner with Google.
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.120]   We have a.
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.920]   They're used in Chronicle.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:30.040]   Yeah, we have a director's account and we work, you know, we have worked with them.
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.880]   We've not been offered anything like that.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:36.720]   In fact, in there have been some situations where we have had videos we put up that have
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:42.080]   had background music that's copyrighted that they have taken down because the for us, they
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.680]   don't ask us to.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:48.880]   They just do it because it has copyrighted music in the background.
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:53.040]   Well, it seems like Google, you know, the EFF was very upset.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:58.200]   The Electronic Frontier Foundation about this judge, was it Stratton Stenten's willingness
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.520]   to give over this information?
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.800]   But that sounds like it's pretty well protected.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:07.440]   Google kind of got itself into this mess by asserting in other areas, particularly when
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.280]   they're talking about AdSense that the IP address isn't personal information, you know, because
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:16.600]   they log IP addresses when you use Google search and they're saying in their AdSense
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.080]   pages, oh, well, don't worry because that's not personal information.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.560]   That's not exactly personal.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.720]   I mean, it's not, you know, phone number, it's not your social security number.
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.800]   It's the phone number for a large house you live in.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.520]   Anybody could be at that IP address, not just you.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.080]   So I mean, I think in some ways, it's just logic anyway.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.080]   You know what I mean, sad.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:41.120]   In some ways they kind of did this to themselves by asserting that the IP address wasn't private.
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.720]   So now what's the judge going to do?
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.720]   The judge is going to say, well, okay, if it's not personal information, I guess we can
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.720]   hand it over.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:54.600]   Well, remember back in 2006 when the feds wanted some detailed search information as
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.840]   they were trying to reopen the decency case?
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:00.840]   Right.
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.600]   They had lost and Google wound up having to turn it over, but I don't--
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.240]   They fought it though, as I remember.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:11.240]   They fought it tooth and nail and other search engines did not.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.240]   Right.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.840]   Everybody else caved and Google fought.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.880]   And at the time we were very complimentary of Google, even though they lost.
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.920]   Yes, they did end up losing, but I don't know exactly what they wound up giving them.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:27.160]   I don't think they necessarily had to give them everything that the feds initially wanted
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.160]   in the form they wanted.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.160]   Yeah, I already--
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.600]   It was a reduced request that they ended up agreeing to, but you're right.
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.040]   I don't remember exactly what it was.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:38.120]   Well, in this case, it's 12 terabytes of data.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:44.560]   And I think Google should just print it all out and hand over books of this data.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.200]   So you want to hear.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.480]   That's about the equivalent to the Library of Congress.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.480]   And after you--
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.080]   And you take a couple of those cartons that they use for the data centers that they want
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.080]   to drop around the streets.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.080]   Yeah, the box is the data center is coming.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.080]   Yeah.
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.080]   Just print out.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.080]   Yeah, you don't have to bind them.
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.920]   Just do it on the fanfold.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:04.080]   That's the equivalent of paying a multimillion dollar judgment in pennies.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.560]   Yeah, you're right, exactly.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.560]   I don't think you'll do it.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.000]   I'd be able to be held in contempt of court for that.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.480]   I don't think they'll do it.
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:16.360]   Not to mention the trees that would go away.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:20.280]   Danny Sullivan of Search Engine land-- Danny's, I think, pretty good on this subject.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:25.320]   Said, "I hope this ruling serves as a flashpoint or a wake-up call to a variety of people
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.920]   who can make a national privacy standard a reality."
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:32.840]   He's using this as a call to Congress to say, "Look, we've got to protect privacy.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.720]   These things are too easy to give out.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.280]   People are logging it."
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:40.240]   And look, here's somebody who-- I mean, I don't think it's going to have that impact,
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.360]   but it could have easily had that impact.
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.360]   I agree.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.760]   I think that's really the point here is not that anybody isn't too much danger from this.
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.320]   There's a lot of restrictions that are very serious restrictions on what this data can
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.600]   be used for.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.920]   But it does give you pause, especially when you consider that those restrictions might
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.880]   not have been put in place by another judge.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.720]   And data has a way of finding its way out of restrictions that it's in.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:09.040]   So without any other regulation-- and I'm not really in favor of regulation much-- but
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:14.240]   without any kind of guidance, we know that judges aren't always up to speed on these
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.240]   issues.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.720]   We kind of need some sort of standard.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.800]   Like, this amount of data is OK.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:25.280]   This amount of data is questionable, and this amount of data is not OK.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:31.520]   It reminds me of the way AOL handed over, quote, "anonymize search results to researchers
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.200]   last year."
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.920]   And I don't remember what reporter it was.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.400]   Just went through the data and found one of the women.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.280]   And tracked her down and say, "Oh, these are your search results.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.280]   Oh, yeah."
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.280]   Yeah, just for some social engineering.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.280]   That was the tip of the iceberg.
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:51.440]   I mean, they also found, like, murder my wife, you know, like, and then the other 20 searches
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.440]   that the person did.
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.440]   So it's like--
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.480]   Do a search for their wife's name, then they do search out of murder.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.240]   They literally found those kinds of murder in there.
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.240]   Exactly.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.320]   And actually, there's been a number of cases now where they've gone and got people search
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:09.760]   logs from their computers, their history, their drop down form information, and found
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:15.320]   them searching for cyanide or ways to, you know, kill people, methods for killing people.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.840]   Your search logs tell you a lot about you.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.840]   Oh, yes.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.720]   I think what's going to happen is a lot of these companies are going to come to the
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.400]   point where they go, "You know what?
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:28.480]   The cost of having this stuff is greater than the benefit to the business, and they'll do
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.800]   it what Wikipedia did, but for different reasons.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.760]   Wikipedia doesn't have log files because there's so much traffic that they don't want
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.280]   burden of storing them.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.920]   So they turned it off.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:43.240]   And when I was at the hacking days, like two years ago, a lot of the hackers, you know,
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.120]   who sort of work on the servers and stuff like that were like, "Let's not turn it back
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.120]   on."
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.120]   Right.
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.120]   And it wasn't for technical reasons.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.120]   Privacy.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.320]   They basically were privacy cuts, and they were like, "Let's just not have log files."
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.920]   And it's sort of really cool libertarian concept.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.760]   Who's the first-end search engine?
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:01.640]   Maybe you'll do this, Jason, just step forward and say we're not going to keep logs of your
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:05.360]   searches, because that is a competitive advantage against Google.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.520]   The only problem is, I mean, I think we would do that pretty easily.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:14.080]   The problem is if you're partners with Google and you have AdSense on it, anyway, they're
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.080]   doing it anyway.
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:20.760]   I mean, the other way you could do it is just empower people to encrypt, you know?
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:26.120]   Well, or if you use a meta search like Dogpile or Metacrawler of Uzi, doesn't that, does
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.120]   that anonymous?
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.120]   Nope.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.120]   It doesn't?
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.760]   No, because they're, what they're doing is they're, in most of those cases, they're
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.640]   just doing tests and stuff like, they're just passing it along.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.680]   In some cases, I think they might do the searches and then serve it back to you, so
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:38.680]   it would go through their IP.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.240]   But I mean, a lot of what's going to happen is a lot of people are going to go to stuff
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.240]   like Tor, T-O-R.
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.880]   The onion router, this is an on-liser.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:46.880]   Yeah.
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.240]   So, yeah, TorProject.org.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.040]   And I tried it a couple of times, it really slows down your problem.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.040]   That's the problem.
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.040]   Surfing.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.040]   That's the problem.
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.760]   It also messes with your, because it goes through a proxy.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.600]   If you're watching anything that's US-
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.400]   Hulu won't let you use it.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:05.040]   Yeah, you'll probably not be on a US proxy, although you might luck in to being able
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.640]   to watch BBC content by accident.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:14.720]   It needs to be a Tor that is run by a professional company where I can pay $10 or $50 a year
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.440]   and just, it goes fast and logs.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.720]   I mean, there's got to be some of those anonymous services that Al-Qaeda are using and all
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.720]   these kind of people.
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.720]   Why don't they have-
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.800]   What was that service, Leo, that they used to be for pay that we talked about on the
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:26.960]   screen savers all the time?
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.320]   Hot spot, like you can use it.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.320]   It was anonomiser.com.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.320]   Anonomiser.
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.320]   And they stopped doing it.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.160]   And then there was the freedom something.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.160]   And that was, no, they're gone.
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.160]   They were using an interesting technique.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.200]   Patrick was really into this.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.400]   They used these little tokens.
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.120]   I never really was satisfied that it was completely anonymous.
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.160]   You know who is running a private Tor server, I think?
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:53.440]   There's a company out of Sweden, although they're moving to the Bay Area called Ubico.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.760]   We interviewed them on security now.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:03.640]   They make a single sign on USB key and they are using it with a private Tor server.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:08.360]   The problem with a private Tor server is, you know, it kind of defeats the idea.
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:12.720]   The Tor server, the whole idea of a Tor server is your traffic is routed through numerous
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:17.600]   anonymous servers and anonymous locations and so very difficult to track.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.480]   It's no longer the onion router at that point.
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.480]   It's the banana router.
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.120]   You've only got one feel.
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.200]   One feel and you're in.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.880]   But for something like video, I mean, doesn't that just render it almost unwatchable?
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:28.880]   Well, it does.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:29.880]   It's too slow.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:33.680]   So I guess my question is ultimately it's also inconvenient.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.200]   It all slows you down.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.240]   Aren't people, wasn't, was it Scott McNeely?
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.840]   Isn't he ultimately right?
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.720]   Get over privacy is dead.
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.360]   They're just going to use Google.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:50.560]   They're going to just swallow it and say, eh, and do what's convenient.
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.920]   I think there'll be a certain group of people who are always going to worry about their
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.920]   privacy down to the nth degree.
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:01.680]   But yeah, I think generally, you know, you think your readers even know about it?
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.600]   No, no.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.160]   I try to talk about it on the radio show.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.920]   No, they don't care.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:08.920]   You can get them a little.
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.600]   So it's also a generational thing.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:15.120]   I think younger web users care less about it than older ones do.
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:19.000]   Yeah, younger people are just kind of said, they're just, you know, living with it.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.600]   They're they're fatalistic about it.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.640]   They don't, you know, that's the way it is.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.040]   Well, and there may be some benefits to it.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:29.240]   There may be some benefits to socially to not being boring about it.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.520]   Google web history is great.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:39.640]   And then when I signed up for who is he, you know, that site, W H O I S I dot com, it's
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.640]   kind of a neat idea.
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.440]   They use the Google social graph.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.680]   You log you log in with your Google account.
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.720]   All of a sudden they know everything you've done and they can build this social graph
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.720]   with you.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.720]   Try it right now.
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.520]   W H O I S I dot com do it.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:56.720]   It's like a Google search for your social networking.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:03.720]   And but the but it works really well because it just knows it was I who is I who is I who
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:07.440]   is I who is he hate these names who is you have.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.440]   Well, they're running out of them.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.320]   That's why every all the good names are gone.
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.840]   Everybody watching the Twit live stream is going there.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.840]   I can't get to it.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:14.840]   It is.
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:15.840]   You know what?
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:16.840]   We just slammed it.
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:17.840]   Right.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.240]   We used to have that problem on the screensavers.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.800]   You couldn't you couldn't mention a site.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.960]   We had to like keep the links off the website.
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:24.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.680]   And that people would tell after the show was over.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.960]   There used to be a website called all the good names are taken dot com.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.480]   But I think it's taken.
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.320]   It's a squatter.
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.320]   It is.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.120]   It's a squatter now.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.640]   That's so sad.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.160]   Prices for domain names are out of control.
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.840]   What's the most you've heard of?
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:50.640]   Oh, there are multiple ones going for over a million dollars right now on a regular basis.
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:55.600]   I just got offered server.com for 2.5 million.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:03.360]   If somebody if somebody is a pruder recruiter recruiter recruiter inheritance 600,000.
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.680]   I have I'm reading from an email.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:09.960]   It's I buy domains and so they email me when you know like early on.
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.400]   So there's you're on a list with these domain squatting companies and they'll they'll offer
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.280]   us it is domain brokers brokers.
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.920]   They're not they're not squatters.
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:17.920]   They're brokers.
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:18.920]   So these guys are.
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.080]   You can go buy your own TLD pretty soon.
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.080]   You don't need to pay them.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.080]   Yeah, what's that all about?
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.800]   You could get dot merit right.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:31.080]   Dot com probably couldn't somebody else can get Tom dot merit.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.080]   What is how does that work?
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.400]   You can get any arbitrary dot level domain.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.120]   Yeah, that's the deal.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:39.720]   They I can't improve the system where if you have the technical capacity and the ability
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:44.840]   to pay several hundred thousand euros, you can operate your own T top level domain.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:45.840]   They want euros.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.920]   Could I not give them dollars instead?
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.360]   You can give them, you have to give them a lot more dollars.
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.600]   Don't take American pesos.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.120]   You just have to translate over to your.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:57.280]   Just read that Gazelle Bünchen will no longer accept dollars for walking the runway.
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.640]   You have to pay her in euros.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:59.640]   There you go.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.200]   That's a sign of the time.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.640]   I don't want a dollar.
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.800]   So it's no good.
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:07.320]   I give me to your house, please.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.480]   No dollars for me.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.760]   In fact, apparently into like Park Avenue and some fancy stores now.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:15.160]   They're starting to take euros instead of dollars.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.160]   It's the end of days.
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.160]   It is.
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.160]   Over to Jason.
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:22.720]   Hello, Los Angeles Times cuts 250 jobs, 150 from their newsroom.
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.160]   What about the, do I, what do you, did you read that?
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.960]   It's a real thing going on with it.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.680]   Was it the Miami Herald where some interns said it's over?
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.680]   Let's we're giving up.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:31.960]   Yeah, that was at the Tampa Tribune.
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:32.960]   Tampa Tribune.
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:38.920]   Yeah, the Tampa Tribune, an intern by the name of, I think your name was Jessica De Silva
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:44.920]   was in the newsroom when the editor came in and did a session with the staff in which
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:49.880]   she explained the layoffs and one by one went over each person and said why that person
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.880]   was gone.
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:51.880]   Don't need you.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:58.640]   And then, and then she said, you know, and then she said that this was kind of the kicker
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:05.840]   was that they needed to quit thinking of the newspapers website as an adjunct that now
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:09.360]   the print edition was the adjunct to the website.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.360]   Yikes.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.360]   Yeah, of course.
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.360]   Right.
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:16.640]   You know, she essentially kind of set out loud what everybody, I think, in the industry
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:20.160]   knows, but you know, none of the big execs are saying.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.160]   And that's true.
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.800]   I mean, we're at the Chronicle.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.960]   We're starting to treat it like that.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:29.640]   We do news for the web first and then for the print edition.
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:33.240]   Jessica's actually now the superstar at the Tampa Tribune.
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.240]   She is.
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.240]   She is.
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:42.080]   Although, you know what happened is she, someone posted her a link to her post on Romanesco
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:48.880]   which is the, which is the pointer site that has all the media gossip on it.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:53.640]   And she was kind of savaged by a lot of the old, the old timers who basically said, yeah,
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.080]   you know, you, you don't get it.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.320]   You just wait two year older and then you understand.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.320]   You're going punks.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.320]   Yeah.
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.320]   I never understand.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.320]   Well, what's it like at the, at the Chronicle?
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:05.960]   I mean, is it, is the writing on the wall?
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.760]   The writing has been on the wall for a while.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.080]   We are in a lot better shape because we're not a public company.
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:14.080]   We're owned by Hearst, which is privately held.
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:18.440]   And so we kind of don't have the stockholder pressure that a lot of the others do.
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:24.360]   Hearst is also very progressive in, in this regard and as, you know, has been pushing
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:28.840]   its, its newspapers for some time to get more onto the web.
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:34.560]   And we're doing, you know, in terms of blogging, we're probably one of the most active papers
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.880]   on the web doing it.
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:40.080]   Although it's, you know, even if you're aggressive with it, you know, the San Francisco Chronicle
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.000]   is, is continues to struggle out there.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.920]   And you know, it's, it's, it's a really hard environment to do to be a traditional newspaper.
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.200]   What do you think about blogging for newspapers?
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.400]   Because we have this conversation on Buzz out loud.
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:58.920]   It's seen at a lot about whether you're some places just do blogging because they think
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:02.360]   it's cool and it ends up not doing them any good.
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:05.000]   And really blogging is just a content management system.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.200]   It's just a way to publish.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.200]   How do you guys use that?
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.200]   I'm curious.
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:12.600]   We, we, well, we've been doing it since about 2004.
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:16.640]   And we, we use it essentially as another, you're right.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:21.360]   We use it as a way to publish the news that the benefit to it is, is that we get conversations
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.880]   going about our, our blog entries.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.760]   We also have comments under every story now.
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:30.120]   And so every story essentially becomes almost like a blog.
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:34.280]   And one of the things that it's happened, I know I have a, I have the technology blog
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:38.560]   at the Chronicle is that the kind of things I write about and the kind of things I think
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:45.280]   about have changed because of the people I interact with almost instantly when I, when
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:49.240]   I post something it, it's changed the way we think about the news definitely.
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.760]   And all of us in New Media have been aware of that for ages.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.280]   I mean, that's the way it is.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:59.680]   But it's got to be, it's a, it's a real challenge for old school reporters and anchors on TV
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:03.720]   and, and, and hosts because they never had anybody talk back to them.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:10.160]   So what's interesting is, is that you get people who kind of were not into it, didn't
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.680]   want to do it, had to be dragged to it.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:18.000]   And most journalists, I think like hearing from their readers.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.440]   I mean, most journalists do not want to just write and not have any feedback.
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:26.200]   And to get it instantly can be quite a rush.
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:31.000]   And we have people who were, you know, who were resistant to it, who now are addicted
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   to it.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   Yeah, I think that's what happens.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.520]   Basically, I know like, if you look at Saul Hansel from the New York Times, really smart
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.520]   guy, I've known him for over 10 years.
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:45.600]   And I told him three years ago when we were at CES with Engadget that he would be doing
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.920]   it and he was like, no, no way.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.360]   And now he's doing it and he loves it.
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:52.520]   But then you look at something like John Markoff from the New York Times, I saw him at the
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:55.360]   Wall Street Journal Deconference and I said, I told you you'd be blogging.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:59.320]   And he said only under duress, you know, which is funny because John's been covering technology
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.320]   longer than anybody.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.320]   Right.
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.320]   But he likes the long form.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.520]   And it's basically, you know, you're taking people who are marathon runners and saying,
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:06.920]   okay, now you're a sprinter.
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.000]   And some people are just like, no, sprinting is stupid.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   Just personality.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   Yep.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   It's a personality difference.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:20.320]   What we do is we tell our writers to use their blogs to do their print job.
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:28.440]   In other words, you know, when I went to cover Mackerel this year, the blog post that I did,
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:33.120]   the Twitter posts became almost a notebook for what I would then take and do as a column
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.560]   or a print item.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:40.600]   And if you take it and integrate it into your workflow, it works great.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.760]   You know, John hasn't gotten there yet.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.160]   Saul has.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:48.760]   I think if John kind of lets himself go, what I tell reporters who are resistant is that
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:49.760]   you can't hold back.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.560]   It's like a love affair.
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:54.960]   You got to throw yourself into it with wild abandon.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:55.960]   That's the only way to do it.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:56.960]   You're cheating on the newspaper, but it's okay.
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.760]   I let myself go years ago and it's been great.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:00.760]   Yeah.
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:03.760]   Just that's the only way to do it.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.360]   Well, I like the way you put it.
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:11.360]   Is that this is this is not sloppy journalism because that's a lot of the attitude you get
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.760]   from from the older crowd who's against Blo that go.
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.680]   It's not get it's not checking your sources.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.160]   It's printing rumors.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.680]   It's not paying attention.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.680]   That's not it at all.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.720]   You know, Jason kind of hit it on the it's the sprinting.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:26.080]   It's like getting stuff out there and the responsible journalists are going to be the
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:30.320]   better bloggers because they will be careful to say like, you know, this is alleged and
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:34.480]   this isn't quite known yet, but they're still getting that information out there.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:40.400]   And the idea of people being able to see journalism in the process and journalists, like you say,
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.360]   being able to get that feedback instantly is invaluable.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.080]   As we're seeing it's totally changing the game.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.080]   Yeah.
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.080]   But not all of them like it.
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:52.360]   I mean, a lot of them are like fought to not have comments underneath their stories on
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:57.520]   the New York Times, and a lot of find it extremely annoying that they have to, you know, actually
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:58.520]   respond to people.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:02.000]   And if you think about their lives just five or ten years ago was like, if you want to
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.080]   communicate with the New York Times writer, you can call the switchboard, leave a voicemail
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.080]   because none of them pick up their phone.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:11.240]   Or you can write a letter to the editor, in which case, in both cases, you're a cooke.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.320]   You're a look, you know, like, oh, you're one of those people who writes letters to
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.320]   newspapers and journalists.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.320]   Exactly.
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.320]   You're a man.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.320]   Right.
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:19.320]   It's a conservative.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.800]   Writing a comment is your concern citizen.
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.800]   You're interactive.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:26.800]   Oh, you're also a cooke or a flame-bater, a troll, but you can be both accepted.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.680]   It's just writing the comment itself doesn't make you that.
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.680]   It's what you're right.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:31.680]   Right.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.680]   No, but writing a letter to the editor, you're a cooke.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:37.360]   Anybody in the old days, like the person who writes a letter to a magazine or something
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.120]   or to a newspaper, that was a cookey behavior.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:43.160]   My dad just got published for the second time in the New Yorker letter to the editors.
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.160]   And you're right.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.160]   He's a cooke.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.120]   So we're going to take a little break here when we come back.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.800]   Let's talk about voicemail.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.000]   Mike Arrington says voicemail is dead.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   Get over it.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.720]   Dwight, you had something to say about that.
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.200]   Do you still use voicemail?
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.440]   What is the future of voicemail?
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.880]   Is it going the way of the newspaper?
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:00.960]   I don't know.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.760]   But first I want to talk a little bit about one of our sponsors.
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.440]   Go to meeting.
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:11.240]   Go to meeting is a great product from the folks at Citrix, people who do go to my PC, which
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:16.400]   is an excellent remote access program, they've taken go to my PC and they've made it so that
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:20.160]   you can now hold online meetings.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.160]   This is great.
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:25.360]   I mean, especially in the days where air travel is no fun anymore, who wants to take
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:29.000]   off their shoes, sit in the middle seat, just go all, you know, I just did it.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.640]   You fly across the country for a couple of hour meeting and you fly all the way back.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:33.880]   That's nuts.
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:36.440]   Even driving across town for a 10 minute meeting is crazy.
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:40.080]   That's why more and more people are looking to go to meeting.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:44.800]   It allows you to hold a meeting anywhere, multiple participants, anywhere in the world.
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.240]   All you do is you could set it up ahead of time or you could do it even while you're
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.400]   in a meeting on the phone.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.880]   You just a couple of clicks of the mass at go to meeting.com.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.000]   You give them the meeting ID.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.520]   They go to go to meeting.com and all of a sudden they're seeing your computer desktop
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.080]   on their computer screen.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.520]   So if you're doing a PowerPoint, you could show them the PowerPoint, you could show them
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:07.080]   spreadsheets, diagrams, websites, whatever it is you're talking about, I should probably
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:08.080]   use it for the show.
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.280]   You could just pop up these pages and they could see it.
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.640]   Not only that, they can collaborate with you on documents.
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:15.280]   You could even give them control.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.640]   It's great for training for that reason.
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.040]   You could say, here's how you use our new program.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.720]   And then now you try it and you can watch them work with it.
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:22.720]   It is really amazing.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:27.080]   I want you to try it free for 30 days, a month of unlimited online meetings.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:31.720]   This is a, I know it's, you know, I got to warn you, you're going to get hooked.
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:32.720]   But you're fine out.

[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.040]   No more travel.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:54.000]   No more taking off your shoes.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   You're going to love it.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.320]   Go, I just, I stay here all the time.
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:57.320]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:01.200]   So it's not just about anymore like going to your PC.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.040]   This is like you can actually host a meeting here.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.040]   Oh yeah.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:06.200]   Well, I can host it and you could host it and we could share.
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.560]   I could say, okay, let me show you Jason's screen and back and forth.
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:10.640]   I do these all the time actually.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.640]   It's really fun.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.640]   I do these lectures with it, which is kind of fun too.
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.240]   Because you could do large meetings.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.240]   Very fun.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.240]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.480]   We thank them for their support of this week in tech.
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.680]   Well, you compare the prices to like flying right now.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.480]   I don't know if you've flown recently.
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.280]   I just, oh my God.
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.680]   Well, don't carry any bags first of all.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.080]   They charge you for bags.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:34.080]   But you know what's interesting?
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.440]   JetBlue is still cheap, right?
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.200]   And I asked somebody and they said, well, that's because they hedged.
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.280]   They hedged their oil.
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:40.280]   They hedged their oil.
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.280]   They bought oil at lower prices.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.680]   They locked it in for a year or two.
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.200]   And so South West did the same thing.
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.080]   The only problem is I went on JetBlue.
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:53.880]   They wanted like $500 one way for coach and for a job.
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:54.880]   It's something similar.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:59.120]   And I was like a United and it's like a thousand to go across a country.
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:05.000]   I was getting round trip to New York for $99 each way, $150 each way.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   Any more.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   Holy.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Any more.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.560]   This is like, you know what?
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:10.560]   That's the point.
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:14.760]   I should just go to go get it and go to eating and just go to eating 50 bucks.
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.800]   Why don't you have a jet?
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:17.800]   I'm working on a kid.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:18.800]   I'm working.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:21.240]   You were watching Wimbledon earlier, weren't you?
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.240]   Yes.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.240]   Did they have a net jet?
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:25.320]   Yeah, we had net jet ads all over that.
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:26.320]   Really no kidding.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.320]   Yeah.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.320]   You want to talk about people suffering.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:32.360]   There's a lot of rich people with jets who are suffering right now that oiled boss went
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.360]   way up.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.680]   Oh, you thought it was a good idea.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:38.760]   You thought you were rich till you said to buy your own gas hand over the credit card.
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.840]   You know, actually, don't you pull up and you hand over the credit card at the pump,
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:42.840]   even with a jet?
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.840]   It's the same thing.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.840]   You give them a credit card and they say, how much will that be?
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:48.320]   Well, I only have 50,000 on the card.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.600]   So don't fill it up.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.600]   Just stop at 50,000.
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:51.600]   It's unbelievable.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.600]   The price.
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.560]   I mean, we got a serious, well, I don't want to bum everybody out, but this is going
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:56.960]   to be a serious recession.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:57.960]   That's what I think.
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:58.960]   Just the oil price alone.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.680]   I mean, oil and the lack of safety.
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:01.680]   There's a new website.
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.680]   Take a look at this.
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:03.680]   Mygallons.com.
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:08.240]   Somebody sent me a link to this where you can buy gas now.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:11.920]   The current prices, again, you're hedging that the prices are going to go up.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:12.920]   What do you call that?
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.720]   Selling shorter long.
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.720]   You go long on gas, right?
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:21.000]   No, long would mean that you want to hold the investment for a long time.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   You expected to go up.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.600]   Short would be, you think it's going to go down.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.360]   So it's basically a hedge.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.360]   It's a hedge.
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.120]   You're locking in a price for some period of time.
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:35.760]   And then you buy a hundred gallons at the current price, whatever that is, or a thousand
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.720]   gallons.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:41.120]   And then you get a credit card that you can use at the pump.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.120]   It's an interesting idea.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.120]   I don't mean...
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.120]   The current price in what area?
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.120]   Well, I don't know.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.120]   I haven't signed up.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.760]   In southern Missouri or San Francisco.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:48.920]   There's a big difference, isn't there?
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.440]   It's going to be five bucks in San Francisco in a week or two.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.840]   It's getting real close to me.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:58.800]   Every time I say this, though, you know, listeners all over the world, our European
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.400]   listeners say, "What are you guys crazy?
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.240]   We're paying the equivalent of $17 a gallon."
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:07.480]   Yeah, I think somebody on a clerk was saying it was $10 a gallon in England right now.
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.480]   They buy the leader, but whatever.
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:11.240]   Someone affordable.
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:14.520]   So is that because we're subsidizing gas or they have more taxes?
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.520]   Why is that?
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:16.520]   They have huge tax.
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:17.520]   It's just tax.
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:21.000]   I have a good idea, though, how to solve this problem.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   What's that?
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   I don't know.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   I've been thinking about something.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   Let's take over Kuwait.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   No, I got a great idea.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.800]   We should charge people $10,000 to have a license plate that allows you to go up to
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.400]   100 miles an hour, right?
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.040]   Because they already do this anyway.
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.040]   There's like...
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.040]   Says Mr. Tesla.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.680]   No, no, no, I'm serious.
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:40.000]   This is how they do another parts of the world.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.080]   So they should offer people who want to drive faster the ability to buy these license plates,
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.080]   right?
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:47.200]   Because there's a thing here in California with the California Highway Patrol, you can
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.720]   donate $10,000 and you get this license plate.
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:52.680]   Basically, if you get pulled over in your Ferrari, they let you go.
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:53.680]   Wow.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:54.680]   It's an insider thing.
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:55.680]   Where do you get that?
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:56.680]   It's...
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:00.720]   I'll find the URL and I'll post it, but it's something about the California Highway Patrol
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:03.760]   and they're like benevolent fund for like, you know, offices or...
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.760]   Colleen says it's the CHP 1199 Foundation.
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:07.760]   That's exactly what it's called.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:08.760]   It's a California only.
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:09.760]   And so a bunch of my friends have...
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:10.760]   That actually works?
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:13.960]   Yes, I have friends who have Lamborghinis and Ferraris and what's...
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:15.520]   That's criminal.
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.160]   And you pay 10 grand at work.
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.840]   It worked before the show.
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:19.840]   So anyway...
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.280]   Good, I want to stop right now.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.280]   That's criminal.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.840]   It's my idea, Leo.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.840]   Make it...
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:26.840]   So it's happening anyway.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:31.960]   So anyway, make it legal, take the $10,000 and all that money goes towards solar power
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:34.560]   and electric car subsidies.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:39.120]   So basically you take the people who want to spend that money and have them subsidize
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:44.040]   electric cars for people who can't afford them or whatever.
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.440]   It's going to cost a lot more than $10,000 a license plate.
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.440]   Do you still get that?
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:51.280]   No, I mean, you might have a hundred miles an hour to make it an impact.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.280]   It could be 10...
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.280]   Yeah, but it could be millions of dollars.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:56.400]   So you just give everybody who buys a Prius, you know, $1,000 back.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.440]   You give anybody who buys an electric car $5,000 back.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:02.080]   I mean, it's going to be an incentive.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.080]   I mean...
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.440]   Speaking of the electric cars, here's the thing I hear.
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:11.800]   Every time the electric car comes up from the bunkers is that the total cost of ownership
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.800]   argument, the total cost of the...
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.440]   Total cost to the environment because of the sink and all this stuff.
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.680]   The batteries and the battery disposal.
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.480]   Do you all know anything about that?
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.480]   Is that bunk?
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.480]   Is that true?
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.480]   Is that something to be worried about?
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:24.480]   Is it bunk really, Jason?
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:28.720]   Because I thought the manufacture of these batteries was so toxic and the chemicals you
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.920]   need and the zinc you need is so horrible.
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:31.920]   No.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:32.920]   No?
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.960]   These are lasting for a long time now.
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.200]   And they're just not that damaging.
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.200]   I've read about this stuff.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.480]   I have that documentary.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.480]   Who killed the electric car?
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.680]   I have it at home.
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:43.960]   I haven't watched it yet, but supposedly that's the thing to watch.
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.040]   I haven't seen it either.
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:47.960]   But no, that's all bunk.
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.320]   And the cost of these things is going down dramatically.
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.320]   And I mean, we have batteries all over the place.
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.520]   They're just laptop batteries.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.520]   So...
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:58.040]   Are those studies just overestimating the cost of disposal then?
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:59.040]   Or are they just done by...
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.320]   I've never seen any of these studies.
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.320]   I just know that from...
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:02.320]   I've heard of them.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.640]   Yeah, I haven't seen them either.
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.200]   That's just like...
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:08.360]   That's like one of those right wing like, "Oh, but then you have to dispose of the batteries."
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:12.200]   Like, trust me, building an engine and all that other stuff that goes into a car that
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:15.080]   doesn't go into an electric car, that's a lot bigger of a footprint.
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:17.760]   I mean, these electric cars have very little in them, you know?
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.320]   They don't need a combustion engine.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:23.520]   Well, right now, the electric's like the Tesla you're talking about, right?
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:24.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:26.080]   That doesn't need a combustion engine at all.
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:29.640]   In five years, you're going to have 20 different full electric choices.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:34.120]   And they're all going to be able to charge 100 miles plus on one charge.
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:37.360]   And you're going to be able to buy these things, put solar panels in your roof and be totally
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.360]   off the grid.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.360]   It's...
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:44.160]   I think we're going to solve this problem really quickly, since there's the will by the people.
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:47.640]   I wish we'd get up to speed on the solar panels.
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:51.920]   It seems like it's so close to breaking through and becoming something, but there's a little
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:54.520]   bit of a return problem.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.960]   They're still not quite turning around the amount of power that you'd like to really put
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.840]   more of the top and there's a higher efficiency.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.440]   It's a best-spence problem of getting into it.
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.080]   But man, we're so close.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:09.320]   Once they start returning a little more efficiency and once they start either subsidizing or
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:13.600]   giving grants or something to get them on top of houses and buildings, I think it could
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:14.600]   be a huge benefit.
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:21.840]   Well, there's a company called SolarCity, which is doing incredibly well that they are
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.200]   doing the financial arbitrage.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.440]   You can put solar panels on your house for free.
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:31.000]   You can use your electric bill and you basically just pay them back over 20 or 30 years for
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   putting them up there.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.760]   Plus interest, so they make money on it.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.360]   Yes, so it's basically SolarCity's doing the last mile.
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:40.640]   They basically are an installation company that don't make the panels.
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.640]   But I met the CEO of the company and he said...
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.640]   I've actually read about that.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:44.640]   That's a neat idea.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:49.320]   They're so backed up that they can't keep up with the amount of people who want it.
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.760]   It's basically solar leasing.
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:56.640]   You lease the solar stuff, your electric bill goes down and then they're just doing the
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:57.640]   financial arbitrage.
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:03.000]   But they got like some hundreds of millions of dollars in a line of credit or something
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.400]   from some big institutionally mortgage down.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:10.200]   If you're investing right now, would investing in these kinds of green technologies be a
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:12.360]   good place to put your money?
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.360]   They're not public, it's the problem.
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.360]   They're all private.
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:18.440]   So if you watch the PCs, they're all putting tons of money into this stuff.
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:19.440]   So I think it would be.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.440]   They think so.
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.440]   Yeah, PCs, yeah.
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:24.800]   They're long.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:27.880]   Let's talk about voicemail because Mike Harrington wrote an interest.
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:29.800]   Y'all read that article and Mike Harrington wrote it.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.640]   "The voicemail is dead.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:33.640]   Stop using it."
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:37.680]   Maybe I should ask it because you actually wrote a response to it.
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:40.880]   What does Mike have against voicemail?
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:46.480]   Well, I think like all of us, it's kind of an irritating form of communication.
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:51.280]   I actually, to a certain extent, agree with a lot of his post in which he talked about
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:54.520]   how inefficient and irritating it can be.
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:55.720]   It seems like it's efficient.
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:57.800]   It's much more efficient than taking a call.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:58.800]   Well, it depends.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.360]   It's more efficient than taking a call.
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:06.000]   It's not more efficient than email or say Twitter or even instant message, which can
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.600]   be intrusive.
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:14.320]   But in terms of the time it takes to get the information, punching it in, sitting and listening
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:19.080]   to the information, coming back to it, it's inefficient.
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:22.520]   What about visual voicemail with the iPhone, that kind of thing?
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:24.920]   Doesn't that make it pretty usable?
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:30.920]   Well, it gives you more information, but it doesn't give you what the whole message is.
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:34.760]   You still have to end up going back and listening to it.
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:41.280]   And what Mike Harrington said essentially was that tell everybody to stop using it.
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:44.360]   It's not useful anymore in today's day and age.
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:50.080]   But the problem is that mainstream business America uses it.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:53.640]   It may be falling out of favor in Mike Harrington's crowd.
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:57.560]   But I'll tell you what, you couldn't do business in the oil and gas industry here in Houston
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:58.560]   without voicemail.
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.280]   Isn't it funny for a while people?
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:06.600]   I remember old-timers saying, in fact, a certain old-timer named John C. Devorak doesn't
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:07.600]   have voicemail.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:13.560]   "I don't need voicemail, I'll answer the phone or I won't, but I don't need voicemail."
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:18.720]   And I remember very well a lot of people hating voicemail, hating answering machines specifically.
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:21.120]   And then it became the thing, if you didn't have an answering machine, you really were
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.680]   a doddering old nutball.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.800]   And now it's going the other way again.
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:28.160]   Well, it's like anything else.
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:31.680]   Voicemail is actually very good for certain things and it's very bad for others and people
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.680]   don't use it right.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:38.320]   Sometimes people leave these long, drawn-out messages, it'd be much better sent in an email
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:40.320]   or sent as a text message.
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:44.840]   But there are certain times when a quick voicemail that just says, "Hey, I called and called
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:49.000]   me back," that's exactly right because somebody's checking out you get it quick.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.280]   You know, "Okay, I got to call you."
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.800]   I have to admit, I don't listen to my voicemail.
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.600]   I'm from the book.
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:55.680]   Everybody.
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.000]   I know who's in this who hates voicemail.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.240]   They just get simulescribe.
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:00.240]   Have you heard of that?
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.000]   It's called Phone Tag Now.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.280]   And basically, 30 bucks a month unlimited, they'll transcribe it.
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.920]   There's SpinVox does this too.
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:12.320]   These are companies that just turn it into email, basically.
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:13.320]   They do it in real time.
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:18.360]   So my friend Fred Wilson, the venture capitalist who does a VC, has it and I know he has it.
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:22.880]   So I basically bust chops every time and I leave a message from like...
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:24.440]   Do you do it in a funny accent?
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.800]   Oh, no, I'm just making it hard to understand.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.800]   I'm falling for my friend, Fred Wilson.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.280]   Fred Wilson is a very good friend of mine.
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:38.320]   I like him very, very, very, very, very, very much.
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:41.560]   He's a total complete gentleman.
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:45.120]   And then say a word that is completely indecipherable.
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.520]   And it was like, "Oh, but then he forwards them to me."
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:48.520]   And it's so funny.
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.520]   It's like, eating berries.
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:52.960]   And then it's poor person like in India.
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:53.960]   Who does this?
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:54.960]   Who did it?
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:55.960]   How is doing this?
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:58.320]   Oh, it's all like being outsourced to...
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.640]   Is it Amazon's mechanical Turk or what?
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:02.720]   I mean, Jot's the same thing.
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:03.720]   Jot has a human.
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:08.160]   I use Jot all the time and I'm always thinking, "Who's writing this down?"
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.800]   They do it in like India, Philippines.
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:14.680]   One time I said, "Hey, Jot person, I just want to thank you for transcribing this message.
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:15.680]   Have a nice day."
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.360]   And she wrote it down in the message.
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:20.240]   Say goodnight, Gracie.
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.240]   That's good training.
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:22.240]   She's fine, gracie.
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:28.560]   Well, I think the ultimate solution here is for that kind of service to have voice recognition
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:32.440]   catch up so it doesn't have to be done by a human and can be 90% reliable.
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:34.120]   This is why they use humans.
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.040]   Humans are cheaper than computers when it comes to stuff like this.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:37.040]   Right now they are, yeah.
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.440]   But also think about the cost of an era.
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:41.440]   Like a human's like...
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:44.200]   They probably get pennies in message, don't they?
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:45.200]   Pennies.
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.200]   Yeah, I mean...
[00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:47.200]   Two cents.
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:48.200]   There's two cents.
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:49.200]   There's another two cents.
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.200]   There's another two cents.
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.200]   Well, just as...
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:52.200]   Look at cha-cha.com.
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:57.440]   What they're doing with SMS text where cha-cha has a human power and sort of search engine competitive
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:58.680]   with what I'm doing a little bit.
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:01.040]   You can text cha-cha.
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:05.360]   Any question and they pay people, one group of people like three cents to transcribe it
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:08.160]   and another group of people like seven cents to actually answer the question.
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.480]   It just shows how cheap humans are.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:15.800]   When you do it on a global basis, there's an unlimited supply of what Clay Shirkley
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.440]   calls the cognitive surplus.
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:18.440]   Right.
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:21.840]   People who are watching TV would rather just transcribe stuff and make come bucks an hour
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:22.840]   or five or five times.
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:24.160]   Our economy continues to tank.
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:26.640]   We may be doing it for Indians soon.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:32.920]   Anybody would like to leave a message for my friend Rajisha Pardifo, he is a very, very,
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:38.000]   very, very, very, very, very, very nice man.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.160]   I can see myself doing this in a couple of years.
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:41.160]   Happy July Foil.
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:43.160]   You have first transpiring this in America.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.160]   Do you want to...
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:45.160]   You are a American.
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.160]   You are a American.
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.160]   You are a American.
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:48.160]   You are a American.
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:49.160]   You are a American.
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:50.160]   You are a American.
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.160]   You are a American.
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:52.160]   I'm ready for doing this.
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:53.160]   You should not train quite people like this.
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:54.160]   What would be nice would be if the...
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:46:01.800]   voicemail services, they are on site and businesses had this translation capability built into them
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:02.800]   so it happened.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:03.960]   That would be good.
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:05.480]   As it was left.
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:06.480]   Yes.
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:10.600]   Well, that's what you have the little pink slips for while you are out.
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:11.600]   Yes.
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:12.600]   It's called a secretary.
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:14.600]   I'll tell you.
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:20.000]   Any person who's in public relations out there who has my number somehow and calls and leaves
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.200]   voicemails.
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:26.000]   If you don't stop talking within about 10 seconds, I do not hear the rest of your voicemail.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   Oh, yes.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.040]   That's the big thing is brevity here.
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:31.040]   It's voicemail.
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:32.880]   Nobody wants to sit there and listen to you go on and on.
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:33.880]   Just keep it short.
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:37.640]   Tom, if you ever wondered how we are going to replace all the light bulbs we are using
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:42.080]   in America today, well, we have a new solution here.
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:43.360]   Who wants to listen to that stuff?
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:45.640]   But do you actually get those kinds of calls on voicemail?
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:46.640]   Yes.
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:47.640]   Oh, yes.
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:48.640]   I still get them.
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:49.640]   I sent you an email.
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.640]   And I haven't heard back from you.
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:52.640]   Those are all.
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:54.720]   Those are terrible.
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.440]   Shoot me now.
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:57.440]   I get in.
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:01.400]   You know what's funny is when you talk, I've like called them back and I said, please
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:02.640]   don't do that.
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:05.480]   Please don't follow up an email with a voicemail.
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:09.080]   And what they tell me is the client wants us to do.
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:10.640]   They're not, they know better.
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:12.400]   It's the clients want them to do it.
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:14.640]   I got sent a program.
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:15.640]   I won't say the name.
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:19.200]   I got sent a program, you know, $50 program Photoshop plugin.
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:22.520]   I've received an email every two days for the last three months.
[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:24.240]   Have you looked at the program yet?
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:26.160]   I sent one two months ago saying, yeah, I looked at it.
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:27.760]   Well, I'll talk about it at some point.
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.560]   Have you looked at the program yet?
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:31.960]   It's like, it's like, it's automatic.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:34.200]   Fortunately, they don't have my number.
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:37.000]   Well, none of them really know what I cover it.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.200]   You know, they're all sending me pitches for things that are, you know, electronically
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:44.160]   internet connected vacuum cleaners or whatever.
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:47.360]   Google has finally added a couple more Google stories actually.
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:48.360]   Google's hot.
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:52.400]   It's probably the only story this week is all Google.
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:54.680]   They've added a privacy link at the bottom of the page.
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:55.680]   No longer in.
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.800]   Well, that was why did they resist that?
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:03.040]   This was so, so Hansel wrote this story saying Google's violating the California Online Privacy
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:07.880]   Protection Act of 2003 by not putting a link on the front page on its privacy policy and
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:08.880]   Google resisted it.
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:09.880]   I don't understand why they do.
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:13.160]   I thought they were like, well, our page is so finely designed that we can't afford to
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:14.160]   put a privacy link.
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.160]   Oh, would it be reverse is blog post?
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:17.160]   It was like, no.
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:22.320]   Theresa May, or did a long blog post about how many words there are on the page and how
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:27.000]   she was so proud of the fact that they added privacy, but they took it used to say copyright
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.840]   like 2008 Google.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:32.280]   But then she realized that's implied that it's Google's copyright because you're on Google
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:33.280]   dot com.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:38.480]   So she was able to drop the Google and add privacy and it's still 28 words because we know
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:45.640]   that for every additional word on the Google page, 50, 24 kilowatts of power are used.
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:47.320]   Actually, that's not to be sneezed at.
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:52.320]   I mean, the amount of power used by it, somebody was suggesting, I think is a great idea that
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:55.280]   companies should publish how much power they use.
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:58.040]   We forget that this is every page you go to uses power.
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:00.000]   Well, shouldn't you change the page black then?
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   Isn't that better?
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.240]   Yeah, apparently that's a that's a that's a conard.
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:06.160]   Actually, those servers are running anyway.
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:10.480]   So it's a fixed cost, you know, whether thousands of pages are seen or no pages.
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:11.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:14.560]   But I mean, it's like saying, you know, you know, 800 million cows are going to die whether
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:15.840]   you eat a burger or not.
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:20.000]   If people stop eating burgers, they'll use fewer watts.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   Right?
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   True.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.280]   If we stop leaving the house, we'll probably leave.
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:26.280]   Right.
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:29.080]   Everybody turn your computers off after you listen to this week in tech.
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:35.240]   The idea was that a black page somehow used fewer, you know, watts in your monitor, but
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:36.320]   it turns out that's not true.
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:38.440]   The monitor is always because it still has to show something.
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.360]   Yeah, there's a black well, there's a backlight's always on.
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:42.960]   It's just whether the LCD is open or not.
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:43.960]   Doesn't matter.
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:46.120]   Well, I thought, yeah, I knew it didn't matter for LCD.
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:47.160]   I didn't know if it actually.
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:49.240]   How many people you see are teas.
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:51.160]   Those are the energy hogs.
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:52.680]   So that's the worst offenders.
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:54.680]   Well, that's true.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:56.920]   Google apparently debunked that black screen thing.
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:57.920]   All right.
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:00.080]   Story number two, this is a great New York time.
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:02.480]   All these are New York time stories.
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:08.440]   Google screws up its childcare big time.
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:09.440]   Did you read this story?
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:10.800]   It's a very interesting story.
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:14.240]   Only Google had a third party contractor.
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:22.000]   Everybody loved was very happy with, but then decided to do it themselves because of course,
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.920]   Google could do everything better than anybody else can.
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:28.360]   Because if you can organize the world's information, you could certainly run trial.
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:29.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:31.640]   And a part you can raise children.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:32.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:33.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:34.640]   They know.
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:35.640]   Oh, we can do everything better.
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:36.640]   They have an algorithm for that.
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:43.920]   Well, it's kind of a little bit of a little scandal here because now you have to read
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:44.920]   the article.
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:52.840]   But apparently, Susan Wojczyki, Wojczyki, who is Larry Page's sister-in-law, or I'm
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:58.400]   sorry, Sergey Brin's sister-in-law is kind of in charge of this.
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:03.080]   She owned the garage that Google was founded in and now she's the company's vice president
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:05.840]   for product measurement.
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:10.040]   But apparently, she's also like the advocate for Google's daycare efforts.
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:15.600]   So they fired the Children's Creative Learning Centers, the CCLC, which electronic arts uses
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:22.120]   a lot of Silicon Valley companies use, and they created their own Kinderplex based on
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:29.360]   the learning philosophies of Rijio Emilio, which is apparently hugely expensive.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:31.000]   So what exactly happened then?
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.200]   They announced that they're going to raise the cost of...
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:38.280]   Well, it turned out they found out that they were subsidizing childcare with this new expensive
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:43.080]   system, $37,000 a year per child.
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:51.800]   And they decided to raise the cost of childcare tremendously at Google, 75%.
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:52:00.200]   So the daycare bill would go from around $33,000 to $57,000 a year for Google employees.
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:05.760]   Now, you could hire somebody full time to take care of your kids for $50,000.
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:11.000]   But I think the idea is, well, if it's comparable to what an outside daycare will cost, it'd
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.080]   be nice to have the kid on campus.
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:15.080]   Is that comparable?
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:17.200]   $33,000 might be.
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:18.200]   That's expensive.
[00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:19.200]   $33 is pretty high.
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:20.440]   That's $3,000 a month.
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:21.440]   That's high.
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:23.760]   They said in San Francisco, it's like $12,000 to do this.
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:24.760]   That's high.
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:25.760]   $15,000.
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:28.440]   So, yeah, it's a mistake.
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:33.040]   And then, and then the problem is that the waiting list is so long, everybody wants this
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:34.280]   Google daycare.
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:36.200]   So they want to get the waiting list to zero.
[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:40.120]   So they kick people off, they charge you a hundred bucks to be on the waiting list.
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:43.440]   They kick people off.
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:46.640]   And I guess the upset is that some people came to Google, and I remember this, it was
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:48.080]   famous for its childcare.
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:50.440]   So some people came to Google for the childcare.
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:54.200]   And now they're having to have support it or they can't get it.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.480]   Well, it's just for the top level executives.
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:57.480]   That's really what it is.
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:59.480]   People who are millionaires.
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:05.600]   There's a tremendous sense of entitlement that Google has created amongst its rank and
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:08.600]   file because it was the first place to have this food thing.
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:12.200]   I think somebody did a calculation, Henry Blodgett on Silicon Alley Insider, that they
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:17.600]   were spending like $12 or $15 per employee per day to feed them.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:18.600]   I'm not surprised.
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:19.600]   It's good food.
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:20.600]   They give them good food.
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:21.600]   Yeah.
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:22.600]   I've eaten there many times.
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:23.600]   It's ridiculous.
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:24.600]   It's delicious.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:29.520]   It's so beyond what's necessary because it's also like 20 different stations.
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:32.520]   It's not like, you know, it's restaurants or options.
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:35.680]   It's like there's like 17 campus restaurants or whatever.
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:36.680]   Restaurants.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:39.480]   What do you, I mean, people are going to get a mad sense of entitlement and...
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:41.520]   Well, I think that's a fantastic idea.
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:44.320]   And I think I hope the CBS executives will listen.
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:47.160]   You know, it's the Silicon Valley culture, Tom.
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:51.240]   You need to do that because otherwise you'd just go across the street.
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:52.680]   And by the way, it's good for team building.
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:53.680]   You all get together.
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:54.680]   You're in the cafeteria.
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:56.040]   You don't go off campus.
[00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:57.520]   You don't go to a FUD rockers.
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:59.120]   Why it has a chef, right?
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:00.120]   Yeah.
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:02.360]   Why it's a little more reasonably than Google.
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:03.920]   Lucas had a chef.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:05.560]   I think Wired had a chef.
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:06.560]   I think like...
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:07.560]   Yeah, they got anymore.
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:08.560]   They don't have.
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:09.560]   I don't know if they're doing that now.
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:13.840]   Well, they had a friend who was interning there as recently as a year ago and they still
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:14.840]   had it.
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:15.840]   Oh, well, maybe they do.
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:16.840]   Wow.
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:17.840]   Good legacy.
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:18.840]   Isn't there a Mahalo chef?
[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:19.840]   Don't you have a Mahalo chef?
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:22.680]   We bring food in four days a week, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:24.680]   Yeah, I mean, it's a big perk.
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:28.240]   Apple has a pretty impressive cafeteria.
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:29.240]   But you pay when you go there.
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:30.720]   It's not free.
[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:32.600]   No, it's not free.
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:36.880]   But you know, it's certainly a lot better than what you would expect.
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:40.720]   I think it's reasonable to have a subsidized cafeteria at your place.
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:42.000]   So you keep people together.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:46.480]   You'd like them not to go off campus, wouldn't you?
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:47.560]   It's good for team building.
[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:48.560]   It's a great perk.
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:50.240]   Great for keeping people at the company.
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:51.240]   Right.
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:52.840]   It's the total cost of it.
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:55.440]   Somebody is working five days a week, right?
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:56.440]   50 weeks to year.
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:58.000]   Don't look at me like that, Colleen.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   40 weeks to year.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.640]   You're talking about whatever it is.
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:03.400]   Colleen wants me to have lunch now at the Twit Cottage.
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:07.840]   It's like $2,000, $3,000.
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:10.240]   It should be two or $3,000 per employee.
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.880]   It's not that much when you compare it to their salary.
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:12.880]   No, I think it's a nice perk.
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:17.160]   They're all talking about the product and how to make it better at lunch, you know, or
[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:18.800]   half the company, even if half the percentage.
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:21.080]   Don't you really want to do the things that are less expensive?
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:23.080]   The employees are easily swayed.
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:24.720]   It's not salary necessarily.
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:28.440]   It's feeling like you're appreciated and taken care of.
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:29.440]   Yeah.
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:31.960]   Just a little, the little things that, I mean, when I was an employee, that always made the
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:32.960]   difference.
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:36.440]   I'll tell you what the biggest perk has been to follow.
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:41.920]   We put in a washer and dryer because we have showers there and a little, the washer and
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:42.920]   so we had soap there.
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:45.360]   And so then I started noticing the washer and dryers were running constantly.
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:46.360]   I said, what is going on?
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:47.840]   They're doing their laundry.
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:50.080]   People were bringing their laundry into work.
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.080]   And doing it.
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:55.040]   Yeah, because the guys are like, okay, we're buying all this detergent.
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:58.440]   But then I realized, oh, they're not wasting five, six hours on the weekend doing their
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:55:59.440]   laundry.
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:00.440]   They're doing it while they're working.
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:01.440]   There you go.
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:02.440]   Okay.
[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:03.440]   They're like better.
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:06.600]   And on the weekends, they're there on Saturday and Sunday doing their laundry and work.
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:07.920]   I'm like, rock on.
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.640]   And how much is that cost to you, Jason?
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:12.240]   I mean, it really, you know, it's a mountain that much.
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:14.760]   I mean, $500 a year in detergent.
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:15.760]   Google does dry cleaning.
[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:17.600]   You just drop off your dry cleaning at the front desk.
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:18.600]   Hey, pay for that.
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:19.600]   Oh, do you?
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:21.640]   That's just now see Leo runs at the opposite.
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:23.200]   He has people bringing him food.
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.200]   They did.
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:26.480]   They just brought me it's time for a brain tonic break.
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:28.440]   We invite you to try a little brain tonic.
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:32.520]   This is our, they're not really a sponsor exactly, but we all, this is the free thing
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:35.960]   you get at Twitcottage is you get some brain tonic.
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:38.800]   B-A-B-R-A-I-N-T-O-N-I-Q dot com.
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:41.040]   No caffeine, no gueran, no artificial stimulants.
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:42.280]   In fact, no refined sugar.
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:43.280]   It's a govanenector.
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:45.120]   You anything in it?
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:46.120]   Yeah.
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:47.120]   Cold water.
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:49.800]   It's, it's, it's, it's, no, it's got a govanenector is a sweetener.
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:50.800]   80 calories a can.
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:51.800]   It's delicious.
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:52.800]   I love a govane.
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:53.800]   I have a govane.
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:55.800]   It's a same thing that's in tequila.
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:57.520]   It's, it's, it's fresh tequila.
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:58.520]   Think of it that way.
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:01.320]   Undra, un, un fermented tequila.
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:06.720]   And if you use my name, Leo, 20% off at brain tonic, B-A-R-A-I-N-T-O-N-I-Q dot com.
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:07.720]   Let's see how it works.
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:09.520]   You just pour that right on your head there.
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:10.520]   You pour it right on your head.
[00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:11.520]   I feel smarter already.
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:12.520]   Rub it in.
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:16.600]   Tonic does sound like something you should be rubbing on your head.
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:19.000]   And then you put it right on your head and look at this head of hair.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.640]   You won't believe I was a ball as a cue ball.
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:23.640]   Oh, I need that.
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:27.480]   When I, before I drank brain tonic, I look like John Dorett.
[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:30.480]   Now John's got a bit of hair.
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:33.880]   John's got, John's going to mullet.
[00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:36.000]   That's all business up front and party in the back.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   Party in the back.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.200]   Is it a show low?
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:41.000]   That's John Dorectuous seat.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.200]   All right.
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:44.920]   Let's, let's not beat up and for John.
[00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:47.920]   He's not here to defend himself.
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:50.240]   He's energy drinks and the kids who are drinking on them.
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:52.240]   They're all a bunch of crackheads.
[00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:53.240]   That's all.
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:54.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:55.240]   I think get off my lawn.
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:56.240]   All right.
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:57.240]   Let's see.
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:58.240]   Get off my IRC channel.
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:57:59.240]   Yeah.
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:00.240]   So one more Google story.
[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:01.240]   I like this one.
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:02.240]   Seth MacFarlane, the creator of The Family Guy.
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:04.240]   What's this about?
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:05.240]   I don't know.
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:06.240]   What are they up to?
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:10.120]   Is experimenting with a new method of distributing original material on the web.
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:14.880]   Google has hired him to unveil a carefully guarded new project called.
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:19.720]   Seth MacFarlane's Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy.
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:22.280]   So the video ad sets didn't work.
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:25.280]   And what they've done is they've, this is actually pretty brilliant, I think, is they've
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:31.120]   contracted the guy who did The Family Guy to make video content for ad sets and they're
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:32.320]   going to sell ads against it.
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:36.720]   So they'll either be a pre-rule, or be a banner across the bottom and you'll have like up
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:43.320]   to two minute episodes of these funny stuff that MacFarlane does that will not be ads
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:44.320]   themselves.
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:45.320]   They'll be content.
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:49.680]   The thing is, I don't know if you can go get those episodes anywhere else or if you just
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:51.440]   have to stumble across them.
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:56.040]   Well, this is a really interesting change in the way this stuff works where the people
[00:58:56.040 --> 00:59:02.360]   like Google commission content from content creators as a vehicle for advertising is like,
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:04.680]   frankly, the Uncle Milty.
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:10.440]   You know, Milton Burles, Chevy Cavalcade or whatever it was, where the soap companies
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:14.560]   would come and say, hey, do a TV show, we'll be the sponsors, you create the content,
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:16.440]   it's purely a vehicle for advertising.
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:17.920]   Isn't it kind of like the old days?
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:21.920]   Well, it's in the letters of the old days because you don't have, you know, DuPont,
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:25.680]   they're saying, well, I didn't really like that joke because it's different advertisers.
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:27.120]   They don't care as long as people watch.
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:29.960]   People could say they didn't like the joke, but the advertisers, you know, are going to
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:30.960]   be sold by Google.
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:33.240]   So there's still a little bit of separation there.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:39.760]   This is major channel conflict area for Google because Google wants studios to use their,
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:45.000]   you know, services and if Google gets into the distribution business and goes direct
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:49.920]   to creators to produce stuff, you know, if this works, then maybe JJ Abrams instead of
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:53.320]   doing his next show, maybe see, we'll do it with Google.
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:54.480]   Why is that a channel conflict?
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:55.480]   Isn't that good?
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:59.760]   No, because Google makes the majority of their money on having ads on other people's sites,
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:00.840]   non Google sites.
[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:03.320]   So that's why Google will not go into the content business.
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:07.120]   That's why they won't buy a blog because they would undermine their channel.
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:12.680]   Like, yes, so if they basically start running, if they started hiring journalists from the
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.840]   New York Times, New York Times, it's a, hey, unfair.
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.840]   We're not going to run Google ads.
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:20.240]   And so Google gets to go to everybody and say, hey, we're not competing with you.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.000]   We're just a platform company.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.520]   And with YouTube, it's been getting really dicey because when they did the CNN YouTube
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:31.960]   debates, a lot of partners who I talk to were like, oh, you're doing a debate.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:34.480]   So it's a YouTube debate, presidential debate.
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:35.560]   It's not what we do.
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:36.560]   Here's the deal.
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:38.240]   This is kind of interesting.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:41.240]   McFarlane will receive a percentage of the ad revenue.
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:43.360]   He's created new characters to star in the series.
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:47.200]   It'll be served up in 52 minute episodes.
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:51.200]   The installments he described as animated versions of the one frame cartoons you might
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.800]   see in the New Yorker, only edgier.
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:54.280]   Oh, I bet.
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:59.880]   And then for a more substantial fee, McFarlane is working with advertisers to animate original
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:04.280]   commercials for the advertisers, you know, a brain tonic ad or whatever that will run
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:05.280]   on the cavalcade.
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:08.960]   They're going to do custom ads that will look like content.
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:10.160]   In addition to the content.
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:11.680]   In addition to the content.
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:12.680]   That's smart.
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:13.680]   That's smart.
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:19.120]   The two said these are the several deals among the largest ever landed by AdSense.
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.840]   Big bucks.
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:24.480]   So how do you know the difference between the ads?
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:25.480]   There you go.
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:27.400]   The old time journalist weighs in exactly.
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:28.400]   That's right.
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.400]   That's right.
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:31.600]   You know, the thing is this is a natural progression.
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:32.880]   This is a natural progression.
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:37.600]   What's going to happen is that Google is going to become not only a content distributor,
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:41.280]   but also it will commission more and more for these things.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:45.360]   And eventually it will become a major media company.
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:49.240]   I mean, in terms of the actual creation, I think this is just a start.
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:50.960]   And I don't think it's bad.
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.440]   You don't think that's a gun of it?
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.560]   I mean, this is the first thing they've ever done like this.
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:57.960]   And it could be reasonable to think this is a way of priming the pump for other people
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:00.760]   to go create their own content and come in and strike an ad.
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:01.760]   What about this?
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:06.200]   Alex Lindsay has posited this for some time that a company like say REI, which makes
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:11.360]   camping equipment, would do a camping video that has lots of content in it.
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:15.160]   But at any point as you're watching the video, you could click on that tent and buy it.
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:17.040]   Click on those jeans and buy it.
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.040]   Click on that backpack.
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.040]   Click on those shoes.
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:20.640]   It's a future media.
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:25.320]   The future is going to be that these people who are selling stuff, the marketers are going
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:28.920]   to create their own content, which is what they dip their toe of blogs.
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:30.640]   Now they're dipping their toe with video.
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:31.640]   It's definitely in the future.
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:34.040]   Does that leave content only creators like me?
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:39.600]   Well, advertorial already exists and it doesn't compete so much with regular content.
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:44.800]   I mean, you go to cnatv.com and there are advertorial videos created by the companies
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:45.800]   that advertise.
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:46.800]   Ooh, that's such a slippery slope though.
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:50.000]   Isn't that what put separate areas where all the regular content?
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.800]   But isn't that what put content out of business?
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:52.800]   Do they know the difference?
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:53.800]   Yeah, they do.
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:55.800]   But as long as you make them know the difference, right?
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:59.800]   As long as you don't slip those advertorial videos in and mix them up with the content and
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:00.920]   try to trick the viewers.
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.920]   You say like, you know what, this is advertised.
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:05.200]   It's painful and makes me very clear over here.
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.040]   It's going to be dice up here.
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:08.040]   It makes me so.
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:10.920]   I think you risk your reputation big time when you do that.
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.760]   And your original question is how does it affect you?
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:16.080]   What's going to happen is me or Tom or Dwight, the content guys.
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:19.840]   And what's going to happen is there'll be a group of people who will do anything for
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:20.840]   advertisers to get their money.
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:24.240]   And then there'll be a group of old school folks who will try to hold the line.
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:26.680]   And it basically means the advertisers are going to come to you and say, oh, you're not
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:30.320]   willing to do like a commercial for us and say you love the product.
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.520]   We're going to move our money over here.
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:33.520]   And.
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:36.240]   But will that happen with something like a lost and something?
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:38.240]   I mean, first of all, that's not going to go in the ad sense.
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.800]   I mean, that's that's a different.
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:40.800]   There's stuff that's too.
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:42.040]   Yeah, there's long form.
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:43.040]   Yeah.
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.040]   So does it do?
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.760]   Well, they're already the middle ground.
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:50.520]   Shows like lost are already dealing with that, you know, just from just from the notion
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:51.520]   of product placement.
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:57.040]   I mean, if you what was the, it was some movie I saw the other day that was just outrageous.
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.040]   The Hulk.
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:02.320]   The product placement in the Hulk is just, is just amazing.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.160]   And was it a Sony movie?
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:07.720]   Because Sony they always have, they all have, you know, Sony gear.
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:08.720]   What about Wally?
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.200]   Wally had like the iPod.
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:11.200]   Did it really?
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.120]   Do you think Apple pay for that?
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:14.920]   Well, Steve got this company.
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:16.920]   They don't have to pay for it.
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:17.920]   Yeah.
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:18.920]   It didn't.
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:19.920]   It didn't.
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:22.560]   The boot up sound was the boot up sound of Wally was the boot up sound from Mac.
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:23.560]   Yeah.
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:25.560]   Oh, but that's fun.
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:27.640]   The whole theater laughed at least.
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:28.640]   That's funny.
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:35.040]   But that doesn't, that doesn't destroy the, the entertainment value of what you're watching.
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:36.440]   Or the artistic integrity.
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:37.440]   Right.
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.440]   Right.
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:39.440]   Right.
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:45.720]   Would I go to an, an, an REI website and watch an REI video and click on the tent and trust
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:49.840]   REI to tell me objective information about that tent.
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:51.240]   I would not do that.
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:55.520]   But in because of that, because it's a competitive nature, there will always be somebody who
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:58.640]   will come there and give you the independence information.
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:04:59.920]   It'll always be there.
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:01.520]   And I think you will be able to tell it.
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:05.680]   I have toyed many a time and if I could do what I would with just firing all the advertisers
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:09.040]   and saying this to me, the cleanest thing, when this was how we were going to start to
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:14.640]   it, this was our plan, the cleanest thing would be to say, we run this on for you, your
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:18.200]   viewers will run it on your donations and that's it.
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:20.640]   And I would love to do that.
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:21.640]   But it just doesn't.
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:26.240]   Like public, well, except public radio is basically full ads now.
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:29.640]   They just, you know, say, let's say public radio say like, like a Pacifica.
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:30.640]   Right.
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:31.640]   Pacifica still does not take.
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:35.600]   They don't take any sponsorships that don't say brought to you by Archer Daniels, Midland,
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.320]   grosser to the stars.
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:40.000]   They just say, give us your money.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.360]   I don't think I could make it that way.
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:43.360]   You wouldn't make it that way.
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.200]   You could make it that way ever though.
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.200]   I would like to.
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:51.600]   I mean, if I had, if, if I didn't have kids, if it were just me, I would consider it.
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.600]   No, it's fine to have the advertising.
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:54.600]   Advertising is fine with the show.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.600]   I like our advertisers.
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:56.600]   We have good advertisers, but it's just.
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:57.600]   You get to pick a little litter.
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:01.600]   I mean, for somebody who's got traffic and has audience, this is a non issue.
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.040]   It's for the marginal people who are going to have to do it.
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:06.480]   You know, the people who have audience are not going to have to sell out.
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:09.800]   The people who are on the lower end, it was like exactly like paper post, right?
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:10.880]   Paper post came out.
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:12.880]   It wasn't like any notable bloggers did it.
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:15.160]   It was all this sort of, you know, strange people.
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:16.160]   Yeah.
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:19.280]   It was kind of like losers, no offense to the losers doing it, but I mean, I never was
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:20.280]   got to take a thought.
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.280]   But they were sort of losers.
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:24.280]   No offense to the losers.
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.280]   No offense to the losers.
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.280]   You know you are.
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:29.280]   And you know who you are.
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:32.320]   Well, that's what I, that's why I for paper post so much because I was like, oh, let's
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:37.040]   not ruin blogging as a medium and make nobody trust it, you know, but I'm possibly.
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:41.080]   But I agree because blogging was something blogging is something precious.
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.840]   Let's not trash this thing of value.
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.480]   Don't disagree though.
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:49.000]   That's this idea of like, if you have the numbers, you'll be fine because the problem
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.880]   is the way the ad agencies work and you know this is, is they don't necessarily care just
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:54.880]   about the numbers.
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:55.880]   You got to play the game.
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:58.480]   It's a good concept by in there as well.
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:01.600]   And so that doesn't necessarily totally undermine your point.
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:05.240]   But even if you get the numbers, if you're doing content that isn't fashionable or isn't
[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:10.440]   seen as hot, I mean, we ran into this at tech TV, they won't buy it.
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:11.440]   And often times.
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:12.440]   They just don't understand it.
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:15.280]   And oftentimes that's the most important stuff with the stuff the viewers are really looking
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:18.240]   for are the niche that really needs to be filled or, you know,
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:21.720]   general, if you got the audience in the, in the audience,
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:22.720]   big enough audience.
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:23.720]   Sure.
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:24.720]   And it performs to the advertiser.
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:25.720]   They'll do it.
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:29.640]   You know, the, the uniqueness of the content is great.
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:33.880]   You know, if it's in parallel with their message, but if there's audience in the audience
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:40.080]   does perform by the ads, that's why I like the idea of, of, of the viewers supporting
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:42.680]   stuff that maybe advertisers wouldn't support.
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:47.600]   You know, if, if you want this niche content, maybe there's only 10,000 of you, you know,
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:50.520]   each of you throwing a buck, that'll keep it alive and that'll support it.
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:54.120]   I wish there were some kind of more natural way for that to happen.
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:55.120]   Yeah.
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:57.280]   That's a reeducation of users.
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:00.120]   I mean, users do not want to take their wallets out period.
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.400]   No, they're used to getting free content.
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.840]   So I mean, how could you, I mean, you look at the amount of content that's available
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:05.840]   for free.
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:06.840]   It's not going to have to make it work with average.
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:09.120]   Yeah, well, yeah, I think you're right.
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:11.960]   I was a naive, I was a naive, innocent fool.
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:14.000]   Well, it's not like we haven't worked this out.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.480]   I mean, we went through the whole 50s things with the DuPont show and then people realized
[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:21.000]   well, there can be undue influence and let's figure out the 30 second ads.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.880]   You know, the same process we're just seeing happen again, right, because we don't have
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.560]   the 30 second ad for the internet yet.
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.560]   Right.
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:28.560]   No, you're right.
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:32.000]   Hey, speaking of ads, let's take a little break for your favorite.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.520]   Mr. Jason Calican is audible.
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:34.520]   Oh, really audible.
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:35.520]   Oh, really?
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:36.520]   Audible.
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:37.520]   Oh, really?
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:38.520]   I love audible.
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:41.640]   You wouldn't believe the book I'm listening to on a water ball.
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:43.400]   What are you listening to?
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:47.920]   I almost don't want to say because it's going to make me seem like a little bit of a loon,
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:50.880]   but I'm listening to a book called the Purpose Driven Church.
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:51.880]   No, I know.
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:56.680]   No, no, this guy wrote the Purpose Driven Life too, which I wanted to read for some time.
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.320]   Tell us a little bit about it.
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:08:59.680]   I'm very interested in this.
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:05.360]   Well, this book, the Purpose Driven Church, is by a guy who's been quite successful in
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:07.080]   building a church here in Southern California.
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:13.680]   So he basically goes through, and I'm reading it because of its parallels to startup companies,
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:15.920]   also thinking about starting a cult.
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:20.080]   Anyway, it's a really interesting book because he talks about the techniques they use to
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:26.400]   build a church and how you have to look at these churches, not as being, you have to
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:30.400]   look at what your core purpose is and then everything from there.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:32.360]   It's really helped you with everything.
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:33.360]   It's true for everything.
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:34.360]   Yeah.
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:41.600]   It had a really great line in the book where he says, "If you're rowing the boat, you really
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.200]   don't have time to rock it."
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:46.960]   So it's really important at a startup company to really have everybody on the mission.
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:51.760]   So we're going to this new place, and that's the direction, and everybody is rowing because
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:54.200]   if you don't know your direction, it's not clear.
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:55.760]   People stop rowing and they start rocking the boat.
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:58.720]   It's all kind of anecdotes about that kind of stuff.
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:01.800]   I try to read things that are outside of the technology press because it's so repetitive
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:02.800]   in the tech business.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:03.800]   I think that's great.
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:04.800]   I read the purpose-driven life.
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:05.800]   Is it also Rick Warren?
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:06.800]   How do you know?
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.960]   Yeah, I think it is.
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:09.960]   I wanted to read that.
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:11.600]   It was a huge bestseller.
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:17.720]   I'll be honest, I'm not particularly religious, but I think that this, as you say, this applies
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:19.880]   to many, this applies to life.
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:24.640]   Yeah, and that's one of the great things about Audible is that it's such a range of books
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:29.240]   on there that what I like to do is just take a chance and try something different.
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:31.240]   And just you'd be really surprised.
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:35.320]   You can find stuff that you never thought you would be appealing to you, but you listen
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:36.320]   to it.
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:39.360]   You listen to the first half hour and if you're on the membership program, it's nothing
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:40.360]   lost.
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:41.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:45.600]   Well, I'll tell you what, there's no risk at all if you go to audible.com/twit.
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:46.920]   Audible.com/twit.
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:47.920]   You can get this book for free.
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:49.720]   Just sign up for Audible.
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.040]   If you decide, Audible is not for you, no problem.
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:53.040]   Cancel.
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.040]   You get to keep the book, but I have a feeling.
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:57.120]   I got to warn you, you're going to really like Audible.
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.120]   It's not for everybody.
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:00.720]   There's some people who are not, I think, auditory learners.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:05.040]   But if you're listening to a podcast, chances are pretty good that you can absorb information
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.000]   through your ears well.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.360]   And this Audible is a boon.
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:11.440]   50,000 titles.
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:14.640]   Fiction, nonfiction, spirituality and erotica.
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:16.280]   It's all there.
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:17.280]   Audible.com.
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:20.400]   Have you ever listened to any erotica there on the Audible, Jason?
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:25.400]   Hey, you know what the great thing about Audible is totally secure, totally private,
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:28.880]   and they're not going to give your information over to Viacom.
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:30.760]   This is the upside to the DRM.
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:35.800]   You do it legitimately, and if you've got seven or eight erotica books on your iPhone,
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:36.800]   nobody needs to know.
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:37.800]   That's between you and Audible.
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:38.800]   I almost.
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:39.800]   So that would be a yes.
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:48.440]   You know, I have to admit, I have to admit, there's a whole section of erotica and sexuality.
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:52.000]   I tried one just thought, what could this be like?
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.280]   It's not appropriate really for driving the car.
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:56.080]   Let's put it that way.
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:59.000]   It's a little distracting.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.920]   I wouldn't recommend it for, you know, commuting.
[01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:03.920]   Let's put it that way.
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:04.920]   Mass transit only.
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.920]   Mass transit only.
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:10.360]   Audible, but not crowded, mass transit.
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:13.400]   Just stop while we're behind it.
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:16.200]   Audible.com/twit, please take a look.
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:17.640]   Audible is a great sponsor.
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:22.800]   By the way, I want to mention they are going to be sponsoring our coverage of the iPhone
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:23.960]   launch.
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:27.800]   We're going to do something I think is absolutely insane.
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:32.720]   And I don't know if I've what I've signed myself up for, but we decided that we would
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:38.320]   cover the iPhone launch from the minute, actually maybe even before it goes on sale
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:41.120]   in New Zealand, which is the first place that I think in the world it'll be going on
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:47.080]   sale, which is 8 a.m. New Zealand time on Friday the 11th, which is my time, I think,
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:51.080]   is like 1 p.m. Thursday, the day before.
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:57.360]   So starting at probably around noon on Thursday, July 10th, going right through the last Apple
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:03.360]   store opening in Honolulu, which will be 11 a.m. Friday Pacific time, we're going to
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:05.440]   do nonstop wall to wall coverage.
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:07.160]   We will be talking to people at Apple stores.
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:11.120]   In fact, if you're at an Apple store in line, you call us if you're one of the people
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.120]   in line.
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:14.440]   They're actually already lining up in New York City on 5th Avenue.
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:17.760]   So you're taking a balloon trip around the world, Leo, and I know you're here.
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:19.680]   A virtual balloon trip via Skype.
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:21.160]   I'll be sitting here on my ball.
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:22.600]   I have my balloon here.
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:26.640]   I'll be sitting on and then people will be calling in from all over the world.
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:27.640]   But here's the deal.
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:29.200]   We've got 10 iPhones to give away.
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:34.520]   Actually, they're store credits for an iPhone plus, Audible is going to stock each one of
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:37.280]   them up with 100 bucks with the Audible books, which is really nice.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:42.240]   So you get a $100 credit and an iPhone credit and we've got 10 of those to give away in
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:43.240]   that to period.
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:44.880]   So I think we're going to have a lot of fun.
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:48.000]   I invite you to tune in to itlive.tv.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.800]   If you watch toward the end, you could probably watch me collapse utterly.
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:59.560]   And Tom, if you felt like coming up here and taking like the 2 to 5 AM shift, I'm serious.
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:00.560]   I'm serious.
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:01.560]   You would be, wouldn't I?
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:03.440]   So just like the call for help with us.
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:04.960]   It's like it's a call for help with fun.
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:05.960]   Exactly.
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:06.960]   Just come on up.
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:07.960]   We're going to have some surprises.
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:08.960]   Some friends will come up.
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:09.960]   It'll be a lot of fun.
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:12.600]   And if you're in the mood, just, you know, pop by the Twitcottage.
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:17.360]   I'm particularly looking for people to handle that midnight to 6 AM shift.
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:25.800]   But we got caught set up upstairs and nurses ready to give me a transfusion should one
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:26.800]   become necessary.
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:27.800]   It's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:29.800]   It's like the old horror films.
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:32.960]   Like the Jerry Lewis telephon.
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:33.960]   Exactly.
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:37.720]   I'm going to wear a tuxedo at the beginning by the end.
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:38.720]   I'm going to get real.
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:39.720]   You're going to be like the tuxedo of the out.
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:40.720]   Yeah.
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:42.040]   I'll be all weepy and maudlin.
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:44.320]   Maybe Dean will come by and we'll hug.
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:47.120]   Well, we're here on the 23rd hour.
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:49.120]   See what's up, boy.
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:51.840]   And the tell all come by and it'll be a huge be good.
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:52.840]   Exactly.
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:53.840]   We'll hug.
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:54.840]   We'll cry.
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:55.840]   We'll laugh.
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:56.840]   I'll say, what are you doing?
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:57.840]   It'll be fine.
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:58.840]   And you'll have to bring on some kids.
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:14:59.840]   You have to find some kids.
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:00.840]   Leo's kids.
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:01.840]   Leo's kids.
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:02.840]   It'll be great.
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:08.680]   I'm here with seven eighth graders and what you don't see here is the pain in their heart
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:11.840]   of having an iPhone to the all seven.
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:14.080]   You don't see here is an iPhone.
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:18.160]   Yeah, they don't have these all these kids have the on free G iPhone kids show us your
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:19.160]   first generation.
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:20.160]   Oh, isn't that sad?
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:21.160]   God.
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:24.160]   Oh, you can stop these kids from having to use these first generation.
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:25.160]   I horrible edge.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:27.800]   Billy, how long does it take you to plagiarize Wikipedia?
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:30.280]   No, I'm real all day.
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:31.880]   Leo all day.
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:34.480]   It's so sad.
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:35.880]   Twitlive.tv will start.
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:36.880]   We'll start on Thursday.
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:37.880]   We'll be.
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:38.880]   It should be.
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:39.880]   I'm going to.
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:40.880]   It's going to be.
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:41.880]   I can't wait.
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:43.280]   This is why I designed this thing is for silly stunts like this.
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:46.520]   It's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:50.760]   This is why you're at $20,000 going home.
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:51.760]   20 50.
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:52.760]   Isn't it?
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:53.760]   50.
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.360]   Well, you know, you got lights, 10 grand for the lights.
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:56.880]   I hope you're getting the light panel LEDs.
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:58.480]   You got to get those, Jason.
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:00.080]   I don't know if I told Tyler about those.
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:02.280]   You got to get those.
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:03.280]   We got.
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:06.280]   Basically, whatever you spent, I want to spend 10,000 more.
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:07.560]   That's funny because that's funny.
[01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:09.120]   One model better on each of the items.
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:12.680]   I told Colleen, whatever Tom Green spent, I want $1 more.
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:13.680]   Right.
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:14.680]   So, I would say two dollars.
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:18.280]   I just basically want to be able to say, oh, we try to cross your heads?
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:19.280]   Yeah, we have.
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.280]   I got the one better.
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:21.280]   That's plus one plus one.
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:25.040]   And every instead of, you know, these big computers, everybody's going to be using
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:26.040]   errors.
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:27.040]   It'll be all MacBook Airs everywhere.
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:28.040]   Oh, you have the five.
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:37.480]   I told them everything we have, everything we use so you can have exactly the same thing,
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:38.480]   Jason.
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:40.680]   I just want it to be comfortable for when you come down for E3.
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:41.680]   Oh, that'll be fun.
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:42.680]   Work out of the studio.
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:43.680]   Deal.
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:44.680]   I'll be there.
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:45.680]   That'll be fun.
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:46.680]   Yeah.
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:49.040]   Like your once a year visit.
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.040]   I like that idea.
[01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:51.040]   We should do trades.
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:52.040]   You come up here.
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:53.040]   I go down there.
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:54.040]   Absolutely.
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:55.040]   That'd be really fun.
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:56.720]   You could fly up in your net jet.
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:58.600]   That's a sponsor I'd like to have.
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:02.200]   Hi, this is Jason Kallikhanas for net jets.
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:05.480]   Are you tired of being on flights with people like John Devorak?
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:08.920]   Are you tired of sitting between people like John Devorak?
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:09.920]   That's not real.
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:12.400]   Can you move all of that?
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:15.400]   We did your share space.
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:16.400]   I shot first.
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:18.360]   What's this in my brain tonic?
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:20.840]   It looks like a long Devorak here.
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:26.840]   They say that the nightmare is being sat and coached on a plane between John and John.
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:30.200]   Oh, for John, he's going to be.
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:31.200]   Everybody goes to the right.
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:32.640]   You have the armrest on the right.
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:33.640]   See?
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:35.640]   And that's why I get to see by the window.
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:36.640]   You go that way.
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:37.640]   Go that way.
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:38.720]   You know what John would say if he were here?
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:40.320]   Is there any tech news?
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:41.320]   Yeah.
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:42.320]   All right.
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:45.520]   I don't know if Kallikhanas, can we just talk about the new version of Office?
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:50.200]   Which of you guys, Tom, Dwight, Jason, which of you are getting the 3G iPhone?
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:52.840]   Dwight, you're going to get one for review?
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:53.840]   I hope so.
[01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:56.320]   You know, Apple's cagey about it, but I hope so.
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:58.160]   I'm going to buy one one way or another.
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:17:59.160]   You are going to get one.
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:00.160]   Are you using the current?
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:01.160]   Yeah, and I didn't like the first one.
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:02.160]   I didn't like the first one.
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:03.160]   I didn't like the edge.
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:04.640]   Didn't like the yeah.
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:05.640]   I'm with you.
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:06.960]   Didn't like the eboard.
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:12.040]   You know, I tried the Samsung Instinct for Sprint.
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:16.920]   It uses a haptic touch keyboard where when you touch it, it vibrates a little bit.
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:18.640]   I like that.
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:19.640]   I like that a lot.
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.600]   I'd love to see the iPhone adopt something like that.
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:23.920]   I'm trying to get an Instinct from Sprint.
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:24.920]   Somebody told me it's a little slow.
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:27.440]   It's a little sluggish feeling.
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.840]   It is not as as not as zippy as an iPhone.
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:30.920]   It doesn't cost as much.
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:31.920]   It's $129.
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:36.720]   Well, and what we're finding out is once you'll get the AT&T iPhone data plan, you're paying
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:39.520]   a lot more for the iPhone, even than the first generation.
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:40.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:41.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:46.120]   I tried it so dishonest that he's like holding it up saying it's $199 and $299 because I want
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:47.120]   to buy one of these.
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:48.600]   Well, it works, doesn't it?
[01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:49.600]   Give away.
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.880]   And then I was like, I told my assistant like we buy 10 of these like $199 ones and give
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:55.120]   them away like as a contest or something.
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:58.440]   He's like number one, you can't buy them without the plan.
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:18:59.440]   Right.
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:04.080]   Then he finds out they're possibly going to let you buy them at the plan, but it's $599
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:05.080]   and $699.
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:06.320]   It's hugely expensive if you don't get the plan.
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:08.720]   So does that mean it went up and cost?
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:09.720]   Yeah.
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:12.720]   Well, because the plan did the plan is so much more expensive.
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:15.520]   AT&T is making big bucks on the plan.
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:18.960]   Was the 8 gig edge iPhone 599 originally?
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:19.960]   Yes.
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:20.960]   Because it was the bigger one.
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:21.960]   The first one was 599.
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:22.960]   So the price hasn't gone up.
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:23.960]   No, it's the same.
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:24.960]   It's the same.
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:26.800]   And then the 16 gig is 699.
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:28.880]   But basically, I don't understand where you're getting.
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:30.960]   You're getting a 599 iPod, right?
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:33.840]   Because if you don't activate, what are you going to do?
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:35.680]   You can activate it just without a contract.
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:36.680]   That's what you get.
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:37.680]   You don't have to sell.
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:40.040]   But they aren't going to allow the go phone deal.
[01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:41.040]   Right.
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:43.320]   And they're actually not going to sell immediately the phone.
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.320]   Right.
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:45.320]   You can't get it Friday.
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:47.320]   You have to wait a little while.
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:52.560]   But what's interesting, I have a Samsung Blackjack with AT&T.
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:58.480]   And the cost of the data plan is essentially the same as the way it will be for an iPhone.
[01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:04.880]   And initially, Steve Jobs said, "Oh, well, we're not only changing the way that phones
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:08.960]   are designed, but we're changing the way they're sold and the way plans are done, we're
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:09.960]   simplifying it."
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:10.960]   No.
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:11.960]   And that's just all gone out the window.
[01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:12.960]   Yeah.
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:13.960]   It's completely gone out the window.
[01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:17.920]   I think they really want to get that 10 million phone mark.
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:18.920]   They want to hit that mark.
[01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:22.560]   Well, Apple's going to be making a lot more money off at this time, aren't they?
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:24.640]   Because they lose the monthly.
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:26.800]   They lose the monthly that they were getting from AT&T.
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:28.960]   But they get the subsidy.
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:31.960]   They get more money upfront.
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.640]   So I'm not sure how it works out for Apple.
[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:38.280]   I don't know if we'll ever know because they're not talking.
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:41.400]   It's just ridiculous that they had to tie this to one network.
[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:42.400]   So stupid.
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:46.880]   That was my biggest complaint in day one is why didn't they do like Nokia does and other
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:49.320]   companies selling Unlocked GSM phone?
[01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:50.320]   Absolutely.
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:53.400]   Just make it 500 bucks and anybody can buy it and you put it on any system.
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:54.480]   Do what you want with it.
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:58.800]   And then they're not in bed with the evil AT&T, which I think has got to hurt them a
[01:20:58.800 --> 01:20:59.800]   little bit.
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:04.000]   Does the symptom of the cell phone carrier, climate in the US though that they couldn't
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.160]   do this without getting into that game?
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:08.160]   I don't know.
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:11.120]   It's a symptom of them wanting to increase their quarterly earnings so desperately that
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:13.000]   they'll sell out the users.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.840]   I mean, they needed to have, I mean, when you have iPod as your, you know, opening
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:19.440]   act, you need to do something really big.
[01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:23.000]   You know, like everybody needs an iPod.
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000]   Everybody needs a phone.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.160]   They're desperate to get the revenue in on this thing.
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:31.040]   So, you know, they're sort of caught on this trap where they just have to make a lot of
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:33.640]   money in order to impress the, impress Wall Street.
[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:36.720]   So they just squeeze every last dime out of this thing.
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:39.800]   But I think that it's, it's too short term thinking.
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:43.520]   They should have gone for the long term thinking and made this thing like ubiquitous like the
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:44.520]   iPod is.
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:45.520]   What do you use Jason?
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:46.520]   What is that?
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:51.160]   Is that if they, if the carrier system wasn't the way it is now, it wasn't so locked down,
[01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:54.400]   they could have made a lot of money doing it that way, but they, they don't think they
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:55.400]   can't.
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:57.600]   You can't do it with CDMA, but you could do it with GSM.
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:02.360]   You got T-Mobile, T-Mobile's 3G is off as.
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:03.360]   It's awful.
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:04.360]   Is it?
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:05.360]   Well, it's not just awful.
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:06.360]   It's, it's right.
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:07.360]   It's unavailable.
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:08.360]   Yeah.
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:09.360]   Yeah.
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:10.360]   You can't find it almost anything.
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:11.360]   They're ramping up.
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:12.360]   AT&T's was very rare until like yesterday.
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.360]   I've said T-Mobile for a couple of years.
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:14.360]   It's pretty good for me.
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:15.360]   I'm a T-Mobile customer.
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:17.360]   I use a BlackBerry on T-Mobile.
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:18.360]   I use a curve 8320.
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:19.360]   I have to use BlackBerry.
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:20.520]   I get 400 emails a day.
[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:24.160]   It's, you know, and the, you, I can't write more than two words with that goddamn iPhone.
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:25.160]   No, exactly.
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:27.160]   Which is a Europe practice, Jason.
[01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:29.040]   That's exactly what Steve Jobs told me.
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:30.600]   I was like, I can't type on this thing.
[01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:31.600]   He's like, oh no, you'll be fine.
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:32.880]   You know what was the killing?
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:37.880]   The killer for me was I cannot, it will not let me write LaPorte.
[01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:42.280]   My last name, it says you're LaDork.
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:43.280]   It will, I go.
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:44.480]   You know Apple just programmed it.
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:49.440]   LA and it, and then P and then it will not do an O. You have to go around and around and
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:52.960]   around until finally it says, oh, you want to hit the, because you know what they do,
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:55.800]   they actually do this predictive thing when they make the keys smaller if they think
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:58.800]   you couldn't possibly want that key.
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:00.560]   And it's real, that was the killer for me.
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:03.920]   It's like, I can't even spell my own fricking name.
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:06.760]   So I don't know if I'll buy a 3G personally.
[01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:09.560]   So, Jason, you're going to stick with the BlackBerry.
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:10.960]   I'm looking for the bold.
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:12.920]   That new bold is a beautiful BlackBerry.
[01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:13.920]   Bold, beautiful.
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:15.920]   Bold and beautiful.
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:16.920]   How about you Tom Merritt?
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:18.880]   Yep, I'll be getting an iPhone 3G.
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:19.880]   Okay.
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:20.880]   So it's 50/50.
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:23.480]   It's, it's partly that I like the iPhone.
[01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:24.480]   Jason's going to buy 10.
[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:25.480]   He's just not going to use it.
[01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:27.680]   I'm going to buy one and I use it as my backup phone.
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:29.120]   I, sometimes I carry both of me.
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:33.240]   So I, I use the brain, BlackBerry's primary and then I take the AT&T chip and I either
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:36.760]   bring the Nokia and 95 if I wanted to do streaming video or I bring the iPhone to
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:39.560]   find to say that they need a lot of surfing.
[01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:44.800]   Well, the reason the black are right now with the opera browser is really dope for surfing
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:45.800]   the web.
[01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:50.120]   Well, the reason that I really want one is I think, you know, the iPhone is going to
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:55.920]   become just as the Mac OS is platform with the, with the, with the app store and I want
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:59.400]   to be able to write about it for my column and for my blog.
[01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:00.600]   I want to cover these apps.
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:02.280]   I'm going to use my touch for that.
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:04.640]   I'm going to use my touch for that.
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:08.840]   Yeah, but I suspect there will be some that may interact with the phone and the
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:09.840]   phone.
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:10.840]   Yeah.
[01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:11.840]   Yeah.
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:12.840]   Yeah.
[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:15.280]   Did GPS, I actually admit I am watching with great interest what they do with location-based
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:18.360]   applications in the GPS and that could put me over the top.
[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:24.360]   If for instance, a Twitter clone or a friend feed clone that automatically placed me using
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:26.760]   the GPS, I'd be very interested in that.
[01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:30.400]   I think just have it turned by turn directions that you don't have to get anything for your
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:31.400]   car.
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:32.400]   You just set your iPhone in there and turn it off.
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:36.240]   You could do that with the instinct, but they say they won't do that with the iPhone.
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:39.240]   Well, they'd say they won't do that with the iPhone.
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:40.240]   Really?
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:41.240]   Here's the, here's the deal.
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:43.080]   That was the deal with Google Maps.
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:44.840]   The Google Maps doesn't give you turn by turn.
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:47.680]   It will give you directions, but it won't say turn left to your turn right door.
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:48.680]   It won't say anything.
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:51.040]   It's just Google Maps, but you could do that on the free phone.
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:53.520]   They'll show a break iPhone 3G and then we'll get that.
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:56.720]   What they're saying, and I think it's a battery issue, is that the GPS turns on, gets a fix
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:00.800]   and turns off and does that periodically to save battery life.
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:01.800]   Gotcha.
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:04.400]   And so that eliminates that turn by turn thing.
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:08.440]   So what you do is you ahead of time, you say, here's where I am, here's where I want to go.
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:11.960]   And then Google Maps, as it would if you were on your browser at home, generates a list
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:15.480]   of directions, which you could then, you know, press 3, 3, 3, 3 and go through or whatever
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:16.480]   it is.
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:17.480]   That's really interesting.
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:23.360]   Just like the original iPhone, the real value in the iPhone 3G will be once it's jailbroken.
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:24.760]   Yeah, interesting.
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:31.160]   Well, this is the second application that if that's the case, if the battery is the case,
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:38.720]   where battery life has been crippled because by them not going to the state of the art
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:42.840]   type of technology, you know, they could have gone to 3G on the first phone, didn't want
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:44.560]   to because of battery life.
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:48.160]   They're not, they're not enabling turn by turn GPS.
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:55.200]   But worse than that, their terms of their SDK license says you may not write a turn by
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:56.800]   turn program for the iPhone.
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:57.800]   Right.
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:01.840]   You can't do background processes either, which pulls out a lot of the current apps that
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:04.480]   are on the jailbroken edge iPhone.
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:08.480]   So that's why I'm looking forward to a jailbroken iPhone 3G.
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:09.480]   You're a brave man.
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:14.480]   Honestly, my iPhone edge became three times as useful once a jailbroke.
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:15.480]   Yeah.
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:16.480]   I agree.
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:17.480]   I agree.
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:18.480]   All right.
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:19.480]   Well, we'll watch with interest.
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:23.280]   And I hope you guys will if you're in the line in an Apple store or at AT&T store, you'll
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:26.440]   call in and tell us what it's like and give us some background.
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:30.680]   We want to see the scene and we will be giving away iPhones.
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:34.280]   So make sure you tune in starting at around noon to 1 p.m. Pacific time.
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:40.360]   That's around 3 or 4 p.m. Eastern time, 1700 UTC on Thursday, July 10th.
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:41.920]   That's when the party begins.
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:44.920]   It should be very interesting at Twitlive.tv.
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:49.880]   And what would be cool is like when Scoble starts doing his live streaming from quick,
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:51.520]   you can actually with the Tri-Castor.
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:52.520]   I'll do it.
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:53.520]   Yep.
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:54.520]   We'll pull it up.
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:58.320]   And then you basically get to see like Robert Scoble yelling and screaming like in a rangatang
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:01.280]   inside a Apple store that he got a phone.
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:03.480]   Oh, your Tri-Castor can work with quick?
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:04.960]   No, but I could pull up any.
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:05.960]   Well, I'll show you.
[01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:08.400]   I'll press F7 right now and I could pull up any computer screen.
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:11.400]   So if there's a video on quick, I just show it.
[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:12.400]   All right.
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:13.400]   Well, I'll be using quick.
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:16.520]   I have quick on my blackjack and I'll send me an email.
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:18.720]   You send me a say, I'm on quick right now.
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:21.160]   Come chat with me and I'll pull it up.
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:23.080]   No, no, that's really irritating.
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:24.560]   I hate it when you do that.
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:25.560]   I hate Jason.
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:28.520]   Sorry about that.
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:29.800]   I'm on quick right now.
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:30.800]   Chat with me.
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:31.800]   Chat with me.
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:32.800]   I'm lonely.
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:33.800]   I'm doing it.
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:34.800]   I'm doing it.
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:36.600]   You've got to be my friends and come chat with me.
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:38.000]   I'm drinking with Gary Vayner.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.000]   Come chat with me.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000]   Isn't that just the default?
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.880]   Oh my God, you guys have to come and train to find out.
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:43.880]   Can you change it now?
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:44.880]   I think you could change it now.
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:45.880]   Yeah, you could change it.
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:46.880]   Yeah.
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:49.120]   I don't have it enabled, but yeah.
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:50.120]   Yeah.
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:51.120]   All right.
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:57.600]   So you're on Twitter as D Silverman and of course at the Houston Chronicle, it is blogs.cron.com.
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:02.120]   I'm sorry, blogssingular.cron.com/techblog for Dwight Silverman.
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:03.560]   Yeah, it's blogs with blogs.
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:04.560]   It is blogs.
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:05.560]   All right.
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:07.440]   I better fix my lower third graphics.
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:09.240]   I like I use a little technical term.
[01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:12.320]   You got to notice that lower third graphics layer.
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:13.320]   There we go.
[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:14.320]   We've got that all fixed.
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:15.320]   Augstalkron.com/techblog.
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:16.320]   That's right.
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:17.720]   We'll got to switch that video there.
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:26.320]   Tom Merritt is the chief fact totem at Buzz out loud and twit at cnettv.com.
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:30.760]   And also he runs the sword and the laser pointer with Veronica.
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:32.000]   The sword and laser.com.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.760]   It's a sci-fi book club.
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:37.720]   It's a watershed down is your new book.
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:40.720]   Yes, book seven is Watership Down.
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:42.720]   That was just posted fresh.
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:44.080]   Did Veronica pick that?
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:45.800]   Yes, it's a dictator.
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:47.080]   It's a dictator choice this time.
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:48.440]   I'm going to say because, okay.
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:50.200]   She gets to choose whatever she wants.
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:51.560]   And then the next one I get to choose.
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:52.560]   Fuzzy bunnies.
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:54.040]   The sword and laser.
[01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:55.040]   You're going to do anithm.
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:56.040]   You've got to do anithm.
[01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:57.040]   The new Neil Stevenson novel.
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:58.040]   I already committed to that.
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:28:59.280]   In September, right?
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:00.800]   Yeah.
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:04.040]   And then you can find me on Twitter, Plurk, Friend Feed, wherever the.
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:05.320]   Are you Plurkin more now?
[01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:07.280]   Do you Plurk more than anything else?
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:09.680]   I probably Plurk more because of the response stuff.
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:13.560]   I probably post around the same amount as Twitter.
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:14.560]   I wish I could somehow.
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:15.560]   Oh, you know what?
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:17.640]   You've got to put your Plurk stream on your friend feed.
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:20.760]   This is sound so nerdy.
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:22.360]   So sorry.
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:23.400]   And Ping FM.
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:25.840]   You could Ping FM to Plurk and Twitter at the same time.
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:26.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:27.360]   Ping FM.
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:28.360]   Yeah.
[01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:29.360]   Oh, that crazy stuff.
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:33.080]   Anyway, it's A-C-E-D-T-E-C-T if you have any interested following me for whatever reason.
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:35.560]   A-C-E-D-T-E-C-T.
[01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:36.760]   Don't make the mistake.
[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:37.760]   I'll make it easy.
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:38.760]   There's no detect.
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:39.760]   No.
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:40.760]   Yeah.
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:41.760]   It's like you and Merlin Man.
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:42.760]   You guys are kind of reverse snob.
[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:43.760]   It's anti-marketing.
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:45.240]   Yeah, it's reverse snobbery.
[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:47.920]   It's like, find me if you can.
[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:51.720]   I might be on Twitter if you could only decipher my code name.
[01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:53.120]   It's all in the journey.
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:57.600]   I thought you got a free Merlin Man with every Twitter account.
[01:29:57.600 --> 01:29:59.160]   With every hot dogs, ladies.
[01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:00.160]   Yeah.
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:01.160]   All right.
[01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:02.160]   Holland Man.
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:04.560]   Merlin Man came to be on the RealDil podcast at CNET.
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:08.600]   And the security guard took great pleasure in calling me and saying, "Mr. Man is..."
[01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:10.800]   He loved that.
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:12.880]   "Mr. Man is here."
[01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:13.880]   Merlin.
[01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:19.720]   I don't know why I'm plugging Merlin, but anyway, hot dogs, ladies.
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:21.280]   And you are A-C-D-Tect.
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:25.360]   And Jason is unaccountably Jason Calicanis on Twitter.
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:26.360]   You can also...
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:27.360]   51speople to follow.
[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:28.360]   You can also find him at mahalo.com.
[01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:29.360]   Mahalo.com.
[01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:30.360]   Mahalo.mahalo.com.
[01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:31.360]   Mahalo.
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:35.240]   Mahalo.com.
[01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:39.240]   You might have been to me over at Audible at any given point in time.
[01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:40.880]   I recorded a book, guys.
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:43.400]   We'll make that my pick when the book comes out.
[01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:44.400]   You were worth a book?
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:45.400]   Yeah, it's very short book.
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:48.480]   Wait, an E-book?
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:50.560]   No, it was like a little golden riding hood.
[01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:51.760]   It was a kid's book.
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:53.680]   They couldn't afford the rights to little red riding hood.
[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:55.000]   So I'm not kidding.
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:56.360]   It's little golden riding hood.
[01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:57.360]   Are you serious?
[01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:58.360]   I'm not kidding.
[01:30:58.360 --> 01:30:59.600]   Little red riding is not public domain.
[01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:00.600]   I don't know.
[01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:01.600]   Was it voice over talent?
[01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:02.600]   It didn't hire me.
[01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:03.600]   I did it for free.
[01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:04.600]   It was really fun.
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:05.600]   I enjoyed it.
[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:06.600]   So...
[01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:07.600]   Give us a time.
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:08.600]   Let me hear you say something.
[01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:11.320]   Um, with the wolf talk like this.
[01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:14.600]   And the grandma talk like this, she was kind of Jewish.
[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:15.600]   It was fun.
[01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:16.880]   I had a really good time doing it.
[01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:18.120]   And the wolf was...
[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:19.920]   I'm sorry, what a transvestite or something.
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:20.920]   What was that voice?
[01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:21.920]   Exactly.
[01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:25.160]   The wolf was a bad, bad man.
[01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:29.120]   I'd love to see you in something like a chiffon or something else.
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:30.120]   Yes, you look beautiful.
[01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:32.120]   The wolf is such a good good...
[01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:34.120]   The better the teacher is.
[01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:35.120]   What?
[01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:38.120]   I got some Gucci on park.
[01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:40.120]   I'm a very bad wolf.
[01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:42.120]   I'm a bad, bad wolf.
[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:44.120]   I have 30s evil guy.
[01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:45.120]   I can't...
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:46.120]   What a damn wolf.
[01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:49.920]   I am coming to nature.
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:50.920]   I didn't try that.
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:51.920]   I could have gone that way.
[01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:53.880]   I just, you know, I made a different choice.
[01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:55.520]   I went a different direction.
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:58.440]   Something just in the chat room.
[01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:00.440]   Jason Luyo should have their own podcast.
[01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:01.640]   They just do stupid voice...
[01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:02.840]   The stupid voice cast.
[01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:04.640]   Welcome to stupid voice cast.
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:06.280]   I'm Leo LeBouette and he's Jason.
[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:07.280]   Not Jason Gallicannus.
[01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:08.280]   We're here today.
[01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:09.280]   Wow, it's Zany.
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:10.280]   It's a Cucan.
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:11.280]   Hey, look at our guest.
[01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:12.280]   Whoa!
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:13.280]   Look at our guest.
[01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:14.280]   Wow!
[01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:15.280]   Whoa!
[01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:16.280]   He talks like that.
[01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:17.760]   Most important radio across America.
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:18.760]   It's a secure one.
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:19.760]   Exactly.
[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:21.600]   You imagine, like, going to dinner with Adam Curry?
[01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:25.600]   Like, I'll have the Caesar salad resting on the side.
[01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:26.600]   And it's crazy.
[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:28.160]   I'll take a refill on this ice tea.
[01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:29.160]   Wow!
[01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:31.440]   Leo, off to you.
[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:32.880]   What do you have in the lunch?
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:36.520]   If you ever get a chance to go to one of the radio conventions, like the Gavin Convention,
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:39.040]   actually you signed me up for NAB.
[01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:41.200]   I'm going to be doing that, taking your place at the...
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:42.200]   Oh, you did?
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:43.200]   You know?
[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:44.200]   At the Jacobs Media, yeah.
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:45.600]   That's like the elite thing there.
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.360]   Like, Jacobs Media is like a consultancy.
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:50.080]   So they do, like, the top 50 people at...
[01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:51.080]   It's going to be fun.
[01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:52.080]   Or top 100.
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:53.080]   It's going to be fun.
[01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:54.080]   And they do this thing.
[01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:58.120]   So I basically did my keynote last year or two years ago was they asked for advice.
[01:32:58.120 --> 01:32:59.760]   And what they should do in the Save Radio.
[01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:00.760]   And I said, "Give up."
[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:01.760]   And they love it.
[01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:02.760]   And they loved it.
[01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:05.600]   And they loved it because they told us, "Forget about radio.
[01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:07.360]   Radio secondary, like this conversation we had."
[01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:11.360]   I said, "Just make podcasts and look at yourselves as audio producers."
[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:15.960]   See, I can't say that because I'm trying to get them to carry my radio show.
[01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:16.960]   So that's the thing.
[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:20.200]   It's like, don't worry about terrestrial radio anymore.
[01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:21.200]   It's audio.
[01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:22.200]   And it's audio worry.
[01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:23.200]   That's exactly right.
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:24.200]   You can get people to listen.
[01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:25.200]   That's exactly right.
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:26.200]   Exactly.
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:27.200]   Yeah.
[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:30.600]   NPR's got to have more readers on itunes than they do on their...
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:32.600]   Oh, I'm sure that's the case.
[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:33.600]   Yeah.
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:34.600]   Yeah, they're...
[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:35.600]   I'm not sure that's the case.
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:38.200]   They have a lot of listeners on the radio too.
[01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:39.200]   They do have a lot of listeners.
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:44.000]   I also think that podcasts are largely an East and West Coast phenomenon where there
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.800]   is a lot of mass transit.
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:47.360]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:50.120]   I'm saying they don't listen in Houston?
[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:54.520]   They don't listen at the same level that they do in San Francisco and New York.
[01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:55.520]   You know, that would explain...
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:59.440]   The only reason I disagree is based on the Buzz out loud audience, our concentrations
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:01.520]   are not in San Francisco and New York.
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:03.840]   They are so all over the place.
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:05.040]   They're in Oklahoma City.
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:08.560]   There are a lot of people in Utah.
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:10.120]   And these people have commutes too.
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:13.200]   They're just driving on the highway for 30 minutes.
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:17.240]   There's some big commutes in the middle of this country.
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:19.960]   And everybody's got an iPod connector in their car anymore.
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:21.200]   That's not such a big deal.
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:22.200]   I mean, the cheapest car come...
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:24.760]   That's where the majority of the people listen to us is in the car.
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:27.040]   Well, except those are in the newer cars.
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:31.320]   In the older cars, which a lot of people still have, you got to plug in one of those stupid
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:37.680]   cassette adapters or you need to use the weak FM transmitters in the newer cars.
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:39.960]   Yeah, but not everybody's got that newer car.
[01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:41.160]   And I really think...
[01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:42.560]   Houston has huge commutes.
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:44.360]   We have 30 or 40 minute commutes.
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:45.360]   I just don't think...
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:50.880]   I want everybody who's listening to Dwight right now on Twitter to email him and tell
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:53.080]   him how wrong he is.
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:55.080]   If you're in Houston...
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:56.080]   Yeah, no, no.
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:57.720]   If you're on the coast, forget it.
[01:34:57.720 --> 01:34:59.480]   Do not email Dwight.
[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:02.240]   Only if you're in the middle slice of America, not just Houston.
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:03.240]   St. Louis.
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:04.240]   St. Louis.
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:05.240]   Chicago.
[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:06.600]   And tell me that you're listening to it on the podcast.
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:07.600]   Listen to podcast.
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:08.920]   You tell him how wrong he is.
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:11.280]   But also tech people are different from the mainstream.
[01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:12.280]   I agree.
[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:13.680]   That's why I do a tech podcast.
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:14.680]   Tech people are different.
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:15.680]   That's good.
[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:16.680]   That's why I do a tech podcast.
[01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:21.720]   Although I got to point out, the one category that's beating us is NPR.
[01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:22.720]   They are right now.
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:25.640]   The top podcasts are all NPR podcasts.
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:28.800]   We're right there in number two, but they're the top podcasts.
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:30.840]   So many technology people are crazy liberals.
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:31.840]   That's why.
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:32.840]   Yeah, that's probably it.
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:34.560]   Hey guys, I really want to thank you.
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:36.080]   I hate to turn off the microphones.
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:40.440]   I'm having too much fun, but we've got to Tom Merritt at Buzz Out Loud at cnettv.com.
[01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:44.280]   Dwight Silverman from the Houston Chronicle Blogs.com/techblog.
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:49.160]   Jason Calicanis from Mahalo Daily and Mahalo, M-A-H-A-L-O.com.
[01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:50.160]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:51.160]   Another Twit.
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:54.760]   He's in the can.
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:36:04.040]   NBC just bought the Weather Channel.
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:06.680]   Yeah, I saw that.
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:10.600]   They bought CBS decided to buy cnet instead of the Weather Channel.
[01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:11.600]   Is that really true?
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:12.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:13.600]   That was the choice.
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:17.440]   That was apparently what I was considering.
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:18.440]   Yeah.
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:20.440]   So it'd be C's the runner up.
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:23.120]   That must make you feel damn good.
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:24.120]   Damn good.
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:25.120]   Yeah, right.
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:26.720]   Because you are the Weather Channel.
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:28.520]   But I have a ton of what?
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:29.920]   It's better at the puppy channel.
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:30.920]   Forget it.
[01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:32.920]   Hey, don't knock the puppy channel.
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:34.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:36.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:38.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:39.920]   I want a Twit.
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:40.920]   Do you want a Twit?
[01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:41.920]   All right.
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:43.920]   Do you want a Twit, baby?
