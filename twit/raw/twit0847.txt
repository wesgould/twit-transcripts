[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   Coming up on Twitch, it's me Ian Thompson standing in for Leo Le Porte who's gone south of the border.
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.520]   Joining me will be Padre in Vatican City and Brianna Wu over in Massachusetts and we'll be
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.840]   going over the latest Facebook name change and of course the leaks from the Facebook papers.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.800]   Windows XP turned 20 this week. We'll be discussing what it was like to use and why people are still
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.360]   using it. We go hands on with the new MacBook Pro, one who's actually been delivered to one of our
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.360]   guests and we'll be discussing Jeff Bezos' plans for Orbital Reef, the new Orbital Space Station,
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.080]   which will be a mixed business park all up next.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:54.640]   This is Twitch, this week in tech episode 847 recorded on Saturday October 30th 2021,

[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.760]   Hello, this is another Twits. Leo LaPorte is down in Mexico at the moment so I should be standing
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.720]   in and filling his very large shoes. My name is Ian Thompson from the Register and we have a
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.120]   trio of technologists on the show this week. We have from the Vaskin City, Padre, a familiar
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.280]   person here on the Twit thing and Briana Wu over in Massachusetts looking very dashing in that cap.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.960]   That's right. I'm going to be leading a revolution today on the show. I hope you all join me.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.960]   We're overthrowing the studio. Leo's not here. And now finally the power will be to the people
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.480]   meaning us. You're letting the cat out the bag. I've got the army outside at the moment.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.800]   No, I've got the cats. Well, yes, you have the vatte cats, of course, which sure
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.400]   always a tremendously fun thing to hang around with and I'm sure they're used to.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.640]   Okay, so we've got an exciting show this week. When we were originally planning it out, we'd think
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.160]   the Facebook papers had just come out and it's kind of like, "Yeah, okay, we'll cover it, but let's
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.520]   try and do something else." And then of course, Zuckerberg dropped his bomb and Facebook is
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:34.480]   metasizing, it seems, in possibly the bad way. So we'll be covering that. It's of course it's
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.440]   been earnings week as well, so there'll be some elements of that. We'll be looking at Jeff Bezos's
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.360]   plans for a business park in space and the right to repair movement got a big step forward this
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.560]   week, so that'll need covering. And of course, the rest of the news from around the tech industry
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:58.400]   and so whatever else comes up. So let's crack on with Twitter. Okay, so the elephant in the room,
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:05.360]   this week after facing a week's and weeks of very bad news stories over the Facebook papers,
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.360]   former British deputy prime minister Nick Clegg has been earning his million-dollar salary and
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.520]   taking a fall for it just as he did for the liberal party back in the UK. And yes, so we appear to
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:24.080]   have Facebook is no more. There is now Muse. It's all metaverse, sorry, it's a meta sorry,
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:32.000]   rather on the views. It's all, it's basically a good time for a name change, it's a change it seems.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:41.440]   So will it work Brianna Padre? You know, I'm very much reminded when I was coming of age here in the
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:49.040]   United States, we had a company called ValueJet in the 90s that had an absolutely abysmal track
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:55.760]   record to the point that there were a late night punch line year after year and people just didn't
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:03.120]   want to fly that airline. So what did they do? Did they radically change their policies? No,
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.240]   they changed their name to something else and just kept on conducting business because
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:15.040]   their name was so toxic, they couldn't move any move anymore forward with it. I'm really
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.480]   reminded of that story with Facebook and some reporting came out this week that I think is so
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:26.240]   interesting. Did y'all read about the moment that Zuckerberg decided to change the name?
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.560]   It actually happened when Oculus released the Quest 2 and there was an uprising with people
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:39.360]   saying, no, no, no, no, I do not want to have a mandatory Facebook account in order to use this
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.440]   gadget. I don't trust Facebook, it's completely corrupted. Don't get us in the same boat. And
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.160]   according to reports, that's the moment that Zuckerberg was like, okay, we need to rebrand
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:57.040]   the entire company. So is there a predictable move? Yes. But I also think it really signals an
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.640]   abrogation of any responsibility to fix the very serious problems at that company.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:09.920]   Yes, I mean, there are a couple of different ways to look at this. First is standard corporate
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.720]   growth at some point means that you're going to rename your company. It happened to Google.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.960]   Just because you need to have something that encompasses all the different subsidiaries that
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:26.000]   you're going to buy or develop. I understand that. That's fine. Every business is going to have that
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.960]   growing pain. There is another element here, which is Facebook and Zuckerberg have realized
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:38.720]   that Facebook has become toxic. The actual name is a negative connotation. That's amazing. To me,
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.920]   that's amazing for a company that's this big. It's something like Comcast or Cox,
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.280]   these companies that are huge that everybody uses and yet everybody hates. That's what Facebook has
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:55.520]   become. And I don't see that changing with the name. I mean, yeah, it worked for ValueJet because
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.960]   there are so many small carriers that can essentially do the same thing. You've commoditized that service.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:06.560]   But with Facebook, there are so few large social media companies and there are none like Facebook.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.600]   Everyone knows what they're using. It doesn't matter if you're calling it metastasize or meta or
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:17.120]   muse or whatever it is. It's still Facebook. Well, yeah, I mean, this is it. I thought it was very
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:24.480]   interesting from the standpoint of they're now grouping Facebook and Instagram. They're just apps
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:30.720]   and everything else is meta. I wondered whether that was possibly so when if the regulators do
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:37.280]   start coming in, then they can say, "Okay, we'll just sort Facebook out, but we're all meta now."
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.360]   It's really different. But I mean, as you say, Google has done this with Alphabet.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:49.440]   I mean, back in the UK, we had the Windscale Nuclear Reactor, which caught fire and spread
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:57.040]   fallout all over Europe and they changed the name to Winska to Sellafield. So I mean, name changes
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.160]   are commonplace. They do work, but will it get Facebook out of this hole?
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:09.360]   I don't believe it will. There was a document that came out this week basically talking
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:18.720]   about Facebook's crisis with trying to hire engineers. In 2020, they put out a huge call for
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:25.680]   new talent. And by this year, it had fallen flat. Right now in the United States, there's a real,
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:33.120]   the Facebook name is so toxic. They're not able to even recruit talent to the company to fix
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:38.720]   their existing problems. And that's why I thought it was so notable that no disrespect to European
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:44.720]   engineers, y'all are great, but they're actually having to go to other countries to recruit talent
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:50.080]   to build what they believe is going to be the metaverse. They put out a call to hire, I believe
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:56.160]   it was, was it 10,000 or 20,000 engineers? It was one of those numbers. But just imagine
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:01.280]   how much work they could do repairing their product here if they invested that kind of
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:08.640]   infrastructure in it. It's clear that this is just a, it's a distraction for Zuckerberg in his view,
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:14.000]   and he's not serious about fixing it. So he's moving on to the next thing. So I think it really
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.640]   signals that Facebook is not serious about addressing their toxic problems and their toxic
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:25.360]   perception in the public. And I think we should expect them to continue in this way.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:35.840]   Could we take one step back just to play devil's advocate here? It's popular to hate on Facebook,
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:41.360]   because Facebook has done so many things that we, the, the technorati, the digiarate have catalogued
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:46.400]   over the years. But to the common person, to an average person who just uses Facebook because
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:50.480]   it's where they find their friends and their family, has Facebook really done that much wrong?
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:56.400]   I hear it all the time when I'm trying to explain how big data can be so dangerous in the hands of
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:01.360]   unscrupulous operators that they don't care if so and so has their data, or they don't care if
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:08.160]   so and so is analyzing their, their internet usage patterns. For us, the branding change is
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.000]   ridiculous, because it doesn't change the underlying company. And like Brianna says, it doesn't change
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:21.200]   the underlying toxicity. But to mom and pop Joe and, and, and Jan Smith, who are using Facebook to see
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.960]   photos of their grandkids, is there really a problem that Facebook has to, has to fix?
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.120]   Well, if you live in mind, if you live in my own, Mar and you know, you're part of the genocide
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:36.240]   that went on there, which Facebook has admitted that it helped foster. I think, yes, you might
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.240]   have something to say about it. But I get what you're saying. I mean, my mom uses Facebook and
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.880]   even after the name change, she's still going to carry on calling it Facebook. And she's really
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:51.200]   not that bothered about what they've done. But I mean, whether or not this is, is something which
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.720]   we should just accept or I mean, we're technologists. We're supposed to be pushing, you know, pushing
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:01.120]   against this sort of thing or pushing for it if it's good and Facebook ain't good at the moment.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:07.120]   You know, I don't know. I think it's kind of like cybersecurity, you know, there's never going to be
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:12.000]   a market based solution to fix cybersecurity because neither the buyer or the seller
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:20.960]   are incentivized to pay for it, right? It's only going to be fixed with regulation. And I think
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:26.480]   expecting the general public to have a, you know, forgive the phrase, Robert, but come to Jesus
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:33.360]   moment about these issues. I just, I don't think it's ever going to happen. I don't think it's their
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:39.360]   role. You know, we don't expect automobiles to get better gas mileage because consumers are out there
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:46.400]   demanding it unless we're in a different country, it might have higher petrol prices than the United
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:52.560]   States. You know, this is a, it's a job for regulators ultimately. I think it's a, it's very
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:59.840]   dark and disturbing to see Congress has basically abrogated their responsibility to do even bigger
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:06.640]   oversight here. At the end of the day, Zuckerberg, he's one of us. He's a technologist. And he's
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:13.600]   made a decision to see no evil here, no evil. He's clearly going to continue on this path.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:19.280]   He doesn't think it's a problem. So I just, I think he's, he's beyond help.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:26.000]   It's fairly dark. I mean, it's, he just, he just seemed to have a certain amount of
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.560]   willingness to ignore this, I would have thought. I mean, what's the view in Europe,
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:36.880]   Padre? Is this playing well, is this playing well over there or are people just like, oh, it's
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:44.720]   zuck again? I think there actually is a bit more visibility into what's happening with Facebook
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:49.040]   and what's happening with big data in Europe, at least in the circles in which, in which I,
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:55.520]   I reside. The strange thing is though, even though people have a better understanding of the issues
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:02.480]   of privacy and how Facebook has been violating that trust, they keep using Facebook products.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.560]   So the same people that I talk to, and they're completely with me when they understand,
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:12.480]   when I try to explain what happened with Cambridge Analytica and what happens when big data is used
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:19.520]   to do crowd analysis, why that's bad. And they understand that and they get it and they send that
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:26.800]   information to their friend over WhatsApp. So there's a better understanding, but I think we're still
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:32.640]   at that point where it's too convenient. And no matter what, even though Facebook seems to be
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:39.600]   the harbinger of doom for freedom in the Western world, it's just too good for them to pass up.
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:45.440]   And that actually really scares me. Myself, I mean, I disagree wildly with what Facebook's
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:51.280]   been doing, but I still use it because it's the easiest way to keep in contact with friends and
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:58.560]   family back in the UK. But yes, I mean, for all the bad press they've received, and it really
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.640]   hasn't hurt the user stats that much, although looking through their financial figures this week,
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.880]   I have noticed there's a drop off in European use and average revenue per user, which
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:11.600]   could be getting people slightly worried. But in terms of the people that could actually change,
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:16.960]   so this regulators and governments, the US government seems to have basically said,
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:22.880]   they levy to $5 billion fine, which what three months profits for Facebook, I think they can live
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:28.000]   with that. Probably funded down the back of the sofa, to be honest. But I mean,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.840]   regulators seem to have completely abrogated their responsibility. And I mean,
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.840]   Breonna, you're very up on the political scene. Is there any sign of this changing under the
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:40.800]   Biden administration? Unfortunately, I don't think so. We have seen
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:47.920]   we have seen better digital policy and better policy coming out of the FCC overall.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:54.720]   Thank God, it could hardly be worse. But I don't get the sense that it's really priority.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:01.840]   I do want to say though, it occurs to me that there is another group of people with the power to
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:09.760]   influence Facebook. For me, I run a political pack and I write giant checks to Facebook constantly,
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:14.400]   because they're such an effective vector for getting political advertising out.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:21.200]   Yeah, I've been thinking about this. I wonder if there's space for advertisers to come together
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:28.160]   and demand more from Facebook. First of all, they charge us entirely too much.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:33.920]   They're not transparent on the metrics. They've shown time and time again that in the case of
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:40.960]   video advertising, they actually cannot be honest about the metrics at times. So I wonder if there's
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:47.760]   space for people that write Facebook's checks to come forward and say, we demand more,
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.760]   we demand better products forming a kind of alliance.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:58.480]   Well, Facebook is famously the company that said, if a video opens and is played for three
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.360]   seconds, then that counts as a view. Right. 100%
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.440]   completely bizarre. Potter, sorry. You were.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:08.960]   Well, okay. So I deal in this space because one of my responsibilities is the new media outreach.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:14.800]   That's that's Twitter. That's Facebook. That's Instagram. And the first they rejected my appeal to
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:19.520]   just not do anything with Facebook. They said, no, we have to be in Facebook. It's it's where we get
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:23.600]   the most views. It's where we get the most traffic. It's where we get heat. So I get that. It's
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:32.720]   it's a necessary evil. But trying to get them to not pay Facebook money to push their posts is
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:38.240]   it's an uphill battle. I just I can't do it anymore. Because Facebook gives them that little
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:43.600]   dopamine, even for them, it's a dopamine hit when they see what kind of reach a video gets or what
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:48.160]   kind of reach a post gets. And even when I try to explain exactly what that data means and it's
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:52.160]   not actually what they think it is, it doesn't matter because it's it's someplace where they
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:57.040]   can put their money and they see a result. It may just be a result in charts, but it's still a result.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:01.920]   I don't see that mindset changing. And again, these are online people. These are people who
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:07.520]   understand the issues with Facebook. And yet they're still not able to wean themselves. So I would
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:13.280]   love the idea of getting advertisers together and using their collective power to say, look, we want
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:19.200]   we want to advertise with you, but we need these changes. I just don't see it happening until
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:24.320]   there's one big player that stands up and says, okay, I'm going to put my flag in the ground.
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:29.440]   I'm going to start it. Come with me. Yeah, well, I mean, this is it. They've got such a diverse
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:34.800]   advertiser base, though, that is that there aren't really there isn't really a couple of big players.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.000]   You could say change this or we're going to pull our revenue because they need to pull it in from
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:44.320]   other areas, surely. Yeah, I think that's true. And that's the problem. Yeah, for me, with political
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:50.080]   advertising, I forget what the number is, but you know, something almost 70% of voters
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:58.080]   from my party or on Facebook, like that is the easiest way to reach them with very targeted ads.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:08.000]   So I think you're correct. It's an uphill battle. I just I there's a real need for leadership, I think,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.760]   from all areas. I mean, you know, regulators, I think we need to have users demanding more.
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:20.400]   I really backed into a corner because even basic tools like corporate oversight,
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:25.520]   I think a lot of different boards would have kind of insisted on different change of direction a
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:33.200]   long time ago. Zuckerberg controls 51% of shares. So like this is a guy he's even beyond the reach
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:41.440]   corporate oversight from his board. So it's it's I don't know. I do think I almost wonder if like
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:49.600]   can you tell from the Almighty, like we maybe we maybe you can help us out. But I feel like we
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:55.360]   have very few options. Yes, I mean, it is ubiquitous and it does seem to be out there pretty much
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:59.040]   nonstop. And there's not a lot that you can do about it. Even people who hate it carry on using it.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:06.400]   And then when you throw in Instagram into the into the equation and WhatsApp, it's an almost
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.880]   reach. I mean, is it possible to break it up? Is it even advisable to break it up into separate
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:19.040]   units? I feel very strongly it is. Yeah, go ahead. Absolutely. I mean, it's this is not an operating
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:23.920]   system. This is not okay, we're gonna we're gonna cripple functionality. These are actual
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:29.600]   independent services that in no way, shape or form need to actually exist within the same company.
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:36.400]   WhatsApp will work just fine, apart from Facebook, apart from Instagram, and the other Facebook
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:42.560]   properties. The only thing that binds them together is that desire for the central company for meta
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:50.000]   to have all that data in one archive in one place that they can do analysis on. So yes, it is possible
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.880]   to break them up. And actually, I think it would be better to break them up. I think services would
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:20:00.240]   start working better if there wasn't always that Facebook tie in. I know for a fact that
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:07.200]   once the Oculus started requiring a Facebook login, I gave up. I just know I don't need another piece
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:13.120]   of equipment that's going to require me to use an account that I only have because it is tied to
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:19.040]   other services. Interesting. I mean, one of the things from the from the meta announcement was that
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:23.600]   they're getting rid of the Facebook login for an awful lot of apps and allow all be meta.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:30.480]   And I'm sure they'll treat that. Very carefully. Same problem again, you know, it's just
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:36.960]   like, oh, wait, we're changing the way that you log in. Great. You've still got to give you the data.
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:42.160]   Look, the handcuffs are now going to be red. So it's OK, right? Because I know you didn't like the
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:48.560]   black handcuffs. So now that they're red, we're all good. 100%. Can we, I know we're focused a lot
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:54.480]   on like the Facebook component of it in the ethical considerations there. I'd love to talk about the
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:21:01.360]   meta announcement itself because as a game developer, I have a lot of thoughts about this specific vision
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:08.080]   coming from Zuckerberg and Facebook about about why I think it's specifically flawed.
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:14.320]   So, you know, what are the I think an assumption? Well, first of all, let me just tell everyone
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:20.320]   out there in Twitland. I've spent a lot of time developing prototypes in VR to kind of figure out
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:27.120]   what kind of game designs work in VR, what kind of ideas work in VR, what kind of stories can you
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:35.440]   tell in VR because it's a very different environment. All the there's a special set of rules that you
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:40.800]   have to start thinking about, like, automatic is I optimizing draw calls towards the center of the
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:47.200]   screen and the way you tell stories, the way you move around. So I've thought a lot about this.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:55.520]   And I think that there's an underlying assumption with many VR and like metaverse enthusiasts
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:04.080]   to think that VR is like the ultimate level of immersion, right? Like you read Snow Crash or you
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:10.240]   read Ready Player One and you imagine this world where you're out there fighting with swords or,
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:15.120]   you know, looking for an Easter egg and a recreation of all these different things. And
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:22.880]   that's the core assumption, right? That this is somehow more immersive than what we have today.
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:34.320]   And what I can't personally square that with is if that's true, then why haven't we seen the
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:43.440]   early adopters flock to using this more than we do traditional screens, traditional games?
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:50.000]   Because it's very clear. You know, this isn't just an opinion. The metrics will show this out.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.600]   That you can have the very, very best games in the entire world and the best experiences in the
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:01.920]   entire world. But it's not a place that people want to spend a lot of time in. They'll be there
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:07.280]   for like 30 minute bursts and then they'll get away and they'll want to go back to the real world.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:17.280]   I actually don't believe that VR is inherently a more immersive experience than looking at a screen.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:23.280]   And if you think about that from like a game development point of view, it makes sense. Because
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:29.840]   most VR experiences, they require you to be in this first person view and it marries you to a
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:35.120]   certain set of mechanics. Working with your hands, shooting things with your hands, kind of
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:40.880]   representing your real body in the world. We all know if we're sitting back with a controller
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:47.760]   and playing the video game, you kind of get lost whether you're doing combos or you know,
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:55.440]   playing a third person story like NASA effect. It has exactly that quality of immersion. So,
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:03.920]   a conclusion I've come to is that VR inherently, it gives you, it almost limits the amount of tools
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:10.480]   that designers have to give you the immersion. The second part of this that I'm really not sold on
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:16.560]   with the metaverse vision is the fundamental reason that I think social media is so addicting
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:24.080]   in the first place. That it gives us all the illusion of feeling connected to real people.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:30.560]   I feel like I'm in friends with many of the people I talk to frequently on Twitter, right?
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:36.320]   These are people that represent themselves with a real icon of themselves. They promote their
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:42.320]   real life work. Sometimes at least to real opportunities like doing a Twitter together today.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:50.800]   That is a real connection. The Zuckerberg vision of this seems to be cartoons and this like
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:25:00.320]   this inauthentic representation of yourself that's once removed from that authentic connection.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:06.400]   So, I think you come to this same question. Like, is it more immersive? Are you going to feel like
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:12.000]   you're forming a more human relationship with a person if you're talking to them
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:20.880]   through a cartoon avatar of them? I don't really think that's true. I think that it's just simply
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:28.400]   a different way to do that. So, you know, with those two issues side by side, I'm just not sold.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:34.640]   The metaverse is going to do anything better than what our current social media and games and
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:39.680]   tools that we have today are going to do. Well, this is it. I mean, virtual worlds are all well
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:44.240]   and good, but they've got to be a believable and be immersive and have something that which,
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:49.280]   you know, no one else can offer. It's, I mean, Padre, are you going to be putting a virtual
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:54.320]   vascular out there and which people can wander around and gaze at all at the arts of centuries?
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:59.760]   There have been requests and there actually have been some technical studies and I've
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:06.480]   basically told them we can do it. I don't know why you want to do it. To get into the discussion,
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:13.680]   I think something that Brianna brought up is why has it VR caught on? And I think it's because
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:20.400]   VR comes out of a fundamental misunderstanding of how we absorb information. Right now, I'm sitting
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:25.680]   in front of my setup and it's a pretty typical setup. It's got three monitors. I'm monitoring
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:32.720]   a couple of different things at the same time. I have a sense of where I am and when I'm working,
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:38.720]   I can easily move from one piece to the next. I can absorb things through my peripheral vision
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:43.200]   and I can take breaks so I can look away from my screens when I need to sort of concentrate on
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:48.800]   something. VR doesn't let you do that. VR is always there. That's that's the whole idea. It's
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:54.640]   always connected, but that's not the way humans work. We like to be connected. We don't like to be
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:27:00.880]   constantly connected. As far as forming relationships, I think one of the issues that we've seen,
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:05.120]   because we study this, my organization studies this greatly, you know, there's a lot of surface
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:10.400]   connectivity where people think they're forming a relationship because they have
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:14.160]   communicated with each other. They've sent messages, they've sent tweets, they've sent posts,
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:19.360]   they've maybe exchanged a couple of photos, but that is fundamentally not how you build a
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:25.760]   relationship. A relationship actually requires real risk. So VR, especially the way that it's
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:33.040]   being envisioned by Facebook, might be fantastic at selling you a product. It is still horrible,
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:39.120]   absolutely horrible at working or building relationships. You see, would would augmented
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:45.520]   reality deal with the problems of that? I mean, for both of you, the idea behind augmented is that
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:50.320]   and this is something which came up in the Metro announcement, it was just like,
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.040]   okay, so you can have VR when you want to be fully immersed,
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:57.840]   AR when you're out in the physical world, as they push it, or reality as the rest of us do.
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:03.360]   Would AR help with that? And certainly based on from what we've seen so far,
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:10.800]   AR hardware is still very, very prototype phases. I mean, they announce Project LaZair, the AR
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:17.440]   glasses as part of the announcement. But I've yet to see a pair of AR glasses which you'd actually
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:26.400]   could use or could wear in any conceivable format. Yes, but the idea of AR, I'm sorry,
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:31.600]   just the idea of AR is so much better. The idea of being able to be out in the world and receiving
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.600]   information about the things that you're seeing or the things that you're interacting with,
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:40.080]   that is so attractive to me that I can actually see real world applications.
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:44.720]   What am I putting on a VR headset? You are closing yourself out from the outside world.
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:51.360]   So for me, AR from the start has always been far more promising. Yes, much more difficult
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:56.560]   because the technological hurdles that you have to leap are much higher. You have to make a
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:01.680]   system that is usable outside. It has to be light. It has to be stylish. It has to have a long
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:07.360]   battery. It can't be connected to a huge computer on your waist. Now, those things are just technical
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:13.280]   problems. But if you put those aside for a second and just admit that at some point,
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:19.040]   we will meet those technical problems, the promise of AR far, far exceeds VR.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:25.040]   Is that true in the gaming world, Brianna? Well, I think it's a different set of assumptions,
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:30.720]   right? I definitely agree. The promise is there. I think if you're thinking about game design,
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:38.160]   there's less of a difference between the way you would design an AR game and a VR game.
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:44.400]   They're the same set of assumptions, right? Your physical body in the space. What is exciting to
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:51.040]   me about AR is it's essentially, it's the same idea of social media, right? You're given 2D information,
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:57.520]   maybe it can be slightly more 3D. But essentially, you're giving a more convenient way for us to
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:04.080]   always be addicted and streaming this information straight into your brain receptors.
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:09.520]   I think our social media addiction shows that there's a real tendency in human nature to want to
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:17.520]   receive information constantly. I think many of us as techies, it's almost addictive, right?
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:26.240]   So I do agree with you that that's going to be more addictive. But that is not a space where
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:34.560]   Facebook is going to be able to create a universal experience or monopoly in the same way, because
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:39.760]   you could have any application kind of there in the bottom of AR playing in the corner of your
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:46.160]   classes and many, many years down the road with neural link implants, where it's going straight
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:53.200]   into your brain stem. John Carmack had some fascinating comments on this to come out of
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:31:01.200]   Facebook the other day, because even though he works for Facebook, mince in very public comments
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:06.880]   saying he thinks that they're completely going about this the wrong way. And just in case you
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:13.680]   don't know John Carmack, he's the guy, one of the pair along with John Romero that launched it and
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:20.960]   did doom in the 90s. So his thought with this is you can't go out tomorrow and say, I'm going to
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:26.560]   create a metaverse. You can't say I'm going to hire 10,000 engineers and we're going to build
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:34.320]   this thing. And he likened it to the experience of building doom. If you remember that in 1995,
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:42.480]   I believe it was, they built this kind of 3D engine that had a game with it. And then along the way
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:48.960]   of building this game, there just happened to be all this other stuff that they coincidentally
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:55.280]   could do along with it. They developed doom the game, which has a purpose. And then along the way
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:01.760]   they came up with WOD files, you know, these huge files that let modders come in and create
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:09.280]   different versions of it. They came up with multiplayer over TCIP. They came up with all these
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:16.000]   innovations that really changed the industry. So what he is advocating for them to do, if they
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:22.400]   really want to develop a metaverse rather than trying to build that as the big goal,
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:30.560]   he thinks they need to bite off a small part of the problem and dedicate Facebook's huge resources
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:38.320]   towards developing that. So as a specific example, developing, you know, like what's their conference
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:44.560]   F8, I believe it is, having that entirely in the metaverse next year. Because if they commit to
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:50.800]   that, they're going to figure out how to widely deploy this to a lot of different people at Facebook.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:55.520]   They have a lot of different usage requirements. They're going to figure out spatial audio. They're
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:33:01.040]   going to figure out the infrastructure and bandwidth for a lot of people to log in for the same time.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:08.160]   And by focusing on goal, they'll get all these other technologies out of it. So to me,
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:13.360]   I think that says two things. First, obviously, that's a smarter way for Facebook to go about that.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:20.560]   But secondly, I don't really believe there's going to be a future where Facebook is the only
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:28.080]   company that develops a problem, develops a solution to a problem in this space. I think it's going to
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:33.920]   be much more akin to what we see today, where many, many startups are working in this space.
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:40.160]   You have different specialists that work on different parts of it, and ultimately,
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.400]   four or five companies getting a lot of market share.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:47.120]   Well, we're going to have to see how it develops. But in the meantime, let's just have a quick
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:52.400]   word from Leo, who might not be here in person, but he isn't in spirit.
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:57.760]   Hey, Ian, thank you so much for filling in for me while I'm in down in Mexico. But I do have to
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:04.880]   interrupt just going to be a minute. Got to tell you about Audible. Audible, Audible,
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:12.800]   audiobooks are the best. It's not just audiobooks. It's spoken word entertainment of all kinds.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:18.000]   One of my listening today, well, there is a great Dune audiobook. It's a one of Audible's
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.960]   specialties. They do dramatizations, multiple voices, acting it out. I saw the movie, then I got
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:29.280]   a hankering for more Dune. It's an Audible. Love it. Actually, I bought it many years ago,
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:33.360]   and that's one of the things I love about Audible, all my audiobooks, and I have a
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:38.640]   library of over 500 of them I can continue to listen to at any time in the Audible app.
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:43.440]   That's pretty awesome. What else am I listening to? Well, I'm getting ready for the Wheel of Time,
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:50.960]   which is Amazon Prime's next big fantasy TV show. It comes out next month. 15 volumes. I just
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:58.720]   downloaded volume six of the Wheel of Time saga. I am loving it. It's one of those titles that
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:04.160]   you're glad there's so many of them because you're just going to get immersed in a world that just
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:09.120]   you just suddenly you know these people, you know this world, you're really there. In fact,
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:14.640]   that's how I really got started with Audible. I had a long commute all the way down to San Francisco
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:19.840]   for tech TV. Sometimes I'd be four hours a day in the car, and I was getting pretty squirrely
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:25.600]   until I found audiobooks from Audible.com. That saved my life. In fact, my first big series was
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:33.200]   21 audiobooks. The very famous and I highly recommend them, Aubrey Matcherin series about,
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:39.600]   I've mentioned it before about Napoleonic War era British sea captain and his good friend,
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:44.720]   the doctor, as they sail around the world with all sorts of adventures. There's 21 of them.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:51.360]   Patrick O'Brien, the author, fantastic. The nice thing about Audible is, you know, when you're
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:56.640]   in the car in a commute, when you're doing the dishes, walking the dog, but you want to enjoy
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:02.480]   something, you want to listen, and these audiobooks or spoken word titles are so engaging. I just,
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:10.240]   I mean, I like, Lisa and I are listening together to James Missioners Hawaii. Instead of watching TV
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:14.960]   at night, we put on an audiobook from Audible. It's so great, and it's a nice thing to do together.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:19.440]   It's really wonderful. Whether you're driving, cooking, cleaning your house, or just relaxing,
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:25.520]   you can listen to amazing audio from Audible. It's the leading provider of spoken word entertainment
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:30.880]   all in one place. The largest selection of audiobooks ranging from bestsellers and new releases to
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:36.000]   celebrity memoirs, languages, business, motivation, and more. You can get original
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.960]   entertainment from top celebrity creators. Listen to Steve Martin's born standing up. He reads it.
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:47.120]   It's in his voice. It's great. Thousands of popular and binge-worthy podcasts, too. In fact,
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:53.760]   they have a new plan. Audible Plus, it gives you full access to the whole Audible Plus catalog.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:58.160]   So it's all about giving members a chance to listen to and discover new favorites,
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:01.760]   explore different formats like the exclusive Words Plus music series.

[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:32.480]   Now back to Ian and the gang. Thanks very much, Leo. Okay. That obviously
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:36.400]   don't want the show to be all Facebook, but we really should mention the Facebook papers since
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:40.560]   Francis Hagen, the whistleblower, has been speaking to the UK Parliament about it.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:46.160]   We've had a bunch of revelations, have been problems with India trying to deal with content.
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:52.400]   There have been allegations that Facebook knew that it was putting out anti-vax information.
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:56.880]   But at the end of the day, didn't we really already know this? A lot of the allegations,
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:02.320]   yes, it's nice to have Facebook's own documents confirming them, but this was stuff that was
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.560]   covered years ago. Are we really surprised by this?
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:13.040]   Surprise, no. The fact that there are mainstream media outlets that are now catching up, that
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:16.960]   actually is a little surprising because there was some discussion about whether or not they would
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:21.120]   ever be able to connect the dots and say, "Hey, wait a minute. This happened and that happened."
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:26.880]   Now, we've known for a long time that Facebook has been doing this. We've known for a long time
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:32.080]   how Facebook can sway public opinion with the types of advertisers that they accept.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:39.040]   But as I mentioned earlier in the show, the common person, the regular person who really
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:43.280]   doesn't cover technology every single day and actually doesn't really care about it as long as
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:51.520]   it works to connect them to what they want, they don't seem to care. I've seen people read these
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:55.520]   stories and say, "Oh, that's pretty bad." And then they go back to Facebook and then they go back
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:00.160]   to WhatsApp and then they go back to Instagram. So am I surprised? No, not really.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:07.600]   Am I surprised by how little this is going to change things a little bit? I was hoping that maybe
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:12.720]   this was the time, maybe the outrage was finally big enough, maybe the pain would finally be high
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:16.640]   enough that Facebook would be forced to change. That's not going to happen.
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:23.520]   I don't know. I think I'm a little less pessimistic than you are, Robert. I feel like
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:30.000]   it's like that moment in the murder movie where you kind of know that the guy did it.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:36.400]   But they can't quite prove it in court because they don't have enough evidence. And then they go
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:41.760]   and they get something comes through, someone agrees to testify. And that's the moment they have
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:47.600]   something they could use in court to put somebody away. If you're talking about regulators and the
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:52.960]   pretext that they're going to need to take stricter action, I think it's very much worth noting that
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:58.000]   Europe has traditionally been much harder on American tech companies than the American Congress has been.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:07.040]   I feel like this isn't a single report to come out or a single person to say this or a single
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:15.200]   story and the virtue or whatever. This is a pattern of behavior backed up by thousands of
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:21.200]   documents that proves that they're doing it again and again and doing it willfully.
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:27.600]   And we're going to literally spend years like tearing apart all the information that we have
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:34.720]   in here. So I feel like this is the evidence that lets us know this is what reporting has been
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:41.040]   hinting at. And it's all corroborated at this point. Here it is. Regulators go to work. If you
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:46.800]   need an excuse, you've got one. There is that. I'm just thinking back to the Snowden papers.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:52.640]   When those came out, when the Snowden archive came out, it was literally 18 months before,
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:58.880]   I'd been at Black Hat and had suggested to a former deputy director of the FBI that the US had used
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:05.840]   the echelon network to spy on commercial companies for the benefit of US companies.
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:10.560]   And he tried to have me thrown out the conference because it was a conspiracy theory rubbish.
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:14.960]   And then when the Snowden leaks came out, it's kind of like, wow, we've actually got the data now.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:21.520]   Everything we suspected they were doing, they were doing. But then after that, what did politicians
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:28.640]   do? They just changed the laws to make it legal. I'm not massively hopeful about Facebook changing
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:35.520]   these leaks actually changing things. Is that a little bit too maybe doom laden, do you think?
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:40.640]   Padre, give us some joy. I don't think I don't know. I got no joy here. It's not doom laden. I
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:47.280]   think it's just, it's very realistic. I remember one of the very first episodes of Tech News Today
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:53.040]   that it was ever on was when we were covering how Zuckerberg was going to have 51% of the voting
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:58.320]   shares of Facebook. And the comment at the time that I made was, this is great as long as you
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:04.000]   believe in Zuckerberg's vision, because there's nothing to stop him with 51%. It doesn't matter
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.600]   what the rest of the board wants. It doesn't matter what the rest of the shock, the shareholders
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:11.200]   want. He's got the majority, he's going to do it the way that he wants to do it.
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:17.360]   Now that worked really well when people were totally on board with him building up this giant
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:25.440]   network and making record profits. But now that we don't like what he's doing, that 51% is still
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:30.400]   there. He still doesn't have to worry about getting voted off the board. There is no one who can
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:36.320]   kick him out of the company. There is no repercussion that unless you were to bankrupt Facebook would
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:42.240]   actually affect his net worth. So that's where my pessimism comes into play, which is, yes,
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:47.040]   we've got the data, yes, we can now prove that Facebook was doing horrible, horrible things.
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:52.880]   But none of it was illegal. Lawmakers have no idea what they're talking about when they're
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:57.920]   talking about regulating big tech. And there's no one who can stop Facebook internally.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:03.360]   So where do we go? I mean, this seems to be the thing from some of the leaks and that, you know,
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:07.840]   engineers were saying, this is clearly what's happening. We are dropping the ball on this.
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:13.040]   We are promoting divisive content. And yes, it drives engagements, but we need to think about
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:17.760]   the longer term and sort of the image part of this. And yeah, when you've got someone who is in
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:23.040]   complete control of the company, there's no real incentive to go up against them because you're
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:28.880]   going to lose internally, at least. I mean, Brianna, you were saying a lot of Facebook is having real
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:31.760]   problems hiring at the moment. Do you think that might be a break on things?
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:40.320]   I do. You know, it's become very popular on Twitter for, you know, software engineers to
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:47.920]   tweet there. They're basically, no, I will not work at Facebook letters from recruiters when they
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:55.440]   come forward and try to get them to work there. You know, I know this is a strong analogy, so stay
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:45:01.520]   with me. But you know, there are tech companies that facilitate some truly horrific historic
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:09.520]   events, right? And I think that it should give all of us that make these things pause to say,
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:15.680]   what am I getting involved with? Am I building something that's fundamentally evil? There are
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:26.400]   real serious, credible questions from reasonable people if Facebook is fundamentally incompatible
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:34.240]   with democracy. Because since this explosion of Facebook all around the world, we have seen a
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:42.960]   movement towards authoritarianism that is terrifying. And my hope is that if the people
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:49.520]   that are skilled at this, the people that they need to build these products refuse to work there,
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:57.760]   hopefully another competitor could come along that does actually have ethics, you know, and will be
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:03.600]   held some kind of standards with the public. So I think that's a very positive development.
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:08.560]   I would encourage any software out there, engineers to, you know, follow your peers and stay the
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:14.560]   course on that. It's quite interesting. We saw a similar sort of thing when Uber was being exposed
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:20.240]   for the rather toxic atmosphere that had had in its own company. And I was speaking to a recruitment
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:26.000]   consultant, but they were saying people are now taking Uber off their resumes and just putting
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.960]   themselves down as a freelancer or something because they don't want to be associated with
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:33.360]   the company. And I wonder if that's going to be happening with Facebook too. But there will always
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:39.040]   be flax or flax around to defend it. A friend of mine did a story about IBM's involvement in the
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:45.280]   Holocaust in building, you know, the tabulation machines which enabled the Nazis to, you know,
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:49.840]   put people down in certain thing. I'm not saying Facebook or Nazis or anything, but it was interesting.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:56.560]   We got in that she got an email from IBM's chief PR person saying read the article a couple of
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:02.080]   things. First off, we pulled out of Germany in 1938. I don't think anyone really realized how
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:07.680]   bad Hitler was before 1938, which led to some hollow laughter and then follow that up with,
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:12.880]   by the way, you say our actions were deplorable. We prefer regrettable. Would you mind changing it?
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:18.480]   There are always going to be people out there who are trying to, you know, spin this right.
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:22.720]   I don't know if Facebook can spin themselves out of this, but experience suggests that they
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:30.000]   may be able to. We shall see. But yes, I mean, overall, let's try and make the show not all about
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.040]   Facebook. I would just like to bring it, bring in Brianna at this point, because I understand you've
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:40.320]   got the new MacBook Pro. Tell us what it's like. I do. It's right here. I have it right here.
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:45.840]   And last week, we finally got a decent hardware refreshes at it.
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:54.000]   I know. It's so funny. It is like holding my old 2012 MacBook Pro. It's just everything.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:00.880]   Everything they've made bad decisions about in the net last few years, they kind of rolled it back.
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:07.600]   Yeah, I've only had it since this afternoon. So I can't give you a full in depth review of it.
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:14.000]   But I can't give you some very quick impressions. First of all, the keyboard in it is excellent.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:21.040]   You know, I work on political initiatives. Most of my day is spent sending messages one way or
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:28.720]   another. So the keyboard isn't just drastically better than this scissor keyboard that they
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:35.840]   used for many years. It's better than the keyboard in the M1 Mac they introduced last year. I had the
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:41.920]   2020 model of that. So if you write a lot, I think that this is, and you have the money,
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:48.800]   I think it's an upgrade that you could very seriously consider. It's much heavier in hand.
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:58.560]   It's squared on the edges. It feels really chunky and substantial, which I think is
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:04.400]   a good thing. But I also think because it's so much heavier, that's why I personally decided to get
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:10.000]   the 14 inch instead of the 16 inch. So you know, you're going to be having a heavier,
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:17.760]   sturdier laptop. The notch, I was concerned about that. I haven't even noticed it since day one.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:24.640]   So I think that's going to be a non-factor for me. The other thing is there was a real
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:31.360]   kerfluffle this week with Dropbox who had kind of thrown it out to the community. Hey guys, do you
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:40.720]   think we should develop an Apple Silicon app for Dropbox? Dropbox currently on my Mac uses
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:47.840]   over a gig of my RAM, which is massive. That makes drone not positively better efficient.
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:53.040]   It's terrible, it's unjustifiable. All the time, just in the background.
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:59.760]   Sinking in background, in residence, it's chewing a gig of RAM according to iStat. So
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:05.840]   Dropbox quickly walked that back from their forum post saying, no, no, no, guys, don't worry.
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:13.520]   We'll be releasing this next year in 2022. But I just feel it's like, you know, Apple Silicon's
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:19.840]   been out for a while, guys, this is something I spend $20 a month on. You might want to make
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:27.040]   this a priority. But overall, yeah, I think, overall, you know, ultimately, I can't do my job
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:31.440]   without a MacBook. And I think this is an excellent version of it. Excellent. I mean,
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:36.080]   Potter, Mr. It's been a while since you're over here. Are you a Mac or PC person at the moment,
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:43.280]   or a Chromebook person? I am a PC person, 100% a PC person. But I do like the Apple hardware.
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:49.680]   I do find it funny that basically Apple just new coked the world. They released a series of
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:53.760]   MacBooks that were wanting that people really didn't like. And then they released the old
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:59.040]   MacBook and suddenly everyone loves it again. So kudos. Well done. Well done. Well, I mean,
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:04.160]   they have they have really been letting the MacBook down over the last few years. I mean,
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:08.880]   okay, there's the keyboard problems, which are many a numerous, but I mean, it just
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:14.640]   it wasn't a priority for them, it seems they were, you know, it's all about iOS and it's all about,
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:20.080]   you know, the latest generation devices. But I have yet to meet a MacBook user who someone who's
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:24.960]   used MacBook for a few years who isn't passionate about it and doesn't want to change. And Apple
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:29.920]   would giving people reasons to change. I mean, Briology, you think this is obviously you've only
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:34.560]   had it for a couple of hours, but I mean, and you're Mac based, but I mean, generally,
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:38.000]   you're feeling positive. This is something which could woo people back to the fold.
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:44.240]   I am, but you know, I mean, let's literally dive into something you just said about the ways that
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:49.840]   they've been laying the community down. You have the lack of ports that's been addressed. You have,
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:57.840]   you know, you have the keyboard that's been addressed. You have better thermals that's been
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:04.000]   addressed. It's higher up on the table. But there's something that they have and they haven't
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   addressed. And I think this really gets to the core of your question. For a long time, we've been
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:18.240]   talking about the lack of discrete GPUs in the MacBook lines. I'm a professional 3D person and a
[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:25.120]   game developer. You know, I need very powerful 3D capabilities to run Unreal Engine and Autodesk
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:34.560]   Maya on my Mac. Apple at this point have functionally seated the ground on games and professional 3D
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:41.760]   work. I'm sorry. It's just a fact. You can play Apple arcade games. They are not sophisticated enough
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:52.640]   to need a 16 core, you know, Mac, Mac's GPU with Apple Silicon inside of it. So I think this is
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:53:01.200]   the return to form that we were looking for if you use Final Cut or, you know, those kinds of
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:08.160]   that family of apps that have been really optimized for it. At the same time, Apple has
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:16.800]   given up in my opinion on gaming and really sophisticated graphics technology to the point
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:22.240]   where, you know, Robert, like you, when I do Unreal work or serious graphics work these days,
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:27.920]   I don't even try to do it on Mac anymore. I have a very expensive PC and a PC laptop that I use
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:33.520]   for that. So I think it's very good, but just know that you're not going to be a gamer on it.
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:40.560]   It's interesting that you say that because, I mean, back in the day, in the sort of the 80s and 90s,
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:45.680]   gaming was key to Apple's popularity. They did much better games than you could get on the PC.
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:52.080]   I mean, that kind of dropped off once Doom came out and everyone realized, wow, this is absolutely
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:57.040]   fantastic. You mentioned Doom earlier and I just, I lost so much time to that game.
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:03.360]   You put on a pair of headphones and you were there. So why did Apple drop the ball on this?
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:09.600]   I think it was two things. Yeah, games changed. They found themselves accidentally
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:15.360]   in charge of the biggest games market in the entire world, right? There's a tendency with Apple
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:20.640]   devices and I know this firsthand to force them to run on a very wide range of hardware.
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:28.960]   So whereas the PlayStation or PC can kind of aim for a higher end of graphical experiences,
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:35.520]   Apple arcade games really default down to this car tuning style where you could probably run
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:42.240]   them on like the iPad 3. Most of these games would vary little problems. So I just think that
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:48.480]   it's not just that the kind of ecosystem of successful games on iOS and Mac
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:55.840]   don't really require powerful graphics. Apple themselves have not really spent a lot of money
[00:54:55.840 --> 00:55:02.480]   developing these graphical APIs and tools. Remember how long scene kit and sprite kit were really
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:07.440]   the only tools an iOS developer had for these things forcing me to go to something like Unity
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:14.160]   or Unreal Engine. So the bottom line is it's just not been a priority for Apple and the technologies
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:19.040]   that they've developed and the relationships they've made with game developers and they have the
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:24.800]   outcome of the choices they made. Yes indeed. I remember when they tried to come up with a
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:31.040]   doom knock off. I think it was called marathon. It was just painfully bad. But wait, wait,
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:38.160]   because the spiritual successor to Marathon was Halo. So it did eventually become something
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:43.040]   incredible. Yeah, but on a different platform, Halo saved the Xbox to goodness sake. There was
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:48.400]   nothing else that people would play on that. But I mean, look, Leisure Suit Larry and the
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:54.160]   Lamb of the Lounge Lizards and Monkey Island, those are great on an Apple. But once you started
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:59.120]   getting graphics intensive, it just, like Brianna said, the game publishers had to focus on where
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:04.480]   they could optimize and it wasn't going to be the Apple. It's a simple zone. They actually chop
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:09.920]   that back, but we shall see. Actually, no, while we're on the topic of games, Brianna, I believe you
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:17.120]   have something really quite marvelous and en route. We have a Game of Gates series in the works as I
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:21.680]   understand it. That's correct. This is the first time I've gotten to talk about it in
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:27.840]   media. So I'm really excited about the view. So for those of you that don't know, I was one of
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:35.120]   the primary targets of Game of Gates back in 2014 and 2015, which was a concerted effort by trolls to
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:43.600]   silence women speaking out in the game industry. I've been approached many times over the years to
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:50.000]   basically come forward and turn this into a movie or a TV series or something like that.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:55.040]   I've turned it down every single one of those times, not once, not twice, not three times.
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:57:01.360]   Four separate times, Hollywood's come to my door, has offered me quite a bit of money and I've said,
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:07.840]   I can't be involved with that. And the reason was they wanted to make it, yeah, they wanted to
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:13.280]   make it like a feminist horror movie. Like one of the most iconic moments of Game of Gates that
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:19.440]   they actually put in the Law and Order episode was the man in the skull mask like sending videos
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:24.960]   to me about how he was going to murder me and my husband and my dog. Yeah, it's kind of just
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:30.400]   melodrama, right? Just not something I want to revisit. It's not something that I thought would
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:37.280]   add to the discourse. So this company came to me mind-dry it and they were like, well, how would
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:43.600]   you do a Game of Gates TV series? I think the reason we're still talking about Game of Gates
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:54.240]   all these years later is because our failure to act then has really led to the failure of many
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:58:01.360]   of our systems today as we see politics kind of breaking down all around us. Because Game of
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:09.680]   Gates wasn't really about death threats. It was a fundamental change in how we argued online
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:16.640]   and how extremists could kind of hijack a conversation in bad faith and bring some really
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:22.400]   terrifying policies to bear. I just want to walk you through a short list of things that have happened
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:30.800]   in the United States since Game of Gates. You had A-chan, which was born, and A-chan directly led
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:37.440]   to the Christchurch massacre in New Zealand where 49 people were brutally murdered by someone who
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:43.280]   was radicalized on A-chan, which again directly was formed because of Game of Gates, where he
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:48.560]   live streamed it and became inculcated with these white supremacist ideas. You have one of the
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:57.200]   primary targets, architects of Game of Gates and the harassment campaign, Steve Bannon, who literally
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:05.520]   helped Donald Trump get elected in 2016 and brought these kinds of troll wars to bear,
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:12.320]   which have poisoned the United States politics and have made it so we really can't tell which
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:21.600]   end is up when it comes to issues like vaccines. You have the QAnon movement, which again is directly
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:30.320]   led to many of the people behind Game of Gates and A-chan. This QAnon movement in the United States,
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:37.760]   this cult, which again is hijacked social media, that has directly led to many events in the
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:47.200]   United States like January 6th. What I wanted to do was to take Game of Gates and to tell a story
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:53.920]   about how American politics got to where they are today. To talk about this choice we made and that
[00:59:53.920 --> 01:00:01.120]   the Obama Justice Department made back in 2014 and draw the line every step of the way
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:09.200]   with using myself as a narrator but using largely fictitious characters to kind of represent these
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:15.840]   different points of view. Why did the game industries fail to stand up for women employees? Why did the
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:23.760]   Justice Department fail to act? Why did companies like Facebook fail to seriously invest in addressing
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:32.720]   disinformation and harassment? Why was the media so unable to respond to Steve Bannon's particular
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:41.600]   use of disinformation? How were our ideals in America about free speech twisted and used against
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:47.840]   us? That's the story that I'm working with Hollywood to tell, this streamable series talking about
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:54.160]   how our institutions are failing us and why that's directly why the United States is broken today.
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:01:01.040]   That sounds fascinating. Have you started recording or is it a scripting stage at the moment?
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:06.960]   The way it works is you have a pilot, the pilot is written with the arc of the first season
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:12.560]   and what we're doing now is basically bidding it out to different major production companies.
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:19.600]   I can't tell you which ones we're working with yet but some of the most major
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:26.720]   studios have written some of our favorite shows that actually one of my no for fact you like a
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:32.480]   lot because we've talked about it before. It's at that point where it's finding the right production
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:39.040]   studio to basically spend the money to make this happen. Excellent stuff. We'll look forward to that
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:44.480]   certainly. Coming up later on the show we're going to look at Jeff Bezos' business parking space.
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:49.120]   But in the meantime, here's another word from Leo. Let me interrupt, if you don't mind.
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:54.000]   Let me interrupt for just a moment. Hi, it's Leo. Thank you Ian for filling in for me while I'm
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.840]   gone. You know what I'm bringing to Mexico? Am I tripped with me? Of course I bring it everywhere
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:04.960]   with me. Express VPN. Did you see this study the FTC just came out with it said internet service
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:13.920]   providers are shocking spying on their customers, gathering information, selling it to marketers,
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:21.440]   even like personal stuff, location information. You know, you don't really have much choice in
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:28.320]   ISP. If you're one of customer one of the big ISPs is doing this, it's not much you can do. I don't
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:33.680]   expect you to switch ISPs, but I think a good solution would be to use Express VPN.
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:40.480]   Prevent your internet service provider from snooping on your internet activity with Express VPN.
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:44.800]   It's so fast. It's so easy. You can even put it on your router and protect your whole household.
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:50.160]   It's it's a simple app that works on your smartphone and your computer, even smart TVs,
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:57.200]   even routers to protect you, encrypt your data so that the ISP can't see it so that hackers can't
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:04.320]   hack you. And I love it because it gives you access to content that's restricted geographically.
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:10.720]   Express VPN is the best absolutely best VPN provider. They have there in I think 90 plus
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:15.760]   countries. So you can see content in any of those countries. It's very easy to use one big button
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:22.640]   on the app. You're connected and it's so fast and this is important. You want to go with a VPN provider
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:30.320]   that frankly is making enough money so that they don't have to snoop on you like your ISP does.
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:35.680]   And they can invest in infrastructure so that they're fast. That's Express VPN. And it's still a
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:40.000]   great deal. That's a seven bucks a month. I'll tell you how we can get that deal. It's the number one
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   VPN service, according to CNN, according to the Virgin's, the only one I use is the one I'm bringing
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:51.040]   down to Mexico with me to protect me. Doesn't slow down your connection. It doesn't log what you're
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:55.760]   doing. It can't their trusted server technology means they cannot write to the disk. They cannot
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:04:01.760]   log what you're doing. And they're regularly audited so that they're so that you know their
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:08.800]   privacy policy means what it says that their trusted server works as advertised. It is absolutely
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:14.640]   the trustworthy VPN. You can't say that about all of them. So stop handing over your personal data
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:20.320]   ISPs and the other tech giants who mine your activity and sell off your information. If you
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:26.720]   want to protect your privacy, protect your security and watch some Netflix out of Japan or England,
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:32.720]   protect yourself with the VPN I use and trust to keep me private online Express VPN. Go to express
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:41.920]   VPN.com/twit spell it out e X p r e s s v p n.com/twit you'll get three extra months free when you
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:49.760]   sign up for here. This is the one I use the one I recommend express VPN.com/twit go there right now
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:55.760]   to learn more. Now back to you Ian. Cheers, Leo. Leo is down in Mexico for the day of the dead.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:02.000]   And I suspect possibly recreating the iconic scene from Bond, but still that's a story for
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:08.880]   him when he gets back. Now further, well, a non Facebook news and other things. We saw that Jeff
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:14.720]   Bezos has a Blue Origins company and a couple of other partners, including Boeing, are now talking
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:19.600]   about by the end of the decade putting the first commercial space station into orbit,
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:24.080]   which they described as a mixed use business park, parts hotel, part business center,
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:31.920]   past reef past a part research facility. It's a quite challenging proposition considering
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:35.680]   that Blue Origin can't get anything to orbit as yet with their current rocket systems.
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:42.400]   The passenger systems from Boeing haven't yet worked in feeding indeed their passenger capsule
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:46.080]   is back at the factory because it failed on it that failed on its last attempt to try and get into
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:53.040]   orbit. Brianna Padre, do you think this is a viable idea? Should we be trying to build business
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:06:00.880]   parks in a little bit? Go on someone gently. Would I like them to? Yes. I mean, I love to see it
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:06.240]   because that's the vision of my childhood. Everyone's in a space station. Everyone's
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:13.600]   orbiting either the Earth or the Moon or an Lagrange point. But in terms of does it make
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:20.480]   financial sense? Not really. I think we've proven that with the ISS. Yes, there's some
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:28.160]   interesting experiments, but it's far too expensive to escape our gravity well to have anything in
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:33.360]   a business park just so that it can be in space. It's going to be a prestige thing. It's going to
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:39.120]   be something that's used by the wealthy so that they can do PR shoots. But other than that, I mean,
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:44.400]   it's not really viable. The level of technology that we have, not just booster tech, not just to
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:48.480]   get out of the gravity well so that you're actually in orbit and not just falling quickly,
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:56.640]   it's not there. And more so, it's not going to be there until we stop using chemical propellants
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:02.640]   and neither Blue Origin nor SpaceX or no-nor-NASA or any of the agencies are anywhere near that
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:08.960]   level of technology. So interesting idea, sure, for science fiction, not in my lifetime.
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:12.160]   Interesting. I mean, Brianna, if you've got the chance for an orbital holiday,
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:18.320]   would you take it? And do you think anyone else? Oh, yeah. Oh, wow.
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:23.520]   Yeah. No, Frick, I talk about that all the time. Like this theoretical thing where
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:28.800]   nailing comes, you get to jump on a spaceship like the Ingardians of the Galaxy. Better believe I'm
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:37.760]   going. So I, Robert, I do share your pessimistic appraisal of the situation. I do think it's worth
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:43.920]   noting there are some unique things that can be done in space from a commercial standpoint.
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:49.840]   You know, my own husband works in biotech. I helped develop the coronavirus vaccine and there are many
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:56.640]   kinds of drugs that could best be developed and manufactured in a zero-g environment.
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:03.280]   So there are all kinds of manufacturing issues like that. So I do think there's commercial value
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:10.080]   for that. I don't mean to get political though, but this news does come out the exact same week
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:16.160]   that we are talking about a very substantial billionaire's tax here in the United States
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:22.080]   that would be almost impossible for them to avoid in the way that it's written. And, you know,
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:30.720]   personally, if I got to choose between Jeff Bezos developing a hotel in space or taxing Jeff Bezos,
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:37.440]   so we could fund NASA much more aggressively and have the public way in and do a lot more space
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:44.960]   exploration and development there, I would choose B all day every day. So I hope that's the way the
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:49.120]   dice rolls there. Well, indeed. Also, can I geek out for just a second here?
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:54.960]   When you're dealing with space, there's primarily two issues that we have right now. I mean, well,
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:09:00.720]   three, the first is the propellant getting out of the gravity well. But if you're in orbit or even
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:07.440]   on a lunar body, power and heat, you build up heat and it's almost impossible to get rid of it.
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:14.720]   And your power budget is incredibly limited. So I'm big on manufacturing in space. I mean,
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:18.880]   I love the idea that there are certain things that can be made better in a zero-g environment.
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:25.120]   But having a zero-g environment that provide both the manufacturing capabilities and the power to
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:31.120]   run the equipment and the ability to remove the heat that the equipment generates, that's not
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:37.360]   just a business park. I mean, that's building a factory in space. So again, I mean, that's
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:42.960]   several factors of complexity above what's being proposed as a business park.
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:47.440]   Well, this is it. I mean, I guess you get nuclear reactors up there to provide power so you don't
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:51.120]   have to rely on soda, but that's a whole new kettle of fish going on.
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:57.600]   Well, see, even then, even then, because our nuclear reactor power right now, unless you're
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:03.920]   dealing with a radiothermal isotope generator, is basically steam power. It's a steam plant
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:11.120]   that uses a nuclear fire instead of burning something. The problem is none of those plants
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:15.120]   work unless you can get rid of the heat. That's how you have to condense the water. So if you're in
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:21.520]   space, it actually becomes far more difficult to do something like nuclear power. I mean,
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:27.680]   essentially, the only thing that works is solar. And you can't create enough PV space
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:30.560]   to run a standard factory with just solar power.
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:34.560]   It's interesting. So we're going to have to wait for the space elevator or is it a...
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:40.080]   I'm all about the space elevator. Give me the space elevator, please, or just a big rail gun so I
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:46.560]   can shoot payloads into low-Earth orbit. Well, Brianna raised an interesting point on this,
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:49.840]   because you write, the billionaire tax proposals did come out this week. Obviously,
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:55.600]   the tech industry is very likely, the leaders of the tech industry are right in the firing line on
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:11:03.040]   this. I mean, from the proposals that they have, it doesn't... I mean, it's not as though Elon
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:07.040]   Musk or Jeff Bezos is going to be hanging around with a cup out, so I ground central station. I was
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:11.920]   trying to pay off the mortgage that way. But I mean, it does seem a bit rich that,
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:16.880]   particularly for Elon Musk, has been very vocal against it this week. And considering the guy
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:20.800]   did get a certain amount of government subsidies just to get his business off the ground, quite
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:26.160]   literally, it does seem slightly more key just to say, "Well, actually, yeah, but I'm not that keen
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:31.600]   on this tax business." Do you think he's going to go through? Is Congress actually going to act on this?
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:37.840]   I think it's up to Joe Manchin, unfortunately. And I think we're going to get more information
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:45.280]   about the text of the bill this week. And fingers crossed on that. I think what I would like to see
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:50.720]   is this isn't my analogy, but it's one that I've heard frequently. A lot of these billionaires,
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:57.920]   it's almost a Batman situation where they... The company that Wayne Enterprises, where they make
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:02.560]   all their money, causes all these problems for society. And then you have to have the billionaire
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:09.040]   Batman go out and stop all the consequences from it. Personally, what I would like to see is more
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:15.520]   money taken from the billionaires, where we as the public can kind of decide which way this goes.
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:21.120]   And just one more thing about this, Robert, as long as we're talking about the nitty-gritty details
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:26.720]   of how we actually do something like this in space, one of the things that we've tried to figure
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:34.240]   out for a long time is how to stop the loss of muscle mass in space, because you go up there in
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:39.520]   your muscles atrophy. And one of the things that I'm so proud of my husband for is while he was
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:47.040]   working at Novartis here in Boston, his name is actually... He helped develop the patent for one of
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:52.720]   the drugs that's going to do this. They came up with the drug and you can literally, according to
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:59.440]   the patent, it causes you to just automatically generate all this muscle mass. And they see it,
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:04.320]   and they're like, "Oh my gosh, people are going to be using this to abuse sports." And it's kind of
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:09.440]   like blow all these things. I would say that was my first thought as well. Right. Yeah. No, no,
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:17.360]   I'm training for space. But this drug could be very helpful for getting this long-term letting
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:21.920]   humans live in space. It's interesting. We have a bunch of drug depastranauts who are managing...
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:28.560]   But it is a serious problem. It takes what? Six to nine months to get to Mars? Same to come back.
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:34.240]   That's an awful lot of muscle mass to lose. And particularly if you're... I mean, also thinking
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:40.000]   longer term, if you're actually born on Mars and you grow up with that kind of gravitational stress,
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:44.000]   you probably couldn't come back to Earth unless you've got some serious muscle development going on,
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:50.320]   because the gravity would just crush you. I mean, is it... If we're going to become a space-faring
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:56.080]   species, as I hope that we do, it's obviously going to take some fairly serious physiological
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:04.240]   changes in humanity. And also, where are we going in terms of how that's going to equalize out when
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:07.840]   things get back to Earth? But I have to say, Brianna, when you heard it, when I heard when you told me
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:13.520]   about that drugs, my first thought was post-sports people are going to be on this like a rat-spa-drain
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:20.800]   point. If I remember correctly, they were trying to figure out ways to let sports teams try to
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:26.080]   detect it ahead of time, because they knew it was going to be such a thing that would be a piece.
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:32.000]   So put a marker in the trunk so that it shows up. Right. Yeah. There they could also help elderly
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:37.120]   people, right? You fall and break a hip. It's because you lose muscle mass. So there we go.
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:44.080]   Yeah, we shall have to see. But yeah, well, hopefully we'll get out there. We're starving in the
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:47.840]   midst of plenty at the moment, considering the most asteroids can send enough metals to deal
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:52.400]   with the markets for quite some time. But still, readers have pointed out that, of course, we could
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:56.160]   have the spinning space stations that would engender a certain amount of gravity, but that
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:02.160]   requires a massive space station to actually get it in organized. I mean, I love 2001, but
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:08.640]   we're a long, long way from that. I was sorry, going to party. We don't actually have the
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:14.240]   material science to do that yet. Spinning a space station is a way to generate a force that will
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:22.640]   resemble gravity, but the force that you would experience on the hub of that spinning structure
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:30.240]   would tear any current material to pieces. So it looks great in sci-fi, but not incredibly
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:33.760]   practical. There actually is a show that deals with this really, really well.
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:39.040]   If you've read the Expanse series of books or even watched the show, that's actually something
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:45.760]   that it builds into it. That was Abraham put that into the writing of the show. So that much is
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:49.920]   actually realistic. That's interesting, because I mean, when Arthur C. Clarke was regretted the
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:56.240]   introduction of the transistor, because when he got his idea for Spelite for satellites,
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:00.800]   it was based on valve technology. That's why he thought that space technology,
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:06.240]   or sorry, manned space flight, would become essential basically for the maintenance of satellites,
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:12.240]   because somebody would need to swap out the vacuum tubes. Once they broke, and in later years,
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:16.800]   he was kind of like the transistor really mucked that up. You can just send machinery up there now.
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:22.720]   It's painful, but yes. Well, we shall have to say, and not even carbon-carbon nanotubes could help us
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:26.160]   out of this one, it seems, but we will hopefully the material scientists are on to it.
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:31.280]   Now, we've had other good news this week. It's every three years, the US
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:37.600]   Copyright Office and the Library of Congress comes up with exemptions to the Digital Millennium
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:45.120]   Copyright Act. This basically says that under the DMCA, then you're not allowed, you're technically
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:50.000]   not allowed to tinker with stuff, even if you bought it. The right to repair has been severely
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:56.160]   curtailed. Now, we have a bunch of new exemptions of things that we can look at,
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:01.680]   things that we can repair. They've clarified the language on whether or not you can repair,
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:05.760]   on what kind of vehicles you can repair, what kind of medical devices you can tinker with,
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:10.880]   and most importantly, from a security perspective, the kind of security tools that you can use.
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:18.800]   Breonna, in terms of how our latest, this latest three-year menu has come up, were you generally
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:24.720]   positive or negative about the thing? Oh, 100%. It's fantastic. My own state of
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:31.920]   Massachusetts has really led the way on right to repair laws. I was just absolutely thrilled to
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:39.760]   see this. I really think Lister is out there may not know. I love to restore classic portions.
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:47.120]   It's just my favorite thing in the world to do. The tools and the lockout you increasingly have
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:54.720]   with more and more modern portions. It's gotten to the point where you can't work on your own
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:18:02.160]   cars. It's impossible to get the software to do it in even independent shops. They charge such
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:08.400]   strikingly high fees for just the tools to go in there and fix it. It's just not a very
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:14.560]   tenable situation. Let's be clear about what this is. It's a scam to get you to go spend three
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:22.320]   times as much at the dealing. I was very happy with the changes that they made. I think that all of
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:27.680]   us don't just have the right to repair the things we own. I think we should have a right to access
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:32.960]   parts and tools to repair the things that we own. I think if we're talking seriously addressing
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:39.680]   climate change, addressing our culture disposability has got to be part of that and maintaining the
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:44.160]   things that we buy for longer. That's interesting. The reader just pointed out that apparently in
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:50.640]   Massachusetts, Subaru stopped offering certain vehicles in Massachusetts following laws on this.
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:54.880]   You wear that at all? Yes. That is actually a thing. That's outrageous.
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:19:03.440]   You're right. There it is. Padre, you'd love to tinker. Is this right up your alley as well?
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:09.360]   Oh, absolutely. I've been down with the right to repair since before the movement started.
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:14.480]   It comes down to a culture of ownership. Do you actually own the things that you buy? Are you
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:19.280]   leasing them? Are you borrowing them? Do you have the ability to do with it what you want after you've
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:31.280]   paid your money to own it? It's strange to see how companies have used copyright law that never
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:35.440]   ever intended to cover their industry, their product, their whatever it is that they're selling
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:44.160]   to keep you from doing that. I use the car repair analogy because I know Brianna is so down with it.
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:52.960]   I remember when I repaired my first vehicle, it was a Dosson 310. It was like a 1984 Dosson 310.
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:58.320]   It was a piece of junk. Everything was manual. The only thing that was electric in it was the
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:03.040]   battery. That was literally the battery in the spark plugs. It was so much fun to tear it apart
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:11.200]   and put it back together and learn how parts worked. Then I got a Toyota Corolla and I tried to do
[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:14.560]   the same thing to it, but it already had an electronic harness in it that was tied to the
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:20.000]   electric fuel injection. I couldn't even buy the manuals to tell me how the stuff worked.
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:26.800]   That actually required me to be a dealer to be able to buy it. This was back in the '90s.
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:35.840]   That's when I realized, "Wow, this is really a racquet." You purchase something for a tremendous
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:41.120]   amount of money, and then you can only fix it with them. If they had their druthers, you could only use
[01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:49.040]   gas purchased from their dealerships. Yes, I will push back any right to repair. I will push back
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:52.640]   against any company that says that they have a right to tell me what I'm going to do with
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:58.160]   something that I purchased. I don't understand people who don't get upset about this.
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:04.320]   I had to calm down. People who were like, "No, that's fine. I'm like, I don't get it. What are you
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:10.720]   spending your money on?" Do you actually own that? Do you want to own it? If so, then you have to be
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:17.200]   with me on this. Well, when they were designing the original Apple, Steve Jobs was very much about
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:22.400]   we should not allow people to repair and upgrade their own kit. I remember when it came out and
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:29.760]   when the whole DMCA thing first kicked off was a run large. You have music and music ripping.
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:36.160]   You remember those old adverts when CDs came out? It's like, buy to own for the rest of your life.
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:42.960]   Then it kind of changes. Well, you own it on this particular format. If you try and digitize it so
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:46.720]   you can listen to it elsewhere, that's against the law and you can't be able, you can't be allowed
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:51.520]   to do that. I think you're right, Breonna. This is Ern and Padre. This is basically a scam as far as
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:58.160]   I can see. It just seems to be moving very slowly. I'm so happy that you brought up the
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:02.480]   old music industry commercials. Do you remember there was one that was like, you wouldn't shoot a
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:08.320]   cop and steal his gun. Why would you copy a track off the radio? I'm like, wait, what? What did you
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:13.920]   just tell me? If you like that, it's the same response. You really should watch the British
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:18.240]   show called the IT crowd or the IT crowd depending on how. Oh, yes. Yes. The FBI could
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:22.960]   the adverts in that. It's like, you wouldn't kill a policeman and steal his helmet and then go to
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:29.520]   the toilet and give it to him. It's just like, it was beautifully done. But that kind of moral panic
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:35.920]   built up. Companies, as you say, Breonna, have been very, very quick to Capital Right. Okay.
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:42.400]   No, you can't do this. You can't do that. One of the first things when you get a car is to
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:48.160]   have a tinker around. But the original Model T came with its own toolkit and descriptions
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:54.720]   of how to use it. From an ecological perspective, I think we've got a massive loss in terms of
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:59.680]   disposable consumer technology. So there was some interesting stuff on that in terms of,
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:06.160]   hopefully making things slightly better in terms of usability.
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:09.680]   But yeah, we shall have to see how that develops.
[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:17.520]   I think it's so strongly. I hope this isn't too Zen or spiritual, but I feel like it's so
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:26.800]   good for the soul to maintain things. If you own a home, it feels good to go out on Saturday and do
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:34.480]   things to take care of your house. I think we have an entire generation of people that see
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:42.080]   a car the same way that they see an iPhone, something they drive and they don't have to maintain or
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:50.560]   service. You feel so connected to something that you work on or maintain. It's more meaningful
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:59.280]   to you. And I feel like as we've moved more and more to this corporatized, disposable world of
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:04.560]   products, I really do feel like you lose something of your humanity along the way.
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:11.200]   Like anyone that's built their own PC knows you have more of an emotional attachment to that and
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:15.920]   making it work than you might have to a Dell that you just bought off the shelf.
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:22.880]   I think it is about value, but I also think it's about meaning, if that makes sense.
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:28.000]   I think it's a very good point. The point you raised about the PC, I can remember when I built
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:35.600]   my first one, you baby the thing. You strap that static strap on every single time you go inside
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:40.160]   it, you tinker around and you play around with the switches. It's tremendously satisfying.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:47.040]   And I kind of missed the days of PCs where you had the big box and you could swap stuff out and
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:51.040]   upgrade and that sort of thing. And yes, it made less money for manufacturers, but it was a lot
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:57.760]   more satisfying. Padre, do you remember your first PC that you built? My first PC didn't have a case.
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:09.200]   It was a junk build from some dumpster diving. It was an 8088 that I had found four or five
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:15.440]   different broken ones in a dumpster behind some computer store. And I found enough working components
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:19.280]   to put it together, but it didn't have a case. It didn't even have a proper power supply. So I
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:25.680]   had to kind of rig up a power supply to make it work. And it had a disk drive that barely worked
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:32.560]   if I held it at the right angle. And I loved it. I wish I still had that thing. That's a piece of
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:37.840]   history for me. Oh, good grief. Yeah, we've all got that bit of technology that you've got to be
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:42.400]   exactly right on it. Otherwise, I mean, on this one of my USB ports needs, I've got to need to
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:46.800]   crack the back on it and do some repairs because I dropped it and it's slightly twitchy. And it's
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:51.440]   just a quick note how much you move that little that little Bluetooth, that little USB connection
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:58.080]   just to make sure it works. But well, we shall have to see how it goes. Right, coming up, we've got
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:02.240]   a whole variety of things. Android 12 is out, of course, and of course, which has been covering
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:07.520]   this quite int, quite intimately. And I'm curious to see what our panelists feel about it because I've
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:13.280]   been trying Android 12 on myself and I may be a little bit rancy. But before I do, here's Leo.
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:17.040]   Our show today brought to you by Thank you Ian for letting me interrupt block five.
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:22.240]   Well, Lisa, I'm so happy Lisa brought her black card with her going down to Mexico.
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:27.600]   And I love it. She loves it. I love it because it's a Visa signature card. So it's a great deal on
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:32.960]   international. There's no foreign transaction fees. There's no annual fee. You get all the benefits
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:38.480]   of a Visa signature card. Lisa likes it because she earns Bitcoin on her block five card.
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:43.440]   Whether you're a crypto pro or total beginner, you can finally earn Bitcoin the easy way.
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:49.520]   Bitcoin rewards. Yes, it's the world's first Bitcoin's rewards card from BlockFi. You can earn
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:55.040]   unlimited Bitcoin on every qualifying purchase you make. So as we travel around Wahaka, we are
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:27:02.160]   earning Bitcoin. I love it. It's the block five rewards Visa signature card. And it's just the
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:06.160]   easiest way to get Bitcoin when you buy your groceries, when you pay your bills, when you fill
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:14.720]   up at the gas station, or, you know, when you fly down to Mexico, you can earn 1.5% back in Bitcoin
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:21.360]   on all qualifying purchases. There's no rewards limit. It is a great card is a Visa signature
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:26.560]   card that you know that's the best. Everybody agrees. That's the best. It's a beautiful black
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:31.440]   card, by the way, with a Bitcoin logo on it. I love that. And there's no annual fee. And we're
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:36.960]   not paying any foreign transaction fees. That's why we're using it in Mexico or anywhere we go
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:42.080]   in the world. Now is the time to start a ramp up your Bitcoin portfolio. Of course,
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:47.840]   you know, Bitcoin is worth a lot these days. And I think it's only going to go up. It was the best
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:56.480]   performing asset of the last decade outperformed the NASDAQ 100 by 10 X 10 orders of magnitude,
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:01.280]   according to Yahoo Finance. And BlockFi is no stranger, by the way, they're a leader in crypto.
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:07.520]   They are on Forbes FinTech 50 list in 2021. BlockFi has always been the easiest place to buy,
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:14.320]   sell and earn crypto. And now earn crypto with your BlockFi Visa rewards card. I love that.

[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:18.800]   earn some more Bitcoin. Okay, it was nice to have Bitcoin, but cheers there. Right, okay.
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:26.080]   So last week we had Android 12 come out. This week we've had Android 12L come out.
[01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:30.640]   Both of you have you been trying it out? I mean, Breonna, you said you were
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:35.200]   a Mac, when it comes to computers, you're Mac based. But in terms of phone, are you also iPhone or?
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:40.480]   Unfortunately, when you buy one thing in the Apple ecosystem. By the entire.
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:50.640]   I do have to say, I think I keep watching the demos of voice to text on Android and
[01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:58.960]   it is y'all just got us destroyed on this. Like Siri is the you go. Android is driving the
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:05.040]   Lamborghini when it comes to a text to speech. It is embarrassing how much worse we are. So
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:10.320]   it's a very pretty operating system, but I will leave opinions on this to the experts.
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:14.960]   It is interesting the speech to the speech to text thing is I use that in front of my stepfather
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:19.200]   and he actually went out and bought a smartphone just because he wanted to do that.
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:25.760]   It's a it's a remarkable thing. I mean, I've been trying out Android 12 and I've got to say,
[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:31.680]   I think it's a I can't swear on it, but I think it's terrible. It's great from security perspective,
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:37.760]   great in a lot of under the under the under the under the hood type things, but the actual user
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:44.720]   interface looks like it's been designed by somebody who's just blind. I mean, it's it's terrible.
[01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:50.160]   Padre, have you updated yet or you? I have and then I downgraded.
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:57.680]   Really? You didn't like it that much? Yeah. I get it. I understand why they're doing it. I
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:03.200]   I remember in 2011 when they first shipped honeycomb and they tried to do the same thing. They tried
[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:09.680]   to make a push for the tablet environment. They didn't have the apps back then. And so that's why a
[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:14.720]   lot of people just didn't use that's why it failed because ultimately in Google world, if it doesn't
[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:20.000]   immediately do incredibly well, they kill it after a couple of years. So I understand the doc.
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:25.120]   I get that that that comes straight out of their Chromebooks. I understand the split screen.
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:28.880]   That's something that people have been asking for a while so they can take a familiar interface
[01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:35.840]   from the phone and put two of them on a tablet. But like you, it just feels messy. It feels
[01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:42.080]   I mean, I understand why they did everything that they did with the UI. I just don't like it.
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:46.640]   Now part of that might just be I have to get used to it. Maybe I have to commit myself to it,
[01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:52.160]   use it on a daily basis and eventually all the positives will come out. But right now,
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:57.600]   it just feels like a really bad version of Android. And why would I use a really bad version of
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:00.400]   Android when I have a perfectly good version of Android that I could be using?
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:04.800]   No, I mean, that's that's fair enough. I mean, with 12 L, certainly it addresses
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:09.920]   because I think it addresses something an issue with Chrome OS in particular because now that
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:15.680]   Android apps are putatively running on Chrome, I think that that's an aspect to it certainly.
[01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:24.560]   And as you mentioned, twin screen devices. Now, it's been nearly two years since the first sort
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:30.160]   of foldable phones came out and they are about as popular as a rattlesnake in a pinata.
[01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:35.280]   They look really cool. Well, until they break.
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:43.280]   I'm sorry. I understand materials technology. I'm a big fan of it. But the idea of I looked at
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:48.720]   that first foldable phone, I thought, yeah, that's probably going to be broken within a year.
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:50.880]   Did you take that long? No.
[01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:56.320]   No, it didn't. I mean, maybe Microsoft's got the right idea with the sort of
[01:32:56.320 --> 01:33:00.800]   actually having two screens with a hinge in it. But that's not really what a lot of Silicon
[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:06.960]   Valley people want. I don't know. I've tried the dual screen phone. I don't see that it really
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:13.280]   adds anything. But I'm kind of worried about where Google is going with Android. They seem to have
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:20.960]   really lost their way in some regards. Just in terms of the features and the
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:26.240]   usability of it, it just seems like Google's taken its eye off the board. Do you think that's fair?
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:32.960]   I think this is going to happen anytime you have a maturing market. The same thing happened to the
[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:39.840]   iPhone. Once they had a UI that worked really, really well, any change that they called innovation
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:44.400]   could also be seen as, well, what is wrong with them? Why did they fix something that wasn't broken?
[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:50.160]   So I'm not going to I'm not going to hark on Google for trying. They're trying to make a better
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:54.880]   operating system. They're trying to include more features. They have made it more secure.
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:58.640]   They have added more hooks. So developers have more things to connect to when they
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:05.440]   develop new applications and services for those products. But like you, I sometimes wonder,
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:10.880]   is there someone powerful behind the helm? Is there someone who's actually driving
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:15.680]   Android forward with a vision or is it governance by committee? Because it kind of feels
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:19.840]   like governance by committee right now. It's a bunch of people saying, wouldn't it be cool
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:24.240]   if this and wouldn't be cool if that rather than, well, what do we want the end experience to be
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:29.840]   for the user? Let's design for that. Indeed. I mean, Brianna, you're, I guess, you're sort of
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:34.000]   feeling slightly smug at this point because we're both whining about our phone operating systems.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:38.800]   I mean, in terms of iPhone, do you feel happy with it? Do you feel they're actually developing and
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:42.560]   moving the operating system forward? Or have they kind of reached something which works and
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:46.880]   will just tinker with the edges now? Yeah, I think it's more tinker at the edges, right?
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:54.320]   It's gotten so complicated, I think. Like, I think that normal people just don't notice a lot of
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:35:01.040]   the features that they bring out year after year. Looking back at Android, I just have to say,
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:07.440]   I have such a different reaction, like not being an Android user, but looking at the screenshots of
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:14.320]   it. I mean, it's just stunning graphical design. And it's so disappointing to me to hear from you
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:20.400]   all this, not a great experience because by every single press report, the Pixel and the Pixel 6
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:25.440]   Pro are such amazing phones this year. So that's really disappointing to hear.
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:33.440]   The 6 is a really tricky one because I've cracked the screen on this and I use a Pixel 3
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:39.120]   and I've cracked the screen, I figured, "Okay, now would be a good time to upgrade." But
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:45.920]   the 5 looks good. It's got a headphone jack and I'm sorry to be such an old-fashioned person
[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:49.920]   about this, but I do like a headphone jack on a phone. I use the phone in the car and all
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:53.920]   full-lot and it's quite handy for that. And I hate the idea of having to carry a dongle around
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:59.280]   everywhere. But I mean, Breanna is an Apple user. You are used to dongle. I'm assuming.
[01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:08.560]   How disruptive is it? For me, I think it may not be as bad for women because I carry a person
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:17.680]   think whenever I leave the house, I keep the $70 official Mac USB-C to USB-A adapter,
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:25.520]   which is absurd thing to carry with you everywhere. So I guess I'm just known to dongle town at this
[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:31.040]   point. I'll 100% with you. It should come with ports like a headphone jack.
[01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:37.280]   Yeah. Okay, if numb to dongle town isn't the title of the episode, I don't know what we're doing.
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:43.760]   It really should be. I'm sorry. That's a classic line, which I'm afraid I'm going to have to steal
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:55.040]   at some point. Now, look, my daily driver is still this 6T, 1+. Because it still has a 3.5mm port.
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:37:00.000]   I don't want a dongle. I won't use a dongle. In fact, I think if I have to move to dongles,
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.320]   I'm going to have to start wearing a fanny bag again just to carry them with me because
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:07.440]   I'm not going to have that thing in my pocket and then lose it in something I can't connect
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:13.200]   my headphones anymore. The strange thing to me is when companies start looking at innovation as
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:17.840]   we're removing a port that everyone knows and loves and uses all the time, that just seems so
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:23.040]   strange and counterintuitive. But it's what's passing for forward-looking design now.
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:27.920]   I do find it odd as well. I was talking to somebody about this in the industry and it's like,
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:31.760]   "Well, look, it's quite thick. It's like, well, it's really not that thick."
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:36.720]   It's like, "Well, it's not great for things like dust and water protection. It's like,
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:40.720]   I'm pretty sure we can work away around that. Besides, it's waterproof."
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:47.440]   Yeah, it's sort of water-resistant. Yes, it's a very odd setup. I'm sure
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:52.640]   it's quite, and Apple has shown that you can make a billion-dollar business out of dongles.
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:59.280]   I think other manufacturers got that message loud and clear and it's like, "Really? Okay."
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:04.400]   But yeah, 3.5 works for me. We shall have to see how it works out.
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:11.920]   You're more so much smarter than I am. I have like seven pairs of airpods because the battery is in
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:19.360]   them die so frequently. Then it'll hold just a few minutes of the charge. That's the thing that
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:26.160]   Apple designed for us to do is to get involved in this $200 absurd headphone ecosystem.
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:29.040]   Really? You're finding the batteries are dying. That's the click.
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:34.240]   Oh, it's terrible. You can't swap it out. You couldn't even go to Apple and say,
[01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:39.040]   "Hey, have these first-gen airpods, please repair the batteries in them." There's a recycling
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:46.480]   program, but it's not something they're even prepared to fix. There's this planned obsolescence
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:52.400]   of airpods. God knows they've made bank from killing the headphone jack, so I don't think it
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:56.960]   was courage as much as they needed the stock price to bump up a bit.
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:02.800]   Good grief. I had no idea that it was that bad. Looking at the things, they look almost impossible
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:06.560]   to repair. Actually, cracking one of them open would probably destroy them.
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:11.280]   Yeah. Oh, absolutely. It's all glued together. You crack it open and it's done.
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:15.520]   Good grief. Well, on the other hand, it brings in a lot of shareholder value.
[01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:21.360]   So... Now, speaking of shareholder value, I have to say, it's been an interesting week for
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:26.240]   Activision. And, Brianna, I'm pretty sure you've probably got a view on this. Basically,
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:36.880]   Blizzard has canceled 2022 BlizzCon. The Activision CEO has taken a 99.9% pay cut until he,
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:41.920]   until he, to quote, has sorted out the diversity issue, whatever the phrase he used was.
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:49.920]   The games industry in general has been, as we discussed earlier, has been fairly toxic in terms of
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:55.440]   sort of frat boy culture. But Activision has kind of become the poster boy for an awful lot of
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:59.440]   things that were wrong. Brianna, do you think this is actually going to change anything,
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:02.960]   or is this just, again, coming back to Facebook, corporate marketing again?
[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:11.040]   Well, I think that Activision is a situation that's going to actively change because it's a
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:19.120]   different situation than Facebook. We've been talking about what's broken in Activision since
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:25.200]   game or gate. The reason things are happening now is because regulators got involved. The
[01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:32.320]   state of California subpoenaed a ton of documents, found some horrific, horrific allegations,
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:38.640]   just to repeat one of the most serious ones. You have a woman that worked for this company,
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:49.200]   who, her boss basically sexually propositioned her. She eventually was sexually harassed so badly
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:58.480]   that contributed to her suicide. And then after that point, that boss passed nude pictures of her
[01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:05.440]   around to her teammates for them to leer at. That's actually in the California document. So,
[01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:12.640]   you know, these are tremendously serious allegations. And the reason it was taken seriously is because
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:20.400]   California regulators got involved. So, from what I hear inside of Activision, I do think a culture
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:28.160]   is going to change. I think that it's affecting their things like them trying to get insurance
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:34.400]   because of the cost of it. I think that's going to get better. As far as Bobby Kotick specifically
[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:41.680]   in the salary cut, you know, when I ran for Congress and I looked up donors that had a history of
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:48.000]   donating to people at the tech background, he was on my number one donor list. We actually called
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:53.680]   his office quite a few times because he throws out so much money to people and most frequently
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:42:00.800]   to right wing Canada. So, you know, this is someone that has quite a bit of money. He's gotten very
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:08.720]   rich working at Activision, $150 million last year by many reports. So, I see this as an
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:15.440]   overwhelmingly symbolic move. But I think that ultimately, these can be the regulators in the
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:20.400]   lawsuit that are going to force Activision to make a change. It's interesting. I mean, he said,
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:25.520]   oh, I'm going down to a 68,000 a year salary. It's like, yeah, you were rewarded over $150 million
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:31.120]   last year. So, you know, you're not out shaking the club. I mean, Padre, it's easy for a rich man
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:35.760]   to enter the kingdom of heaven. So, we're not going to go there. But what's your take on this?
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:44.400]   Well, I'm with Bionna in that this is this looks like a Facebook move and they're just trying to
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:49.920]   get some good press out there to change the story. But I think the the enabler here is the fact that
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:56.960]   they were they are being sued by a state agency. So, you know, they have to make these changes. It's
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:00.800]   it's not we're doing it because we want to be good and because we see that it's better. It's
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:06.400]   this is an existential crisis for Activision. I mean, the if those suits were to grow and if
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:14.800]   it were to gain speed, it could really, really destroy the company. Now, I think the pay cut that
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:21.600]   that is a it's a PR thing because no matter how much pay he makes, he's still going to get awarded
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:27.200]   through his options. That doesn't go away. That's that's not written away. So, if the company does
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:35.040]   well, he still gets paid millions. So, what what I'm looking at is I want to see on paper,
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:39.040]   what are the diversity steps that they're going to make? What how are they going to handle diversity
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:45.360]   hiring? How are they going to handle complaints? Are they actually going to strengthen HR to be
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:49.360]   able to work for employees rather than HR protecting the company because that was the biggest problem
[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:56.080]   that we saw in in the legal saga, which was HR was only there to make sure that it didn't go
[01:43:56.080 --> 01:44:00.560]   any higher than it needed to any complaint went higher than it needed to go because that would
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:06.640]   affect the price of the stock. So, if they can do that, if they can show on paper that they're
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:15.360]   making systematic changes, then I'll say yes, kudos to you. Good job. Until then, I'm very
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:19.680]   skeptical. I gosh, I've just been incredibly skeptical about everything in this entire episode.
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:23.920]   I don't know why. Well, I don't think of it skeptical. I think it's just a real issue. It hasn't
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:28.960]   been proved right yet. But, now, it's an interesting point about HR. I do find, particularly with
[01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:35.360]   American companies, you kind of forget that HR, you know, you are a resource, you know, they're not
[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:41.760]   on your side. This is all about keeping management out of jail or out of being sued. And it's
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:47.360]   a very weird thing. Somebody was saying no one ever grows up thinking, yes, I want to be an HR
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:52.480]   person. I wonder how people end up in it. But I don't know. Hopefully, things will change with
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:58.480]   Activision, which we'll see. If I could just say one more thing, yes. I just I want to put
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:05.680]   into perspective why this this story matters. Not just there's obviously the ethics concern. I
[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:13.280]   think no one out there, no matter how cynical you are wants to see a situation like like the one
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:20.000]   that happened with the woman that tragically died by suicide. I am of the opinion. I feel very
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:32.480]   strongly about this that we have a larger innovation crisis in the video game industry. And I feel that
[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:41.760]   the quality of games that we are putting out there are so laden and so hampered with these
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:53.440]   these mechanics like daily login bonuses, pay to win mechanics, DLC, live subscription models.
[01:45:53.440 --> 01:46:01.040]   Ubisoft even this week had something if you bought Far Cry 6 and didn't play it enough,
[01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:06.880]   they had the villain in that game emailing you at your personal email address saying,
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:16.480]   oh, thank you for leaving Yara in my capable hands. You couldn't stop me. So I feel so strongly
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:23.120]   that we have an innovation crisis in our field. And I think part of that is tragically,
[01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:29.680]   if you go and look at game studios, who are the people that make video games? I'm not trying to
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:35.840]   knock like straight white dudes here, but you're really, really over sampled at game studios. We
[01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:44.080]   had a major game studio announced this week where the only woman listed on the workplace ledger
[01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:51.920]   is the dog who is listed as the morale officer. And that is the it's the norm in our industry
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:47:00.480]   tragically. So it's not just, I think that when you only have people from a single perspective
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:08.960]   developing games, I think unfortunately you tend to see the same ideas and the same priorities
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:15.840]   happening again and again and again. And I think if we want our industry to be vibrant,
[01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:23.040]   if we want truly the best kind of games to come forward, if we want to have more interesting
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:29.520]   experiences than just call of duty every single year with slightly prettier graphics for the
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:35.600]   thousands of people you're murdering, I think it's really important that we are an industry where
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:42.960]   anyone qualified can come in the door and can do their best work. So I feel very strongly, this
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:50.400]   isn't just about making Activision a safe working place. This is about making the game industry the
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:57.280]   very best version of that it can be where everyone wins. People get to have safe careers, but you as
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:02.000]   a gamer get to play better games as well. Hopefully things will change. It's about
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:08.720]   I'm not going to swear, but it's about time. We shall see. Anyway, let's before we have a,
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:14.240]   we'll take a quick break and then come back and talk Windows XP because it's 20 years since that
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:20.080]   operating system came out. Yes, I know. And it's still in use and by far far too many people.
[01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:25.120]   Anyway, before that here's Leo. If you don't mind, Ian, I got one more ad before we wrap things
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:30.080]   up on this week's this week and take and thank you so much for filling in for me. I really appreciate
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:36.880]   you doing a bang up job. Of course, Lisa and I are down in Mexico. And I got to tell you, when I'm
[01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:44.240]   buying online, whether I'm buying in the US or buying in Mexico, I am using this next sponsor
[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:51.440]   privacy.com. I've been a privacy.com user for years before they were advertising with us because I
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:57.920]   love the idea of a credit card that is secure in one of two ways. You can make a burner card with
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:03.200]   privacy.com that can only be used once. Boom, that's it. So you don't ever have to worry about it being
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:09.600]   stolen or being overcharged. I often use though their merchant cards. I love this idea. The minute
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:15.280]   it's used with the merchant, it's locked to that merchant. So I use it for all my online transactions.
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:20.640]   I it's easy to share by the way. It's built into privacy.com. You just say, I want to share this
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:27.440]   credit card. Why would I want to do that? Well, my mom, 88 years old, she cooked for me, my whole
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:34.080]   childhood. Amazing cook. But she told me last year, I'm so tired. I want to cook anymore. I said,
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:41.760]   Mom, let me get dinner. Let me get dinner. And I sent her a privacy card. Just click and share.
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:46.960]   She didn't have to have a privacy account to use it. She put it in DoorDash. And now,
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:51.120]   anytime she wants a meal, she just orders when they come, they bring it to her and I'm buying.
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:56.400]   I said, Mom, tip good too, because I don't care. I want I want you to get the best service.
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:02.640]   I love it. It's completely secure. If it leaks out, I don't have to worry about that. It can only
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:08.560]   be used with that merchant ever. I can set limits and I can pause the card. Now that's really handy.
[01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:13.040]   I'm not worried about my mom, but it's not unusual for me to sign up for subscriptions
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:20.960]   online. You know, sometimes that can be hard to cancel. I use privacy. I get the security of
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:26.560]   locking that card into that particular subscription. But if I'm done, I don't even have to cancel.
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:32.880]   I just pause the card or delete it. And boom, that's it. They'll be declined. And you see on the
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:37.360]   privacy website, you can see all the times the card is declined. That's actually useful in case
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:40.800]   somebody tries to use the card somewhere else. It will be declined, but you'll know.
[01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:47.280]   It ties into your debit card or to your bank account. I should let you know it's not a credit
[01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:54.320]   card. You don't build up a balance. It's an immediate use, but it does appear as a regular
[01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:58.080]   to all the merchants as a regular credit card. I think it's great for subscriptions,
[01:50:58.080 --> 01:51:04.080]   great for using online, great for using any time. You want to use a credit card,
[01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:09.280]   but you don't want the bad guy to use it. I'll tell you, I sign up for a gym. I wish I'd
[01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:14.720]   had a privacy card at the time. I canceled the gym, but they kept charging me for quote trainer
[01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:19.280]   appointments. I didn't catch on for months. I called the credit card company. They said,
[01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:24.160]   well, it's been too long. We can't refund you. If I had used privacy, not only would I know that
[01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:29.040]   charges going on, I could have hit the pause button and I wouldn't be out any money. I wish I had.
[01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:33.680]   A great way to control subscriptions, recurring payments. You could set a spending limit with
[01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:40.320]   the service so they won't overcharge you. You can catch them trying to add on and you can stop it.
[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:46.080]   You can stop it. I think privacy is the best way to go. It's easy to use. They have a Chrome
[01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:50.560]   extension, a Firefox extension that automatically fills in the information, generates a new card,
[01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:55.920]   so you don't even have to exit that page. Sharing is easy. Copy and paste, no texting.
[01:51:55.920 --> 01:52:01.360]   Just click the share button when you're viewing a card, enter the email address. They get it.
[01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:05.440]   As my mom didn't, she found it very easy to use. Your account summary is great.
[01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:11.200]   You have a choice. When you have it show up in your checking account statement,
[01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:15.200]   you can either just say privacy.com or can say the merchant. I always say the merchant.
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:20.160]   That way it's easy for me to allocate to budget and so forth. You can even tag now.
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:24.480]   This is something new. They added custom tags so you can sort your card by category. That's
[01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:30.160]   actually great because I use privacy so much. I've got dozens and dozens of cards. Each of them,
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:35.920]   either tied to a merchant or for a single use. I love it. It's just the easiest way to do it.
[01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:40.240]   I think the most secure. Protect your financial identity online. Use virtual cards.
[01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:46.480]   This is the easiest way to do it. Privacy.com/twits. Sign up for a new account, new customers.
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:55.120]   Automatically get $5 to spend on their first purchase. Privacy. P-R-I-V-A-C-Y. Privacy.com/twits. Sign
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:53:01.440]   up today. You're going to love it. Now, my friends, it's time to go back to Ian.
[01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:04.640]   I'll be back next week. I'll see you then. Take it away, Ian.
[01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:06.640]   Okay, I'm off that right now.
[01:53:06.640 --> 01:53:12.720]   Okay, well, Leo has been away this week, but here's a quick round up of things that you may have seen
[01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:20.800]   on the station this in the last week. In honor of Halloween, you can get the Ghostbusters
[01:53:20.800 --> 01:53:27.280]   Proton Pack. It'll be $400. For my birthday, it's like you're an adult man.
[01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:33.600]   That's why you spend your own money on it. Previously, on to it.
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:40.480]   Mac Break Weekly. Renee's got an M1 Mac's 14-inch laptop. In my stress test, it was just
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:44.320]   draw-dropping at first because of the numbers. ProRes, it was 10 times faster, like literally
[01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:48.800]   10 times faster. This to me is redefining what my expectations are from a pro laptop.
[01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:55.520]   Tech News Weekly. Facebook has announced that it is rebranding and going by the name Meta Now.
[01:53:55.520 --> 01:54:01.280]   Mozucka-Burg once is a world where he's free of intermediaries. Why is Facebook so taking with
[01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:05.920]   this idea for the metaverse, something that basically has us living in VR and doing all of
[01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:09.760]   our computing there. And it's because Facebook controls the operating system.
[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:15.440]   Windows Weekly. I got the Surface Duo 2. It's a super cool device. It's really nice,
[01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:20.800]   but I feel like this is truly a generation 2 device so far from my very, very limited testing
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:25.200]   of it. And you know what they always say is Microsoft doesn't make a good device close in
[01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:29.520]   the third generation. I have a feeling that's going to be true. All about Android. Do you really
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:35.760]   Samsung had an event? Actually, if you recall this, the Unpacked Part 2 happened last week.
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:42.080]   You can now customize the Galaxy Z Flip 3. It's the Magical bespoke edition.
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:46.960]   The funniest content I saw on that was somebody said, this could have been an email.
[01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:49.920]   Twit. Yeah, I'm not going to argue that one won bit.
[01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:58.080]   Welcome back. And there was some good watching to be had this week.
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:04.960]   Right. Okay. This week also saw the 20th anniversary of Windows XP. For those of us who were still
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:08.560]   using Windows 2000 at the time, it wasn't that big a deal. But if you're on Windows
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:15.600]   Millennium Edition, then it was a very, very welcome edition. So it's an iconic operating system.
[01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:20.960]   It's still massively in use. There's a big long tail of users out there. I mean, in terms of outdated
[01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:25.040]   technology, it's one of those things that is hung around like a smell in a space suit.
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:33.200]   Any Vatican systems working on it, Padre? Yes. Actually, yes, but all of them are air-gapped.
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:39.600]   So we have a few machines that are still running Windows XP just because of some legacy software
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:46.560]   that will only run on XP or below. But they are not connected to anything. So that's the
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:50.560]   concession that we made. They're not even hooked up to a private network. They are completely stand
[01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:56.880]   alone, which kind of limits their usefulness. It is rather weird. I was down at JPL for the
[01:55:56.880 --> 01:56:02.080]   Curiosity Rover landing. And after, you know, we got the first shots back and everyone applauded
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:07.200]   and then they sort of closed down the meeting. But the default screensaver came onto the
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:12.160]   projector and it was Windows XP. And you're like, you've just landed a ton and a half of
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:18.000]   Rover on Mars and you're still using Windows XP. Brianna, did you have much experience with XP or
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:23.040]   you mac all the way? Oh, God. Yeah. This is how I was doing network support for a career.
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:28.080]   I remember it like it was yesterday. I can't believe it's been that long.
[01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:33.440]   Yeah. One of the things that really strikes me is when I ran for Congress here in Massachusetts,
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:39.280]   I personally dropped off. You have to get signatures to get on the ballot. And I personally went around
[01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:46.000]   to every single town's basically clerk's office to drop off my signatures because I wanted to get
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:52.880]   to know people and it would be a fun event. And I was terrified to be honest with you. How many
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:57:00.800]   election computers were still running on Windows XP? You know, we talked a lot about cybersecurity
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:06.560]   on my campaign. And here's kind of an example of what about how we may need to be spending a
[01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:14.640]   little bit more money on infrastructure to make sure we can't be hacked. So, fingers crossed that
[01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:20.560]   that lucky streak continues. Well, this is it. But I mean, when when XP first came out, it was,
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:26.240]   it was billed as the secure operating system. I mean, because Microsoft had such problems with
[01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:29.920]   computer viruses really going rampant on its on its thing. They were just like,
[01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:34.480]   yeah, this is XP. It's built on the anti framework. This is going to be the most secure operating
[01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:40.480]   system yet. And I think people hang out a bit too long. It does seem, as you were saying,
[01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:46.560]   with the with the election machine stuff, the DEF CON voting hacking sessions,
[01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:52.320]   they were still running Windows C on some of these machines. But why is it part of the thing?
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:56.400]   XP is still hanging around. Is it just the legacy software?
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:58:03.600]   It's just a legacy software. But remember, there were a couple of advantages to running XP.
[01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:09.120]   It was the first Windows OS that allowed for multi monitor setups. It was the last
[01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:16.160]   Microsoft OS that allowed you to move setup files to either a hard drive or solid state.
[01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:20.720]   If you had one of those later on and do a completely in computer installation,
[01:58:20.720 --> 01:58:25.280]   ridiculously fast, it also had no problem being mirrored from machine to machine to machine.
[01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:32.480]   It was before Microsoft added any of those protections. So as a whole, it is a fantastic test
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:37.440]   bed system. It is an operating system that I still use every once in a while. I will occasionally
[01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:42.880]   spin up an XP instance, put it on the internet and see how quickly it gets owned and see what
[01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:50.080]   kind of new attacks the box experiences. So it's still kind of fun. It's a versatile
[01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:56.080]   environment. It will run on very low end hardware. I can move it from box to box to box without ever
[01:58:56.080 --> 01:59:01.440]   having to worry about whether or not I'm licensed for it properly. So yes, it's still in use and
[01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:07.840]   yes, it will remain in use for years and years to come. I mean, the same attacks that are working
[01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:14.000]   on XP machines now will probably be seen on the internet in about 15 years.
[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:19.840]   It's interesting. How was it from a network topology standpoint, Breonna? I mean, was it
[01:59:19.840 --> 01:59:25.760]   actually good better to work with than 2000? I remember, yeah, it was an upgrade in a lot of
[01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:32.800]   ways. You know, we were figuring out technologies like direct ex-backs back then. So the underlying
[01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:41.280]   kind of reset for the game industry was revolutionary at the time. You know, networking overall and
[01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:46.960]   getting office systems to talk to one another was tremendously more difficult back then. I don't
[01:59:46.960 --> 01:59:51.520]   know if you remember this, but trying to get Windows and Mac machines to talk to each other on the
[01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:57.920]   same network. That was an absolute nightmare back then. You had to go buy specialized software and
[01:59:58.960 --> 02:00:05.520]   oh god, I'm having flashbacks just remembering it. So, you know, it was for the time it was very good.
[02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:14.160]   And I think it was clearly a groundbreaking product. I just, I think about it from a technology
[02:00:14.160 --> 02:00:21.360]   leadership point of view that we need to, I think we could be much better at incentivizing
[02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:28.720]   and funding ways to upgrade our infrastructure in the United States as time marches on.
[02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:33.840]   I don't feel like that should be in schools. I don't feel it should be in voting systems.
[02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:41.360]   I don't feel it should be used in DMV, something I saw one time. I think we need to better fund this
[02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:47.520]   march forward with technology. It's interesting. It's amazing how long old attack hangs around
[02:00:47.520 --> 02:00:53.280]   simply because it's convenient and easy to use. I mean, as I say, I was still using 2000
[02:00:53.280 --> 02:01:00.400]   Windows 2000 in 2008 just for a gaming machine which wasn't connected to the internet because it was
[02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:05.440]   just convenient. You knew how to use it and you could, well, you could fucks around in the operating
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:10.400]   system, which I really liked. I do. This was what turned me off apples originally because back in
[02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:14.720]   the early 90s, you had to use a ResEdit, which is kind of like trying to repair a nuclear
[02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:20.160]   reactor with a stone axe. It's just, it was a horrible tool, but still. But as I say, old technology
[02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:26.000]   is hanging around and June is very much on all the billboards, all the adverts.
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:31.440]   I'm sure those people that love it, love it dearly. I know my wife had a picture of
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:37.280]   Sting in it on her bedroom walls, a teenager, which I'm not at all bad.
[02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:46.960]   Indeed, yes. But apparently the script for the current version was written on MS DOS,
[02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:52.160]   Movie Master. The writer should be written in DOS.
[02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:57.360]   Well, apparently he likes it because it's secure and it's what he's used to and he feels
[02:01:57.360 --> 02:02:02.320]   superstitious about it. I mean, it's for such a futuristic film. One has to wonder,
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:07.920]   you know, what's what the thinking behind is this. So, Padra, do you have a particularly old
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:13.600]   bit of tech that you're still very fond of and still use? Oh, what is the oldest? So the oldest
[02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:18.000]   piece of tech. Okay, so it's not a museum piece. It has to actually be in use, correct?
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:29.760]   Okay, I have a, I have a HTC, an MDA. It is a Windows Pocket PC phone.
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:33.280]   Oh, wow. Pocket PC, I remember that. Do you remember that?
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:42.560]   2005, I think? Yeah. Okay, that beats, yeah. Yeah, that beats my, I think it's 2008 is one of the
[02:02:42.560 --> 02:02:46.880]   oldest portable hard drives I've got. Brianna, you're obviously much more cutting edge than we are,
[02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:52.240]   but I mean, any old tech hanging around in Massachusetts? I love vintage stuff. I have a,
[02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:58.080]   I'm looking at right here, my Star Trek Next Generation pinball table. Oh, I spent so much money
[02:02:58.080 --> 02:03:05.760]   on that university. What year was that like 1993, I believe? That's old school. Yeah, I'm a
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:12.400]   huge vintage gamer. So I have every single video game system ever created almost. And I
[02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:16.720]   play them all the time. So come on over to my house and we can play teenage,
[02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:20.800]   we've ninja turtles. I may well take you up on that. Although I gather, I'd probably be whipped
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:25.840]   hollow because is it true that you're still in the top 10 for the SNES platform? I unfortunately
[02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:31.120]   have been bumped down, but only because I'm focused on other games right now. Next time I come on
[02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:36.400]   Twitch, I'm gonna have my Tomb Raider 2013 run. My time's on this. Yeah, you're doing a speed run.
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:41.600]   I'm still doing a speed run. You're getting some great times. Yeah. Yeah. I'm, I figured out how
[02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:46.560]   to teleport through, through doors and sequence, break the game. So a lot of fun. What's the
[02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:51.920]   time to be? For that way, it's one hour on console. It's one hour and 51 minutes.
[02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:58.480]   Good grief. You only consider how much time most people spend that trying to learn that game.
[02:03:58.480 --> 02:04:02.880]   That's really quite stunning. Any tips for the aspiring speed runner?
[02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:09.280]   Oh, I'm sorry. Could you say that again? Sorry. Have you got any tips for the aspiring speed runner?
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:14.800]   I mean, what kind of things do you need to focus on? You know, pick a game that you really enjoy
[02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:22.080]   because you're going to be playing it a lot. And then go to speedrun.com. Look at the top run for
[02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:30.240]   the game and watch an entire playthrough and then start learning the tricks about how you do that.
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:35.120]   So like for Tomb Raider, if you want to sequence, break the game, you have to back up on a door
[02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:41.760]   and then you have to get 51% of your geometry through the door. So you scramble backwards
[02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:47.600]   until Laura reaches the state where her hands are just twitching in the game. And then you scramble
[02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:53.040]   forward and press backwards simultaneously and she'll roll through the geometry and be pushed out
[02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:59.200]   of it. So watch it and learn those tricks and then just copy what other people have done.
[02:04:59.760 --> 02:05:06.000]   What you'll find is if you then put more time into it than they do, you'll get in the top 10.
[02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:11.040]   Interesting. I mean, Padra, you're a amount of the cloth you have obviously a very busy time,
[02:05:11.040 --> 02:05:16.960]   but any games you've attempted to speedrun through? No, but I do often twitch through doorways.
[02:05:16.960 --> 02:05:23.200]   That's just kind of how it is. It's got to be done. It's got to be done. But
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:29.600]   sadly, the only game I have time for these days is Age of Empires and doing a speedrun on that
[02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:35.200]   is still not very speedy at all. We shall have to see how it goes. Actually, while we're on the
[02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:40.560]   gaming front, it's interesting stuff going on with Stadia at the moment. Breanna, can you fill us in on
[02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:44.960]   this? I mean, Stadia was sort of pushed out there. It's going to be the next big thing. It's going to
[02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:50.880]   be great. And then it just seems to have died away. What's going on with that? I haven't seen the
[02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:57.360]   story. You tell me? Oh, OK. I mean, basically my understanding is that Stadia's pivoting,
[02:05:57.360 --> 02:06:01.760]   which is always which is never a good thing to hear, but they're going to become a sort of
[02:06:01.760 --> 02:06:10.320]   white labeled game streaming platform. But I do this whole the whole Stadia concept seems slightly
[02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:17.280]   optimistic to say the least. It's not as crazy as you may think though. One of the things that
[02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:23.120]   we've been doing a lot more on Nintendo Switch is if you don't know, Switch is made on, I believe
[02:06:23.120 --> 02:06:28.720]   it's the Tekra architecture, whereas every other game in the industry is made on X86.
[02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:35.760]   And one of the ways they've gotten around Switch is a complete lack of power is basically doing
[02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:43.040]   what Stadia does, doing cloud computing and having a server compute everything and then stream it
[02:06:43.040 --> 02:06:50.000]   to your Switch. And those games have done remarkably well on Switch. So I could actually see that
[02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:59.120]   being a viable feature for this. Maybe not on the big consoles, but for more constrained hardware,
[02:06:59.120 --> 02:07:03.760]   that could definitely work. Interesting. OK, have you tried it out, Pondre?
[02:07:04.960 --> 02:07:13.440]   I have and when I first played with it, I was actually impressed. A lot of the lagging issues
[02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:17.520]   that I thought were going to be a problem were in a problem. It helped me through part of the
[02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:25.680]   pandemic because it was a fun device to play with. But the day after I received it, I already
[02:07:25.680 --> 02:07:31.200]   wrote the obituary for Stadia because I know go I know Google and they just don't have the
[02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:38.400]   attention span to make something like that work. The thing about running a game delivery surface
[02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:43.360]   over the internet is you have to be constantly pushing and refreshing your catalog and bringing
[02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:47.280]   in new talent. And that's why they're making it a white label. They're making it a white label
[02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:51.200]   because they realize, Oh, that's a lot of hard work. And that's a lot of continuing work. It's not
[02:07:51.200 --> 02:07:55.360]   just one project. And then you're done and everyone loves it. It's, well, what are you going to do
[02:07:55.360 --> 02:08:00.720]   today and the next day and the next day. And Google does not do well with those types of products.
[02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:06.720]   Google is a set and forget company. They want to be able to do their product development,
[02:08:06.720 --> 02:08:12.240]   push it out there, and then just start cashing the checks. So Stadia was never going to be that.
[02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:18.320]   It's just not possible. I don't know if I agree with that though, because I'm thinking through it.
[02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:25.360]   And Google does like something I do very well is bringing like architecture and services.
[02:08:25.360 --> 02:08:31.360]   Like I think there are very few people that would argue Google is not drastically better at services
[02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:40.000]   than say Apple is. And if you start thinking through all the possibilities for that kind of
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:47.120]   client side rendering of things like this, I can really see an explosion of that. You may not know
[02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:54.560]   this. The game industry is really experiencing a shortage of talent right now because there are
[02:08:54.560 --> 02:09:01.280]   so many new players in our field. They're trying to gobble up as many game developers as they can.
[02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:07.600]   Netflix for instance has announced that they're going to make a very big push in the games because
[02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:13.280]   they see experiences like Fortnite being a very big threat to their business model.
[02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:20.800]   And do you really think everyone that like subscribes to Netflix is also going to have like a $2,000
[02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:30.240]   PC with an RTX 3090 inside of it? I could see that kind of architecture having a very useful
[02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:35.840]   market for companies like that. So I'm not cynical about this. I think it makes sense.
[02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:40.720]   That's interesting because we had the Intel releasing this week, the older lake, which they're saying
[02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:45.920]   is their fastest gaming chip ever and the rest of it. And there is as you say, there is a huge market,
[02:09:46.560 --> 02:09:51.840]   at least a very valuable market in terms of gaming PCs and gamers are cutting edge when it comes
[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:56.320]   to the hardware in general, which is why the stage here idea never seemed to work. But I guess,
[02:09:56.320 --> 02:10:04.000]   yeah, I mean, they're going slightly wider than it does have that opportunity to maybe get out there.
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:09.360]   But let's face it, if you're a serious gamer, you're always going to want your own rig surely.
[02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:13.760]   Right. I'm not even a serious gamer and I want my own rig.
[02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:20.720]   I basically have been playing one game for the last two years and it's not exactly demanding,
[02:10:20.720 --> 02:10:26.160]   but I love having it on my own setup. I used to love going around trade shows and seeing like the
[02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:30.800]   gaming PCs with liquid cooling systems and the rest of it. And you're just like,
[02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:34.720]   I really want one, but I just can't justify the cost.
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:43.520]   Well, it's the enduring story of technology, I believe. But yeah, okay, right. Well, we're
[02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:47.840]   going to wrap things up. But thank you very much to my guests, Brianna Wu and Padre,
[02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:53.200]   of Marvelous to see you both as ever. And we've had a very good time at the time of it, I hope.
[02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:58.480]   People may be slightly concerned that this is being done on Saturday, but it's Halloween
[02:10:58.480 --> 02:11:04.000]   tomorrow. Parents are going to have to deal with hot, hot kids, hopped up on sugar and I should
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:08.720]   imagine a wee bit of vomiting going on if people are overindulged, but still. So this is why it's
[02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:15.040]   on on Saturday. But usually Leo is recording the show on Sunday between 12 and 5, 12 p.m. and
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:22.240]   sorry, 2 p.m. and I hope he has 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. on Sunday Pacific time. And you can watch in
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:29.200]   and of course come in live on the chat room on our Discord server. And one day when the virus is
[02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:34.160]   finally abated, we can reopen the studio and allow people to come in and watch the show as it was
[02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:39.520]   meant to be watched in person. And it really is always fun seeing people and
[02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:44.800]   seeing people actually come down and come into the studio. But those days will come again. I am
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:48.400]   quite sure. In the meantime, another Twitch is in the back.
[02:11:48.400 --> 02:12:00.800]   Amazing.
