[00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.840]   Where I can get my mind straight by hanging out with people who seem to be handling the quarantine much better than I am
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:09.240]   Including and it's amazing Lindsey Turntine who is in sconced with how many men five men?
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.240]   Let's see there are four men and one teenage girl and you
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.280]   It's a big
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.560]   Also, yes boys boys to men
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.680]   Lindsay's SVP we went through this before the show
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.000]   But I believe I have the title correct senior vice president for content strategy at Viacom CBS
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.200]   Is that the same as the former CBS interactive?
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:43.800]   Yeah, it's similar. It's larger now similar. Yeah, and so I work on the on the cnet media. You're a big shot is what you are
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:51.600]   You know, I'm just doing what I do just doing what I do man. Well, it's great to have you also with us
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.200]   This is fun because these are all people. I just really love getting together with Lisa Schmeiser who normally comes to the studio
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.840]   Can't do it these days, but she's here via Skype, which is nearly as good
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.080]   Lisa is editor at IT pro today. Hi Lisa
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:14.720]   Hi, it's nice to be here. Thank you for having me. She has is that your old race car number nine behind you there? I
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.160]   Believe it's a number for baseball player
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.320]   Right now, so oh the core is entirely on him
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.760]   It's his retired number from when he played for the San Francisco Giants. That's so nice or the Cubs one of the Cubs
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:34.320]   Number nine for the Cubs that sounds vaguely familiar. Maybe Daniel Robino knows
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:41.360]   He is also here. No idea executive editor windows central ask him about video game controllers. He can help you
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.920]   but yeah, it's one of those weird hobbies
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.880]   He's got every color in the rainbow. That's really
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.440]   They're only that's like a quarter of them, too. There's way more out in the other words amazing
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:01.480]   It's great to have you this is actually you're here for a very special reason because this week Microsoft had its developer conference build conference
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.760]   For the first time ever entirely streaming. I
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.120]   Saw some numbers like 300,000 people watched the streams was a huge number
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.000]   Yep
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.480]   Compared to six thousand or four thousand. I normally attend in person. Yeah, so I'd love to see this
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.160]   From now on from all of the developer conferences is nice to not have to get in a lottery to figure out
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.600]   You know if you get to go pay a lot of money to go
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:33.440]   And this way you can see it all I just I just really like it and I have to say I enjoyed the keynotes
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.160]   We streamed the keynote's live on Tuesday
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.280]   I never really quite know what such in Adele is talking about
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.480]   We joke around about that, so I think there's a lot of words
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.600]   There's a lot of you feel good, but you don't really know what's being said and why it's why it's important
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:06:01.000]   It's funny because I have huge respect for him. Well. Yeah, I mean he is clearly a great CEO who has pivoted Microsoft into a much more
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.080]   Successful lane and they're he's doing great. He's a he's a caring guy. He's a deep guy
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:15.720]   But he I just I can't I can't follow what he's saying he did I did pick up though on a couple of things this fusion
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.840]   He mentioned fusion. I thought well, I meant what's that?
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.360]   This is a new
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:27.800]   Programming platform that that brings together win 32 and
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:36.760]   Pw project reunion. I'm sorry reunion of fusion. Yeah, EPA apps the windows store apps and the in the win 32 apps
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.560]   That seemed fairly important or maybe that's just my imagination
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.680]   No, no that that was and you know if you're not a developer or you're you know like me
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:53.200]   You just follow Microsoft, but you don't actually write stuff. This was probably one of the biggest and most interesting announcements
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.680]   In a way, it's not even new
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.000]   It's what's been happening for the last few years already that they've been talking about
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.040]   They just kind of gave it a name and a formality this time
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.600]   and you know, it's really
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.000]   It is a the next
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:16.440]   Where this stuff is moving right for so they have multiple development platforms for their apps win 32 to something goes back
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.640]   You know 20 30 years is what makes windows windows so powerful?
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.520]   But then of course you have universal windows apps and uwp
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:31.200]   Which was more modern and they still encourage developers to go down that route if you're doing something on HoloLens surface
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.520]   Hub or any their future devices windows 10x included uwp is that platform
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:41.020]   but what they're doing now is basically any APIs that are coming out will target both of these systems and
[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.080]   They're they're trying to get rid of this idea of like
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:50.000]   Developers can only have to choose one platform to develop on they can do whatever they feel comfortable with
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.120]   What are their goals are what are their strategy is whatever their budget is as well
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:58.920]   And that's why you know PWA is progressive web apps are becoming increasingly popular to
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.840]   And we see a lot of that with Microsoft Edge and announcements around there
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.600]   so all they're trying to do is get away from this idea of
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.960]   You know a single system that people need to rely on because even though uwp
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:15.160]   Made more sense set on phones or at least had more of an argument for it
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.560]   The fact is the UI system. What's now part of when UI 3.0?
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:27.520]   Is very modern. It's very fresh looking. It's fast. It's dynamic. It allows scalable and resizable apps
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.520]   There's a lot of positive stuff about uwp that does make it the future of app development for
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.360]   Microsoft Edge platforms
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.400]   But you can't just throw out win 32 as well as due to all the legacy
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:44.600]   So what the system allows devs to do now is take those old apps as old win 32 apps and
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:51.200]   Bring in the stuff from uwp the positive stuff into it including the UI so you can actually make modern looking
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:57.480]   Classic running applications and so like I said that's been happening for the last few years behind the scenes
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:02.760]   But this is more it's been kind of formalized and they're kind of laying it out with win UI and a couple other
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:08.120]   New systems are coming out. This is a big deal because of course Microsoft unlike any other
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:15.680]   Operating system really depends on legacy. You've got many many business users who are running old software
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:22.120]   You'd like to bring them into the modern times not just for the way it looks and feels but for security reasons
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:30.800]   Reliability reasons so if they can provide a platform that makes it easy for people who have win 32 programs to bring it up to
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.240]   Modern times that could be very important
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:41.280]   Going forward for Microsoft. It's a way of handling this legacy problem. That's always been kind of tying them down
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.120]   Yeah
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.120]   Good the other thing
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.320]   And then we'll move on
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:52.400]   The other thing I heard him mention that I thought was really interesting for years. It seems like
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:58.840]   Apple went through this Microsoft's gone through it in several different ways. They've they've wanted to reimagine the document
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.880]   that it's not just a collection of
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.440]   text or pictures
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.640]   Smushed together in a single file that they can get rendered by an application
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:16.020]   But instead it's something alive. They can have components from a variety of places. It's kind of that object model desktop that
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:23.680]   Apple talked about and Microsoft talked about and now they've they've got something called the it's fluid
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:29.440]   Are you just fluid you I heard that giggle it's
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:36.720]   It's the flow is that what I'm talking about? That's yes, so I T windows I T pro explain this to me Lisa
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:44.480]   So the reason I'm laughing is when I was an info world my colleague Galen Gruman came up with the term fluid computing
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.920]   to describe the experience of beginning a computing task on
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:55.920]   One device and then continuing it via the cloud through other devices and the example he gave was
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:05.200]   In starting a story on his iPad and then finishing it on his laptop sensible and I'm not sure the phrase fluid computing ever
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.440]   really gained traction
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.960]   outside our office
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.320]   but
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.320]   the notion that
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.400]   we've uncoupled
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:22.200]   The the task flow and the results of that task flow from a device is is not exactly new and
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:28.900]   When I'm looking at what Microsoft's doing here. It's a really logical continuation of what they've been pushing
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.720]   with how they want to affect
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.120]   business productivity and
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:41.080]   end user experiences the past few years I've I've said enough sessions at Ignite or
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.760]   listen to enough streaming
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.480]   press press events or other
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.760]   You know dev events where they've talked about
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:56.600]   Breaking out of application silos. I don't know if they necessarily use that phrasing
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:02.640]   But that's that's the end result is the idea that instead of switching between applications and having to switch modes of working
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:10.240]   They're envisioning pushing people into just one workspace and then thinking about your work in terms of how am I manipulating this data?
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.400]   Where is it coming from? What do I want to do with it in the end? Yeah?
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:18.360]   I mean we've been tight. It's food computing gailin gailin nailed it down in like 2011 right 2012
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.160]   we've been we've been kind of tied to this notion that a
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:29.880]   Document is like a physical it's kind of a skeuomorphic way of looking things piece of paper that you type on and that's what that's a document
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:33.000]   And when we just made a digital version so there it's a little confusing
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.600]   Computing when they first introduced it. Yeah, we've yeah, I think even you go back arguably
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:45.040]   Trying to find a new metaphor now exactly you go back to Doug Engelbart's, you know demo
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:51.400]   The whole idea was well a document is a is a is a kind of this a holder for a variety of things
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:55.400]   So this new it I guess it's a new kind of office document
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.200]   that uses
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.200]   fluid components
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.960]   to
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.000]   Like this is the verge calls it like Lego blocks
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.600]   That let it to me when we talked about this it sounded a little bit like Google's wave that it was very short-lived
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:19.960]   Where a document is an opportunity to use the Minecraft metaphor instead of like a metaphor. Yeah, maybe they should have called a Minecraft
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:26.720]   Maybe I'm misunderstanding this but it's see we've tried to do this before and it's it seems like a great idea
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:32.720]   You know remember the works programs where you'd have one document put a graph in and a database in it
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:38.640]   You could this is even that on steroids. I mean it could be you know a lot of different kinds of components
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:46.360]   Well, this will give you some idea. This is this is the animated gif that Microsoft put out which is actually giving me a headache
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.400]   but
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.160]   so
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:54.600]   Am I characterizing this properly Daniel or is is that not what is because then there's also the fluid UI which
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:14:01.600]   This seems to be web design. I'm right. Yeah, so there is this idea of the fluid computing concept is also
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:05.280]   I think part of this larger goal that they have which is ambient computing
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.400]   This idea that you just have screens
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.680]   Operating systems are streamed to your device
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.840]   Everything is a lot more dynamic and yeah to use that word fluid, right?
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:20.680]   this idea that instead of you booting up a PC and have to load an
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:28.000]   Application and then bring down the document everything is kind of brought to you and you're less restricted to the device itself
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:32.280]   And this idea of computing is going to be really interesting how it's changing
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:36.480]   You know desktop computing is always going to be a thing just like laptops
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.800]   But how those evolve over the next five 10 15 years especially with 5g
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:45.600]   And how operating systems are changing and you're going to see that with Windows 10x of course
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:51.240]   Which is more going down that route of what a future operating system looks like and I think that you know
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:56.160]   What's been described here is that other piece of it the actual productivity end of how
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:05.200]   Modern operating systems should behave and are less restricted to the actual physical hardware that where we use data that I love this idea
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.880]   That's exactly right, but it's historically been difficult to do by the way
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:15.000]   I just noticed you're wearing the surface earbuds. Do you like those? Yes, I do. I thought it was a fancy piece of jewelry
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   I did no
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.480]   They're really nice. I mean, you know my review went up for him this week
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:26.960]   I spent a good two weeks with them and spent really a lot of detail into him and the bottom line
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.960]   I give him like a three out of five for a rating
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.800]   So I personally really like them a lot and I use them all the time big
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.560]   Don't you think they're kind of large?
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.040]   So they're large for a couple reasons the battery life
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.280]   You know they get eight hours per charge
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:44.120]   Which they're meant to be you put them in and leave them in all day
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:48.320]   and I think of these as being sort of like lifestyle earphones and
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.360]   This is a very niche and unique
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:57.000]   Aspect to these and I gotta give Microsoft credit at least it's a way to differentiate themselves from every other earbud
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.360]   But if you're looking for little at your buds you put in for an hour or two just to listen to your music
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.440]   You want to tune out the world these are not for you
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:09.920]   These are meant to you can kind of think of it in the future where you just carry around a one earpiece
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:14.280]   Maybe even but you can hear ambient noise around you some comes up to and talks to you
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.520]   You don't have to like wait what?
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.680]   Because you're gonna be able to hear everything at the same time you can hear from your devices
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:24.800]   You can stream media you can take that conference call are you using their microphone right now or using a separate?
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.860]   No, okay, I could but yeah, you know you have a better setting. Yeah, you have a much better
[00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:34.360]   Yeah, but the mics are pretty good on them, but so the size is for a couple reasons
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.360]   So the battery life is very good
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.400]   to their gesture supported so
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:47.200]   On one side you do climb up climb down by swiping down on the other side you go forward or back to skip tracks
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:53.640]   There's also the double taps. I think they had to have a large enough surface area right to actually
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.780]   To because you're not looking at yourself when you're doing it
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:01.360]   So you need to serve a target. I think they actually look good now that I'm kind of getting used to it
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.360]   They look better than those drippy
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.520]   Airpods
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.200]   Right, so and yeah, I have a lot of thoughts about that, you know because
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:13.040]   Airpods are now accepted everybody has them. We don't even notice it anymore
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.600]   I'm watching CNN and that's all anybody's wearing that's all you see
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:20.520]   Yeah, and so they're still weird looking we just all
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:26.760]   Yeah, it's no different than bell bottoms and it's it is a fashion thing right it
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:33.200]   Bell bottoms were huge years ago right in the 70s. You could go rock bell bottoms today
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:38.120]   If people just look at you weird, you know, I call that's different, but everybody started wearing them again
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:45.360]   Just be that right right so when I do like about them is when I'm looking at you and the profiles actually very slim
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.760]   You don't see them. It's only when you turn your head. Yeah, it's only when you turn your head
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:54.680]   So the audio quality is very good. My issue with them is there. I think they're a little expensive at $200
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:59.560]   You know, that's the price point now. I mean AirPod pros are 250
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:02.280]   So the pros are gonna be that much
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:07.880]   Yeah, but if you look at like some like galaxy buds or the pixel buds or you get this right yeah
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.800]   Those are half and like even you know
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:14.520]   I would compare these to regular airpods because they don't have noise cancellation on them
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.520]   either passive or
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:23.120]   Inactive so there's there's none of that here of the case, you know, which is right here is actually really nice
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:28.880]   But it doesn't have wireless charging. Oh, I think a lot of people expect. Oh, you know, so the battery case
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:36.260]   You have to it's a battery case, but it uses a type C plug. Oh, that's all right. That's the original AirPods
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.640]   Okay, that's fine as long as you can charge the buds in the case
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:45.520]   You can and so you get 24 hours you get eight hours of the initial charge and two more charges with this
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.480]   So that they're probably the longest lasting of anything out there right now
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:55.720]   And this is the other big thing. They're so comfortable like they really nailed the ergonomics of how this works
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.720]   So you can't wear them all day I
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.880]   Put these things in and you basically forget they're there
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.680]   They don't fall out that there's like I'm they lock into place into that ear
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.160]   And I can wear them for eight hours and wouldn't even think about it and that's really different from
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:14.520]   your buds that go into the ear canal, which you know, some people will enjoy but I
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:19.520]   Challenge anyone where does for two or three hours and see how their ears feel because it's gonna be painful
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:27.240]   Where these were meant to be you get up you put them on go to the office you work all day and you just wear them and I think that's a neat
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:34.040]   Market, it's not a mass market like I think most people will probably be okay with galaxy buds or pixel buds
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:39.240]   Whatever but for certain people who work in a professional environment who want all day your phones
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.160]   I think these are kind of awesome. I just wish the price was a little bit lower to be more competitive
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.960]   That was a little side light because I because I am
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:51.680]   I am ADD and I noticed you're wearing them and I'm sorry. Yeah, we were talking
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:57.960]   Build let me ask Lindsey cuz I don't know how much your attention you played to the build conference
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:02.360]   But you've been covering Microsoft for almost as long as as somebody like me has
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:06.760]   This is a very different company from the company of 10 even 10 years ago
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.400]   That's true. What's not true is that I
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:16.320]   Haven't actually been covering it very closely for a very long time
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:23.200]   But what I will tell you is that this ain't Bill Gates Microsoft this it is not or is it even
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.120]   Especially impressed with the way
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:30.000]   Satcha is pushing us toward thinking about
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   Interconnected companies. Yeah, and the way in which we think about how technology should work
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:45.600]   With technology from competitors, right? He seems to have completely moved on from this very competitive world that we were in
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:49.120]   When I started in technology journalism everything was a story for yeah
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:54.680]   And he he just kind of ignores that and moves on and says let's let's solve these problems
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:58.320]   And that's what I really like and enjoy about watching this kind of from the sidelines
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:06.720]   The other interesting thing that I'll say about Microsoft overall is that there's this sort of newfound love for Microsoft and maybe
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:14.440]   I don't know maybe it came from the from the young young gamers who fell in love with my room with Minecraft, but I
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:21.040]   Am you know, I live with a lot of teenagers and Microsoft is not at all the word. Yeah
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:26.920]   We have a PlayStation
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:33.440]   But really almost all of the entertainment happens on hand-built computers. Oh interesting
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:39.360]   Yeah, and they run windows and they're I mean they're PC gamers and they're young
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:44.400]   It's a young diverse set of PC gamers and it's just not a dirty word anymore
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:51.560]   You nailed it because I mean Bill Gates with nothing else and people young people don't remember don't know about the old Bill Gates
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.720]   They think he's that nice guy who's saving us from COVID-19
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:59.400]   But or giving it to us or giving it to us depending on their political
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.960]   I mean, maybe he wants to microchip us. I don't know. I can't follow any of this conspiracy crap
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.080]   but
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:12.920]   The Bill Gates of when he was CEO of Microsoft was a shark was a bloodthirsty shark
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:19.400]   Who was feared and loathed by everybody else in the industry? Nobody that's a this is a very different
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:26.800]   You're nailed at Lindsay. There's a very different Microsoft. It's even different from Steve Ballmer who said Linux open source is a cancer
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:30.000]   And now all of a sudden
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:37.560]   There Microsoft shipping that's one of the things they announced this week the Linux kernel in Windows
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:43.360]   Home as well as Windows Pro the Linux subsystem or Windows subsystem for Linux is
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:47.960]   Is basically Linux on Windows? They've got a terminal program
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:52.160]   They bought you the Minecraft is a perfect example
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:57.120]   Compare the Minecraft acquisition and the value it added Microsoft to the Nokia
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:02.840]   Acquisition under Steve Ballmer and the value it subtracted from Microsoft
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:07.760]   This is it's a it's night and day and they went you know when when they bought GitHub
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.440]   I think the open source community was angered and
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.800]   Disappointed and terrified and I think they've completely
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:18.720]   Malified the open source community. They've embraced open source
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:24.920]   Linux is the number one operating system running on Azure now it comes with Windows now
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.480]   It's such a different world. It's it's nothing like the old
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:36.560]   The old Microsoft were you impressed Daniel with the amount of open source embracing going on and build?
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:39.640]   Yeah, although you know, it's not surprising
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:44.760]   They have been talking about it for years now and just slowly rolling out things
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.760]   You know, I know a lot of people are like are they gonna open source Windows itself?
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:52.520]   But all these other technologies developer tools and
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:57.480]   You know, they are returning to their roots in a lot of ways as a computing company
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.720]   And that's what they focus on now
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:05.240]   And I think under Ballmer they tried to do become a consumer company and compete with Apple and we know how to end it up
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:08.680]   And listen, I know, you know, I say a Windows phone user. I love zoom
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:13.760]   But those were definitely failed strategies and that's not that's not what Microsoft is
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:20.080]   So back, you know under Nadella, they're just returning to this idea of just generalize computing everything
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:27.160]   Your building is for developers and software engineers and they're building out the systems for the next five 10 15 20 years
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.760]   And I think that's a nice change
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:35.600]   And I think it's why people are really enjoying sort of this new Renaissance of Microsoft and yeah
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:42.120]   No one really likes this idea of like, oh, we're gonna, you know, crush everybody and it's a cuddly. Yeah
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:46.960]   It's an embrace. What was it embrace and engulfing the English?
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:55.800]   It's like embrace and hug. It's a whole different. It's a whole different Microsoft is very interesting
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:04.040]   Nadella had was do you think that was his house or was that a set that he was on this whole thing was streamed had a very
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:07.160]   It could be either. He has a nice house. Yeah, well, obviously he's got a nice house
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:14.120]   He had behind him though. You could tell already I'm fascinated by what's behind people. He had behind him. What was the letters G
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:21.000]   Vw C2 CW. I can't remember the exact letters and we were looking at that's gone
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.160]   There's a message there before the end of the stream. We did a live stream of his talk somebody tweeted. Oh
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:33.400]   That's the words the word devs D E V S in base 64 encoded
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:41.280]   It was an Easter egg a secret Easter eggs embracing devs that only a geeky dev whatever
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:47.960]   Yet I thought I thought it was great Scott Hanselman followed and did I thought up
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:54.960]   To me that is it was a work-from-home keynote where he showed off all his his stuff as
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:26:00.200]   Hugh lights and the glow in the purple and it was having great fun and he was calling people and
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.120]   And showing off stuff and it went
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:07.640]   10 times better than the average on stage demo much less stilted
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:12.520]   I haven't I haven't seen the rest of the stuff, but it seemed like they really did a good job making build
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:20.760]   Engaging and entertaining and smart at the same it was the right balance between they had a lot of nerdy humor
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:26.160]   Which was nice, but they had a lot of good content, right and they had a lot of likable people who were just
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.920]   And that's tough to do. Yes, Scott's you know really fantastic, but they also had just a lot of good hosts
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:36.760]   And that's a tough thing to pull off. They they had to approach this differently. It's up getting a fun stage
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:43.440]   I'm gonna do my PowerPoint kind of thing right it was more like a TV production where you had to have scripts and this idea of segues and
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:49.680]   You know they did a lot of funny things too, but it was always it was just enough and never got corny or cheesy
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.520]   And I think that's why I kept people entertaining
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:58.760]   I think that's tough to do and I'm not sure that I don't know it'll be interesting to see if Google and Apple
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.880]   and rest these companies can find that right balance because
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:06.800]   Ultimately comes down to like talent like Scott Hanselman. It's not just a great developer
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:14.360]   But he's able to be on camera and you know do all that and that's that's hard, right? You can't force that
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:18.000]   We were Googling our GV to CW
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:27.960]   Through the whole thing and nothing came up, but now there's RG. What is it RGV to CW calm somebody registered the domain name
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:33.160]   let me see if I could come up somebody registered domain name now it's not coming up and and
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:39.400]   Made a site before the the keynote was over. I like that kind of geeky stuff
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:44.120]   It'll be interesting Google canceled their Google IO completely. They're gonna do it later
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:50.040]   But but Apple's developers conferences coming up next month and I think the gauntlet's been thrown down
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:55.760]   I think Apple showed I mean Microsoft shown Apple the way to do it. I wonder if Apple will pick it up there historically
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.760]   So button down and careful
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:01.040]   That's gonna be like a pay per view event be $70
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:07.760]   To watch it behind a paywall can only watch on Apple TV. I could just see it now
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:15.960]   Lindsey I wonder if you see this if if do we need in-person conferences wouldn't it be cool if a lot of these conferences went online?
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:20.040]   Oh my gosh, we have been spending so much time thinking about this and
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:26.840]   There's so many opportunities to talk about this kind of concept was so interesting about doing things only digitally
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:31.600]   Is that it opens up avenues that you can't do with any sort of hybrid model?
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:38.520]   So think about just like the kind of meeting that you have over zoom or Skype in a conference room a
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.200]   meeting where you have
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:47.440]   Five people sitting in a boardroom and then five people calling in to a video platform. It's a horrible meeting
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:53.240]   Yes, the people calling in can't really they don't feel like they're involved in the conversations happening in the room
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:56.080]   They can't read the social cues that are happening in the room
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:01.000]   But when everybody is on zoom or on the you know the digital platform of choice
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.320]   It's a completely different thing and everybody is on a level playing field
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:11.640]   And I wonder if we can get some of that with conferences now if there's gonna be really a chance for
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.320]   One person who's not
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:23.000]   Bill Gates to be giving a keynote and to get just as much attention as you know Bill Gates would be getting if there are
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.800]   10,000 people in the room when there are only 500 people in the room. I think it'll have a really
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.440]   leveling effect
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:33.120]   Are you doing how see I have zoom fatigue?
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:37.480]   Are you doing a lot of your work now on zoom? I
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:45.040]   Do an incredible amount of my work on zoom, but almost all of my one-on-one work. I now do just on the phone
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:50.200]   Oh interesting just audio just audio. I actually find that it's
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:55.520]   almost easier to concentrate yeah with just audio and to really like
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:30:04.200]   Home in on the sound and the words being spoken and not getting as wrapped up and what people are doing or what's going on in their background
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:08.360]   Obviously, that's different when you have to secure share screens
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:14.280]   That's interesting you have to work on something together then you need that zoom setting or something similar
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:18.480]   But when I when it's just about having a conversation more and more like please just call me
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:24.100]   See I ask you because Daniel and Lisa and to certain extent I we work from home
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:27.560]   We don't this is our you know, we're just our life hasn't changed at all
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:33.400]   But I I think especially because of your position Lindsey as a
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:37.240]   Senior vice president you spend a lot of time in conference rooms
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:44.440]   What a lot yeah, and I what has been interesting in our experiences that we really haven't missed a beat
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:50.160]   I mean journalism happens from everywhere and always has so in that sense
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.440]   We were very well set up to to deal with this situation
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:31:01.840]   But what I've been really impressed by is the ability for people across lots of different departments and business settings, you know, business intelligence
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:08.840]   Finance everybody has been working extremely well together, and I don't I don't feel like we really missed a beat
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.840]   And I think a lot of that has to do with
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:15.600]   The fact that we have so many options for how we communicate with each other in this moment
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:21.360]   It's been it's been fascinating. Yeah, and I spent a lot of time thinking about how
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:29.320]   Okay, obviously we never wanted this to happen. We never want this to happen again. It's a terrible situation, but we are so much better
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:36.080]   Able to handle it now than we would have been ten years ago. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, I mean what I mean
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:39.840]   It's almost as if we were preparing for this
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:47.280]   In many respects, you know zoom and all these you know meat and zoom and Skype and all of these things are relatively recent
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:54.480]   Inventions I remember and I mentioned this before in 1965 when I was a kid went to the New York World's Fair and AT&T had a
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:03.160]   You know TV phone and ever and this in the future all your phone calls will be video phone phone calls
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:07.720]   And I remember ten twenty years later 2001 it came out in the 70s
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:10.200]   Where he went?
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:14.640]   Floyd went to Mar or the moon and he calls his family and there's the kid
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:19.640]   They're having a birthday party on a big screen in a phone booth and it seemed like the future
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.640]   But it never caught on
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:27.240]   Because nobody really everybody really wanted to put on and get pants on and stuff for a phone call
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.880]   So it just never caught on except now. I think this is a
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:35.360]   Flip moment in a watershed moment where we're just gonna expect all phone calls to be video
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:40.360]   I think it's interesting that you're not as productive in video and you you it depends on the setting
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:45.680]   I find that when I need to have a really intricate conversation with somebody that doesn't require any visuals
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:51.160]   I think audio can be a you can definitely focus better. I agree with you
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.400]   Yeah, the issue is distracting
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:57.000]   We I've spent I spent some time talking with a friend about
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.960]   Who's read infinite just I mean not suggesting what you should have it takes a year. Oh my god
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:06.200]   I've read it. I've started it 20 times. I've got this far
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:10.160]   Infinite just David Foster Wallace predicts
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:13.200]   This a lot of what's going on
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:19.120]   Not from a pandemic standpoint, but from a video conference standpoint. There's a there's a whole
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.840]   storyline about people having a sort of a video
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:27.120]   Machine like the one you're describing a very sort of a sci-fi
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:36.160]   But basically FaceTime and then a whole sub economy grows up around people who make masks that look just like you that you can put in front of the
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:39.520]   Camera so that you can do things like pick your toenails. Oh while you're on the video
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:43.360]   There that's what people are doing. I know oh
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:48.000]   Scott Hansel and they actually did it during his keynote at Bill
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   He got up and left and he was still there
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:57.920]   Wow, I'm okay now I'm gonna have to finish that again or try good luck. Yeah good luck
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:04.040]   I'll wait for the movie HBO series. Oh, man. It's a great novel and every time I started
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:09.640]   I think I should really finish this but I have yet to find a way to get through it
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:12.280]   it's interesting because
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:17.600]   At the same time as this is brought video calling to the forefront
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:23.440]   It's hurt some technologies obviously face ideas nice. It's useful when you're wearing a mask
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:29.440]   I wish I'd touch ID on my iPhone in fact I went back to the iPhone SE because it has touch ID
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:33.520]   It's perfect for masks. You can unlock it even when you're wearing a bag
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:38.880]   But also I think this is gonna hurt and we were talking about this today with Samable Sumit
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:45.520]   Or a car guy on the radio show it might hurt the future of autonomous vehicles and especially ride-sharing
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:50.240]   Because nobody wants to ride an uber or a lift these days. I
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.560]   Think yeah
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:55.480]   Yeah
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:59.080]   Go ahead Daniel. I think some of that will will pass
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:02.320]   Get over it. We'll go back to the normal. Yeah, well
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:07.000]   It all I mean obviously depends if they get a vaccine or treatment right for this
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.800]   Accentized and that trauma doesn't go away even if there's no rationale for it. You know, I mean
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:19.080]   Possibly I mean I'm more concerned about movie theaters. I'm really wondering how movie theaters are right to survive
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:24.920]   And so it really is an interesting time to think about and that's where the work-from-home stuff is really fascinating
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:30.680]   And Nadella talked about that too that you know more has happened in the last two months then in the last
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:35.680]   You know five ten years of this and you write all these companies have been pushing towards this
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:41.840]   Although we seem pushback to right IBM famously made it by work-from-home or a large portion of their company
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.680]   And then they reversed it and they said all right you got all come back to work
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:46.760]   This is all before the pandemic right course
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:52.440]   So there's been this kind of you know pull and tug regarding work from home whether or not it's effective or not
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:56.240]   But now I've been pushed into it. You have a lot of companies, you know Twitter
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:00.040]   Who you know come out and said that you know, we're gonna remain work from home
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.280]   Microsoft is doing a lot of it as well and
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:08.320]   It it as good as the technology is it's also revealing a lot of holes in the game as well
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:14.840]   So that's what's gonna be real interesting to see how companies pivot now to solve these problems including this idea of like zoom fatigue
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:19.140]   Video fatigue that a right needs to do a video call. So how do you solve that?
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:24.080]   One area that's been really sort of underplayed but because it's still too early
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:28.920]   I think it's course virtual reality augmented reality and I think that's could solve you know
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.440]   We saw marks up two years ago
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:36.920]   I believe show off like was it hollow portation where you put on the hall lens and but they had different cameras and you can actually kind of
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:41.120]   You know be as a hologram in someone's room and talk to them physically now
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:46.880]   We're still years from that but it's good to take another pandemic before we get except that I think yeah
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:50.220]   International norms
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:54.080]   Well, let's go ahead talk about that Lisa. That's interesting. What do you mean?
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.360]   the reason I say
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:04.080]   generational norms is you're talking about the shift to say video conferencing but if you look at people under 30
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:11.040]   They have been sending each other snap chats and communicating via images for good point nearly a decade good point
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:15.160]   and so for them going to video conferencing is a
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:21.720]   Logical next step and they're the same people who have been driving the idea of the fluid workspace that we discussed earlier
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:26.600]   Because these are kids who went through an entire school system using Google Docs and Google tools
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:32.800]   Where they grew up with a model that all of their work would be reviewed by other people as they were doing it
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:36.400]   it would be and it was a really collaborative iterative model of work and
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:45.560]   There have been people who study the workplace who have talked about there are real generational shifts in how folks who went into the workplace in the 80s
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:47.560]   70s 80s and 90s
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:53.280]   Regard task flow compared to people who have come in having come up on a say the Google Docs model
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:59.680]   And I think we're gonna see the same thing when it comes to teleworking and having zoom fatigue and things like that
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:07.920]   Because if you've had a method of work that's primarily self-contained and you've got these very structured communications that are other face-to-face
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:14.560]   They're on the phone. You're probably not going to be used to be always on visually stimulating
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:21.600]   Modes like zoom calls or image chats and things like that. Whereas for kids who have grown up with this is their normal
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.600]   We're gonna have the snap workplace, aren't we?
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:31.280]   You know, I actually I have a different take on that which is that I think a lot of these kids are
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:36.000]   Very able to be like three different versions of themselves at the same time
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:42.760]   So there's the version that you're putting on snapchat and then there's the version on discord, which is mostly voice
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:47.640]   And you're doing those things concurrently and they're very very
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:55.600]   Able to show only part of themselves and it's the part that they choose and I actually think that the resistance to any sort of virtual
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:39:01.440]   Appearance like the stuff that Facebook and Oculus are most certainly working on the ability to let you
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.480]   Show up in a room with your friends
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:09.040]   I think that the resistance to that might be if I have to show up physically
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:12.880]   Whether it's in a physically virtually or physically physically
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:19.520]   I have to be much more aware and it's it takes like cognitive load to think about how you look on camera
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:27.440]   What your facial expressions are whether you're responding to somebody when they're talking to you and you're in your body and your affect is responding
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.840]   And I think that it takes more work
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:34.880]   And that's part of the reason people get zoom fatigue because they are they're tired
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:39.120]   But isn't that what you're doing real life Lindsay? I mean, how's that different here because you have to spend a lot
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.200]   Yeah, go ahead. Well, yeah
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:45.840]   I think that is what you do in real life and that's part of the reason you know, like the teenagers that I live with sometimes
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:50.880]   Would be like why don't before the pandemic? Hey, why don't you go hang out with your friends and they kind of look at you
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:54.160]   As scans and go I am I am
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.800]   Yeah, I'm like
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:00.800]   We'll have friends over and then they'll all go home so they can play a game together
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.920]   Because they can't
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:10.640]   My news is 22 and my nephews are younger. They're both teenagers and it's been really interesting watching every family gathering
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:14.640]   At the same time they're talking to us in person. They'll have their phones open because they're snapchatting
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.800]   They're trying to make the same talk to you
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:20.480]   It's but it's fascinating because it's parallel socialization
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.040]   In a way. Yeah, Lindsay
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:28.320]   Yeah, when kids are little they parallel play when they're really little like a two-year-old
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:31.760]   They sit there and they're playing with each other, but they're doing different things
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:34.640]   Now they've grown up in real life
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:38.960]   No, it's fast they they switch modes in real time though
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:39.840]   It was so much
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:45.840]   It's so fascinating to watch them do it and to realize that their relationship the way they talk to people compared to the way they talk
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:51.040]   Or or communicate online with their friends whether it's your texts or emojis or snapchatts
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:54.240]   It's
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:59.120]   I think that kind of mode switching sense it's exhausting but they're habituated to it
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:03.200]   And I think that's something that we're probably going to see a lot more of this is a deep topic
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:08.160]   I want to talk more about but I want to take a break but I do I think this is interesting that in a way the
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:13.200]   Quarantine and the pandemic have crystallized all it's almost as if
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:17.920]   What are they when you make rock candy, you know, you have a super saturated
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:19.840]   uh
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:22.080]   Liquid with sugar in it and you drop one
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:26.560]   Bit of sugar in it and all crystallizes instantly. I feel like the pandemic
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:32.640]   Did that it was a catalyst that's brought on a reaction that all this stuff that was just waiting
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.040]   To happen
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:38.480]   Has happened. It's fascinating to think about the new normal and what it's going to look like
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:44.080]   But I we do need to take a break. We will we got a great panel man. We're going to get get deep and get going on this
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:50.960]   Daniel Rubino from uh windows central he's executive editor there look for his new review of those giant
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.680]   Gages he's wearing in his ear
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:58.480]   Uh, it's always great to have Lisa schmizer here from windows. I'm sorry it pro today
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:02.720]   I always want to say windows it pro today, but it pro today. It's mostly windows, right
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:06.480]   That might change though. You might have to start doing some Linux stuff
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:10.880]   We do we we actually do have a really good open source writer christine hall
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:16.000]   so we cover that and in following microsoft's key we're moving away from uh
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.720]   Assuming that enterprise computing is predicated on the operating system and looking more at
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:24.720]   Application platforms as the basis for it. Yeah, that's true
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:31.520]   Also here senior vice president for content strategy via calm cbs. I love saying that lindsey turntine
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:37.040]   I note that lindsey have finished infinite jest as did karstin our producer
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:42.880]   Both harvard graduates. So I think that tells you something me the yale dropout. I only got an about page
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:49.040]   You also dropped out of infant. I drop out of everything. I never finished anything
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:54.000]   I've been here 15 years. I can't believe it. That's like what is going on. I'm suddenly
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:59.040]   Something finishing things our show today is brought maybe not maybe it's not done yet
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.760]   Our show today is brought to you by epson
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.960]   I am a fan of our epson eco tank printers
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:09.840]   These days as you're working from home. You got the kids home. They're doing their homework
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:11.680]   That printer is working a lot harder
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:14.320]   The last thing you want to worry about is running out of ink and
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:20.000]   The beauty of the epson eco tank that's the that's the printer that makes it so easy
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.840]   Super-sized
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:24.000]   easy to fill tanks
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.640]   It comes when you buy it with a ridiculous amount of ink thousands of pages worth of ink
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:32.480]   in in most average use cases although we're not average anymore, but
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:37.600]   Two years. I'm still using the set the I bought a second ink set so I'd be ready
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:39.840]   And I'm still using the original set with our eco tank
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:43.520]   Uh, and it's been almost two years thousands of pages
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:47.520]   So you know in the middle of a print job, you know the kids printing out the
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:52.000]   Report or whatever no more rushing to the store to replace an ink cartridge in between jobs
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:44:00.400]   You can kiss expensive ink cartridges. Goodbye. Eco tank is changing the way people print look at shack there. That's cute
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.920]   He makes that printer look really small then
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:10.320]   Go ahead and print all your work reports your task lists your kids homework assignments
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:16.560]   In beautiful color too. The kids want the color eco tank makes it easy added to your online shopping list
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:20.320]   So like shack you could you too could just fill and
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:25.920]   Chill check out epson eco tank printers. They're best buy office depot office max staples
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.840]   And of course epson.com slash eco tank leo e pson
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:35.680]   We've i'm using epson printers since I first got a computer going back to my mx 80 with a tractor feed
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:40.880]   And what I love about epson is they've just kept up with the times and I think the eco tank is the best printer made
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:48.960]   epson.com slash eco tank leo epson exceed your vision
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.840]   They actually have different sizes. I don't I don't it's just his hand is so big
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:58.400]   I don't know it's hard to tell it looks like you gotta hit palm that printer and just pick it up and
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:01.040]   Throw it. He's a big guy
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:03.840]   Um, but actually you made you brought this up
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:06.720]   Earlier, uh, Daniel twitter says
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:12.320]   You know what nobody's gonna have to come in and again ever again. That's it. We're all gonna work from home
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:19.120]   Facebook said the same thing, but then mark zuckerberg this week said but we met this was shocking to me
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:24.640]   We may adjust your salary depending on where you live. I think a lot of silicon valley
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:34.320]   Workers are saying great. I can move to montana by an estate for the price of the rent of my my one bedroom apartment in silicon valley
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:40.960]   And and still make the same money, but mark saying well, we're gonna take that into come on mark ridiculous
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.280]   That is just
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:48.080]   Is it val is that ridiculous most salaries are usually pegged to the geographic location?
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:52.640]   I think in this case your salary should be pegged to your value to the company
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:57.440]   Yeah, and engineers in companies like facebook are worth a lot of money
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:02.800]   The risk of doing that is that that engineer is gonna say well. Yeah, great. I'll go to google
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:04.800]   Will they pay me what i'm worse?
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:08.240]   I think that the real difficult thing here is asking people to take a pay cut
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.240]   Yes, I mean, yes
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:14.400]   You have been given and assigned value that you've internalized
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:17.680]   I would assume and I think it's just it's a big ask
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.320]   Well, it's like telling women
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:25.280]   Time this has happened though. I mean I um, I don't know during the first dot com
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:31.440]   Collapse, I remember companies doing this and moving jobs to like india and saying hey
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:34.080]   You can move to india
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:36.080]   And take it
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:42.960]   No, we'll pay you in rupees. It's great. You're gonna love it. Mm-hmm. Well, this is something I kept saying on twitter is everybody was saying
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:46.080]   Oh, this is gonna be the end of the california real estate market
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:49.840]   This is the end of silicon valley because now the town can go anywhere
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:54.080]   And they'll still pull down these amazing prices and I thought does nobody remember outsourcing
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:56.800]   because you know a company
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:01.040]   In a in a fair and just world a company should pay
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:05.440]   Employees by value, but they're always going to be looking at you know
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:11.520]   Employee compensation as an expense to be managed and if they can find a way to manage it. That's true. I'll do that
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.760]   Um, yeah in a perfect
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.320]   Value are employees by what they what they bring us
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:19.840]   But but we certainly do consider the fact well we're living in petaluma
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:23.040]   So we don't have to pay them as much as if we were living in san francisco's one of the reasons
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.040]   Honestly, I'll be honest
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:27.520]   One of the reasons our studios are in petaluma the rents less
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:31.600]   The salaries can be less because it's you can live well in petaluma
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:37.440]   But I think I think I don't know it's this is one of the reasons women get paid less as you know 82 cents on the dollar
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:41.840]   Because the because people still think well the man's got a supportive family
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:47.200]   So we got to pay him more. I mean this yeah, I think that's old school thinking that's not good
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:50.160]   the issue it's
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:54.640]   I was gonna say that about the pay cut like I can understand maybe going forward
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:59.440]   They're gonna be hiring people to be like yeah basing the salary on something else
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:06.080]   But I think to exact you know ask existing employees to take a pay cut because you're not gonna live in expensive area
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:08.640]   I yeah, that's really kind of that's weird
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.640]   I also wonder if
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:14.080]   This is really gonna happen not with people are gonna
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:17.360]   What's the first thing marissa mire did when she went to yahoo?
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:21.520]   She told all the work all the employees you're coming in you're coming to work
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:27.520]   And I think there's still a very persistent thought that people who are working from home are not working as hard
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:31.440]   As people were in the office. There's also the value of having
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:34.720]   co-workers
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:37.680]   Especially if you're an engineer or coder having colleagues
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:42.480]   That you can talk to during the work day, you know, that's one of the things microsoft showed
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:48.480]   I thought in great detail. Hanselman was showing that is part pair programming and ways to work to collaborate
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:50.720]   Even though you're not in the same space
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:53.200]   But that's never
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.760]   Is this sort of a live ab test right now? I guess it is
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:02.400]   Yeah, if you continue to be as productive as they were and I assume that that will vary by
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:05.280]   specialty and company and
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:12.800]   Tools that they use but if a company does find that their workforce is just as productive working from home
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:16.720]   That sort of dispelled the whole notion that you're not as productive anywhere from home and and there will
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:19.360]   In theory be no argument against that
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:25.360]   We're in no hurry to bring our employees back most of the employees are working from home including many of our hosts
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:27.360]   uh
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:28.800]   Well a because
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:30.800]   The virus is still there and it go away
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:34.480]   So we're we're going to continue to shelter in place
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:41.680]   But also it does seem to be working. We are able to get it done in fact one of the things engineering wise we're we've been looking at is
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:48.640]   moving some of our stuff to the cloud so that people can you know editors and so forth continue to work from home
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:51.360]   effectively
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:56.400]   I think every field is going to have to evaluate what works and what does and I think it's wrong to assume
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:50:02.000]   Of course and not that anyone is that this work from home will work for everyone right like in every
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:08.320]   That's not going to be the case and there will be some jobs where they will benefit from being in person
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:14.400]   And that's where you get into this idea of like even just having an office and you rotate employees in and out of it
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:18.960]   For periods of time. So maybe you don't go to the office five days a week
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:25.920]   You only come in one or two days and you can so there's going a lot of experimentation here once things start to return a little bit back to normal
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:30.160]   Um, and I think every company is going to have to figure that out even in our company
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:33.120]   We're owned by future now future PLC. Oh, that's right
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:38.560]   Yeah, and they still have offices they have offices in New York City downtown Manhattan
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:41.280]   Um, but there's sales offices aren't they?
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:43.920]   No, they they have offices where real
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:49.360]   Now the writers go in and it's rural offices in New York city. Um, my husband works
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:54.400]   If my husband's a senior's editor a senior editor at toms guide and although he works from home on the west coast
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:57.280]   That's interesting the rest of his team is on the east coast in New York
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:02.800]   If there's one thing you could do virtually it's be a be a tech journalist, right?
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:05.360]   And that's where like in the
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:09.760]   Mobile nations we were all virtual we if we didn't have any offices and we've been working
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:14.080]   That's one that made our company so valuable was the fact we had no overhead
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:18.160]   And now they're starting to catch on to this like do we really need to reopen all these offices?
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:21.680]   And we're like why why do you need to go to an office to do this job?
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:23.680]   Right for sale sure, but
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:28.480]   ours technica had a great article like a month and a half ago where they basically laid out
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:31.600]   Here's how our virtual office works. It was even before we sheltered in place
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:39.920]   And they had all their best practices and the team I'm on we've been 100 percent remote and geographically dispersed for like four years now
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:46.240]   And it's worked out. Well, that said I will say there is something for being able to meet in person and have meetings
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:50.800]   Where you can bounce ideas off each other and establish and reinforce
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:53.440]   Um rapport with somebody
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:57.040]   Yeah, so I think there's always going to be an opportunity
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:00.640]   There will always be a space for um
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:05.200]   Dedicated work spaces. There will always be I think companies will probably
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:07.680]   Try to carve out
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:11.760]   Some sort of working environment to foster those kind of opportunities, but I'm
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:17.440]   I would be really surprised if a lot of companies in the Bay Area where real estate is very expensive
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:20.480]   Are not taking a good hard look and
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:24.720]   Trying to come up with hybrid models that let them get the best of all possible worlds. Yeah
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:27.680]   Yeah
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:29.920]   They always said the one thing I think go ahead go ahead
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:34.080]   The thing I'm thinking about with remote work is I had a friend who interviewed for a job recently
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.200]   um
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:38.400]   And she got she got the offer the jobs based in ithaca
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:43.520]   And they they gave her the salary and she said I can't live on that and they said well, why not?
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:46.720]   This is competitive for ithaca. She said well, I don't live in ithaca
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:49.280]   And they said that sounds like a you problem
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:51.280]   Not a
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:55.200]   Move to ithaca they said it only snows half the year they said
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:58.640]   But this I think this is the thing is right now
[00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:01.840]   I've seen a lot of twitter threads where everybody is like, oh, you know
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:07.200]   Everyone's got to have silicon valley type salaries and then we'll just spread across the country and boost other metros
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.280]   Since the end of the superstar city and some of them so forth
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:12.480]   And I kept thinking it's gonna work the other way too
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:15.840]   Where you'll have other employers and other parts of the country
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:22.960]   Offering these salaries, but they're they're still going to tie them pretty heavily to the local economy because that's just kind of how they work
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:27.200]   With their operating expenses. It doesn't make sense to be an engineering firm
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:34.400]   In a non-silicon valley type area where you lit and and have to carry the kind of overhead
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:38.400]   You'd be expected to carry in silicon valley that's that may not be the best way for you to do business
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:44.160]   I think the other positive effect that's going to have for engineering specifically is that I feel like
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:48.080]   The Bay Area was essentially out of engineers
[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:51.840]   Simply not enough
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:58.160]   Employees to come into offices and so the I think you know salary aside the ability to recruit
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.960]   Engineers who maybe didn't want to move to the Bay Area
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:05.520]   Had a family life somewhere else but are extremely qualified will be it will be a boon
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:12.400]   Especially if a lot of large companies are being forced to to sort out how to make remote work work
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:17.920]   When it wasn't previously so so Lindsey my question to you is one of the
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:22.720]   Deterrence I've heard from engineers when it comes to the Bay Area is they don't
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:30.240]   Like the workaholic lifestyle or the expectation that a 75 hour work week is the bog is the bog standard
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:37.440]   So if you do get a chance to widen your recruitment pool and you're able to pull from other
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.440]   other
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:41.440]   You know talented people over the country
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:49.200]   Do you think there's the possibility that the culture of silicon valley firms might be affected simply because they're going to have a workforce
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:53.360]   That's resistant to some of the cultural expectations that we take for granted around here
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:56.560]   I think that's really hard to know, but I will say that I hope
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:58.960]   That it changes
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:04.080]   And I I I think that there it could go a couple of different ways and like with anything else
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:06.800]   It may depend on the company and the culture of the company in question
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:12.240]   But I do think that this time and this this experiment that we're in right now like it or not
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.880]   Will help us sort out
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:20.480]   Where how we draw boundaries as a corporation how individuals draw boundaries around the workday
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:24.000]   We're sort of being forced to because we could in this moment work
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:29.760]   200 hours a week and there's really nothing to stop us. And and so I think people are going to
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:32.480]   Develop their coping mechanisms
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:37.440]   On the other hand humans are humans and some will work themselves to death and some won't work enough
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:41.120]   And that may just be the same no matter where you work. That's the cynic in me saying
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:46.400]   Oh jack dorsey's just saying yeah work from home will expect 90 hours now a week, you know
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:52.240]   You're always working you're working from home. You're always on the job. So that's the real that is a real risk
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:57.440]   There's something you said though from the savings of not having to go to an office
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:02.240]   I mean I wake up in the morning. I roll into my job in five minutes
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:08.400]   like there's no without commuting without these massive lunch breaks and some of these forced meetings and
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:13.760]   People can be more productive, but it does depend on the individual too
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:20.400]   A lot of people work from home lots of distractions and you know, that's that's what's going to change with
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:23.280]   You know, some people can't adjust to this lifestyle. So
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:26.000]   That's gonna be an interesting thing going forward. I think for
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:31.680]   People and how they get evaluated on work and whether or not they can actually, you know handle working from home
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:39.360]   But there's something to be said from the lack of wasted time that people aren't being actually productive that counts as going to work
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:44.800]   You know, so I think that's really interesting distractions very because at work you've got people bugging you
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:47.440]   at home. You've got a ham sandwich
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:50.080]   Talking to you from the
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:54.880]   Well, that's hard
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:57.600]   What you don't want is the kids home at the same time as you are
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:02.640]   Yeah, but if you but if the kids had a workday where they went to work
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:09.840]   I ease school and you could stay home that wouldn't be that bad would I mean it's pretty like no honey staying home and working
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:11.840]   Years foot pants is a grown-up pretty much so
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:22.160]   Sometimes I feel like this is mother nature's covet is mother's nature's way of saying you know
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:27.280]   Here's you got to fix the climate crisis because the air is clean. The cars aren't on the road
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:30.480]   It is clear. There's a huge cost to commuting
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:37.280]   There's a personal cost, but there's a societal cost. There's an ecological cost just stress and stress
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:42.320]   Yeah, I've although I've heard a couple people say I missed my commute
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:45.200]   Well, that's my commute was when I
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:51.360]   You know, listen to infinites that's right. The only way you're ever going to finish infinites is with your four-hour commute
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:54.800]   Yeah, or catch up with your family or listen, you know
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:59.840]   Listen to music in your car. I'm not saying that those things are good things for society
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:02.960]   But but it's such an individual response. No, I agree
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:09.440]   Some people miss that so much and some people are so thrilled to have to be gone and probably most of us would like a hybrid
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:14.000]   Well, you need me time. So what you can do is carve out me time
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.920]   It doesn't involve being in a car or you could just go in the garage and sit in your car
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:24.240]   And we we silently because I can't get privacy anywhere else
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:31.440]   I miss my commute. I miss you car
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:40.400]   I did not realize this but apparently it wasn't just the rgv2cw message
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:45.840]   There were easter eggs throughout all the build streams daniel. Did you were you aware of that there?
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:50.640]   There there was a yeah, they were even to the point where they were coordinating
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:53.360]   uh, their polo shirts to be
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:56.640]   Microsoft green blue and red
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:04.160]   Oh, wow, I didn't catch that but it was a handsome and told the the verge we had scripts and storyboards
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:06.480]   We put it on like it was an hour of television
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:10.160]   Um, they were there was the bouncing amiga ball
[00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:16.800]   in uh in one of one of the screens during the build event they were doing all sorts of stuff that only nerds
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:19.200]   would notice
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:25.680]   Scott had a program that was written an app that was written by microsoft called presence light
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:29.440]   That changed his hue light bulbs to match his desktop theme
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:32.560]   I mean there was a lot of stuff like that. That was kind of wild
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:37.920]   You probably noticed it because you know, that's your job. I didn't know I don't I don't get into that stuff
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:42.320]   I really I don't care about easter eggs. I don't care about nerdy jokes. I'm there for the actual content
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:45.840]   It's I'm glad they did that and that goes to again why
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:51.840]   I felt like there was a lot of talent that got this to be entertaining for people because a lot of people do enjoy that
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:55.680]   Um for myself. I I rolled my eyes at I was like, I don't really care
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:57.680]   But I'm a second
[00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:04.400]   Yeah, I don't know maybe that's just me because I'm kind of a geeky guy. I kind of enjoy the uh
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:10.960]   The silliness the geeky the easter eggs kind of as a reference to content. So yeah, exactly
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:13.520]   You know me. You know me so well
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:16.240]   Um, I thought it was very good. I hope that uh
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:22.880]   This is this is a parallel uh issue too because conferences one of the things people miss from conferences is the face-to-face
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.520]   Sure, I think what might happen
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:30.640]   For both work at home and conferences is you carve out time for the face-to-face
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:34.080]   You have a special, you know a conference is just face-to-face
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:39.280]   And and maybe people pay extra to go to build that's just face-to-face and the rest of it
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:46.160]   Everybody can stay home and watch or your company has friday, you know casual day where everybody comes to the office
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:50.880]   And you have a barbecue and you get some of that collaborative juices going. I think it's possible
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:54.800]   Maybe that that's how an adaptation adaptation we'd make to them
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:01:01.920]   I think that that's absolutely feasible one of the other things that's really interesting is as well with covid specifically is this idea that
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:08.400]   Um, it seems like it's becoming more and more clear that indoor transmission is right. That's the problem. Yeah
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:14.720]   Indoors is bad. Yeah, you know outdoors is less bad, although you should still be very careful. Please wear a mask
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.720]   But
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:20.640]   I've been thinking about how this affects different parts of the united states, you know
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:24.960]   When I think about my office in the Bay Area and things that we could do collaboratively over time
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:27.200]   We might choose to do some of it outside
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:33.440]   Manhattan is a different story. Yeah, and the weather will affect our ability to
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:39.520]   meet and greet and collaborate outdoors and is that an advantage for places with more temperate
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:43.360]   Weather just during this next year or two when we're trying to
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:47.760]   Make our way through this. I think you could meet at the hot dog cart
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:52.880]   Get some peanuts get some peanuts every time I go to New York
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:55.680]   I get those roasted caramelized peanuts. I just love those
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:57.280]   They're so good
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:02.400]   And just walk around with those and then if you have a little extra spend you can get the cashews and really live it up. That's luxury
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:09.520]   Are you using let me ask you um, uh, Lindsay if you're using uh zoom at
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:17.760]   Viacom C. Yes. Yeah, we're using zoom primarily. We use different things for different situations. Um, sometimes we'll use built-in
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:20.800]   Google tech but um
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:22.320]   primarily zoom
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:27.440]   How about how about uh, you lisa is it a zoom is it pro today using zoom or?
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:31.680]   No, it's microsoft. It's like a club teams teams. Yeah
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:38.080]   Yeah, teams is fine. There's another one with teams you like teams. So the interesting I do and it's
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:44.880]   it's been because it's it's turned into our de facto collaborative workspace for us to
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:50.400]   Drop drop drafts of stories that we're working on to share things too cute
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.400]   We have an off topic channel that we just keep running and keep up the chatter
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:03:00.000]   The thing I found interesting anecdotally is before the lockdown started
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.760]   Through the company there was a culture of conference calls where you just you know
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:08.720]   You dial in and you'd listen and you'd be working on your computer as you listened or you'd be participating as necessary
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:11.520]   And now we've gone to all teams video all the time
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:16.800]   So, how about you, daniel, what is what does mobile nations do?
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.920]   Yeah, we've been using slacks since
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:25.760]   2015 no 2014 maybe like I mean whenever slack came out we
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:31.360]   Pivoted right to it because we were always remote anyway and and geographically
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:36.800]   Uh, so that became an important tool and then we would use often google hangouts
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:39.360]   Um, and then a little bit of skype
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:45.360]   Internally some of us were using teams for a while we do have the windows central team was using teams
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:51.280]   Um and and teams is really good for just dropping in a video call like right in that chat, which is cool
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:52.960]   but um
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:55.440]   Now we've got all a future on to slack
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:58.560]   Which that was my choice. I would prefer teams
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:02.240]   But we do have a bunch of other sites and they're right and joys using slack
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:07.200]   So that actually future wasn't even using a paid version of slack and now you can use it for your work
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:12.960]   They are yeah, yeah, now they're they're using the free the paid version for it. So um, but yeah
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:17.840]   We just do yeah slack and then uh, then we use telegram for the real
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:22.560]   Oh really? Yeah, that's where the good stuff happens. Uh, that's where the employees where we hang off and you know
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:29.200]   You're not gonna use no corporate spyware now man. Yeah, we want to use russian spyware instead. Yeah much better
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:31.040]   Yeah
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:34.800]   Yeah, we use slack as well and that's part of the problem with slack is it's too much fun
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:39.840]   Um, all the animated gif activity and it's really actually quite
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:42.160]   I hate it. I I
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:46.160]   I fairly use those things. I I jump in here's what i'm doing
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:49.040]   I'll answer a question is so notes post something i'll read it
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:56.160]   I don't spend the way I look at it. I have to write all day and i'm not a great writer and I don't particularly love it
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.480]   I'm not gonna waste my keyboard
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:00.240]   fingers on
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:03.600]   Nonsense and slack like I could be writing a paragraph right now
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:10.240]   So I know some people do get distracted with slack and chatting all day. I'm I turn that stuff off
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:15.760]   I I don't look at it my first experience with slack was when we were developing our website and the team in uh, Austin that was
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:21.280]   Uh, got us on slack and they had set up a gif bot that every time you typed that's nice
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:24.080]   Borat would pop up going that's nice
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:30.320]   And for a while didn't know why is borat what how
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.800]   What's going on? I was very disoriented
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:40.800]   Is this real life am I hallucinating? I don't understand
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:48.320]   It's just irc for the modern world. Yeah, well, I like irc. There's no borat in irc. I gotta tell you that
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:51.360]   Uh, did was there concern?
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:57.920]   Uh at cbs via comm when all the zoom security issues
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:02.880]   Came up was there a move at some point to say maybe we should go somewhere else for our
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:04.800]   conferencing
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:10.480]   I honestly don't know what happened at at the it at the top of the it food chain and those discussions
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:14.800]   I'm assuming that those discussions happened. Um, we didn't stop using zoom
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:20.720]   But I think different part it's a very large organization. So different parts of the organization were using different technologies
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.320]   We got
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:24.320]   Really fast follow on about the right
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:26.320]   secure way
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.320]   to pursue
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:35.440]   And and kept moving there wasn't a big moment where we all stopped using it. Um, although I do have kind of a funny
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:43.360]   uh story about my my son's school district, which is the berkeley unified school district. There was a high school class that
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:52.560]   Basically shut down using zoom for e-learning because of a security breach or perceived security breach which was some
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:59.680]   The story was it was an adult man who basically took off his clothes and crashed a photography class
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:01.280]   Oh my god
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:04.160]   Yeah, it is and my son is on this call
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:07.200]   That shut down zoom for all of v usc
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:10.720]   It was actually just a kid in the class. Yeah
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:18.800]   Frashing the zoom stream with a gif. Of course. I know which gift. Yes. I know exactly
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:23.360]   Which and and my son was like it was actually really funny
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.200]   Yeah
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.760]   And I don't know why that's definitely
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:34.160]   Interesting that's a generational gap because all the kids knew exactly what happened. They knew exactly what happened. They got it
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:40.960]   I mean, it wasn't appropriate. It's not right. No, but they'd all seen that they'd all seen that picture many many times
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:47.520]   That's pretty funny. That's generational and the teachers were going. Oh my god. There's an old man in here
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.200]   It was yeah, it was it was definitely an interesting moment
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:55.760]   I mean, I think it caused the district to really sort out what they needed to sort out from a security perspective anyway
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.440]   So it wasn't all a bad thing
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:01.840]   But there's a lot of learning happening in a lot of places that are not that are not tech savvy
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:07.440]   All of our employers are pretty savvy. There are a lot of places right now sorting through a lot of questions
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.920]   No, and I don't want to down
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:12.320]   Downplay it because it is actually a big problem
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:18.160]   Zoom bombing, but I think everybody by now has learned I would reason I ask as zoom has made such a concerted effort
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:22.480]   to look like they're working hard on security. I'm not sure
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:25.440]   how much of it's
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:29.040]   Real and how much of its theater that's kind of unknown. I mean they've hired
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:33.200]   Or brought in consultant some of the biggest names in security
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:37.360]   they they hired secure code warrior to
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:41.760]   to start locking down the code they hired
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:46.320]   The former yahoo and facebook
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:54.640]   Security guru well respected alex stamos they hired katie missuras his company to find zero days
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:57.920]   I mean they've done a lot. They said we're not going to add any new features
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:59.920]   They even missed a boat on a
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:04.240]   Opportunity with facebook they were working on something with facebook and had to stop because they didn't want to work on new features
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:06.880]   They just wanted to lock it down, but I don't know
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:13.600]   I mean, it's great pr they convinced I think the world. Oh, yeah, we care about security and we're going to work on it
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:19.200]   I don't know how much of a difference it made it's not completely
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:23.360]   So much of this comes down to human error and behavior. That's right
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:28.400]   I mean if people are going to openly distribute if they want their zoom call to be open
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:33.120]   And they're going to send a URL around right people are going to join it
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:38.960]   People are going to join it and yeah, you have to understand the risks. I think they've done a pretty good job communicating about the risks
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.840]   um at a certain point
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:43.600]   people
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:47.760]   Often as we know we'll we'll sacrifice their privacy for convenience
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:52.720]   Right and I am honestly not sure that any company can do much about that. Well, my wife we use zoom
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:55.840]   We use a lot of different things zoom google meet and in deslac
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:58.000]   My wife
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:03.680]   Uh was perturbed because we were we use zoom mostly with outside clients sales calls and things like that because they understand how you use it
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:06.560]   And when zoom changed it so you had to have a password
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:10.320]   It was annoying to her. It's like well. I don't want to pass word
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:15.920]   I want everybody be. I'll take the risk. Yeah, I'll take the risk. I'll take the risk
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:17.760]   um
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.760]   and so
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:24.720]   As often as the case making something more secure sometimes makes it less convenient less fun
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:27.680]   Uh, let's take a little time out
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:31.040]   Great panel today. You guys are fantastic. We want to talk though

[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:59.440]   Let them know you saw it here on this weekend tech. We had a great week on this week. You know what I didn't see we did a um
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:06.480]   A werewolf variation called I don't know find the hacker on our twit after hours. Let's take a look
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:12.960]   We had a lot of fun this week. Here's a little entertaining video. We've made for you previously on twit
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:19.520]   Well, hello there. I am Stephanie Studebaker and I have been called in from the corporate office
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:26.240]   You see we have determined that this here company has been hacked and somebody here
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:31.760]   Was responsible for taking some very important very secret information
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:40.000]   Hands-on Mac this week. I'm going to show you the single most important thing you can do to secure your back and touch
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:46.720]   Twit news. So this is the first number of developer conferences that will be streamed Microsoft build
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:52.480]   2020 the first virtual developer conference good morning and welcome to build
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:58.080]   All about android so the one plus eight pro has a color filter camera on it, right?
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:00.480]   Um, but it was perplexing
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:09.360]   Uh because a lot of people thought it was an x-ray camera, which it is not a twit technology for your eyes and ear holes
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:13.600]   There's a perfect example of a company jumping the wrong way
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:18.320]   Then a color filter and so you could kind of see because it would filter out the color and say the
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:21.200]   Apple tv so you'd be able to see the electronics
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:24.000]   with without the color
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.880]   And they they're taking it out because people thought oh, they're gonna think it's an x-ray camera
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:33.520]   We can't let that happen so they're taking it out. That's just silly. That's just
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:36.320]   I don't believe it. Geez Louise
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:38.960]   um
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:43.040]   Speaking of failing technology students are failing ap tests
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:49.280]   Because they're using their iPhone to take pictures. Of course the iPhone uses this high efficiency image
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:51.440]   codec and
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.440]   And the AP exam apparently
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:55.840]   Can't understand it. So the
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:17:00.800]   So uh when you attempt to upload it to the testing portal at least
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:04.000]   This is the experience of a high school senior in l. s. Angeles
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:10.080]   He just completed his english literature and comp test last week. He snapped a photo of a written answer with his iPhone
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:15.680]   It broke the portal. It stopped responding his time ran out and he failed the test
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:22.240]   So my son took two ap tests in the last two weeks. Yes
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:24.320]   And I got to say
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:28.720]   Um, he read that story and was like the college board is the worst
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:35.120]   Why couldn't they figure this out? This is so dumb, but on the other hand, I have a lot of I don't know
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:38.800]   I'm not trying to call empathy, but sympathy for the college board because
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:41.520]   Gosh
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:48.320]   This scenario in which students could not take proctored exams. Well, that's hard. Yeah, a feasible one
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:55.120]   I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that the college board isn't the isn't hiring like
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:59.120]   world-class engineers. They probably can't
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:01.840]   pay a world-class salary
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:05.840]   And all of a sudden they have a month and a half to completely
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:11.040]   Refactor the way that they test basically every college bound student in the country
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:15.520]   And they have to account for hand written tests, right?
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:18.800]   That's I mean, that's crazy
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:22.720]   Anyway, it is the case that the college board tweeted
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:26.560]   The recommendation that you change the settings on your camera
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:29.440]   From hike to jpeg
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:35.280]   How could they have missed that tweet? No, I yeah, you're right. I'm totally I don't want to bash on the college board
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:37.280]   It's you know, we're all struggling
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:40.880]   It's and and have been for long before yes
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:46.800]   This pandemic not the most sophisticated tarry strange situation for a lot of people. Yeah
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:48.720]   Yeah
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:49.600]   uh
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:53.440]   One senior who uh was quoted by the verge he has to remain anonymous
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:57.920]   Said that the college board tweet went out a few minutes before his physics test began
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:02.880]   He says no one taking the ap physics test would have been able to see it because we were already logged in
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:05.520]   So thanks for the tweet
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:07.200]   But
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:13.920]   Anyway, I feel bad. I feel bad in general for college high school seniors and college seniors. This has been a rotten
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:19.280]   Graduation at rotten 2020 although I have to say I'm very well my heart is warmed
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:26.960]   I don't know how uh lindsey your your senior feels, but my heart is worn by all the signs everywhere congratulating 2020 graduates
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:32.880]   I think people feel bad for them. They don't get to walk. It's stinks. He's a junior. Oh, he said you got one more year
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:37.200]   We'll see yeah, we'll see what the world is like no by then
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:39.920]   Oh, no, it'll be fine a year from now
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:46.160]   But I will say that the remote learning like the inequities that have come out of remote learning are are huge
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:50.800]   So a lot of private schools have been able to weather this pretty easily and a lot of public schools
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:55.600]   My mom the other day was like why aren't they why aren't they absolutely required?
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:59.440]   To be sitting in an online class, you know three days a week
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:04.080]   For instance, and and I had to explain that well in a large urban district
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:08.160]   There are a lot of kids who still don't have access to a computer
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:15.360]   I think busd has handed out many hundreds of hot spots just to give some kids internet access so that they could learn
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:19.200]   So big public school districts have been completely unable to make
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:23.920]   Remote classes required and as a result the teaching is just
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:28.800]   It's a shadow of what it used to be not and not because these teachers aren't dedicated
[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:30.960]   But because they literally cannot reach their students
[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:34.560]   Do you feel like you're the students you haven't living with you are
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:38.080]   Basically losing a year or a semester
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:41.200]   Absolutely. Yeah
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:44.480]   Yeah, and it's not it is by no fault of the district. I mean no
[01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:47.520]   Not that I mean, I'm sure
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:54.560]   But your kids are in a highly technical highly wired house. They've got all the tools they need. Imagine the kids who aren't
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:59.920]   Absolutely. I mean my kids have a fiber connection and so that they can they can upload anything that they need to
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:01.760]   Yeah
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:08.320]   But you know, I will say that that it's been interesting to watch the the the reaction overall even with very technically savvy
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:10.800]   Families to this kind of remote learning
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:16.960]   The feedback that I've gotten from my friends and for my kids is that it's sometimes it is just extremely hard to motivate
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:23.360]   Yeah, when every day looks the same and when you're not there your peers and if you're really into like ap us history
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:29.280]   Right, but what you're into is the conversation about us history in the classroom. Yep, and that's gone. Yep
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:32.960]   They're just staring out the window. Yeah, I can I
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:38.240]   Feed back on symphatee. Yeah, Lisa. How's your daughter doing?
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:42.880]   So
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:46.880]   A lot of the issues that Lindsay mentioned we've had in alameda as well
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:52.480]   I know for our school personally we didn't start online instruction for two weeks because our elementary school
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:58.880]   Wanted to wait until every student in the school had both a crumbook and
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:03.680]   regular regular guaranteed internet access so they did regular technology surveys
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:09.520]   for drop-offs and pickups arranged for internet access and then we were able to start
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:12.880]   so
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:18.720]   We we started off with the awareness that not every kid was going to have an equal situation going into this to begin with
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:23.040]   My daughter is nine and what has been
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:27.440]   the predominant theme that runs through this
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:31.120]   Is she really misses working with her peers?
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:34.960]   There's a lot of collaborative learning that goes on at that age
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:38.160]   And for all that they have little breakout groups in zoom
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:45.120]   That's not the same thing as being able to like bend over a paper with two or three other kids and puzzle things out back and forth
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:46.720]   and
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:50.720]   They try really hard over zoom and the teachers do a lot of small group work too
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:54.480]   I mean that the teachers have really done their best to rise the challenge, but
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:23:00.880]   It's it's it's a struggle to remain engaged because you're either spending a lot of time staring at a screen
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:06.960]   Or you're trying to work through a math game or you're trying to work through a typing test or something like that
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:08.320]   and
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:11.520]   It is very different from a live living breathing type
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:14.400]   School situation where you can maybe take a break
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:20.320]   Or you can have a friend that can troubleshoot with you if the teacher is busy or the teacher can come over the teachers aid can come over
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:23.120]   It's
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:25.120]   It's been a mixed bag. Yeah, I'm
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:27.360]   Any structure
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:32.160]   Any kid with any sort of disability so imagine a kid who's somewhere on the autism spectrum
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:34.240]   Who's not going to do well with video chat?
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:40.320]   Who really you know probably relies on in-person cues because cues are so hard to read in the first place
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:42.880]   um any
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:47.360]   Autistic kids in general are really struggling and I've heard that from people in the district. It's it's
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:52.000]   It's been very hard to plan for special education for anybody who needs it
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.680]   um
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:24:00.880]   You know technology only gets us so far and and and then we rely on each other and when that last part is gone
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:02.880]   I think it's been very very difficult
[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:09.280]   And of course there's I feel really lucky. I have a nine-year-old so she's able to do a lot of things by herself
[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:15.680]   I have friends who have much younger kids and asking a group of kindergartners to focus on zoom for 20 minutes is
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:20.640]   Is just a monumental task and how are you
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:25.040]   So much of kindergarten for a school is just learning how to be in school
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:31.520]   And now these kids don't even have that. There's the only good news is everybody's doing that everybody's gone through this. Yeah
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:37.360]   There's going to be just a generation and it's not just the us worldwide
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:43.520]   That just while we miss it a little bit of school school when I was a kid and everybody will
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:44.720]   um
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:49.520]   What I worry more maybe a little bit about is the future of higher education
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:52.640]   A lot of universities are facing now
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:58.240]   Crisis and it's not I mean look it's across the board hurts just declared bankruptcy
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:02.400]   And of course that's going to trickle down because car manufacturers depend on fleet sales
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:04.480]   to big companies like hurts
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:09.920]   And so they're going to be in trouble and they can on and on and on but but but higher education
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:12.720]   A lot of universities just aren't in a great position to survive
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:17.440]   Another six months of this and if you're spending if if you're
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:24.720]   I mean imagine a heart you're a harvard student you're spending a ton of money to go to harvard and all you're doing is taking courses at home
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:28.000]   I might take that year off
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:34.240]   Yeah, well we're you know as the parent of a junior who's kind of sketching on his future
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:41.680]   It's hard to know even what to you know the the fall matriculation a year from this fall will look like
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:43.280]   Whether
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:46.960]   All of the I mean if I were going to be starting college this coming fall
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:51.120]   I would probably take a year off. What's the impact that has a year from now? Right
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:52.640]   Yes
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:54.640]   If there's a school left
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:58.080]   I mean harvard's got a huge endowment they're going to be left but they're
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:02.240]   Are a ton of scott galway was on uh CNN last night saying it's
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:05.520]   We're going to see universities disappear. He's a professor at NYU
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:07.120]   We're gonna see a lot of yeah
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:12.320]   I'd rather he had a piece in New York magazine last week where he was he was saying that and explain the rational about it
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:15.920]   No, one of my nephews is a senior he got accepted to a uc
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:21.840]   And the discussion that he's having with his family, which is ongoing right now gap year gap year
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:25.040]   Well, the question is is it worth him?
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:33.280]   Enrolling and starting as a uc freshman if his experiences. Oh, welcome. You see freshman enjoy your bedroom in the house. That's not a good idea
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:35.360]   That's not a good
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:39.520]   Honestly, if you take a gap year, you're not going to be doing the grand tour you're going to still be in your bedroom
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:41.040]   so
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:45.920]   I don't know what it's going to look like or does he or does he defer and go to community college for a couple of years and gets
[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:51.040]   Basics taking care of and then try to transfer back into the school and these are decisions that he had no idea
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:53.120]   He was going to have to make this year, right?
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:58.160]   Right. He was he was like all I had to do was try and get into college. I got into college. You know what's doing well?
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:01.440]   Minecraft
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:06.640]   Minecraft play spikes. This is a scene head story tops
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:13.760]   126 million builders a month already the best-selling PC game of all time
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:18.560]   Uh, I think what did Microsoft say they crossed 200 million copies
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:26.800]   Sold now 126 million people playing every month talk about a smart move on Microsoft's part
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:30.320]   And by the way, what a good steward they have been
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:34.800]   Uh, it's not unusual to see big companies buy properties and let them fall
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:38.160]   Microsoft kind of destroyed no kia, but
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:44.720]   In this case, they've made Minecraft better and better and better. They've put a lot of effort into making a fantastic
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:47.680]   Product that I think there's a whole generation that loves
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:50.080]   Minecraft
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:57.200]   And they're about to launch my Minecraft dungeons. Yeah, I've been actually playing. Oh, have you tell me about it because I'm dying to play it
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:04.080]   It's good. So like if you're like me and you appreciate Minecraft, but you kind of don't get it
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:08.240]   Minecraft dungeons is way more approachable. It's a straight up
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:11.120]   Uh, you know top down kind of
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:15.760]   Or the college dungeon type a dungeon crawl right your dungeon crawler, right? Yeah, yeah
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:20.080]   And it's just a it's a classic kind of video game, but the special the graphics on it
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:23.120]   The effects have been really good. The playability is really nice
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:29.600]   It's it's charming. You're still in that Minecraft world with all those characters, but there's kind of like a plot now
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:35.200]   They're already planning to expansion packs. This isn't like a one-off game. They're looking at this as sort of like
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:37.440]   Minecraft which has always been
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:41.200]   They keep building on it right they're getting rtx support they're building out
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:46.080]   There's the Minecraft education component. Well, they're kind of doing that with dungeons as well
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:52.320]   There's a lot of plans behind this property and then compared to the other Minecraft the virtual reality one
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:59.200]   Uh, this one is way more fun and accessible. So I'm actually pretty excited about it comes out in what two two days
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:02.880]   Day after tomorrow. Yeah, and you feel like it's pretty playable. It's ready to go
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:08.080]   Oh, it's a lot of fun. It's yeah, it's really enjoyable. I think anyone can hop into playing it
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:11.600]   There's no building. So there's just game playing
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:16.720]   We have I so I have uh, we have a 17 year old at home who's played Minecraft
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:21.120]   Since he was eight probably I don't know for as long as it's been around
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:25.280]   We have i'm running right over here five different minecrafts instances
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:30.880]   Well, I once my own personal one because I you know, I don't like kids messing with my stuff, but
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:35.520]   But they have they have several and it's really fun
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:42.400]   And they're totally into it yet last week. I was showing a christina. I'm sorry briano who was a game developer
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:49.680]   Uh, I was showing her what they built which was mind boggling. She said those are actually the exact skills
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:54.560]   They need to be level designer professional level designers in gaming. I haven't told michael this
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:56.560]   I may never tell him this but
[01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:03.440]   Those she said you if you what you're doing in minecraft is harder than it would be doing it an unreal engine
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:09.760]   You could get a job doing that stuff. So there's gonna be a whole generation of kids who are really good at minecraft. I guess
[01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:13.920]   Leo do you find that you're do the kids you know play?
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:16.960]   Minecraft with
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:22.080]   Different groups of people what I find is it. Well, like gosh. I'm not lady. He's just talking about our son all the time. Sorry
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:25.440]   No, it's so it is totally social. It's social
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:31.360]   But what he has he has his gamer friends and they play hard for pc games together and then they're on discord
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:38.320]   And then he has his casual friends who are his like they're also very good friends, but they're more of his already friends. There's like
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:44.960]   History class friends and they get on house party and play minecraft. Oh, how interesting
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:47.440]   Oh
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:52.400]   Games for different scenes. Yeah, yeah, he does that it's different. It's absolutely the case
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:58.080]   There's some kids who want to play mortal combat 11. There are some kids who want to just build stuff
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:02.160]   There's absolutely room for both and yes, it's different groups
[01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:11.120]   It's very yeah, it's very interesting and of course then there's the then there's the competitive gamers the e-sports kids and it's it's uh
[01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:14.400]   I was gonna say with with minecraft because it is different like that
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:18.320]   We used to have a show years ago that I had started with some of our writers
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:22.240]   And the idea was what's nice about minecraft one? It's very approachable
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:27.040]   Anybody can pick it up whether eight years old or 60 years old anyone can jump into it
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:28.720]   but also is
[01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:33.840]   Casual like you can sit there and have conversations with video people while you're walking around and building stuff
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:40.160]   Versus a first-person call of duty type game where it's gonna be all action. No one's gonna be like so did you hear about school today?
[01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:43.200]   Like there's not gonna be that kind of level of engagement
[01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:47.280]   But what's really cool is I almost feel feel like that level in minecraft
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:53.040]   Is sort of this idea of like where we're going today, right? We're just talking about with work from home inside of
[01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:57.600]   People and kids being already used to have any sort of virtual relationships
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:04.000]   And you can do that with different levels of gaming and minecraft is I would say high level because you can sit there really get into
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:09.920]   Conversations with people and it's already kind of training kids for that new world which we're in right now
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:12.560]   We we used to have a minecraft show
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:14.000]   um
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.600]   omgcraft
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:20.320]   Chad johnson hosted it. They built a whole beautiful uh twit city
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:29.120]   This is a video that he made uh in 2013 when he was still at twit seven million views since then
[01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:33.120]   And i'm very happy for Chad. He does it on his own now. He said I
[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:35.840]   At one point he said i'd like to do this
[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:39.120]   Myself, I think I can make some money at this and we said all right
[01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:45.520]   And he is now at one million subscribers on gcraft so we're very proud of Chad johnson. Oh, we still love
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:48.240]   one million subscribers
[01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:50.800]   uh, and I feel a little bit of
[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:55.120]   proprietary uh joy for him because we did start that show way back
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:33:00.640]   When in the twit cottage and I have a feeling that one of the reasons he's done so well is he hung in there
[01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:04.880]   But also minecraft is just taken off minecraft is huge
[01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:07.840]   So congratulations, Chad used to produce this show
[01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:10.560]   Was my one of my producers
[01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:12.960]   speaking of success joe rogan
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:18.720]   Going to spotify the most successful podcaster of all time
[01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:21.680]   according to joe rogan
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:27.360]   Well, and I believe him he says he has 190 million downloads a month that I find a little
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:34.640]   Mind-boggling. I know I have no reason to doubt it, but it seems like I mean that's almost he's been doing it for so long
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:37.840]   Right. I mean how many of those i've been doing it longer than him. That doesn't mean
[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:42.400]   I got 190 a month. I don't think longevity is the only reason
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:45.680]   He's not the downloads, but who's who's audited?
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:52.720]   There's nobody there's no there's no rating system, but I look it's pretty clear joe is the number one podcast in the world
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:55.760]   And he he I'll tell you who's given him
[01:33:55.760 --> 01:34:00.080]   Some validity uh spotify just took him over
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:06.320]   Uh, he's gonna they're gonna make the joe rogan podcast and exclusive on spotify wall street journal estimates
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:09.840]   That's a deal worth more than 100 million
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:15.200]   Dollars he is on youtube, but there will no longer be joe rogan shows on youtube just excerpts
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:20.480]   Um all of his shows going back 11 years will be on spotify starting september 1st
[01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:22.560]   And at some point before the end of the year
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:26.480]   And this is the thing that worries me it will be exclusive to spotify spotify spent
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:31.040]   They said they were daniel x their ceo said they were spending a half billion dollars
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:36.720]   To acquire podcast networks and they bought gimlet they bought podcast
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:40.000]   They bought anchor fm. They bought the ringer
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:45.200]   And they are trying to build an exclusive podcast empire and exclusive is an important word because
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:50.560]   That makes them more valuable to advertisers because if you have to listen on the spotify app
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:54.960]   Then advertisers will know exactly who listened when for how long
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:57.840]   There won't be any and there's not any good way as you
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:01.600]   I wish you hadn't said it, but there's not a good way lisa as you pointed out
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:07.040]   To measure that we don't know, you know, we can we can count downloads from our server
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:10.960]   But that's about all we can do rss podcast might suffer a little bit
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:15.040]   With if spotify succeeds apple apparently
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:20.720]   Does not want to let uh spotify succeed they're beefing up their podcast operation in effect
[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:23.280]   They apparently are looking for people to
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:26.400]   To hire
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:27.920]   To run
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:33.200]   I don't know if they'll be exclusive but uh to run podcasts at apple
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:35.920]   So i'm glad i'm in a in a growing industry
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:38.160]   I
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:40.560]   I mean if it's goes the way of of all
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:44.720]   Video media
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:46.720]   It will be exclusive
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:53.200]   I mean the the path to profitability is probably exclusivity for all the reasons you mentioned but also
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:36:00.800]   Um because that's how you guarantee listeners. I mean if I were a big joke rogan fan, which i'm not but I I am one of the yes
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:05.600]   And one of the apple music people like I never got in deep with spotify
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:09.520]   But if I were a big fan, I might be like, okay. Well time to jump ship
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:12.000]   I'm going to move over to spotify and if enough people do that
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:18.800]   It'll be effective. It's very interesting. I have to say it's going to be uh changing um
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:24.560]   It's become big. It's become more mainstream hasn't it? It's no longer a hobbyist medium
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:28.960]   It's no different than like even with youtube years ago people
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:34.000]   Basically creating shows off of youtube and then big media companies coming in and buying those
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.920]   But you're seeing this
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:39.920]   You know, I think well a lot of the way that didn't work so well did it daniel
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:43.840]   No, it didn't now now with those youtube shows and you know there's been
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:47.680]   Hits and misses there and it'll be interesting to see what happens with podcasts
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:54.400]   I know the thing about podcasts that really drives people nuts is there's a very very diy element to it
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:58.480]   Both in creating the actual show anyone can do it
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:00.560]   You know and then build up
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:07.040]   But there's also diy aspect in terms of listening to it because you can get any sort of podcast app
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:14.000]   Subscribe to drs feed and download it and control it and there's been a whole sub market of those kind of apps and now with
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:19.440]   You know it going to spotify and you know a lot of other podcasts going to spotify and
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:22.720]   I guarantee you apple and everybody else will start doing this as well
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:26.560]   That whole industry is going to die and people are going to lose the control
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:28.560]   They're going to go to these specific apps
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:31.840]   No different than what we're seeing with video on demand in terms of
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:37.040]   Amazon and that's not a nightmare though. You don't know where this show you want to watch lives. It's frustrating
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:39.520]   Right and so this is going to be the same thing
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:41.520]   It's going to happen
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:44.080]   I'm sorry
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:48.160]   I don't know what's going on with your audio you're coming and going so say that again. No, no
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:52.720]   Say think about the directory opportunities because I don't know about anyone else
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:56.560]   But when someone recommends a movie at this point one of the first things I do is is
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:38:00.560]   Go to is it a website called is it streaming to find out?
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:03.120]   Is it on any one of those?
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:04.800]   Yeah
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:06.800]   And that's kind of really in a way
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:12.800]   I don't want podcasting to be oh, I have to figure out where to get my podcast off to go to
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:14.640]   Can I hear it
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:19.280]   Dot com to find out where we can hear the podcast that's to me that's disappointing
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:25.600]   It's it's although I guess it's analogous to what happened to blogging or is it? I mean, maybe not because
[01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:34.960]   Remember you've always had effort for walled guard the walled garden model remember that this has been something that sort of happens every few years
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:37.200]   when there is um
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:43.360]   A new media genre that's attracting sufficient engagement and or ad dollars
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:45.680]   It's gonna get
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:49.280]   There's usually a land rush on afterwards to try to create networks
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:58.240]   Or try to create the walled garden or to try to create an exclusive channel and monetize under the premise that people will be willing to pay for it
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:00.800]   and but
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:02.640]   On the
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:04.640]   I think what i'm getting at is
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:06.640]   will it be
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:12.400]   Not great if you're a joe rogan park fan and you cannot or will not subscribe to spotify for whatever reason
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:16.320]   You're gonna miss out on back shows and archives and this thing evil that you've loved
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:20.560]   Yes, it's gonna be bad in the short term, but there are other podcasts
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:26.400]   This is an extraordinarily popular podcast, but podcasting doesn't start and end with this guy
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:31.200]   Well, and howard stern howard stern left radio to go to serious
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:38.480]   They paid him half a billion dollars over a period of years. He made a lot of money very good for howard stern didn't kill radios
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:41.600]   Yeah, other thing i'm killing you
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:42.880]   Yeah
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:45.840]   So i've thank god we have a content strategist here
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:48.400]   so
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:53.920]   And by the way, seen it does a ton of podcast cbs interactive does a ton of podcast cbs radio does a ton of the
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:56.320]   I imagine some of the contest
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:40:00.400]   Content strategy and stuff that you're doing
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:08.480]   The strategizing has to do with uh that have you talked a little bit about that in the future of rss versus exclusive
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:17.040]   We uh, we published two new podcasts last week the group that I work in did one is one is uh about wrestling
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:20.480]   Yeah
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:25.120]   And one is uh called the cheapskate which is about getting really good deals. It's rick brita's podcast
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:28.960]   He's been writing that column for cnet for i believe 15 years
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:33.760]   And now he's doing it as a podcast. It's actually it's it's really good. You guys should listen, but
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:38.400]   Um, we haven't we haven't obviously pursued any sort of exclusivity
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:43.920]   One of the things that's charming about podcast right now and I am frankly surprised it took this long
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:46.800]   For this joe rug and style
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:52.560]   Turf war to happen
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:58.320]   Because it has been such a joy to say get our podcast on your podcast. I agree
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:01.280]   And I don't
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:05.920]   I am shocked that it took this long for this to happen. I don't think that um, I think that it will work
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:10.320]   I think that you know, we all know that it's a truism that content is king
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:16.880]   And if you have content that you can't get somewhere else you'll go to that place and that and that's why the streaming landscape is so confusing right now
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:24.640]   Um, and and all of the networks have proven that if you have a piece of content that has a huge fan base
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:26.960]   They will sign up for one more account to get it
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:29.120]   um
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:33.360]   So we haven't gone there yet with the podcast that we're producing in the in the group that I manage but
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:39.520]   But but I wouldn't be surprised if the industry moves there. Yeah, and not slowly to be clear
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:44.880]   I mean our podcasts are on Spotify. We we actually were a launch partner when Spotify started doing podcasts
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:47.920]   We were very glad to be on the stage there with daniel eck
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:50.800]   But I would never go exclusive to any platform
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:55.120]   I wouldn't want to go exclusive to any platform because kind of my ethos is well
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:58.720]   It should be wherever anybody goes. We should be there. That's good for us
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:03.440]   Not for a hundred million dollars. Well, I know I'm no let me be clear
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:05.440]   I
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:08.400]   Don't be sure I'm on a lot of things for a hundred million dollars
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:11.600]   I mean, what we're gonna say that he said in the past
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:16.800]   He would never do that for Spotify because the numbers were too low. Oh interesting. I didn't know that. Oh, that's interesting. Yeah, and
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:21.200]   Okay, you know, he actually has like kind of lambasted them in the past about how they treated artists
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:27.600]   Something changed and probably that a hundred million changes. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's pretty
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:31.120]   Everybody's got a price. It's pretty hard to say no to a hundred million dollars
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:34.480]   I don't fault joe. I know at absolutely zero
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:37.680]   faulting of joe
[01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:40.800]   I'm just I'm I'm hoping that spotify strategy
[01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:43.600]   Does not hurt?
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:47.040]   Traditional rss podcasting because I think there's a lot to be said for
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:52.080]   This and it's somewhat freewheeling you could start a wrestling podcast. You could start a cheap skate show
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:57.840]   Uh, that's the beauty of it. Um, you know, anybody could start a show and it can do well
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:01.040]   Because you don't have to make a deal with a content
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:06.880]   Gatekeeper, you can just put it out there and I want to I want to see it that way. It's kind of like blogging
[01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:09.520]   To and I want to see it stay
[01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:16.480]   Uh, we're in a big challenge with podcast and it's both leveling and um and frustrating
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:18.800]   And and I'm sure you know this is that
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:23.920]   If you are just a person who and this happened with blogging to if you're a person who just puts it out there and your diy
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:28.800]   Content and it's good. It is so hard now to be discovered
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:31.840]   Yes, no, it was five years ago
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:38.080]   Huge in the podcast world. It's a huge problem now and I think the one benefit that could come from more structure
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:42.400]   In the podcast world is discoverability. I mean, you know, the apple has
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:46.720]   Squatted this a little bit, but they but they do spend some time curating
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:51.280]   Podcasts for for the public that is a little bit of a service
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:53.760]   I am surprised that there aren't more
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:59.920]   Services out there further curating the podcast world but but we're missing that guidance and I think
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:04.480]   Hopefully it'll come from from what's happening now in one way or another there is something
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:05.600]   I mean, it's the same thing
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:09.520]   Content needs to be to be just developed and explored by a degree
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:13.360]   But the same situation on youtube there's a million shows on youtube
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:16.880]   It's hard to figure out what to watch but somehow the cream rises
[01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:20.880]   I mean some of it is that you know like Chad Johnson he spent years
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:25.120]   Working really hard producing a ton of great content
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:30.400]   And I'm sure it was frustrating and and the beginning and and challenging in the beginning
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:34.800]   But eventually he built a big audience and now I'm sure he's doing fine
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:40.880]   So starting to see this also play out with e-sports, you know with twitch and mixer and youtube
[01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:47.440]   All paying large sums of money to game streamers to try to lock in that audience. Yeah, you got so
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:51.120]   You know we're seeing this beauty pie just didn't puty pie just
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:54.800]   YouTube yeah, he said, okay, I'll stay at youtube
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:57.040]   I think the threat was he was going to go somewhere else
[01:44:57.040 --> 01:45:00.720]   You I we don't know what the dollar amount was but it's got to have been huge
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:03.440]   Because he's their number one
[01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:04.960]   pot
[01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:06.960]   content guy
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:10.960]   It's I mean just you know, it's what it's maturity. It's what happens with maturity in any industry
[01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:13.520]   The money gets in
[01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:17.120]   But I just I love I missed I'm kind of an old hippie
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:21.520]   I just like the idea that anybody can do a blog anybody can do a podcast
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:26.960]   You know that was what the internet changed was you didn't have gatekeepers anymore. You didn't have to
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:32.160]   You know talk a publisher into publishing your book. You could just self publish it
[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:35.840]   You didn't have to talk a record company into producing your record
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:38.560]   You could just put it out and you could succeed
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:45.120]   Maybe not make a platinum. I mean, it's just a question of whether you're an audience right?
[01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:49.840]   Yeah, I think that the downside the flip side of what you're describing Leo is that
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:55.760]   So now that you can self publish say a novel let's talk about the the book industry for a minute
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:58.400]   You can self publish a novel
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:02.000]   You probably won't get attention unless you know somebody who knows somebody
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:05.600]   Or unless there's something so astounding about it that it gets kind of picked up
[01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:06.960]   Um
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:11.200]   It used to be that you could talk a publisher into publishing your novel if it was good
[01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:16.240]   And you could and you could go through the traditional routes through an agent find an agent find a publisher
[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:21.200]   Now it's almost even harder because publishers have been stretched so thin
[01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:24.320]   Right that they go to just where the money is
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:29.760]   They're less likely because they have so much data at their hands to take a risk on somebody who's unknown
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:36.560]   And it's almost like this flattening had this really good effect for access in the beginning and now
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:39.440]   People are finding themselves wishing
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:47.360]   Right that having an agent and going the traditional route to a publisher where the guarantee of financial success because it is no longer
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:50.080]   Um, so it's a little bit of a
[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:55.520]   A deviled sword. Yeah, and users want curation. They want some direction. They want some help finding
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:58.080]   Good stuff. Do you think it's foolish to say?
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:00.480]   Am I just a pie-eyed optimist to say that the
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:04.480]   The if it's good enough, it'll it'll make it it'll rise to the top
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:08.000]   Is that not the case? Are there are there great records?
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:10.400]   great musicians great podcasts
[01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:15.920]   Great novels out there that just oh yes, there's just yes
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:17.840]   Yes
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:23.920]   There's a ton out there that's undiscovered and it probably always has been I mean that's always been true because we live in a big world
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:26.640]   It's less true now. Isn't it? It's less true now
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:33.680]   If you for instance, maybe but I think artists are having a hard time getting things like record contracts because the money from a record contract
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:35.520]   only comes from like
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:41.680]   A huge huge hit and otherwise it just comes from merchandise. Right. So it gets really it's harder to get over that hump
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:47.360]   It always I would go in the subway in New York and I would hear the best virtuoso
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:50.240]   musician down there in the subway and I would think
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:56.480]   There must be a million people like this guy or gal and they don't have a record contract
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:01.920]   Uh, the difference is you don't you no longer have to have a record contract
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:06.880]   To be heard and if you are a virtuoso, you don't have to play in this subway
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:10.400]   You can put it on youtube or you can even put it on spotify
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:18.560]   You can even put it on apple music and perhaps if you're that good generate an audience that to me is still better than the old system
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:24.400]   I think it is but I think that we're also suffering a little bit from the tyranny of the algorithm
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:32.560]   Well, that's for sure. Thank you. So you know, well, especially in the youtube world. Yeah, there are some content creators
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:38.640]   Who are creating really interesting good stuff and it's sort of this self-fulfilling prophecy that if it doesn't take off
[01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:40.880]   It doesn't get seen right
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:47.200]   And so that's that's the challenge there and and as lisa you're right because there's an opportunity there both of you are right
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:52.960]   There's an opportunity there to somehow help the cream rise. I don't know if spotifies the right answer
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:54.960]   But there's got to be that's the problem
[01:48:54.960 --> 01:49:00.320]   There's always going to be a market for curation because people will not want to
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:06.560]   Or even they will want to or they won't have the time to or they'll get up in their head about an inability to
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:09.040]   curate for themselves and so
[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:14.320]   You still have a lot of blogs that are very popular because they promise to sift your products and find the best ones for you
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:18.000]   We still have an entertainment media vertical that
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:21.520]   reviews things and tells you what to watch because so
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:25.920]   Curations of valuable content niche that could probably stand
[01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:31.600]   To expand with the flutter content that comes out and then there's also going to be discoverability tools
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:38.800]   And audience development is another thing too because you know you've talked about how oh, there's these great musicians you heard on subways
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:44.560]   They're playing on subways and the odds that somebody's going to leap off of off of the a train and scream
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:47.760]   I must take you down to the lake center. That was the dream
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:52.400]   Yeah, but there's vanishingly small that's not yeah, how you
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:59.120]   Develop that's not how you would develop your constituency and how you would but I don't think that's why they're playing this subway
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:02.080]   They're playing the subway for tips. That's how they're making
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:04.080]   I think you're right both
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:07.360]   It's like sitting in
[01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:08.880]   Yeah
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:10.880]   none of artists
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:20.080]   None of artists have had to have training or a background in audience development like most of them focus understandably so i'm being artists
[01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:24.640]   But if you're in a world where there's just this huge sloshing sea of content and there are algorithms
[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:29.680]   That are self-reinforcing towards certain content trends and you're not already locked into that system
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:35.520]   You're now in a position. We're not only are you a producer and a creator you have to try to figure out how you're going to also
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:38.800]   Who are you targeting? How are you targeting them? What are you always in reaching out?
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:42.240]   And those aren't always complementary skill sets that people have
[01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:48.880]   Let me talk about our sponsor last pass last pass sponsored our studio. We love last pass
[01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:57.440]   I hope you saw our event where we talked about the future of digital identity with a great panel including log me and see so jerry book
[01:50:57.440 --> 01:51:03.920]   Health and steve gibson from the security now show and andrew keen we've got another last pass event coming up this fall
[01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:06.080]   Stay tuned. We'll talk about that last pass
[01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:13.920]   Is a very good partner to have today as we have more and more employees working from home
[01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:19.840]   It's really been a a lifesaver for us. You you've got a plan for the unexpected and the beauty of last pass
[01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:24.640]   I'm very I feel very fortunate that we moved to last pass a few years ago last pass enterprise
[01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:28.800]   I've always used it at home. It's it's you know initially it was a password manager
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:33.680]   But now it's much more now it really is about making sure that the right people are using
[01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:39.600]   The resources that they're entitled to keeping control of those things and when you have employees going home
[01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:44.800]   Employees who have access to our bank accounts to our databases to our servers
[01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:52.640]   It's important that we secure all of that last pass can be deployed quickly in the midst of any event to ensure that your business
[01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:57.760]   Continues to run smoothly that every employee that login is secure
[01:51:57.760 --> 01:52:03.280]   They do in a lot of ways now much more than just password management single single sign on as a big one
[01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:07.840]   I love this about 1200 plus single sign on apps that work with last pass
[01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:13.040]   I like it because it's more secure and employees like it because it's easier to use
[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:20.960]   And it continues to have control and and and insight access to who's accessing what from where and that's really important
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:27.360]   Of course they have the best password management. They always have and you get complete oversight of shadow it enforceable
[01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:34.160]   Policies across all password protected accounts. They've also added some interesting multi-factor authentication
[01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:39.280]   So of course you've got biometric authentication on most phones now, but in addition to that
[01:52:39.280 --> 01:52:43.600]   You've got contextual factors like geolocation
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:46.240]   IP address that help you
[01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:50.960]   Make sure the right people are using the right tools if you're using a vpn for instance, of course the vpn is a login
[01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:52.960]   Your employees are using that login
[01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:57.120]   But you can also use last pass to add multi factors of that login making sure
[01:52:57.120 --> 01:53:00.480]   That you've got the right people accessing your network
[01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:05.280]   And some of the things last pass does is so smart don't they never send or store the master password
[01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:10.000]   That means last pass can't access your data and if they can't neither can hackers
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:14.240]   Encryption happens exclusively at the device level before you sync to last pass
[01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:19.040]   Only users can decrypt their data only at the device level and by the way every device
[01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:28.400]   Windows Mac Linux Android iOS I use last pass everywhere password sharing can be done securely and easily even if employees are at home
[01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:35.600]   I just I can't recommend last pass more highly. It is the way to secure your business
[01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:40.400]   I'm so glad we're using it, especially now that many of our most of our employees are working from home
[01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:47.840]   You should be using it too last pass can make remote work simple and secure last pass dot com slash to it find out how they can help your business
[01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:53.200]   Stay productive last pass dot com slash to a great partner
[01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:55.360]   in this
[01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:57.360]   special time
[01:53:58.240 --> 01:54:02.240]   Special time and we're coming you know the other thing that's booming
[01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:05.120]   Thanks to quarantine is streaming tv
[01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:08.960]   Uh, this was it next week hbo max is coming
[01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:17.680]   Even apple is starting to beef up its lineup on apple tv plus by bo buying older tv shows it turns out catalog is pretty important
[01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:22.880]   Uh on streaming networks and apple just spent 70
[01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:31.040]   Million dollars to get the new tom hanks movie which was supposed to appear in theaters about now
[01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:35.600]   and uh can't obviously normally what the what
[01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:39.200]   producers have been doing is
[01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:44.640]   Putting them on for 20 dollar rentals. I watched a number of movies that were supposed to come out which swatched emma
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:46.320]   Um
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:51.840]   The hunt that was wild paid 20 dollar rental but that we would have paid that much to go see it in the theater
[01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:54.480]   So that was okay
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:56.000]   um
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.560]   This is though interesting this movie grayhound
[01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:01.520]   Which is all done
[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:05.440]   Well premiere on exclusively on apple tv plus
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:10.000]   And the bidding war for this sony pictures movie which was
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:13.040]   supposed to come out father's day
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:17.280]   Really heated up apple ended up paying according to deadline 70
[01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:20.240]   million dollars
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:23.440]   For this movie which was written and produced by tom hanks
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:26.400]   Wow
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:32.240]   I think it's a pre is a prestige play as much as a they're not going to make the money back with subscriptions
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:34.400]   I mean
[01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:39.920]   That gets to that problem right of trying to like how you're going to watch this like I actually have apple tv
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:44.000]   Is that that free subscription? Yeah, I got with my eye buy an apple device. Yeah
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:49.360]   But I don't have any way to watch it on my tv as far as I know I don't I don't have the actual
[01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:56.320]   So I've never seen any content so now I need to go buy another black box connect with my tv to watch this
[01:55:56.320 --> 01:56:01.360]   It's just like do you have a roku because you can they have an apple tv? I don't do you have a
[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:04.800]   Do you have anything connected to your tv? I have an xbox
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:08.320]   Uh, I don't think there's an apple tv app now there is no
[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:12.320]   This is this is a like a continuation of what we were talking about
[01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:14.880]   You know you
[01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:22.320]   Is this the joe rogan of apple tv and the answer is probably not because apple has made the bar really high like it involves hardware
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:26.240]   Yeah, and once you start to involve hardware, that's a good point
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:34.160]   Then it's a whole it's a different conversation and this is why I subscribe to every streaming service except that one. Oh interesting
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:41.120]   Do you think disney disney plus has done very well, which is good because there's other disney properties not doing quite so well
[01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:44.480]   Yeah disney plus did a lot of good deals with carriers
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:51.680]   So a lot of people, you know, that's right. I'm getting mine from verizon. That's right. I'm yeah and hulu and espian too
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:55.760]   You get discounts and disney plus bundle is really compelling
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:56:58.080]   Yeah, and they put it everywhere
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:01.040]   I can actually watch that on my xbox because they've released an app
[01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:03.680]   If apple wants to release an app on xbox
[01:57:03.680 --> 01:57:10.480]   There's probably a good chance at some point I would especially because I have technically a free subscription i'd actually watch the content
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:15.120]   Um, so that's where some companies, you know disney did a very good job
[01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:17.360]   They on day one it was available everywhere
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:20.160]   And that's where but apple is gets into this
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:26.080]   You know, they they it's cracking a little bit right they are putting their app on other things now including some tv
[01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:28.880]   So it's a start, but they really need to be everywhere
[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:34.720]   I am excited about hbo max which comes out in a couple of days
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:37.920]   And this is gonna be on youtube tv
[01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:40.880]   I don't know. Well, that's a good question
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:43.920]   They're supposed to have made a deal with hbo
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:50.640]   But i've been waiting for hbo to come to you can buy hbo is an extra can you on youtube tv? No
[01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:53.680]   No, you can do it on amazon prime
[01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:57.760]   Right and hulu and hulu interesting for that youtube
[01:57:57.760 --> 01:58:01.600]   Um, so you your tv comes from youtube
[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:08.400]   It does now i've i've used slink and i've really i love youtube tv. I really do there. Yeah, there
[01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:12.720]   I mean, they're the best at streaming besides netflix in terms of quality and optimizing, right?
[01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:18.640]   It's such a hit you can see why apple paid 70 million for greyhound because it's such a hit driven business
[01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:22.480]   The only reason people got disney plus initially was mandalorian
[01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:27.440]   The well, maybe not the only reason i think carce i think it was the only reason
[01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:30.080]   Carce i got it for the computer where it's tennis shoes
[01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:32.160]   so
[01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:34.160]   Maybe he's the only one
[01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:40.400]   i'm excited about steve carell's new show space force and that's on hbo max
[01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:43.440]   And for me that would be worth getting hbo max
[01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:51.680]   So i think one of the biggest challenges for hbo max quite honestly is how confusing all the different hbo's are
[01:58:51.680 --> 01:58:55.760]   It's it's it's i don't know what it is i'll be honest i follow this stuff
[01:58:55.760 --> 01:59:02.720]   I don't know what hbo max actually is i just kept glossing over it. So yes, same i feel that i have read
[01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:07.680]   many descriptions including those on my own publications and
[01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:12.560]   cena has to do an explainer. This is what hbo max is this is the
[01:59:12.560 --> 01:59:15.760]   We have an explainer. We have a we have an experience that explains all the hbo
[01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:19.440]   Next to each other you have an infographic what i need is like an
[01:59:19.440 --> 01:59:27.760]   With a chart that tells me how much everything is by each month and what shows i can see and what platforms i can see them on
[01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:32.080]   Because if i can have all that comparative information in one quick image
[01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:34.160]   It would make my life so much easier
[01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:38.960]   It's still figuring out go and now like hbo go and now like i confuse those all the time
[01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:41.760]   They're both apps. They're in the same place on the store
[01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:46.160]   I'm like all right. Which one do i want? It's like i it's a gamble every time
[01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:53.600]   I have to say hbo max if you can figure out what it is and where it is and maybe you already have it for free because a lot of people do
[01:59:53.600 --> 01:59:58.560]   i'm also very interested in uh, sith rogan's show
[01:59:59.760 --> 02:00:01.760]   Just because the name an american pickle
[02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:10.240]   He plays a 1920s immigrant and is computing coding computer coding great grandson
[02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:14.000]   It's high concept, but it sounds good
[02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:20.720]   Um, I don't know it's 15 bucks a month, which is what you'd pay if you didn't have hbo at all
[02:00:20.720 --> 02:00:27.520]   Um, I don't it's very confusing. It's very confusing. Yeah
[02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:31.680]   It seems to have different content and that's really the answer
[02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:34.480]   It has a huge and now you get
[02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:40.640]   As i say you're getting sub brands make them deals right? Yeah, so on hulu they have a sub brand deal with
[02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:48.800]   Fx and fxx where they co-broadcast and sometimes they premiere shows on hulu first before it even goes to the fx channel
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:51.680]   And now on amazon you're getting i fc
[02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:58.240]   On demand i've heard what's called like i've seen film or something like that, which is a sub sub subscription to amazon
[02:00:58.320 --> 02:01:02.000]   And it's only on amazon apparently so you're like trying to figure this stuff out
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:08.080]   And then there's a criterion which i kind of want but I don't know how to watch that yet, so who knows
[02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:14.160]   I'm literally looking at the cnet explainer, which is
[02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:18.480]   I'm also seeing it the same thing and i'm just kind of like it's peachy
[02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:20.400]   I've read this before and i have not no
[02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:26.640]   And he's doing is just break this down into a job. You can't explain this. It's so complicated
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000]   I
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:34.960]   Don't know is that hbo max's fault or is it the world we live in now or what?
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:37.840]   I think that it is the it's the hash
[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:42.000]   This is actually written by jones soulsman who covers streaming media for us and
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:45.520]   um, I think that it has to do with the overlay of
[02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:49.280]   The content providers the people who make the content like hbo
[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:54.480]   Yeah, it's all the tools the service providers. Yes, so there's a lot in this article about the overlap of
[02:01:54.960 --> 02:02:00.720]   um atnt and hbo and what you're already paying for and whether you're getting this through your cable
[02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:04.080]   provider or you're getting it as a add-on
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:08.400]   And that just creates this incredibly complicated lens game
[02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:11.360]   This is now in a nutshell why i'm worried about spotify
[02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:14.400]   Owning podcasting because it's just it's crazy
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:21.040]   It's yeah, at least it's spotify. It's technically free even jarogans. That's true. That's the part of free tier. So
[02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:26.880]   Um, there's that's just a simple app you down on create an account, but from the user's point of view
[02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:30.640]   It's not a bad thing. It's from the podcasters point of view that I worry because you know
[02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:35.760]   And actually if you're a privacy focused user, you might not be crazy about it. Yeah
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:40.800]   Yeah, the good thing about this stuff is in theory you could subscribe and unsubscribe
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:45.520]   Rather quickly, right, but then I feel like for someone like myself
[02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:48.480]   I need like another service that manages my services
[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:52.640]   So tells me why I can just one click and do that, but who's gonna make that, right?
[02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:56.640]   Then there's also the issue who has time to watch all this crap
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:03.040]   Your bank they may have in a weird way. I think that the future by the way total jag here
[02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:07.440]   Is your bank managing those subscriptions for you? Wells Fargo history
[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:09.440]   Oh
[02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:15.360]   Where you can like Wells Fargo will kind of identify recurring stuff and and help you get out of them. That's great
[02:03:16.240 --> 02:03:17.440]   Yeah
[02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:23.200]   That's great. I use an app that they've been advertising heavily called true bill that kind of is supposed to do that figure out
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:28.320]   What subscriptions you have and and so forth, but yeah bank that would be a sensible financial service
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:30.160]   Be huge
[02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:35.040]   It's a big value ad for a bank to do because they don't really they want you to be using your money wisely
[02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:39.440]   They they don't have the same incentives to get you to subscribe or unsubscribe from things
[02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:44.400]   Right, so they really are a good kind of neutral party to to provide that service for you
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:47.520]   And I hope them more of them do it in our chatroom
[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:51.440]   Doctor like you need a budget to do that a budget
[02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:58.080]   There's a there's an app called you need a budget. Oh, I thought you were telling me something. I do need a budget
[02:03:58.080 --> 02:04:01.760]   There's an app called you need a budget people
[02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:07.200]   Refer to online is ynab and oh why not? I know I've seen that everywhere. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
[02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:12.720]   It'd be right in their constituency where I like this. Yeah, we're carrying this is how much you're paying every month for hula
[02:04:13.600 --> 02:04:15.920]   Chat calls it services as a service
[02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:19.120]   Yes
[02:04:19.120 --> 02:04:25.600]   I like it. This is the lovely fridge now services. Yes, you need services. Everything is meta. It's all service
[02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:27.840]   Um
[02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:31.680]   Bad news if you were hoping to get a hundred twenty five dollars in your equifax
[02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:34.720]   settlement
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:41.440]   So many people applied for it you might get a few cents of course the banks are going to get money because the equifax breach forced
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:45.120]   Banks to issue new credit cards in the millions
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:48.320]   So banks are going to get five and a half million
[02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:51.920]   uh, the ftc made equifax
[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:57.840]   Pay a five hundred seventy five million dollar settlement with in the words of
[02:04:57.840 --> 02:05:03.440]   ours technica's kate cox a pinky swear to go forth and send no more
[02:05:03.440 --> 02:05:08.960]   Individuals supposedly could claim a hundred twenty five dollars each from the settlement
[02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:15.920]   Until that is the ftc and equifax remembered that there were 144 million people in the breach
[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:20.560]   And there wasn't enough cash to pay everybody that much
[02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:27.680]   So as it ends up your might you give might get a check for 52 cents in a bag of pop chips
[02:05:27.680 --> 02:05:30.880]   I don't know
[02:05:30.880 --> 02:05:36.160]   I mentioned the pop chips because that was the most i've ever gotten a class action lawsuit
[02:05:36.160 --> 02:05:38.800]   was the famous the world famous
[02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:45.040]   Pop chips. I'm sorry. I mentioned pop chips and and I and I think I put lindsey turrentine into anaphylactic shock
[02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:46.400]   I apologize
[02:05:46.400 --> 02:05:51.680]   Uh, I got the the settlement in the class action lawsuit was a bag of pop chips
[02:05:51.680 --> 02:05:57.520]   Go ahead. Go ahead hydrate wall lindsey
[02:05:57.520 --> 02:05:59.920]   Is
[02:05:59.920 --> 02:06:01.920]   Mids from my mint. Oh no
[02:06:01.920 --> 02:06:07.280]   And it went down the wrong. I think you're taking mint tea a little too literally lindsey
[02:06:07.840 --> 02:06:10.320]   You know what I learned this in um, Amsterdam
[02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:12.880]   Well in the Netherlands, that's how they make mint tea
[02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:17.280]   But it wasn't mint in the jar, but okay. Yeah. Yeah. No, this is actual mint
[02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:20.080]   That's actually a great idea. Is it good?
[02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:22.800]   It's wonderful. Do you boil it or is it suntier?
[02:06:22.800 --> 02:06:28.480]   I boil it. I just pour boiling water over a stick of mint. Oh, I love it. No one
[02:06:28.480 --> 02:06:29.280]   And then calm down
[02:06:29.280 --> 02:06:34.000]   You need a little screen on the top or something just a little something
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.560]   I'm gonna get myself mint inhalation
[02:06:36.560 --> 02:06:41.120]   I showed it. I brought to you by cash fly and I mean that quite literally they are our CDN
[02:06:41.120 --> 02:06:43.680]   A content delivery network
[02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:47.440]   And if you notice and you probably don't that's the beauty of cash fly
[02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:48.560]   You probably never notice
[02:06:48.560 --> 02:06:55.040]   But when you download shows from our network via our RSS feeds are on our website. They come fast. No buffering
[02:06:55.040 --> 02:07:00.720]   Boom. They just come in. That's cash fly at work. They've been delivering content since 1999
[02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:07.840]   We've been using them almost since the beginning of twit. I'm a huge fan of cash fly partly because they save us money
[02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:09.920]   I mean they they are
[02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:12.960]   30% faster than the competition and they cost less
[02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:16.800]   They also do some really nice things like smooth out the cost
[02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:24.640]   Of your CDN by by you know, we're very peaky as most downloads are whether it's podcasts or applications or data of any kind
[02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:26.400]   You know tends to be peaky
[02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:31.360]   You kind of maybe worries on some CDNs. Oh am I going over my content cap?
[02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:34.400]   Not with cash fly. They average it out over a year
[02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:38.880]   So you know exactly what you're going to pay month after month and now they have something really cool
[02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:41.920]   It's a little complicated, but if you use the CDN you'll get it
[02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:44.720]   It's called 100 cash shield
[02:07:44.720 --> 02:07:49.920]   And it's going to save you so much money a drastic reduction in data transfers fees with
[02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:56.400]   AWS's s3 and other cloud storage origins because your cash hit ratio with the CDN will be 100
[02:07:56.400 --> 02:08:01.200]   Essentially you're putting your storage not on these third parties, but on cash fly
[02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:04.080]   which means when
[02:08:04.080 --> 02:08:06.240]   You get a
[02:08:06.240 --> 02:08:08.240]   cash hit
[02:08:08.240 --> 02:08:10.640]   When you get your cash items being evicted
[02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:16.320]   For large one-off requests costing you a fortune in data transfer out fees
[02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:21.840]   Well, it just doesn't happen with 100% cash shield and cash flies guaranteed availability. You just avoid that
[02:08:21.840 --> 02:08:28.240]   It's a next generation content delivery solution for today and tomorrow you keep your content and data closer to your customers
[02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:31.760]   You don't have to go over the public internet traffic from other companies
[02:08:31.760 --> 02:08:38.320]   You buy as much space as you want your data will always be fetched from 100% cash shield rather than the origin
[02:08:38.320 --> 02:08:43.360]   Shielding can reduce your origin spend by thousands of dollars a month and
[02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:47.680]   And this is no insignificant side benefit. There are no more cash misses
[02:08:47.680 --> 02:08:51.440]   You're going to improve your download speeds. There'll be no more buffering
[02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:56.640]   Guaranteed availability the highest quality of service if you're streaming video
[02:08:56.640 --> 02:09:05.600]   It'll scale reliably to reach global audiences of any size if you're if you're doing gaming you get hyperfast download speeds low latency and a scalable solution
[02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:10.800]   Your podcast will be delivered quickly and reliably without delays or timeouts and I can vouch
[02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:17.600]   For that lightning fast digital download speeds for large digital digital files no matter where your customers are I love cash fly
[02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:25.360]   And because they're all over the world their global throughput performance dominance ensures any cash misses are delivered five times faster
[02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:27.680]   Than from your origins
[02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:29.680]   Just for twit listeners
[02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:33.920]   Cash flies giving away a complimentary detailed analysis of your current cdn bill and usage trends
[02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:37.680]   You may be paying as much as 20 more than you have to
[02:09:38.480 --> 02:09:42.320]   This is no pressure just bring them your bill bring them your usage
[02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:44.640]   And they can tell you if you'll save twit

[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:52.960]   for saving me
[02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:54.960]   big time
[02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:58.480]   Oh, there's so many stories we haven't got to let me see
[02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:04.400]   What about the grandma or to delete her facebook pictures of her grand children
[02:10:06.080 --> 02:10:08.160]   This is just a silly story
[02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:10.320]   a gdpr action apparently
[02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:16.720]   A mother and daughter were having a fight grandma was posting pictures of the grandkids the daughter said knock it off grandma said
[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:19.040]   No, they're my grandkids
[02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:21.600]   They went to court
[02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:27.760]   And the judge ruled that the matter was within the scope of the general data protection regulation gdpr
[02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:30.560]   the grandma
[02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:35.600]   Is ordered to remove the photos or pay a fine of 50 euros a day up to a thousand euros?
[02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:42.640]   And if she posts more images of the grandkids in the future she'll be fine an extra 50 euros a day
[02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:48.560]   I love this. I I I think the kids should get to choose
[02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:52.400]   Yeah, yeah, that's what happens in a divorce the kids choose
[02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:57.440]   I want grandma to post the pictures. Maybe they're too little to have a choice
[02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:00.000]   maybe
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.080]   Yeah, every grandma
[02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:10.480]   Yeah, every grandma post pictures of their grandkids. Would you would you be unhappy if your mom posted pictures of facebook of your daughter?
[02:11:10.480 --> 02:11:14.400]   At least so or
[02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:16.080]   So
[02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:20.560]   I actually did have this conversation with both sets of grandparents. Oh, okay
[02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:25.520]   and my reasoning and my thinking was it's my job to
[02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:33.360]   Be a responsible steward of my daughter's image and her name and whatever her profile online is right now
[02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:37.040]   That's fair because she doesn't have the tools to do it. Yep. And so
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:40.000]   because they are a part of her
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:46.640]   Circle in the family. They also my argument to them was they also have that oblique yes because they're adults
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:51.600]   Yes, and so I wanted to make sure that if they were going to post pictures
[02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:56.640]   That the people that they accepted as facebook friends were people they could vouch for in real life
[02:11:57.120 --> 02:12:01.840]   that they were people they felt comfortable exposing this information to and
[02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:10.880]   That they would also understand if my daughter or I at any future point reserved the right to ask them take it down
[02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:14.880]   and it was a little bit of a weird conversation to have
[02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:17.440]   because
[02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:20.960]   One parent one grandparent was like how is this any different than throwing
[02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:26.000]   Student pictures in an envelope and sending them out with a christmas card
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000]   I had the same
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:31.360]   That's a good point but the christmas card goes to one person
[02:12:31.360 --> 02:12:34.000]   Facebook goes to everybody
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:40.000]   To be replicated and reused and downloaded in music like you lose control in a way that you don't have a physical object
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:46.240]   And so we did have to work through the idea that we'd like to think that everybody that we know digitally online is a good actor
[02:12:46.240 --> 02:12:51.120]   That's not always the case. Please be responsible about assessing and evaluating
[02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:54.720]   And then once my daughter hit elementary school, we started
[02:12:55.360 --> 02:12:58.240]   Passing everything by her like if I mentioned her on twitter
[02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:01.680]   I'd make sure that I talk to her about it first and she's okay with what we tweet
[02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:04.640]   Sometimes she's like you can tweet what I just said
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:09.520]   Um, and we do the same thing with pictures and it's
[02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:12.640]   An ongoing discussion with you know, this is your
[02:13:12.640 --> 02:13:17.440]   You're you're gonna you're gonna have a public data trail and as your parents
[02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:19.680]   It's our job to start you off strong. That's fair
[02:13:19.680 --> 02:13:25.280]   And hopefully give you the skills to build it up over time on your own and take it over by the time
[02:13:25.440 --> 02:13:27.440]   You're in your teens
[02:13:27.440 --> 02:13:31.840]   Good news with for section 230 fans
[02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:38.400]   This is the communication decency act section that says that social networks are not responsible
[02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:42.800]   They're not caught their common carriers in effect. They're not publishers of the content
[02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:45.360]   uh, there was a lawsuit
[02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:51.920]   against facebook from back in 2016 because facebook hosted accounts
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:59.680]   At least the lawsuit claimed knowingly belonging to hamas, which is of course a classified as a terrorist organization
[02:13:59.680 --> 02:14:04.480]   Under section 230 that you know, you can't sue a website for that
[02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:08.480]   But the lawsuit said facebook's algorithm
[02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:14.800]   There's the algorithm again promoted terrorist content to people who liked similar pages or posts
[02:14:14.800 --> 02:14:20.640]   And as a result they should be more liable their immunity should be reduced or eliminated
[02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:22.960]   uh
[02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:27.200]   They lost in court this lost in court facebook 1 second circuit court
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:34.080]   Shot down the complaint saying there's no basis for making facebook liable because it arranged content with algorithms
[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:39.600]   It was appealed to the supreme court and this week the supreme court
[02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:46.800]   Rejected the case letting these ruling stand so a victory for section 230. I guess you agree
[02:14:48.720 --> 02:14:51.200]   This is always that tough case scenario, right?
[02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:53.440]   It's I mean it comes down to freedom of speech
[02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:56.880]   Not in this exact case, but those are the examples used
[02:14:56.880 --> 02:15:01.520]   It's never the things you want to hear that we all agree upon it's always those tough cases
[02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:08.400]   The ones that are like is this what we really want because no one is going public. Oh, yeah, we should let terrorist groups and
[02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:12.160]   Let them use these platforms for this stuff, but at the same time
[02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:16.640]   Yeah, you can't have these companies being completely responsible
[02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:24.160]   What needs to be done is put pressure on these companies to figure out how they can solve these problems with your algorithms and everything
[02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:30.960]   Lindsey do you think that facebook's more liable because they their algorithm might have promoted the amass posts? I
[02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:33.680]   you know
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:35.360]   Yes
[02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:41.360]   And I think that the problem here is that when we talk about free speech we're often talking about the ability to share your
[02:15:41.360 --> 02:15:45.200]   opinion even if it's controversial or or negative
[02:15:45.680 --> 02:15:51.760]   And then the responsibility of a private company when it comes to that to what degree is facebook
[02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:55.280]   You know a utility right versus
[02:15:55.280 --> 02:16:02.240]   Just a service that that makes it makes money through passing along information
[02:16:02.240 --> 02:16:04.320]   um
[02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:06.320]   I think that that an
[02:16:06.320 --> 02:16:11.920]   Algorithm promoting something if is in a way effectively an endorsement of that
[02:16:12.400 --> 02:16:19.200]   Interesting not necessarily an endorsement of the content itself, but an endorsement of the power of the content and it gives it
[02:16:19.200 --> 02:16:21.760]   Amplifying something
[02:16:21.760 --> 02:16:25.680]   Right it's saying more people should fire this from the theater
[02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:31.120]   Decided right that more people should hear this and and we in this case is the algorithm
[02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:34.080]   Um, and that's and that's where it gets really really tricky
[02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:39.600]   But I I tend to fall on the side of caution here right like go ahead and put your stuff there
[02:16:40.320 --> 02:16:45.040]   But but if it is dangerous and that's where it gets really easy
[02:16:45.040 --> 02:16:49.360]   Yeah, don't
[02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:55.360]   Spread it as it's a tough it's a it's really tough. I mean I we were talking about this at home the other day and I I kind of think that
[02:16:55.360 --> 02:17:04.640]   Um the laws in this country around free speech and what that means and and how it was interpreted came before the ability for machines to amplify a thought
[02:17:04.640 --> 02:17:05.840]   Right
[02:17:05.840 --> 02:17:07.840]   It's the same problem
[02:17:07.840 --> 02:17:12.800]   But we but you had to you had to have the resources to do that and maybe we need to take another look at it
[02:17:12.800 --> 02:17:15.040]   Well very famously
[02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:21.280]   Mere months after the first amendment was passed the federal government passed the sedition act
[02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:25.600]   Which was completely against freedom of speech
[02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:34.240]   It permitted the deportation finer imprisonment of anyone publishing false scandalous or even malicious writing in the united states against the government
[02:17:34.720 --> 02:17:37.280]   so that was in 1798 so
[02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:43.280]   We have a long and checkered history about the the first amendment in this case. It's not the government
[02:17:43.280 --> 02:17:50.640]   Restricting what face you know, I guess it would be the government restricting what facebook could do, but it is facebook's right to publish or not publish
[02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:53.120]   Stuff
[02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:57.360]   I think the algorithm arguments very interesting. We have the same problem with youtube promoting
[02:17:57.360 --> 02:17:59.680]   extremist content
[02:17:59.680 --> 02:18:03.520]   Algorithmically, I don't I don't think that the youtube employees or staff or google
[02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:05.920]   wants to do that, but the algorithm does
[02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:09.920]   At what point don't they become responsible for what the algorithms doing?
[02:18:09.920 --> 02:18:13.280]   Yeah, and how is the algorithm? You know humans have
[02:18:13.280 --> 02:18:16.160]   You know, there's certainly you know, there's the old pornography
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:17.680]   You know it when you see it
[02:18:17.680 --> 02:18:23.760]   Issue and if you rely on humans and you know it when you see it to make educated decisions about what is appropriate to share and what isn't
[02:18:23.760 --> 02:18:26.400]   And then you that's one thing
[02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:33.680]   Turning those decisions over to an algorithm is fully another thing because that algorithm is probably always
[02:18:33.760 --> 02:18:39.760]   Going to move to our most base instincts not our most educated instinct. Yeah. Yeah, that's why they work
[02:18:39.760 --> 02:18:46.640]   Exactly. Finally. I mean, I don't mean finally like this finally happened. I mean our final story
[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:52.160]   Walmart is discontinuing jet.com it bought it for three billion dollars
[02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:55.680]   It was an attempt to go after amazon. It had an interesting
[02:18:55.680 --> 02:18:58.880]   Algorithmic base the pricing was based on
[02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:01.600]   You know the situation, I guess
[02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:06.320]   And how much you bought etc etc Walmart needed to get an online
[02:19:06.320 --> 02:19:12.800]   You know to come online sales to compete with amazon. They bought jet four years later
[02:19:12.800 --> 02:19:19.200]   They discontinuing it visits to the site have plummeted the brand is not taking off
[02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:23.440]   Uh, that's a pretty big loss for walmart. Although
[02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:27.040]   I got to point out walmart's doing all right niek commerce
[02:19:27.040 --> 02:19:29.680]   74% surge in online sales
[02:19:29.920 --> 02:19:35.120]   Do that's what's so weird about this. Yeah, they built this whole thing and they're not using it
[02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:42.480]   There's a brand they've had a really checkered approach to e-commerce too because they bought mod cloth
[02:19:42.480 --> 02:19:49.840]   And that hasn't worked out for them. There was some men's clothing site that they also bought that I think they recently gutted
[02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:51.440]   um
[02:19:51.440 --> 02:19:53.120]   It seems like
[02:19:53.120 --> 02:19:59.040]   They really don't know how to build an audience online and and capitalize on their
[02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:01.120]   uh
[02:20:01.120 --> 02:20:04.240]   Slajas tickle and instill network either. It's it's kind of awful
[02:20:04.240 --> 02:20:08.400]   It's I think the story of jet is interesting because the guy I found in a mark lore
[02:20:08.400 --> 02:20:12.560]   Founded it because he hated amazon. He had started
[02:20:12.560 --> 02:20:14.320]   um
[02:20:14.320 --> 02:20:16.800]   diapers.com and soap.com
[02:20:16.800 --> 02:20:23.520]   And 2005 and amazon essentially took it down in a price war they've done this before with other
[02:20:23.520 --> 02:20:27.520]   uh other online stores by just undercutting them
[02:20:28.560 --> 02:20:31.440]   And eventually he was forced to sell the amazon
[02:20:31.440 --> 02:20:34.800]   Amazon acquired both brands for
[02:20:34.800 --> 02:20:38.960]   $545 million the company the parent company's quid see
[02:20:38.960 --> 02:20:41.840]   He left quid see in 2013
[02:20:41.840 --> 02:20:46.320]   And then started jet.com three years later to try once again
[02:20:46.320 --> 02:20:51.200]   To beat the amazon juggernaut, uh, i'm sorry
[02:20:51.200 --> 02:20:57.840]   He started at 2013 three years later. He sold it to wall to walmart for 3.3 billion
[02:20:58.480 --> 02:21:01.440]   And now here we are seven years later and amazon
[02:21:01.440 --> 02:21:03.120]   Money on
[02:21:03.120 --> 02:21:05.920]   Been a lot of money hitting on amazon. He hates amazon
[02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:07.120]   He
[02:21:07.120 --> 02:21:09.680]   I was I had this problem my life. He hates amazon
[02:21:09.680 --> 02:21:11.760]   But he or something so badly that i've made
[02:21:11.760 --> 02:21:12.240]   Yeah
[02:21:12.240 --> 02:21:16.720]   $545 million and then 3.3 billion not bad right not bad now
[02:21:16.720 --> 02:21:19.840]   He is still walmart ceo of e commerce
[02:21:19.840 --> 02:21:24.880]   So I guess he still has a job. Although why he's working. I have no idea
[02:21:26.400 --> 02:21:30.960]   And hey if I got 100 million I retire, huh? He hates amazon. He hates him
[02:21:30.960 --> 02:21:32.960]   I'm gonna kill amazon
[02:21:32.960 --> 02:21:33.920]   He's working
[02:21:33.920 --> 02:21:35.920]   And i kill him
[02:21:35.920 --> 02:21:36.720]   Oh

[02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.480]   By the way
[02:22:12.480 --> 02:22:17.600]   Uh, we we're launching a whole package next week on cnet. I'll see that's 25th birthday
[02:22:17.600 --> 02:22:20.560]   Oh

[02:22:22.880 --> 02:22:25.920]   I was cnet's fourth employee. I wonder if they'll mention me
[02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:28.960]   Well, I'm writing the intro tonight
[02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:32.000]   And so I've told you this story, right?
[02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.240]   Halsey minor and shelby bonnie
[02:22:34.240 --> 02:22:40.720]   If I told you this story, I know I haven't heard it. I was uh, I was doing a radio show in
[02:22:40.720 --> 02:22:43.360]   1992. I was doing a syndicated
[02:22:43.360 --> 02:22:46.240]   computer talk show with the vorac
[02:22:46.240 --> 02:22:50.160]   And I got a call from this guy halsey minor who was a hedge fund
[02:22:50.960 --> 02:22:52.960]   You know boy boy wonder
[02:22:52.960 --> 02:22:58.160]   Uh saying hey, we're starting we want to start a television network about computers
[02:22:58.160 --> 02:23:00.880]   You seem to be the only one doing a national computer talk show
[02:23:00.880 --> 02:23:07.280]   You should come to work for us. I said, okay. He made me I think I was a vp of marketing
[02:23:07.280 --> 02:23:12.800]   There was only four of us. It was him shelby bonnie another hedge fund guy and finance year
[02:23:12.800 --> 02:23:15.280]   And I think there was one other person working there
[02:23:16.080 --> 02:23:22.480]   Uh the first job he gave me was well, how much is it going to cost for us to start a 24-hour tech network?
[02:23:22.480 --> 02:23:26.960]   This is in 1992 and I came back saying I'll give you an example
[02:23:26.960 --> 02:23:28.800]   CNN
[02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:30.000]   Took them
[02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:34.880]   $50 million a year for 10 years before they made any money that's half a billion dollars
[02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:36.640]   How much you have halsey?
[02:23:36.640 --> 02:23:39.920]   And at that point and I take some credit for this
[02:23:39.920 --> 02:23:44.000]   They pivoted to the website strategy with a little tv on the side
[02:23:44.560 --> 02:23:46.480]   Uh, he also fired me, but that was another
[02:23:46.480 --> 02:23:50.880]   That's another story for another day. I want to hear that story
[02:23:50.880 --> 02:23:54.320]   This is the 25th anniversary of the website. Yeah
[02:23:54.320 --> 02:23:59.440]   Yeah, so 92 so that 25th anniversary would have been 95
[02:23:59.440 --> 02:24:06.480]   So yeah, this was early on he he really and I we even did a pilot john c divorek and I
[02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:11.280]   Uh did a very much like this show a round table show pilot
[02:24:12.160 --> 02:24:14.160]   Um, and that's I think what got me fired
[02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:17.440]   Is and the weird thing about did you ever meet halsey miner?
[02:24:17.440 --> 02:24:21.360]   Oh, yes. Yes quite a character the weird thing about
[02:24:21.360 --> 02:24:26.080]   Halsey he never told me I didn't work for him. He just went radio silent
[02:24:26.080 --> 02:24:34.800]   This was that shortly after and I boy I kick myself. He said, you know, we need some and if you could put $10,000 into this
[02:24:34.800 --> 02:24:36.800]   I'd give you I don't know 20 percent
[02:24:36.800 --> 02:24:38.560]   and uh
[02:24:38.560 --> 02:24:42.000]   And I said, you know, I just bought a house halsey. I don't have any cash
[02:24:42.960 --> 02:24:46.560]   Anyway, little did I know what did I know how many it um
[02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:53.120]   So six months later, he says come on and visit. This is when he was in the railroad car
[02:24:53.120 --> 02:25:00.000]   Down on the waterfront. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah. He was in a railroad car. He said come on down
[02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:05.840]   I'd like to show you my railroad car and uh, he basically he said, you know zd
[02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:10.720]   Zif Davis is looking for a tv guy. You should go call them
[02:25:10.720 --> 02:25:17.280]   And uh to hint I took and did call them in fact they hired me bill macron
[02:25:17.280 --> 02:25:24.160]   Uh and uh gary, um, I can't remember his name. They hired me. So that went well, but that was a weird
[02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:29.280]   Interregnum. I don't even know if they paid me. I can't even remember if I
[02:25:29.280 --> 02:25:33.760]   The the real reason halsey didn't like me is he wanted to go down to sig ref
[02:25:34.400 --> 02:25:37.360]   And he said would you get the together? Her plane tickets will go down to sig ref
[02:25:37.360 --> 02:25:40.960]   We'll see what's going on at the this a big was a big graphics conference
[02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:43.680]   And I made a mistake of instead of buying
[02:25:43.680 --> 02:25:48.560]   A nice jet airplane tickets. I got a turbo jet
[02:25:48.560 --> 02:25:54.160]   To la because it was cheap cheap and quick and he didn't like that. So I think that was the end of my career
[02:25:54.160 --> 02:25:56.960]   That was it. Yeah, that was that was your last decision
[02:25:56.960 --> 02:25:59.280]   That was that was my last decision as an executive
[02:25:59.840 --> 02:26:06.480]   Of cnet number number three or number four employee. You don't don't please do not put me in that story
[02:26:06.480 --> 02:26:07.840]   I don't know
[02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:10.080]   I but you should know you should know
[02:26:10.080 --> 02:26:14.800]   Uh, I have something to do with cnet success. I left
