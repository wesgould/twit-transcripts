[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Tastes like chicken.

[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   >> It's time for this weekend tech and we're assembling a panel
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   of opposing forces.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   This is going to be interesting.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   In one corner on the left we've got CNET in the face and
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   shape of Mr. Tom Merritt of Buzz Out Loud.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   >> Hey Tom.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   >> Hey how's it going Leo?
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   >> Thanks for having me on.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   >> Always good to have you on.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   I love doing it.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   I'm returning I'll do Buzz Out Loud on Monday.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   >> It's a deal.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   >> And also from CNET a guy who's not been on Twitter
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   before but is a revered name in broadcast news.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Long time famous news director at KPIX in Channel 5 in

[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   And now what do you do Harry Fuller at CNET?
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   >> Good question what I do.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   I worry about the front door and video and all kinds of stuff.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   >> You're an executive editor.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   >> Yeah, so I edit all the executives.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   >> Somebody's got it.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   >> Somebody's got to watch him.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   >> It's great to have you.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   >> Thank you.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   >> Thank you for joining us.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Get closer to the mic because we want to hear every bit of your
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   pearls of wisdom.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   >> All right.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   >> You got it.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   >> Never have to get any closer to Mr. Patrick Norton.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   He's always right up on top of the mic.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   >> Mr. Patrick, DL, that's it.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   >> I turn my volume down.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   [laughter]
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   He's in the Ziff Davis corner.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   We've got two over there.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Also the cranky geek himself, John C. Devorak.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Dot org slash block.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   >> Oh, is that again?
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   >> Dot org slash block.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   You know it has a ring to it, a cadence.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   And somebody's got a bicycle bell it sounds like.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   >> It has a ring to it, you said.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   >> No, what was it?
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   >> Oh, I get it.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   John's always want to be a shock-chock.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   I hear there's an opening now at CBS.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Maybe--
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   >> Yeah, I heard that too.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   >> Right, right.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   >> Dymus used to every time I did the time checks.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   When he worked at W and Bracey would play the duck quack.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   >> W and Bracey.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   >> You got his voice.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   You could take that job.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   >> I grew up, well, not grew up, but I used in college.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   I would get up early, just listen to Don.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   I'm a son of WNBC.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   >> Yeah, I just can't believe Dr. Reverend Billy Saul-Hargis
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   for the first church of the Cooey Death and Discount House
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   of worship has fallen so far.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   >> Didn't you do that?
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   >> I don't think he's been doing Billy Saul or any of those
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   characters.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   >> No, but I was-- >> No, but when I was--
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   >> No, but when I was listening, when I was living in
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   North Jersey, and it was all over the morning show, that was a
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   huge part of it.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   >> I was singing the morning.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   >> Nook and people, it was fun.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Great stuff.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Do you think I must have found a job right away?
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   It's not a tech story, but I'm just curious.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   >> You go right to the satellite place.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   >> That's what I figured.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   >> 50/50 chance they won't touch him because they've got to get
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   through Washington, D.C., politically correct.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   They want their merger and they're not going to
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   infuriate any of the politically correct people in Washington
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   now.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   >> Politically correct people in Washington.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   >> Politically correct.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   >> You mean incredibly uptight.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   >> Well, that--however you want to translate, I think I'm
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Mrs. Radioactive until after the merger.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   >> Okay, well that's fine, but he's still going to end up there
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   and besides, it's not that he needs the money.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   He could be picked up by one of the earthbound stations.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I don't see why you're on it.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   >> This is just start podcasting.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   >> How about New York?
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   >> I don't know.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   He may do that.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   >> He may be-- >> Because he's insulted a bunch of people,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   advertisers won't touch him with a stick and the Rutgers basketball
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   team hasn't accepted his apology, but not forget his
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   apology, but not forgiven him yet.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   >> It was a nasty thing to say.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   >> Oh, it was-- >> He can go online.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   >> It wasn't anything worse than something Andrew Dies Clay would
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   say.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   >> Yeah, but Andrew Dies Clay's not on a podcast.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   >> Dies Clay isn't on radio.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   >> Yeah, it was not.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   >> That's what it was.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   >> There is a tech angle.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   >> You're seeing another role model.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   >> There is a tech angle to this because it was the media
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   watch blog that picked it up.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   The IMS's statement was at 6.15 in the morning.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Nobody really heard it.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   There was no ruckus raised except by media watch.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   They immediately sent out email blasts to newspapers and
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   news editors and blogged it.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   And I think it was that.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   >> Yeah, no, I agree.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   He was targeted.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   >> And a lot of blog sites posted video once they finally got
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   onto it.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   >> Is it the worst thing he's ever said?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   I really don't listen to the guy ever.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   >> Seems unlikely.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   >> I don't remember him saying anything about that.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   >> It's a pretty-- I mean, you know, the basketball team just
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   comes out of an NCAA match and he says something about it.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   >> That was true.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   >> He said it was a crummy thing to say.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   >> Well, I don't know.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   He said it was a couple of years ago.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   >> About a year ago, in fact, almost exactly a year ago when the
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   female reporter that worked for the Christian Science Monitor had
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   gotten released by whoever was holding her hostage in the
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Middle East, he basically accused her of sleeping with her
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   captives.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   >> That's pretty bad.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   >> I got the idea that that's what he built his career on,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   saying stuff like that to get people all riled up.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   >> Just to call David Borman "Pantload."
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I thought that was-- remember Borman?
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   >> Yes.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   >> He was the NBC vice president or executive producer who put
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   him on MSNBC.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   I'm sure he's-- he's long-- I think he went to CNBC or CNN.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   >> CNN.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   >> So he's long gone from there.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   >> All right, big story, of course, and it's a story we missed
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   with our Mac show by one day.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   We seem to be doing that a lot with the Mac show.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   >> It's Mac's always a day late in a dollar short.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   >> It's true.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Apple.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   And I'm very curious what you guys think of this.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Apple goes to the PR News Wire, releases a story, very simple
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   story.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   In fact, maybe I'll read the actual Apple copy because--
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   >> Because they've been accused by Herb Greenberg and others now
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   of spinning the story, basically saying we've been working so
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   hard on the iPhone.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   And boy, by the way, incidentally, the iPhone has passed
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   several of its tests so far, and we are still on track for a
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   June release, but we've been working-- >> Late June.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   >> Late June.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Yeah, yeah, that's not the June 11th that everybody's been saying.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   We've been working so hard on the iPhone that, oh, golly, we just
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   don't have the resources to work on Leopard, and we're going to have
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   to delay that for three months till October.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   >> Right, which of course assumes that the same people that would
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   work on a phone and a mobile phone would be the exact same people
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   working on Leopard, whether they do pull those guys off a Leopard?
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   >> Obviously, the iPhone's running OS 10.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   >> But the phone is running OS 10.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Didn't you remember?
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Steve Jobs, as though the iPhone is running OS 10.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   I think the site Apple's positive-- you know, Pollyanna's spin that
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   they put on this press release, there's almost no way not to
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   interpret this negatively.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Either they're such a small company that they've only got 10 people
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   working for them.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   >> We've so misallocated our resources, or conversely, we've so
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   realized we make so little money off of the operating system.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   We've decided to completely throw in in the consumer electronics
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   direction.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   >> Well, that's what Macworld says.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   >> Macworld says the iPhone is into distraction.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   >> Who cares about the OS, says Macworld magazine?
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   >> I do.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   >> I do too.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   >> I care more about the OS than the Smartphone.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   >> Of all people, of all people?
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   >> Yeah, it's kind of a surprise.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   >> I didn't know that.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   That is weird.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   >> This is Peter Cohen?
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   >> No, it's not.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   What percentage of Apple's revenue comes from the iPod
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   iTunes now for Macworld?
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   >> You know, but Macworld magazine is supposed to be about the
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Macintosh, not about Apple, not a company who cares about the
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   company's bottom line.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   >> It's their Macworld and their enthusiastic publication doesn't
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   mean they can't have a strong sense of reality.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   >> Well, I got another sense of reality for you.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   I think the problem with Apple, if they're having problems with
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   their operating system, is the fact that Steve Jobs runs a
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   futile system and nobody can do anything on the plantation
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   without his permission.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   >> And he's only got so many hours a day and he's running two
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   corporations and he's on the board of ABC.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   >> The problem is not that there's only ten employees.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   The problem is there's only one Steve Jobs.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   >> That's right.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   There's one decision maker and I'll bet he has to sign off
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   anything bigger than a paperclip.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   >> Or other negative possibilities.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Leopard is in such trouble.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   They were going to slip it anyway and I've heard a lot of
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   people kind of behind the scenes saying, "Lepard not looking
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   so good."
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   They crashed at Macworld Expo.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   I remember when they were demoing.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   >> Are we saying spotty performance from Leopard?
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   >> How about this for a more obscure idea?
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Although in reality, I agree with Harry.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   But how about this for an idea?
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Leopard was having nothing but problems to the point where they
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   dreamed up the whole iPhone scam just to distract people from
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Leopard.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   >> I smell a call and they will never release the phone.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   >> I smell a call.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Here's the other negative.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   >> A phony phone.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   I like that.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   That's better than Leopard's spots.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Here's Herb Greenberg's scenario for MarketWatch.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   He says the iPhone is in trouble.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   He says, "Notice, they say we've passed some of our tests,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   but not all of our tests."
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   >> No, boy.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   >> And that 22 minutes of battery life is really killing us.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   >> And he says, and I think this is credible,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   they pre-announced the iPhone prematurely to cover up poor
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   iPod sales, they fooled the stock market, obviously.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Apple stock's been on a tear, and now they're in a little bit of
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   trouble.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   >> Do you think it's time for them to rip up OS X and start over
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   again if they're really having trouble with Leopard?
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   >> I don't think so.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   I think the core of OS X is solid.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   I think maybe Leopard was more ambitious than an Audaby,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   but OS X is it stands now as a very solid operating system.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   It certainly competes well with Vista.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   >> Well, while we're dealing with conspiracy theories,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   the fact that their house organ, which is really the Wall Street
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Journal and not Macworld, hasn't said anything positive about
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   iPhone in a while, makes you very suspicious.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   >> Mm.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   >> You talk about multi-wasp--
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   >> That's the one, that's the one.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   >> I noticed Walt wrote an article, the most recent tech column
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   is about how to get all the crap off of PCs, and he manages
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   to sneak the Mac in there anyway and say, but this isn't a
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   problem on Apple's software.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Interesting, boy, talk about house organ.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   So what do we say?
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   What's the vote?
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Bad news for Apple?
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   >> They always get through this stuff.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   I'm not worried about it.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   I'm still thinking that the real problem is the fact that they
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   want to get into the phone industry in the first place,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   which is my argument.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   I think it's just a bad business to be in.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   >> But what about the Mac faithful?
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Doesn't this really say we are at a computer company anymore?
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   >> That's what they're trying to say.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   >> I think maybe they shouldn't be.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   >> I think that's a scary thing.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   >> I agree with John on that.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   I think they've realized that they can only go so far with
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   the computer side of things and they can make a lot of money
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   on devices.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   I don't know if the iPhone is going to be the next iPod
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   for them, though.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   That's the big problem.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   >> They're up against some big players in Samsung and Nokia.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   >> I just bought a Nokia N95.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   >> It's more to roll than Nokia than the big two.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   >> Well, you know, one thing that's one little bit of FUD out
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   there is my wife's trying to find a phone to go with her Mac
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   and everything she reads says, well, you can get the trio,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   but it's not great.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Really, the best one for it's going to be the iPhone.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   And just discounting every other phone if you already have a Mac,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   which then plays into that Apple way of thinking, which is,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   you know, the only good things that really work with our
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   products are our products.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   >> It's not true.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   I have to say, BlackBerry works fine.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   My Nokia sync's fine.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   >> You can pick up the missing sync, which will actually sync
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   most of the major phones with OS X applications.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   >> And one of the people complaining that even the trio
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   syncing doesn't work that well with the Mac that others work better.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   >> Well, no, that's just syncing is always a problem.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   >> Syncing is a horrible thing.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   >> But there are ways to-- I mean, does your active sync or whatever
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   they call it now in Vista work with Windows Mobile 5?
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Not very well.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   >> Uh-huh, yeah.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   >> Syncing is always a problem.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   >> Syncing stinks.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   >> Bill Gates heading into space.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Russian cosmonaut said.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   >> Yeah, no way.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   >> No way.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   He says that Charles Simone, he's up there with him right now.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   The current space tourist, Simone is a Microsoft program--
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   was a Microsoft programmer.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   >> Cosmonaut, you're-- >> Wait, wait, give me a chance.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   I gotta do the accent.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   >> Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   >> Really, John, I'm shocked.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   >> Cosmonaut's my timing's off today.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   >> For your-- your chitchkin says Charles says the Bill Gates
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   also preparing to visit space.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   So next time someone will be with Bill Gates, for me,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   this is biggest surprise of flight.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   >> Russians could say the letter V.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   >> Why would I say that?
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   >> You know, you do those accents so well.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   I mean, the main-- the two best was your Indian one.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Isn't any good, by the way.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   >> I like Russian.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   >> And your German-- and the Russian accent,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   I don't think it's that easy to do, because I've been trying to do it.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   I know people that have that accent and I can't copy it.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   >> Apparently.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   >> You're gonna have to teach it to me.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   >> Hochin Horosho.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Apparently Gates visited Star City just a couple of months ago.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   The cosmonaut training center.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   >> It's a buy it.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   >> Actually, to sell Vista.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   >> There's no way-- I blogged this, by the way,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   and you can check it out to work.org/blog, but--
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   >> Where's the--
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   >> But anyway, I wrote that I don't believe there's any chance in tarnation,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   as it were, that Gates would ever do this.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   It's not his style.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   It's not his style to waste money like that.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   He's a kind of a-- you know, he's a guy who doesn't like to be that way.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   He doesn't like limos.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   He doesn't-- he's--
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   >> Hey, you know what?
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   I think it's gonna--
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   >> He doesn't have a yacht.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   He doesn't use any--
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   >> He doesn't use any--
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   >> John, John, John, coach.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   >> This is the best midlife crisis ever.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Forget the sports car.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   Forget the bogus 482-foot yacht.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   He's basically just looking at all these schmucks with a billion dollars
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   that are peeing away their money and just going,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   "You know what?
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   A quick $20 million trip to the space.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   I'm good."
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   >> Russian rocket to red.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   >> Russian rocket to buy a chunk of a, you know, launch company.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   >> Will he board a trustees?
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Will the stockholders let him?
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   >> That's the other question I had.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   >> He won't go until he steps down from the microso.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   >> Yeah, it's his retirement.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   >> The stockholders cannot let a guy like Bill Gates is Microsoft.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Do this kind of a joyride.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   It's just too--
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   I mean, I think that if you did this, that's on it.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   It's probably a risky trip.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   >> I think with 30 billion in the bank, he can figure out a way to, you know,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   absolve himself of fiduciary responsibility of the stockholders.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   >> I don't think it's that.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   I think they'll just beat him up or something.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   They'll just tie him in.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   >> Who cares?
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   >> Why is everybody so interested in now or so positive about these guys
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   throwing away money like this on these ridiculous trips, which are meaningless?
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   >> Well, you know, I think it's better than some of the other ridiculous.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   I mean, first of all, if you got the money, you know, it's your right to spend it, you know, but the thing about this way--
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   >> Oh, there's no social responsibility anymore in the United States or anyplace else, apparently, listening to you.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   >> Well, Leo, by the way, exactly has your opinion, so you should think about that for a minute.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   >> I have it.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   First of all, I haven't finished what I was saying.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   >> Gates is giving away more money than anybody else in the history of the planet.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   >> Exactly.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   I mean, Gates basically, if anybody deserves a quick 20 million shot in this space, it's Gates.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   Look at the amount of money he's giving.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   He's basically stamping out entire forms of disease.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   >> What disease has he stamped out?
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   >> Oh, gosh.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Give me a moment.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   I'll give you a favor, everyone.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   >> He hasn't stamped anything out, but he's planning to stamp out AIDS and effort.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   >> Yeah, at least he's trying to--
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   >> Compared, yeah.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   I mean, John, yeah, you know, people waste money constantly around the world, you know, ridiculous yachts, pathetic homes, you know, stupid efforts.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   But, you know, if Gates wants to go to the moon, I mean, considering what he's trying to do in the--
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   >> Is it going to the moon or is it going to the international space station or is he just going into orbit?
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   >> I was just kidding.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   >> Well, you know, they say these people are going into space and half the time they're just going up on a suborbital flight and getting weightless and coming down.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   And that's not going into space.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   >> Some money is still up to me, so--
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   >> No, they're going to the space station.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   >> Okay, they're going to the space station.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   That's for 20--
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   >> I said moon by accident.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   >> For 20--
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   >> For 20 million, you should at least get to stay in a three by four cubicle and pee into a bag for 20 million.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   >> Yeah, that's all there's something funny about that.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   >> That's all there's something funny about that.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   >> The powder, neapolitan ice cream.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   >> Yeah, and the 25 million dollars would be, you know, crap it in your own pant.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   >> Do you-- the honest question, do you think he passed the medical to get up there?
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   >> Gates?
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   >> Yeah, Simone you can't, I imagine Bill can.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   >> I think he has some low blood pressure.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   >> I think he has some low blood pressure.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   >> Simone is a little more athletic.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   You know, Bill's not, you know, in--
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   >> I mean, go off the level of that.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   >> He can jump over a chair.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   >> Is that the test?
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   >> And he's certainly sainer than the astronaut lady who tried to shoot her boyfriend.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   >> That's true.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   >> But he's got the diapers to prove it.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Can you, can he still jump, remember that he used to do that Patrick?
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   He would jump over a chair from a standing start.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   >> I wonder if you can still do this.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   >> Yeah, I mean, I look at this way, if Gates needs to get healthy to go--
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   >> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   >> --to go have his face.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   >> Good point.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   >> He's gonna call up Chris Carmichael.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Carmichael's gonna recommend, you know, he's gonna buy a training team.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   You know, I don't be the fittest bazillionaire on the planet.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   >> Well, it just always hits me when you hear about these people buying the rain to space.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Like, you have to be in pretty good medical condition to go up there.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   And not like you just need to have the money.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   I mean, that's no easy thing to do.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   It's pretty hard on him.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   >> Holy sucks.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   You know, you've been up in one of those blue angels right now.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   >> He passed out.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   We got video to bring.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   >> Well, I think it's gonna happen.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   That's it.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   I'll put money on it.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   >> Paul Graham, the man who began the Fad for Bayesian Filters in the spam, he's really,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   I think a very bright guy, says, Microsoft's dead.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   He now works for Yahoo, by the way.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   >> Oh, well, now Bill doesn't have to worry about it.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   >> Doesn't have to worry.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   >> A few days ago, says Paul, I suddenly realized Microsoft was dead.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   It happens when he was talking to a young startup.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   >> When he was kicking the corpse.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   >> He is.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   And he has four reasons why Microsoft's dead.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   You want to hear him?
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Sure.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   What killed Microsoft?
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Number one, Google.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   There can only be one big man in town.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   They're clearly at Google's the most dangerous company now by far, both the good and bad senses
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   of the word Microsoft can at best limp along afterwards.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   Number two?
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Someone like Paul Harvey there.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Do it as Paul Harvey.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   >> Page two.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   >> Page two.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   >> Page two.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Hello, Americans, stand by far.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   >> Here's a...
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   >> Number two, Ajax, of all things, which ironically is a piece.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   >> We all laugh at that one.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   >> Well, here's, you know.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   >> He means the cleanser.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   >> Right.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   Mr. Clean.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   No, when he's saying is that web services have become so good that desktop applications
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   don't make sense anymore.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   >> I hate that statement.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   >> Everything on the web, because everybody's always connected all the time.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   >> Hello.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   >> It's the bell again.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   >> Stupid.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   It's like the whole Web 2.0 is coming next week.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   >> It'll be here.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   >> We're starting Roger with a camera to just go off on it.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   >> Lock them.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   >> I've been using Google spreadsheet for work for some things, and it's really limited still.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   You can make it work, but it does not do the things that you can do in Excel or even open office.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   So they are not ready to move everything on the web.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   >> No, it's ridiculous.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   That thing, we're 20 years away from what that does.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   >> And your six-hour flight on New York, what are you going to do?
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Play games on your laptop.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   >> No, they go.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   >> And I was glad.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   >> Well, you could probably download most of the stuff, including like, you know, how many people...
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   >> Well, and you're going to have broadband on planes anyway.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   >> But now I was playing with Ajax, something on it.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Some Ajax thing the other day, and I was, but you have people who have too carried away
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   so it had a drop down and then a slide over, and then if you drop down and you didn't move
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   the mouse fast enough, it popped back up.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   >> Websites are like those old magician tricks now with the boxes, the slide and doors open.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   >> It's ridiculous.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   It's crappy.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   >> Third-cause broadband internet.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   Anyone who cares can have fast internet access now, by the way, even on airplanes, that's coming any minute now.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   And what are you laughing at?
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   >> Yeah, just like the Powerjack and every seat.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   >> Hey, no, what happens to the Powerjack? >> Yes, it was great.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   >> You know, we mentioned that story about the broadband on airplanes on Buzz out loud,
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   and everybody wrote in from Europe saying, "Yeah, we had that on Loufton's.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   I used it and then they took it away because they couldn't make any money on it."
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   >> So enjoy it while you can.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   >> Last nail in the coffin, Apple.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   >> Thanks to OS X, Apple came back from the dead in a way that's extremely rare in technology.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   Their victory is so complete, says Paul Graham.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   I'm now surprised when I come across a computer running Windows.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   >> Oh, that's real.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   That's the biggest.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   >> There's one over there.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   >> Apple came back from the dead because of the iPod.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Well, okay, the Mac first the iMac, but the iPod's what's made them relatively.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   >> Yeah, I had to make the stock rocket.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   >> He says, "I'm glad Microsoft is dead."
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   They were like Nero or Commodus, evil in the way only inherited power can make you.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Remember Microsoft Monopoly?
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   It didn't begin with Microsoft.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   They got it from IBM.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   >> So IBM by all this logic is dead as well.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   >> Well, IBM's been dead for a year.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   >> Microsoft asking for work.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   They told him to shove it.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   And so now he went to Yahoo and gave this a reward.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   Okay, it makes sense.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   >> Here's how he suggests Microsoft could revive itself.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Are you interested?
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   >> I would just suggest one thing.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   At five years from now, Microsoft will be worth a hell of a lot more than Yahoo.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   >> It's only a technical death.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   It's not biological death.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   >> Resurrection is possible if Microsoft buys all the good Web 2.0 startups.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   >> Wait for John again.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   >> Let's have a piece of one of them.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   >> He runs Y Combinator, however you pronounce that.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Y Combinator is the Yahoo startup, but Incubator.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   He says they could get substantially all of them for less than they'd have to pay for
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Facebook.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   It's just by everybody.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Number two, put them all in the building in Silicon Valley surrounded by lead shielding
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   to protect them from any contact with Redmond.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   I think we'd all agree with that, though.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   >> Yeah, because Redmond's really hasn't been making money for years.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   >> Oh, I don't know.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   I don't know if they're really--
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   >> They can squash creativity pretty quick, I guess.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   >> I'm not arguing that, but I'm just like, you know, with all due respect, most of the
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   websites are still looking around to be bought.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   That's the business model.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   >> There's not much else you can do.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   I mean, with Sarbanes Oxley, which is a destructive force that needs to be repealed, there's not
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   much else these companies can do.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   This has got to end the Sarbanes Oxley thing.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   >> Speaking of got to end, Tim O'Reilly says, "Unsability on the Internet.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   It has to end."
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   >> Shut up.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   >> Tim.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   >> A few, Tim.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   >> He's so funny.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   >> It's all began, of course, with Kathy Sierra.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   >> He should talk to Don Imus.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   >> Who was civility?
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   >> Civility.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   >> I got you a civility right here.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   >> That's a good point.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   >> Action Cooper wrote up that.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   Kathy Sierra is the blogger who was threatened with pretty nasty death threats and pictures.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   She decided to skip O'Reilly's e-tech conference in fear for her life.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   And this has kind of prompted -- you've seen mainstream media stories all over in every
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   venue.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   What's wrong?
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Why are people so rude online?
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   And O'Reilly wants to solve it with his blogger.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   >> I think we talked about this the other day.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   And I concluded they're not as rude as they used to be.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   I think things are really mellowed out compared to -- if you go back to the '80s when you were
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.800]   on one of the Usenet news groups or doing anything online that kind of unbelievable flaming
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:39.680]   that went on was nothing -- it was just way beyond it.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.520]   It was magnitudes worse than it is today.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.320]   >> I'll tell you where all the flaming is going on right now.
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.000]   People flaming Tim O'Reilly for this idea.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   >> People are maybe trying to stir it up.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   >> Well, I don't know.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.600]   The idea isn't such a bad idea.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.600]   Code of ethics for bloggers is fine.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.000]   It doesn't carry any legal weight or anything like that.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   >> It's not carry any legal.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.320]   >> It reminds me of what they did with the code of ethics for journalism back in what?
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.320]   The '50s or late '40s?
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:09.000]   >> The ethics for journalism has been co-opted by the New York Times for the sole purpose
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.800]   of promoting the New York Times.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:14.240]   And I can go -- I can give you -- don't get me started on this.
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.600]   >> But when it came out, it was a good thing at the time.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.600]   Don't you think so?
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.600]   >> This isn't exactly ethics, though.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:20.600]   This is more like --
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:21.600]   >> This is a -- yeah, I mean, this is --
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.600]   >> What's it calling?
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:23.600]   >> These are manners, right?
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.600]   Yeah, it's manners.
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.600]   Here, I'll read you a little bit of the first grad.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.600]   >> It's the difference between ethics.
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:27.600]   >> Rule number one.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.800]   Don't threaten to kill people because you disagree with their opinion.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:35.280]   We celebrate the blogosphere because it embraces Frank at open conversation.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.120]   >> This is very -- I think unicorn here.
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.120]   But Frank is --
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.120]   >> It's probably unicorn.
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.360]   >> -- does not have to mean lack of civility.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.520]   We present this blogger code of conduct --
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.520]   >> Code of conduct.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.520]   >> Code of conduct.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:46.520]   >> Code of conduct.
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:47.520]   >> I see the dolphins already.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.680]   >> In hopes that it creates a culture that encourages both personal expression and constructive
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.680]   conversation.
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:53.680]   >> We said the blogger --
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.680]   >> Well, I'm trying to use the word blogosphere the other day, and a friend corrected me,
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:57.800]   and I think he's right.
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.800]   It's blog-a-stand.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.240]   >> Yeah, according to this.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.480]   >> You step out that building, they'll blow you up.
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.600]   >> Number one, we take responsibility for our own words in the comments we allow on our
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:07.600]   blog.
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.600]   >> I think that's fine.
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.600]   >> That's fine.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.600]   >> Well, I don't know.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.520]   A lot of bloggers would not like to be held responsible for what other people say in the
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:14.520]   comments.
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:15.520]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:16.520]   >> No, you can't --
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.520]   >> You're not held responsible.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.520]   >> You should take responsibility for moderating the comments.
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:20.520]   >> Best you can.
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:21.520]   >> Yeah, moderate.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.520]   >> As best you can, but you can't --
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.520]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.320]   >> I mean, this stuff is very difficult to root out.
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:29.360]   Number two, we won't say anything online we wouldn't say in person.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.720]   >> Number three, good luck with that.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:37.240]   We connect privately before we respond publicly.
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.240]   I think that's not such a bad idea.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.240]   >> No, that's good policy.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.040]   >> Ideas for, well, it depends on whether you're trying to make a show or not.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.480]   >> I called George Bush before I published that blog post the other day.
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.480]   >> Did you?
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.480]   What do you say?
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.120]   >> Knock on that.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.520]   We connect -- let's see, when we believe --
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.520]   >> Bounce.
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:53.520]   >> Bounce.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:55.560]   >> And it's unfairly attacking another.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.040]   We take action.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.040]   That's a little scary.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.840]   >> It's a little bit mob mentality.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:03.760]   >> The blogger code of conduct has a little sheriff's badge where it says, this is the
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:04.760]   badge he's proposing.
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.760]   It's a little sheriff's badge that says, civility enforced.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:11.600]   And then there's a little firecracker where it says anything goes for blogs that don't
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.600]   want to do this.
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.160]   We do not allow anonymous comments.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.560]   >> Anything goes.
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.040]   >> Anything goes.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:20.560]   >> How can you not allow anonymous comments when people can fake an anonymous comment?
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.720]   >> I think that's a great idea.
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.160]   And I actually do that on most of my blogs.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.680]   I don't allow anonymous comments just to keep the spam down.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.320]   But I don't think that's something you should force people to do.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.400]   >> Well, he says -- >> You know whether the person Joe Smith --
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.400]   >> You can't prove it.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.160]   >> -- says he works for a Boeing.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.160]   >> Right.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.880]   >> And he's got an address, a hot mail, and he says he's Joe Smith at Boeing.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.840]   He's not an anonymous commenter, but in fact, he isn't an anonymous commenter.
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.560]   How do you stop that kind of anonymous?
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.080]   >> He said he always get an IP address.
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.080]   >> Well, no.
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.080]   >> And he's a child.
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.080]   >> Every single person.
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.080]   >> Every single person.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.080]   >> People can spoof that, of course.
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.200]   >> Yes, but -- >> We require commentators to supply a valid
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:56.400]   email address before they compost, though we allow commentators to identify themselves
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.840]   with an alias rather than the real name.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.400]   Well, I can tell you I get spam all the time.
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.640]   Now, spammers will sign up with a real email address.
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.640]   >> Oh, yeah, sure.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.760]   >> They'll get authenticated, and then they'll still fill you with spam.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.320]   >> Again, it's a nice speed bump, but it's not really going to stop any time.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.320]   >> That's long down.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.480]   >> Number six, we ignore the trolls.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.480]   >> That's just good policy.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.480]   Sure.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.480]   Don't feed the trolls.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:16.980]   >> We ignore the trolls.
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:17.980]   I don't know.
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:20.720]   >> It's like from Atlantis.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.720]   It's warning.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:29.140]   >> Well, how do you solve the -- I mean, on a serious note, how do you solve the fundamental
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:34.800]   issue, whether it's an email or whether it's anonymous blog postings of somebody receiving,
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.340]   you know, a serious harassment.
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:38.340]   >> And that's right.
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:41.540]   >> And Cassie Sierra, there's no question about it, but what do you do?
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:43.540]   >> Because -- >> Oh, yeah, it could be I if you got something
[00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:45.420]   like that going on, if it's bad.
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:49.460]   >> Yeah, I mean, she in fact says she pursued it with --
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:50.700]   >> Yeah, you have to do that.
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:56.120]   The real world of celebrities offline, people who actually walk around and flesh in blood,
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.680]   they have to hire security guards.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:02.840]   You know, if you're a TV anchor or a star in sports or Hollywood, you got to have security.
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.600]   That's just the way it is.
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.280]   >> If you're actually not good, but you got to have security.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:08.280]   >> That's right.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:12.580]   I think this is a fine idea because it focuses the debate and gets people talking about it.
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:16.720]   And some people who are just getting into blogging who really don't understand what
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:20.220]   they're getting themselves into can look at this and find out, "Oh, these things could
[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:21.220]   happen.
[00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.920]   Okay, now I know some basic, like, don't feed the troll sort of stuff."
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.580]   But I don't think it's really going to change anything.
[00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:31.940]   I think the fundamental thing is that people have to learn as we pointed out, and we have
[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:36.260]   on the internet over the years, how to deal with the sort of anonymous community.
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:40.140]   Because when you have that anonymity, even if you're logged in with your email address,
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.540]   you have that feeling of anonymity that you can say anything.
[00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:48.820]   I don't know how many times people have emailed me these horrible, flaming, hate-filled emails.
[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:51.260]   All I do is write them back and say, "Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.260]   I upset you.
[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:53.260]   Here's why I said that."
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.260]   They write back, "Apologize you."
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.380]   Because they realize, "Oh, you're a real person on the other end."
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:59.100]   >> No, I have that same experience.
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:03.220]   I get these guys not always, but you don't like it.
[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:06.020]   But you get these crazy comments from somebody and say, "Wait a minute.
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:09.740]   I didn't even, you know, I think you took it the wrong way because I meant to say this."
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:13.540]   And then the guys, first, he's like a lion in the second email, he gave them his pussy
[00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:14.540]   cat.
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:15.540]   >> Usually.
[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:16.540]   >> Oh, thanks.
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:17.540]   Well, thanks.
[00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:19.540]   And the first thing, they fall over, so thanking you for responding.
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:22.020]   I responded like Leo.
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:24.460]   I responded like 99% of my email.
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:27.820]   And so people were always shocked by that because I think they'd expect to send me some
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:28.820]   nasty note.
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:31.860]   And I'm not going to read it or it's going to be read by some secretary, which I don't
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:32.860]   have.
[00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:35.060]   And I just read it myself.
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:36.060]   I've got nothing else.
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:37.860]   I really don't have much of a life.
[00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:39.860]   >> I just didn't read email.
[00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:41.940]   >> I got to train those chickens to read it.
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.140]   >> I think it is a good idea.
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.140]   >> I agree with you.
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:47.300]   I think it's a good idea to raise the conversation, at least say, we care a little bit about
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.300]   this.
[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:49.780]   There's obviously nothing you're going to be able to do about it.
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:52.180]   But it's good to say you care.
[00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.020]   Webby award nominations are out.
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:55.860]   Did anybody, has anybody read them?
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:57.380]   >> Does anybody care?
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:00.820]   >> There are over 100 nominees.
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:02.220]   There are so many categories.
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:04.540]   It looks like a phone book.
[00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:05.740]   >> I hope they all win twice.
[00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:08.420]   >> Wow, it must be the phone book in Greenville, Illinois then.
[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:09.420]   >> It's well.
[00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:10.420]   It's not small.
[00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:15.060]   >> They were very aggressive this year because I got solicited to enter the devorect.org/blog
[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.820]   uncensored website.
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.180]   And I told them I wasn't interested.
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:20.060]   This thing is not an award winner.
[00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:22.140]   And to be honest about it.
[00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:26.060]   Because I've been a judge and enough competitions to know what's a winner in terms of winning
[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:27.660]   something like that and what's not.
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.940]   And I wasn't about to go ahead and try anyway, she says.
[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:32.500]   You know, maybe you never know.
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:33.500]   >> You never know.
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:34.500]   >> It's an honor just to be nominated.
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.500]   >> It's an honor just to enter.
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.500]   >> But the thing is, of course, it's a fee.
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:39.500]   It's a fee-based.
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.140]   >> Oh, it's a sales deal.
[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.900]   >> And then you come to the dinner deal.
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.180]   >> Yeah, and then, you know, I mean, that's why there's so many.
[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:48.380]   I mean, wine competitions are the same way.
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:51.940]   All these wine competitions that are all over the place are all with rare exceptions.
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:52.940]   There's a couple that aren't.
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:53.940]   But most of them are fee-based.
[00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:56.500]   So you pay 100 bucks and you have to enter 2K.
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.020]   You have to bring in two cases of the wine you've entered.
[00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:01.700]   And I've talked to some PR people in the wine industry about this.
[00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:06.420]   Hey, it's an investment of 200 bucks or an investment of 100 bucks in a couple of cases
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:07.420]   of wine.
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:09.500]   You win, you win, you lose, you lose what they're going to make.
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:13.820]   If you win, it's worth way more than $100 in publicity.
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:16.340]   And so that's kind of the thinking with these competitions.
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:21.060]   I'm just like lists as everyone listens to me, you know, knows that I complain about
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:22.620]   lists.
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:23.620]   This is the same thing.
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:24.620]   >> Do you want to hear the categories?
[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:25.620]   Actually, we don't have time.
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:27.300]   It's only a four-hour podcast.
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:32.860]   I mean, it is every part, every, you know, activism, art, associations, automotive banking
[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:37.860]   beauty, best copy, best home, best navigation, best practices, best use of animation, best
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:40.940]   use of video, best visual design, best blog.
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:43.660]   I mean, that's just the use of Ajax, please.
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:45.700]   >> Did you, you on the list, Leo?
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:46.700]   >> Is there what?
[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:47.700]   >> The Twitter website.
[00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:48.700]   >> No, there are.
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.900]   There's one podcast category.
[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:57.020]   The nominated podcasts are the Guardian Unlimited, NPR Scientific American, Spout and the Onion,
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:58.780]   all of which I don't know, Spout, but all the rest.
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:01.980]   >> Spout's a film podcast I hadn't heard of until they, I just read the nominations.
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.140]   >> I'd agree with the rest of them.
[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:04.140]   I mean, the rest of them are pretty good.
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:05.140]   >> Is the other awards still pretty?
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:06.140]   >> You're not nominated.
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:07.140]   >> San Francisco-centric.
[00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:10.340]   >> No, this is in New York now.
[00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:11.340]   >> It's in New York?
[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:12.340]   >> Yeah, I think they moved it up.
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:16.620]   >> Do they have a category for best awards and sciences?
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.100]   >> Webby's not what's standing.
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:23.260]   I would like to make mention of the fact that in this month's In-Flight magazine for Southwest
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:28.180]   Airlines, they had the listing of the top 10 podcasts of in various categories.
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:30.380]   >> Guess who was on tech?
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:34.380]   >> The number one tech podcast, according to this magazine, which is a pretty substantial
[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:36.620]   publication, was Guess What?
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:37.620]   >> Really?
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:39.620]   I'd give it a buzz out loud.
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:40.620]   >> Aw, shucks.
[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:42.620]   >> Oh, making me turn red over here.
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.620]   >> Actually, it's not used to girls out loud.
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:45.620]   >> Yeah, I know.
[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:46.620]   >> That's why I'm turning red.
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:47.620]   >> I'm angry.
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:49.740]   >> You're just there for, you know, to keep them apart.
[00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:50.740]   I'm token, so yeah.
[00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:51.740]   >> Right.
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.740]   >> It might be a small one coming back by the way.
[00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:54.740]   >> So what can you say?
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:56.260]   >> What is Molly coming back by the way?
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:58.620]   >> Molly, I just saw her actually the other day.
[00:31:58.620 --> 00:31:59.620]   She's doing very well.
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:02.980]   If anybody doesn't know, Molly Wood is one of the co-hosts of Buzz out loud who just had
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:08.820]   a baby about a month ago, and she will be back to work for good in June.
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:11.340]   Around the time the iPhone comes out, she'll come back.
[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:15.660]   And then she's going to try to start calling in for the podcast before then, when she gets
[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:16.660]   time.
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:18.140]   >> So she had a boy or girl?
[00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:19.140]   >> She had a boy.
[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:20.140]   >> Great.
[00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:22.940]   >> And he's already got his order in for an iPhone.
[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:25.620]   >> Yeah, like the other million people.
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.260]   >> Like the millions of people.
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:30.620]   >> My 15-year-old daughter has ordered me to give her an iPhone.
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:33.180]   It's kind of like getting an order in.
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:34.660]   Let's see, what else is going on?
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:38.620]   Nielsen says they're going to follow TV viewers out of the house and into the streets.
[00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:45.180]   >> It's about time ratings for TV viewing in bars, hotels, gyms, offices, dorms.
[00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:49.420]   >> They added dorms earlier this year, and it revolutionized cable rate.
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:50.420]   >> Does it change the numbers?
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:52.100]   >> Is that what Henry tells us about that?
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.100]   >> Hugely.
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:54.100]   >> Hugely.
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:57.300]   Because people in dorms watch completely different things than old retired people in
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:58.300]   trailer parks.
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:32:59.300]   >> Mm-hmm.
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:03.540]   >> And so all kinds of the younger demo cable networks now are raising their rates and
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.180]   realizing they actually have an audience.
[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:06.940]   >> I think they did that after.
[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:08.740]   >> Yeah, it's your TV.
[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:09.740]   >> Yeah.
[00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:10.740]   >> Mm-hmm.
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:11.740]   >> Because they were all dorms.
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:12.740]   >> We were totally, we were the dorm channel, I believe.
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:16.260]   >> A lot of people don't realize that the dorms were not rated for years and years.
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:17.660]   >> I didn't know that until now.
[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:20.260]   >> They never rated anything, bars, hotels.
[00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:21.260]   >> Nope.
[00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.260]   >> Nothing but houses.
[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:23.260]   >> That's crazy.
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:27.940]   >> There's a couple really good websites that break down advertising splits and break
[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:31.020]   down the whole Nielsen rating system.
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:34.660]   And it's some of the most depressing reading you'll ever do when you realize it's exactly
[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.220]   how restricted and how controlled those are.
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.660]   >> Wonder when they're going to start monitoring showers.
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:41.460]   >> Shower televisions.
[00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:48.900]   >> A geek squad repair member is being accused of videotaping one of his clients while she
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:50.900]   was in the shower.
[00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:51.900]   >> Whoops.
[00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:57.500]   >> Best buys being sued because apparently the geek squad guy came in.
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:01.540]   He started work on the computer, then asked to use the bathroom.
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:05.340]   Later, the lady of the house showered in the same bathroom when she stepped out of the
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:09.740]   stall she noticed a cell phone propped up on the sink.
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:13.340]   When she returned the phone was gone.
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:14.420]   She removed the memory chip.
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:18.060]   She found a later remove the memory chip, took it to the Verizon store where they watched
[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:22.220]   the guy set up the camera and then leave the room.
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:24.100]   >> How did he know she was going to take a shower?
[00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:25.100]   >> Knitwit.
[00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:28.540]   >> Maybe told her she stinks and she took the hint.
[00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:29.540]   I don't know.
[00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:32.180]   >> Just be careful next time you invite the geek squad.
[00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:34.620]   >> Also how is she going to assume if she stole his memory card?
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:36.580]   >> Oh, that's a good point.
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:37.580]   That's a good point.
[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:40.580]   >> Really justice right there.
[00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:43.900]   He may get off on a technicality.
[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:44.900]   A British man is --
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:45.900]   >> Miffed kick.
[00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:49.140]   >> This is -- we're getting on the bottom of the barrel now.
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:50.140]   >> What a scumbag.
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:51.940]   >> Isn't that creepy?
[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:52.940]   We're getting to the bottom of the barrel.
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:54.140]   These are the weird stories.
[00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:57.500]   British man has met and married a 22-year-old woman after.
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:01.980]   He says dreaming of her phone number and then sending her a text message.
[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:05.100]   David Brown, 24 woke up one morning after a night out with friends.
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.980]   He had a telephone number running through his head.
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:12.300]   He decided to send her a text message saying did I meet you last night?
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:16.300]   Random recipient Michelle Kitzen was wary and confused at first but decided to reply.
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:20.340]   They began exchanging messages and fell in love and now they're getting married.
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:21.700]   >> Best pickup line I've ever heard.
[00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:23.180]   He found her on the Internet somehow.
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:24.740]   He found her my space page.
[00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:26.580]   >> I dreamt of you.
[00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:28.540]   >> Anybody believe that?
[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:29.780]   >> I got a bridge I'll say.
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:33.220]   >> I fell asleep next to the phone book.
[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:35.220]   Her name was in it.
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:41.460]   Samsung says they're going to make a combo HD DVD Blu-ray player like LG is making.
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.140]   >> This has a lot of potential.
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.660]   >> It'll have the full and directed.
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:47.460]   >> By the way, the joke is that Samsung was the first one to announce that they were going
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:52.380]   to do this way back when if you remember Twit number three or whatever and then they bailed
[00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:54.380]   out and now they're playing ketchup.
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:58.300]   >> I don't think they were bailed out so much as Sony told them they weren't going to do
[00:35:58.300 --> 00:35:59.300]   it.
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:00.300]   >> No, I think that's true too.
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:02.740]   But I think Samsung's got a lot of marketing problems.
[00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:04.420]   Samsung's lost.
[00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:11.620]   One of its main marketing guy, Peter Wheatfall, about a year or a half ago who went to Circuit
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:16.460]   City and then they lost one of their other top marketing guy who went to Westinghouse
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:18.780]   to do the LCDs there.
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:23.660]   I think it's a rudderless ship and people inside kind of in and around the company tell
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:28.380]   me that what happened was it was just a political thing and the company's really got some issues
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:29.380]   I think.
[00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:31.020]   >> It'll be good news for consumers though.
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:32.900]   Two of these prices have to drop.
[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:35.900]   LG's charging $1,200 for its dual player.
[00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:38.500]   >> And the Samsung one's supposed to have full functionality, right?
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.100]   >> Yeah, it's low-rate and reactive.
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:41.620]   >> Well, there's two things.
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:46.380]   And one that's actually streating for a lot closer to 850 if you shop around carefully.
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:49.300]   Two, I mean, it actually does a pretty good job.
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:53.740]   If you can give up not having menus, it does a pretty good job with HD content.
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:37:00.340]   But with the lower price on HD and Blu-ray players or an HD plus a PS3, PS3 is a fantastic
[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:02.100]   Blu-ray disc player.
[00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:04.100]   There's just not much point right now for the-
[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:05.420]   >> Probably that's crazy.
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:08.460]   You could get Xbox and PlayStation 3 almost.
[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:09.460]   >> Yeah.
[00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:13.100]   >> Well, Aaron just did a great roundup for PC Magazine of all the second generation players.
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:16.860]   And now he's actually putting together a third one for all the third generation players.
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:20.500]   >> So, Toshiba's now down to 300 bucks for the second generation.
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.220]   Is that a decent, does he like that one?
[00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:24.020]   >> Yeah, it's a pretty solid player.
[00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:25.980]   >> 300 bucks is a, you know, now you're talking.
[00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:31.180]   Does anybody modded the PS3 to accept the Xbox 360 external HD DVD drive?
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:32.020]   >> No.
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:34.460]   >> That's going to be problematic.
[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:36.020]   >> Yeah, it's a challenge.
[00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:37.540]   >> Well, so much isn't software.
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:39.380]   Don't you think that that would be a tough thing?
[00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:40.780]   >> And they're probably right.
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:46.780]   >> You'd have to create an application that could play the HD content on the PS3.
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:47.780]   >> Right.
[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:50.460]   >> And I don't think anybody's, you know, I think we're a long way from it because it's
[00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:55.220]   pretty easy to take that HD drive and buy third party software.
[00:37:55.220 --> 00:38:00.420]   Some of which is better than others to play the, well, speaking of content, speaking of
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:03.980]   which, we've seen the first key revocation now on Win DVD.
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:08.700]   That was the software most people believe was being used to crack the AACS high, high
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:09.700]   def disk.
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:13.420]   >> And it ends up being a moot point because they've got to work around already.
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:14.420]   >> Already?
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:15.420]   >> Yeah.
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:16.420]   >> That's what I've been told.
[00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:17.420]   Yeah.
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:18.940]   >> Well, I think one of the reasons I think it's important is there was some speculation,
[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:20.740]   oh, they'll never do a key revocation.
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:22.540]   That'll never, you don't have to worry about that.
[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.980]   That'll probably never do a hardware key revocation.
[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:26.140]   >> Well, they may not need to.
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:30.900]   I mean, it's much more likely that you'd be using software to do this copying, right?
[00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:31.900]   >> Right.
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:34.760]   >> So, I mean, how are you going to use a hardware DVD player anyway?
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:37.560]   >> You know, so there's a workaround.
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.700]   >> You can get the digital out of it somehow.
[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:40.700]   >> Yeah, I suppose.
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:41.700]   Or you could use--
[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:43.820]   >> But you could speak Wang loose on it, you know.
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:47.220]   >> Bunny can break anything.
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:50.020]   >> So let's get to-- let's talk about Carl T. Rove.
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:52.620]   >> Yeah, here you go, Harry.
[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:55.220]   >> Those emails are not lost.
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:56.620]   They're just sitting in servers.
[00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:01.820]   >> Four years worth of email from White House Senior Advisor Carl Rove to the Republican
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:03.420]   National Committee disappeared.
[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:06.780]   It's being sought as part of the investigation into the Bush Administration.
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:09.180]   >> Actually, it may have gone to hundreds of different people.
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:14.660]   It was just on the National Committee's servers and using their email system.
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:15.940]   We don't know who they went to.
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:17.460]   >> So what was the email system?
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:18.460]   Was there a back end?
[00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:19.460]   Does anybody know?
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:26.020]   >> No, but I'm told that almost everybody in Washington uses Microsoft Outlook and Exchange.
[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:28.020]   And so it's probably pretty standard stuff.
[00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:29.020]   >> Who's the ISP?
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:30.020]   >> Who's the ISP?
[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:35.180]   >> I mean, it seems to me if you're going to do kind of a surreptitious outside the-- outside
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:41.260]   the purview kind of email system to keep people from snooping, which is what they were trying
[00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:45.620]   to do, or trying to keep you know, back channels, what it was, that you would use something non-standard
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:49.100]   that was even proprietary and you weren't back in anything, whatever.
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:53.060]   >> I think you're giving them a great deal of credit for being a lot more sophisticated
[00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:54.060]   than they are.
[00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:56.220]   >> The fact that they use the email in the first place.
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:57.220]   >> It should ask me.
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:02.580]   >> Senator Leahy of Vermont, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said, "You can't erase
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:04.700]   emails, not today."
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:05.700]   This is on the Senate floor.
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:07.820]   He says, "They've gone through too many experts."
[00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:09.340]   And you know, he sounded pretty good.
[00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.180]   Leahy has always been pretty good on tech issues.
[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:12.860]   He says, "Those emails are there.
[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:13.980]   They just don't want to produce them.
[00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:17.900]   It's like the infamous 18-minute gap in the Nixon White House tapes."
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:21.820]   >> Well, actually the Republican National Committee to their credit has admitted that
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:25.420]   they've now got forensic software going in looking for this stuff.
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:30.420]   What Carl Rovin's buddies obviously did, or somebody did for them, or somebody did accidentally,
[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:34.700]   who knows what the real story is, but all they did was delete it, which means they took
[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:36.100]   out the index.
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.700]   But the emails are all still there.
[00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.220]   >> Right, and rebuild it.
[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:43.620]   >> They're going to snoop around with forensic.
[00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:46.060]   We heard the same story about Ken Lay a few years ago.
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:47.060]   All his emails were gone.
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:48.060]   All they were there.
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:51.460]   Somebody had just gone through and "deleted" them, which means they're stuck in the server
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.620]   without an index.
[00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:58.540]   White House spokesman Dana Perino says, "We've been forthcoming, honest.
[00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:02.540]   We're trying to understand to the best of our ability the universe of the emails that
[00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:06.260]   were potentially lost, and we are taking steps to make sure we use the forensics that are
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:08.500]   available to retrieve any of those that are lost."
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:09.500]   I like the word "lost."
[00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:12.700]   >> Now, if you could do that with a valley girl voice, I think you'd have something.
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:14.700]   >> Senator Ted Stevens needs to help out.
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:16.700]   >> They just need a plunger in the tubes.
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:17.700]   >> He's stuck in the tubes.
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:18.700]   >> Yeah.
[00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:22.140]   >> Have you guys seen the story that Google's buying double click?
[00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:23.140]   >> Yeah.
[00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:24.660]   >> Three billion plus.
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:26.740]   So there were rumors this was going to happen.
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:27.740]   So is it officially?
[00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:28.740]   >> Yeah, it's done.
[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:33.100]   >> So is Google now officially evil?
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.740]   >> Or is double click good?
[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:37.340]   That's the other side.
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:41.140]   >> Well, as I was pointing out to somebody today, having come from the old media world,
[00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:44.580]   until Google's to the point where they can start to compete with the real big media
[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:49.460]   companies that make billions of dollars selling professional sports to other guys who watch
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:52.660]   it on television, they're still going to be a minor media company.
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:57.100]   They cannot get the kind of rate she gets for the Super Bowl, for the NCAA playoffs,
[00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.940]   for a single Tigerwood golf tournament.
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:02.220]   Until they get into that league, they're still just a little internet company.
[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:04.700]   I don't care what their capital market is.
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:08.940]   >> The 10 billion dollar internet advertising market doesn't compete with the $65 billion
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:10.980]   United States television advertising market?
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:11.980]   >> Nuzzin' to even begin.
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:16.900]   And you add the international television market, the internet market starts to look like a
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:19.300]   little pee way over on the edge of the dinner table.
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:21.740]   >> You don't think it could become as big in a few years?
[00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:25.300]   >> Not unless they control video because we all know that ultimately that's where the
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:26.300]   money is.
[00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:31.100]   The money is in video, whether it's sports, whether it's movies, whether it's entertainment.
[00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:32.580]   >> When Google's trying to get into it.
[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:37.060]   >> And if Google can't sell the ads on all the video on the internet, like they can around
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:38.620]   text, then they're just a little internet.
[00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:40.820]   >> They're selling on Darshan Direct TV though.
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:44.700]   >> Yeah, but they're not selling spots into the Super Bowl.
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:45.700]   >> Yeah.
[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:47.420]   >> Or the typical old soccer game.
[00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:48.420]   >> Well, no, this beer bottle.
[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:50.220]   >> I'm not saying they can't get there.
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:53.460]   I'm just saying they're still a small company until they do get there.
[00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:55.700]   >> I was just trying to make a blogosphere joke.
[00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:56.700]   >> That's a good one.
[00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:58.180]   >> Blogger stand, please.
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:42:59.900]   >> Blogger stand.
[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:02.940]   >> Recording Industry Association of America and the motion pictures.
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:04.500]   >> Wait, wait, wait, let's get back to this.
[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:06.100]   >> Google double click, you got more?
[00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:10.300]   >> Well, I'm thinking, how come they couldn't replicate what double click was doing in the
[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:11.300]   first place?
[00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:16.780]   I didn't think that their technology was so outstanding that we had to spend $3 billion
[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:18.380]   in a make by decision to try.
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:20.380]   >> Is it worth twice what YouTube's been on?
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:23.460]   >> Actually, I think in this case it's purchasing the relationships.
[00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:24.460]   >> That's what I was trying to do.
[00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:26.820]   >> I was just going to say, they're buying market share, which is what you always do if
[00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:28.460]   you're trying to build a monopoly in America.
[00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:30.460]   >> Buy on clients.
[00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:33.260]   >> If you're an airline, you buy the other airline and take their customers.
[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:34.260]   >> Period.
[00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:38.460]   >> So they're telling me, which I'm not going to disagree with, but what you're telling
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:46.460]   me in a nutshell is, or an egg shell as it were, is that Google can see actually deciding
[00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:52.060]   to compete with a company like DoubleClick and maybe take a few years to beat them down,
[00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:53.260]   but instead just buy them out.
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:57.500]   >> Yeah, why bother when you've got that big barn of cash, you just go shovel some into
[00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.500]   the back of a truck and go buy DoubleClick?
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:00.500]   >> Yeah.
[00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:02.300]   >> It's all funny money from Google's point of view.
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:03.700]   >> Don't they kind of have to spend it?
[00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:05.420]   I mean, what are they going to do with it?
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:06.420]   >> Yeah.
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:08.180]   >> It's not worth anything unless they spend it.
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:09.180]   >> Buy the Twit podcast.
[00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:12.020]   >> We're for sale at the rate price.
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:13.020]   >> $1 billion.
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:14.020]   >> $1 billion.
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:15.020]   >> Right.
[00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:17.820]   >> That'll go a long way in Petaloo.
[00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:19.140]   >> I sure will.
[00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:20.140]   That's a lot of chicken.
[00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:21.900]   You can buy an entire trailer park for that.
[00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:24.100]   >> A lot of little T-Rex is running around.
[00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:28.540]   >> Leo, the port butter and egg festival brought to you by Twits.
[00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:32.900]   >> I'm referring to the fact that it's kind of interesting.
[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:37.500]   Paleontologists have been able to harvest actual protein from a T-Rex bone, a million
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.020]   year old T-Rex bone and analyze it.
[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:43.100]   And it turns out it's very similar to chicken protein.
[00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:44.780]   >> I read that story.
[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:46.980]   My first thought was how cool is that?
[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:52.180]   My second thought was just the whole moment in the second Jurassic Park will be where,
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:53.180]   "Oh, yeah, it's neat."
[00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:55.620]   Then it comes with the killing and the screaming and the fighting.
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:58.140]   >> First thing you want to know, they've already decided, I think, that many of these
[00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:01.140]   dinosaurs, including perhaps the T-Rex, had feathers.
[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:04.380]   >> Yeah, there's some thought to that.
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:06.340]   >> So it's like a giant chicken.
[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:07.340]   >> It's a big chicken.
[00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:08.820]   >> So now it's a giant chicken.
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:10.900]   It must let you know the eggs must have been.
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:12.260]   I mean, you could feed a regimen.
[00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:13.260]   >> Oh, they were huge.
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:14.260]   Well, we've seen the eggs.
[00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:15.260]   >> Tasty.
[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:16.260]   >> Diasur eggs are gigantic, you bet.
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:20.580]   >> I think of the size of Stovu'd have to have to griddle one of those, baby.
[00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:23.580]   >> The Colonel had a big challenge back in those days.
[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:24.580]   >> No way.
[00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:26.380]   It's not the hole in the side of it.
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:28.260]   It's the aim of flame with thrower at it.
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.500]   Everybody gets a hard-boiled in the shell egg.
[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.500]   When they suck eggs, they suck eggs.
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:35.140]   >> Well, talk about predators.
[00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:39.580]   I grew up in the country and you don't want to be a grasshopper in the chicken lot.
[00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:40.580]   They last about two seconds.
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:41.820]   >> That's not an aphorism.
[00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:42.820]   That's literally true.
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:43.820]   >> That's literally true.
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:45.340]   Maybe think about that for a second.
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:47.540]   >> No, no, you don't want to think about it.
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:49.180]   I got to put that on Jiku.
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:53.300]   You don't want to be a grasshopper in the chicken.
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:54.300]   >> Is it Jiku?
[00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:55.300]   Is that how it's pronounced?
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:56.300]   >> Jiku, yeah.
[00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:58.340]   >> Not haiku or yaku or yaku or jaku or--
[00:45:58.340 --> 00:45:59.340]   >> It's not Spanish.
[00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:00.340]   >> It's chippinish.
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:01.340]   >> They're from Finland.
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:04.260]   >> So it's juiced, but they pronounce it juiced instead of joust.
[00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:05.260]   >> No, it's haiku.
[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:07.100]   >> It's jiku, I believe.
[00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:08.100]   >> Okay.
[00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:11.100]   >> According to the founders, it's pronounced like haiku with a J. Of course, that doesn't
[00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:12.100]   really answer anything.
[00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:13.100]   >> Which J?
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:15.100]   >> How do they pronounce haiku?
[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.100]   >> I pronounce haiku.
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:17.100]   >> Haiku with a J.
[00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:19.740]   >> You know, like you have like hefe haiku.
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:23.660]   >> Now, I've forgotten the aphorism and I'm never going to get a chippinish.
[00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:26.820]   You don't want to be a grasshopper in the chicken lot.
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:29.700]   >> Okay, that's going to be the name of the show.
[00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:34.820]   >> Today the RIA, not today, someday, couple of days ago, the R I'm just reading, the RIA
[00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:42.060]   and MPAA lobbied legislators for permission to lie and steal and cheat state of California,
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:48.420]   apparently, considering a bill, a privacy law banning the use of false statements, pretexting,
[00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:52.660]   particularly, and other misleading practices to get personal information.
[00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:57.380]   >> Yeah, they're asking for a stay that they will be allowed to pretext.
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:58.380]   >> We want to waver.
[00:46:58.380 --> 00:46:59.380]   We want to be able to do that.
[00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:02.420]   >> Yeah, but they promise they wouldn't use it for anything bad.
[00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:04.700]   >> Right, so you could trust them.
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:06.300]   >> Yeah, we all love the RIA.
[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:08.260]   >> RIA did.
[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:12.500]   Everybody see that little survey that a website did, it was mostly among technical types,
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:18.100]   but they had a sweet 16 for the worst corporations in America.
[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:23.500]   And the final four included, of course, three that you would guess right away, being Exxon,
[00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:25.420]   Walmart, and Halliburton.
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:28.420]   And guess who beat them all in the finals?
[00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:32.460]   The RIAA was the most hated corporation in America.
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:37.860]   They have displaced lawyers as the worst professional group in the country.
[00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:39.340]   That's how low they've gone.
[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:41.340]   So we trust them a lot.
[00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:42.340]   >> They're number one.
[00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:43.340]   >> Number one.
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:44.340]   >> I don't know.
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:47.820]   >> There's been some, like the RIAA gets beat on all over the place.
[00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:51.420]   For the best one I've read so far is a bunch of smaller, basically somebody did an article
[00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:56.980]   about a lot of smaller record companies that directly blame the RIAA and the RIAA's efforts
[00:47:56.980 --> 00:48:03.940]   on behalf of the major labels and the major distributors directly for just killing their
[00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:04.940]   business.
[00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:08.180]   >> Was it, is two small record store owners in New York wrote an editorial?
[00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:09.740]   I think it was, was it the New York Times?
[00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:10.740]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:11.740]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:12.740]   >> I read that too.
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:15.940]   >> They have done more to destroy the music business and all the crappy recordings in
[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:16.940]   history.
[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:21.700]   >> Well, what's amazing is that you realize pretty much 50% of all CD sales in the United
[00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:29.260]   States run through Walmart, Best Buy and Target, and 20 to 25% of that is Walmart.
[00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:33.740]   So they, Walmart especially, they do the loss leading on discs.
[00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:36.900]   They get cheap prices, get people in there to buy other stuff.
[00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:39.780]   And all of a sudden everybody else looks expensive by comparison.
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:41.580]   It's a really interesting conversation.
[00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:43.580]   I don't know.
[00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:44.580]   Sorry.
[00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:45.580]   >> No, I think it is.
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:46.580]   I think it's right.
[00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:48.780]   >> Sad because it's getting harder and harder to find.
[00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:51.660]   I mean, it's great because we have amoeba records here in town, but there's a real bummer
[00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:54.420]   to see tower records finally die.
[00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:55.420]   >> Thanks, Patrick.
[00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:56.420]   Nice buzz kill.
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:58.940]   >> Man, I think I just want to go home and get there.
[00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:01.900]   >> Hey, there's a new Windows DNS flaw.
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:02.900]   >> That's better.
[00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:07.340]   >> Targets Windows 2000 server, Windows Server 2003 systems through a hole in the domain name
[00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:08.340]   system.
[00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:09.340]   >> IPV6.
[00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:12.100]   >> Is it the way they support IPV6?
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:14.820]   >> I'm not sure.
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:16.420]   >> Is that a different flaw?
[00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:21.900]   >> It's a dangerous DNS server bug in Longhorn code 2 says Microsoft.
[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:26.100]   So it's not just 2000 and 2003.
[00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:28.340]   >> What a shocker.
[00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:31.700]   >> You know, Vista popped his cherry last week, the first critical update for a Vista
[00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:32.700]   on Tuesday.
[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:34.700]   >> What was that comment?
[00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:36.180]   >> We should do it.
[00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:37.180]   >> It was just rude.
[00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:38.180]   >> I could have called it.
[00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:39.180]   >> Take that out.
[00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:40.180]   >> I could have called it.
[00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:41.180]   Never mind.
[00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:42.180]   I better not say it.
[00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:43.180]   >> You got Don I, Mrs. Producer working for you again.
[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:45.020]   >> I don't have the nerve.
[00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:47.100]   >> I'm not a podcast that no one listens to.
[00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:49.660]   I still don't have the nerve to say that.
[00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:51.620]   >> I wanted to.
[00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:55.380]   >> I tried to, you know, DJ just got fired for making that the phrase that pays.
[00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:56.860]   I think somewhere in Massachusetts.
[00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:57.860]   >> Really?
[00:49:57.860 --> 00:49:58.860]   >> Yeah.
[00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:00.540]   So there's, there's resonance.
[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:01.540]   It's resonant.
[00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:02.540]   It's echoing.
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:04.100]   It's echoing all around.
[00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:05.100]   >> Resident evil.
[00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:06.100]   >> Yeah.
[00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:07.100]   >> Oh.
[00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:08.100]   >> All right.
[00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:09.100]   >> Oh, I hate it.
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:10.100]   >> I hate it.
[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:11.100]   >> Would you do that?
[00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:13.900]   >> Now that we've got it back on a high note.
[00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:17.540]   >> Tom Merritt is, you can hear that kind of humor and more on Buzz Out Loud.
[00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:19.100]   It's B-O-L.C-Net.com.
[00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:24.100]   It is, despite what Southwest Airlines says, the best tech podcast in the world.
[00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:25.100]   >> Oh, sure.
[00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:26.100]   >> And we heard every single day.
[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:27.100]   >> Thanks.
[00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:28.340]   And Leo will be on it on Monday.
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:29.340]   >> And I'll be on it on Monday.
[00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:30.540]   >> We'll make it twice as good.
[00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:32.420]   >> I like the old log rolling.
[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:33.420]   >> Yeah.
[00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:35.580]   We're keeping that alive, John.
[00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:37.940]   This is it.
[00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:39.580]   Harry Fuller, of course, is also at C-Net.
[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:40.580]   He is executive director.
[00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:43.820]   Are you, are you kind of in any way responsible for Buzz Out Loud or C-Net TV?
[00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:44.820]   >> I try not to be.
[00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:45.820]   >> He tries to disavow.
[00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:48.340]   >> I try to stay on the far way as I can.
[00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:50.700]   I'm mostly on the news end of the company.
[00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:51.700]   >> Got it.
[00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:53.260]   >> C-Net TV's looking good.
[00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:54.260]   >> I like it.
[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:55.260]   >> Yeah, thanks.
[00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:56.260]   >> It is.
[00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:57.260]   >> C-Net's back in the TV business, baby.
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:58.260]   >> Yeah.
[00:50:58.260 --> 00:50:59.260]   >> Where it started.
[00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:00.260]   Back to its roots.
[00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:01.260]   >> Yeah, it's funny, isn't it?
[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:02.260]   >> Yeah.
[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:03.260]   >> It was a third employee at C-Net.
[00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:04.260]   Did you know that?
[00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:05.260]   >> Wow.
[00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:06.260]   >> Yeah.
[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:07.260]   >> Well, I was at KPIX when I was running that station.
[00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:10.700]   We were the first station in the world to put C-Net television programming on television.
[00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:11.700]   >> Oh, that's right.
[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:12.700]   >> In '94.
[00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:14.780]   >> It was because it had your guy.
[00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:15.780]   >> What's that?
[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:18.020]   >> Well, no, they were using Kate Kelly at that time.
[00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:19.020]   >> Oh, it was Kate.
[00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:20.020]   >> Hart was from Channel 4.
[00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:21.020]   >> Richard Hart was from 4R.
[00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:22.020]   >> Yeah.
[00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:23.020]   >> Talk about an inside baseball moment.
[00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:25.020]   >> Very inside baseball moment.
[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:28.100]   >> Richard Hart, I think, is retired and living in Montana on his millions.
[00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:29.100]   >> Yeah.
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:30.100]   >> I think he got quite a bit of C-Net stuff.
[00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:31.500]   >> He got in on the right part of the--
[00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:33.140]   >> Well, I got in a little early.
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:37.220]   See, it was me, Halsey and Shelby, and Halsey and I just didn't hit it off.
[00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:38.660]   That's what I went to ZD.
[00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:40.660]   And the rest is toast.
[00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:41.660]   >> Toast.
[00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:42.660]   >> This was an empty bank account.
[00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:45.100]   >> You know, I think you did all right, Lee.
[00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:46.100]   >> All right.
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:48.820]   You know, having-- you've done all right over the last year.
[00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:49.900]   >> I got a check.
[00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:51.500]   I am holding in my hands.
[00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:52.500]   I wish you could see this.
[00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:53.740]   But you can hear it.
[00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:57.700]   A check from Cafe Press for $39.38.
[00:51:57.700 --> 00:51:58.700]   >> Wow.
[00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:02.700]   >> That's one month's revenue on Cafe-- that is what-- one month's revenue.
[00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:03.700]   >> You are--
[00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:07.740]   >> On a 100 times my yearly income from Eastmeats West.
[00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:11.500]   >> I think that's a record that $39 that anyone's ever made for.
[00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:15.940]   >> $39.38 on the Twitfongs.
[00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:16.940]   I don't know.
[00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:18.380]   Oh, thank you very much.
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:20.180]   JohnCeadahVorack.org/blog.
[00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:22.020]   Ladies and gentlemen, you may take another drink.
[00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:25.340]   In fact, down the whole bottle, because that's the last time you're going to hear that on
[00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:26.340]   this week's episode.
[00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:27.340]   You'll hear it next week.
[00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:28.340]   >> Of course.
[00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:29.500]   >> Of course you will.
[00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:30.740]   We couldn't do the show without John.
[00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:34.260]   And you know that Adam Curry won't listen unless John's on, so we have to have him on.
[00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:35.260]   >> Right.
[00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:36.260]   It's one extra listener.
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:38.100]   >> Everyone counts, John.
[00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:42.500]   Patrick Norton's at dltv, dl.tv.
[00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:44.700]   I was on that a couple of about a week ago.
[00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:45.700]   And now, thanks.
[00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:46.700]   >> Fine job.
[00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:47.700]   >> We did a tit for TAT.
[00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:48.700]   So that was the tit.
[00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:54.060]   And the tat is, you're coming to my show, The Lab with Leo in May in Vancouver.
[00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:57.180]   >> Which reminds me, I have to apply for a fresh passport.
[00:52:57.180 --> 00:52:58.700]   >> Oh, it may be a little late.
[00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:00.300]   We may be seeing you in July.
[00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:04.020]   >> Oh, actually, if you-- Patrick, give me a call and I tell you it's something you
[00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:06.620]   shouldn't know about if you need to get a last minute passport.
[00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:07.620]   >> Cool.
[00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:11.620]   I just checked it and went-- it's a website.
[00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:16.620]   >> Devorect.org/wagmate.
[00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:17.620]   >> This weekend, TAT.
[00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:18.620]   >> Another twin.
[00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:19.620]   >> Get through the border.com.
[00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:21.620]   >> Is in-- yeah, I know.
[00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:24.620]   I hope to put you in a truck and drive you through the border.
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:25.620]   No problem.
[00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:27.620]   Another twin is in the can.
[00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:28.620]   Thank you, gentlemen.
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:29.620]   >> I made a new character.
[00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:30.620]   It's just not on the wall.
[00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:31.620]   >> This one.
[00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:32.620]   >> Oh, the wall.
[00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:33.620]   >> This is a craps society.
[00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:38.620]   This is a craps society.
[00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:43.620]   This is a craps generation.
[00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:48.620]   This is a craps everybody's ads everywhere.
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:49.620]   >> No ads.
[00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:51.620]   >> This guy's gonna get a--
[00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:54.620]   >> Ah, I'm a cranky old man.
[00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:55.620]   >> And, wow.
[00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:59.620]   >> This is a-- this is going to be a good attempt at a truck.
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:01.620]   >> This is going to be a week from hell.
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:03.620]   >> And now our servers got me.
[00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:05.620]   >> We're in the--
[00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:06.620]   >> This weekend, TAT.
[00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:07.620]   >> We're in the--
[00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:09.620]   >> We are in the--

[00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:11.620]   >> We're in the--
[00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:12.620]   >> TAT.
[00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:13.620]   >> TAT.
[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:14.620]   >> TAT.
[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:15.620]   >> TAT.
[00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:16.620]   >> TAT.
[00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:17.620]   >> TAT.

[00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:22.620]   >> TAT.
[00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:24.620]   >> My friends, my twits, are you ready?
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:26.620]   >> Yeah, the Twitter army.
[00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:28.620]   >> I don't know what the answer is.
[00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:29.620]   I'm really going.
[00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:34.620]   >> Let me introduce the table mates.
[00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:39.620]   >> John C. de Vorek.
[00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:41.620]   >> Kevin Rose.

[00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:58.620]   >> I got the Twitter army behind me.
[00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:03.620]   >> Microsoft proof-rooted.
[00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:08.620]   >> It's a good problem.
[00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:13.620]   >> It's a fool's paradise.
[00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:18.620]   >> This is amazing.
[00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:27.620]   >> It's a good problem.
[00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:31.620]   >> It's a good problem.
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:35.620]   >> I got the Twitter army.
[00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:38.620]   >> It's a good problem.
[00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:41.620]   >> It's a good problem.
[00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:45.620]   >> It's a good problem.
[00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:55.620]   >> It's a good problem.
[00:55:55.620 --> 00:56:00.620]   >> It's a good problem.
