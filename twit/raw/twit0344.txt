[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.080]   John says, "It's a scam."
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.320]   We'll also talk about Austin, why everybody's
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.800]   drunk there this week.

[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.880]   Welcome to Twit.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.960]   This week in Tech, the show where we talk about the week's tech
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.480]   news.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.000]   And we're all a little bit under the weather
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.760]   when we're cranky today.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.760]   I'll explain why in a moment.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.200]   Let's start first with the original cranky geek, Mr. John.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.720]   C. Devorak, who is now marking his fourth consecutive
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.240]   Twit in a row.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.080]   Oh, really?
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.080]   I shouldn't-- that was a mistake.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.600]   [LAUGHS]
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.400]   No, I'm thrilled.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.120]   I'm really thrilled.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.960]   Thank you, John.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.480]   Making that trip up here.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.920]   Channeldevorak.com.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.440]   Check it out.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.240]   Despite the cow losing in the--
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.240]   Cow lost the color on it.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.040]   --color on it.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.160]   No, it's not March Madness.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.160]   This is the--
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.760]   NCAA Final Four.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.600]   No, you follow this at all?
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.960]   The NIT National--
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.480]   The tremendous fans of sports ball.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.440]   We understand it's a hell of a game.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.640]   And they pack 12 tournaments.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.120]   Yeah.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.640]   We'll just add it all the rest of that crap out.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.280]   No, you won't.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.040]   John C. Devorak, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.200]   Also with us, Mike Algen.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.600]   It's so great to have you, Mike.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.160]   Mike joined us.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.160]   Well, I'll tell you in a second.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.440]   I also want to say hi to Brian Brushwood.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.440]   Hello.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.440]   Who is the host of Game Law?
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.840]   I had to pull myself away from a hell of a lot of parties
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.040]   in South by Southwest to make it.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.560]   I know.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.360]   Yeah, did you come back from South by Southwest?
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.040]   Yeah, I did.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.040]   I did.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.040]   That's why I just came here.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.040]   That's why my voice is all scraggly.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.080]   We did South by So Wasted, our NSFW event,
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.200]   where we actually had Ali Spagnola played Power Hour.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.720]   It was a concert of 61-minute-long songs.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.520]   And at the end of each song, you had to do a shot of beer.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.880]   Oh.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.360]   At the end of--
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.360]   60 shots of beer?
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.880]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.000]   That's been drinking, sir.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.400]   You should be dead.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.920]   It's a--
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.400]   It's a pleasure.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.280]   --kind of shut.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.800]   It's popular.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.800]   They're a little shut.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.760]   Yeah, like one ounce.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.640]   You end up drinking, I think, like 60 ounces.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.160]   60 ounces.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.080]   It's like a couple of 40--
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.640]   I don't have five beers.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.720]   It's less than a couple of 40s.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.160]   That's a challenge.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.160]   I do a couple of 40s every night.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.920]   I let my daughter do a Power Hour.
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.400]   So you were a reverse commute.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.720]   Like everybody's going to Austin.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.640]   All of San Francisco is in Austin right now.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.600]   Unfortunately, though, for like how busy the airport is,
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.600]   it doesn't differentiate.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.360]   It's like the ticket prices are crazy.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.240]   Everything's overrun.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.360]   But whatever.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.040]   It was good.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.520]   I never even go to any of the South by Southwest events.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.680]   It's always been about the parties now, more
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.360]   than ever.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.840]   That's why we didn't cover it this year.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.680]   I think Sarah's down there.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.360]   Although I heard Baratunde killed it in his presentation
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.880]   at Southwest.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.360]   I'm sure.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.720]   Who do you kill?
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.840]   How to be black.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.120]   You know, it's so funny.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.600]   Mario Armstrong and Baratunde were on CNN.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.120]   CNN has the CNN grill at Southwest.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.720]   I've never understood why CNN is there.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.520]   But they, for some reason, have decided
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.840]   this is about job creation in America.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.440]   Sure.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.320]   Yeah, we heard that.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.240]   And a beer every week.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.040]   So much of people not working as lit as this.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.000]   Well, I mean, with the climate, the way it is now,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.160]   really any place where innovation is happening,
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.720]   you want to put some kind of anywhere
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.400]   where people are positive and optimistic.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.840]   You're like, it's about jobs.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.720]   Not everything is crap.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.280]   Right.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.440]   Although I don't think any innovation happens in South
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.640]   by its really spring break for geeks.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.080]   Yes.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.000]   OK, I do agree with that.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.920]   That's what it really is.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.120]   Minus the naked women and the beads.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.320]   There's no naked women.
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.520]   There's no wet t-shirt causes.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.320]   They'll be bad.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.960]   No.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.880]   It's cold.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.200]   That's what burning man is for.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.680]   Anyway, it's-- thank you, Brian, because you come up here
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.720]   for game on every week.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.220]   Yeah.
[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.760]   Actually, Brian's always in the back room while we do Twitter.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.320]   And you said, why aren't you letting me on Twitter?
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.600]   I said, I thought you were busy.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.680]   No, no, no.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.760]   Is that-- to be honest, I actually really wanted to come,
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.920]   because I got to promote-- you know, this week,
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.320]   we're doing the Scam School book.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.200]   Dropping on 3/14.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.800]   And I'll tell you what, after my kids,
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.120]   this is like the thing I am most proud of.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.280]   If you go to scamschoolbook.com, you could check it out.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.440]   It's so fascinating, because instructional materials are
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.920]   where I really think ebooks are going to shine.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.360]   Climate.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.320]   Instructional materials for scamming people.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.080]   Well, yeah, well, I mean, because it's 80 magic tricks
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.160]   to do at the bar, right?
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.680]   Right.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.640]   And the difference is, it's like, I spend like three paragraphs
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.000]   explaining how to do something.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.200]   But then you just click on the photo,
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.360]   and it plays a 10 second clip actually showing the move,
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.120]   and everything makes so much more sense, right?
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.480]   And then--
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.320]   So adding the multimedia to a standard text.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.680]   Right.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.040]   Well, and also-- and I've never seen this before,
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.000]   but there's audio commentary tracks for every single trick.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.640]   So it's like each chapter explains how to do the trick,
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.240]   but then the audio commentary talks about the behind the scenes
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.480]   of what, you know, when is a good time to do it,
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.000]   or how I've epically failed with the trick once or twice.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.160]   Dude, I'm so excited about this.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.480]   Is he--
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.000]   He had any sense of irony you would make the whole book a scam.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.840]   I--
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.560]   There's nothing--
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.040]   There's nothing.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.560]   There's nothing.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.120]   There's nothing.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.920]   What's the price of this book and working to get it?
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.800]   Well, it's going to be $9.99 eventually.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.720]   But on launch day, we're doing $4.99.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.560]   Oh, my God.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.960]   And the idea is to do a targeted strike.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:05.440]   I'm speaking.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.200]   This is the scam.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.960]   We want to scam our way to the top of Amazon.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.920]   So I'm cutting the price in half.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.040]   The best experiences on the iPad right now and the iBook Store--
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.000]   Is used author-- did they use author to make this?
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.400]   No, they've got-- they've got book is a cross-platform thing.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.800]   And in fact, they had a contest.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.600]   They had over 600 books in their beta time.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.400]   And they gave this one.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.240]   They had three awards.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.040]   One was for best design, best content, and the best overall.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.360]   This one, best overall.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.720]   So for best design and best content out
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.200]   of the 600 entries on there, it's awesome.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.760]   And it's going to be best on the iPad,
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.680]   but it'll work great on Amazon as well.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.520]   This is interesting.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.600]   So instead of using author, which is iPad only,
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.880]   and you have to give money to Apple and so forth--
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.400]   Correct.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.800]   --this way you could sell it on Kindle,
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.760]   and you could sell it elsewhere.
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.440]   Yeah, and they handle all of that stuff.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.000]   So you use their exclusive platform to build the whole thing.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.320]   And then when you click Publish, it pushes automatically
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.200]   to all three of them.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.320]   And it adapts it-- because right now, it's
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.920]   utter chaos in e-book land.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.400]   As far as formatting goes, if you want to do a rich format,
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.360]   the best experience is still e-pub.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.360]   But even now, with the Kindle Fire,
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.680]   it still won't-- even though you can embed video and images,
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.960]   they won't display properly.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.320]   So we had to put in extra external links
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.680]   to take you to the content if you want to actually see it
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.040]   on the Kindle Fire.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.600]   But to me, the most exciting thing
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.640]   is that all of this stuff can live on your smartphone as well.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.360]   So when you're actually at the bar,
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.080]   you can review the tricks that you know, and then go out and--
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.040]   I think we need a longer plug for this book.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.360]   Now, if you get it on the basic Kindle, there's no audio.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.840]   So you just won't get that.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.440]   Well, no, no, they're all external links.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.240]   So it's all in there when you--
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.840]   You'd have to go in a browser or something.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.040]   And plus, I suspect sometime in the next two months,
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.040]   all of a sudden, you'll just have that capability,
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.920]   because they're constantly doing new versions on there.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.840]   To that basic Kindle, so there's no audio.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.840]   Right, well, yeah, basic Kindle.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.680]   And of course, yeah.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.560]   How you experience the book will change based on--
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.720]   but the pre-orders are up right now.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.160]   So this is an app.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.600]   And it's an e-book.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.080]   So it's in the iBook store.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.520]   But it's got app-like functionality.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.560]   It's all the rich media.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.800]   Interesting.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.680]   John, you might want to think about this for--
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.640]   I need some extra money.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.360]   That's why he keeps coming to the show.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.080]   And of course, Mike Elgin joined us.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.560]   We did something unique this week.
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.160]   We did, of course, on Wednesday, Apple,
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.640]   and announced the new iPad.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.640]   And we did a Google Hangout, which we'd never done before,
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.800]   in addition to our panel.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.600]   So it's something like we could do right now,
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.600]   starting at Hangout.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.880]   And I invited only tech reporters.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.520]   Mike showed up.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.080]   Steve Garfield.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.200]   We had Tim Street.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:34.840]   I forgot who else--
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.520]   Tim Solaris.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.000]   Yeah, so it was kind of an interesting way
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.040]   to have a secondary--
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.240]   It was great for me because I was actually going to do that.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.760]   I was going to do a Hangout and do a running--
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.840]   I call it a live blab of the event.
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.240]   And then I realized--
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.720]   It was thrilled that you joined our live.
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.680]   I realized you were going to do it.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.880]   And I'm like, I just watched Leo's instead of doing my own.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.520]   And then he's perfect at the thing.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.080]   And I was on it.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:57.600]   It was perfect.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.120]   It was really fun.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.120]   It was really fun.
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:08:59.880]   Where's Veronica?
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.880]   She's in the back in the room.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.480]   She's in the way.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.480]   Somebody's got to get rid of him.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.360]   I appreciate him.
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:10.280]   So nobody from this group went to this thing except him.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.440]   And he's a poor representative.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.640]   To South by Southwest.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.040]   You mean?
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:13.760]   It's still going on.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.080]   It's 9th through the 13th.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.000]   In fact, this is today and tomorrow
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.200]   are like the really big days, if you want to go to South by Saturday.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.760]   Yeah, they're there for the content and not just for the parties.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.680]   Nobody goes for the contents.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.160]   Nobody goes.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.880]   They all think bailed out already.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.720]   So anyway, I was saying I saw Brian and Mario on CNN.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.640]   I thought that's interesting.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.480]   They found a two-way guy.
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.240]   So Steve Case was on.
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.800]   Steve Case was on with--
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.240]   They're going on about something.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.920]   With Reed Hastings?
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.160]   It's very interesting.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.760]   Anyway, South by-- is there anything to talk about with South
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.800]   by?
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.440]   Not that I heard.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.800]   Breaking news?
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.840]   There's a shopping cart that follows you around.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.080]   Apparently that's the big thing.
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:48.880]   It's a great news.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.000]   There's a shopping cart?
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.880]   It's a new product that somebody's trying to look at from financing.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.120]   They're trying to replace husbands.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.880]   So as you walk around, the shopping cart follows you around.
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.440]   It sounds creepy if you ask me.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.200]   They're announcing a social media-enabled biodiesel.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:01.960]   It's going to be amazing.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.480]   Chasing world.
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.400]   So no, that's not it.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.120]   I'm trying to find the South by-- all I'm getting is the shopping
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.400]   cart for logging in.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.320]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:13.960]   Whole Foods is--
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.800]   So in the past, Twitter really kind of made it big at South
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.760]   by then the next year, 4 Square, the next year,
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.040]   Goala, which today actually closed its doors.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.360]   It's kind of sad.
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.800]   And nothing since then because everybody's looked and said,
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.040]   hey, this is where Twitter launched.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:28.800]   I want to launch there.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.200]   So there's 800 people trying to launch all the same time.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.240]   And that's the problem.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.280]   As soon as you have success and you
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.280]   have a couple of those awesome flash points
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.040]   where you have a meeting of the minds and the right product
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.640]   at the right time comes out and you get a reputation for that,
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.760]   then all of a sudden you get all the hangers on
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.840]   and all the gold diggers, all the people who hear there's
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.800]   gold in them their internets showing up.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.000]   And then it just becomes-- you get so much noise,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.960]   it's very difficult to find the signal in there.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.520]   One app that some people are saying is going to be big is
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.160]   Highlight.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.840]   I've had this on my phone for some time.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:03.520]   The idea is you put it on your phone and just kind of let it
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.480]   run.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.280]   And it will tell you when people are nearby that you might
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.360]   want to meet.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.600]   So it doesn't necessarily post where you are,
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.360]   but just sort of--
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:11.880]   Well, it does.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:12.880]   --what you guys in a way.
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.320]   Wasn't there a Japanese product that
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.200]   used to wear those?
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.040]   What was this?
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.520]   You would indicate your sexual preferences,
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.840]   whether you're looking for a friend or a Tokyo.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.200]   And you would somebody nearby would be beeping.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.160]   And next thing you'd know, you'd jump in a hotel room and do
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:27.360]   it.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:27.880]   Exactly.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.200]   But the real problem with this, something like this at South
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.760]   By-- it's not just your friends.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.040]   It's friends of friends, right?
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.720]   So it's a fairly large network.
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.960]   At South By, you'd just--
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.120]   It'd be beeping all the time.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:37.960]   Beeping all the time.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.640]   Yeah, we'd just explode.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:39.480]   Everybody there.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.520]   That's a problem with these apps, like Color and others
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.040]   that are just ad hoc networks.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.240]   They're either nobody's there.
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.120]   Or you're just overwhelmed.
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.320]   And it's very difficult to be in an event where it's just
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:51.880]   the right amount of--
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.400]   So have you noticed that as a result--
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.080]   It's like Grindr.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.000]   Have you noticed as a result of all these different
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.320]   applications that you get notification fatigue that creeps
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.200]   into other things?
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.400]   Like, I'm so-- you get so many notices on your Facebook
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.640]   and your Google+, then now, all of a sudden, I'm so accustomed
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.120]   to blowing those off and getting around to them when I never
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.920]   do that I also-- like, even voicemails now.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.400]   I see that people call and leave voicemails.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.360]   I don't want to connect.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.200]   I'll get around to listening to that.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.560]   Same thing with text messages.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.840]   And so now I just tell people it's like, just make sure
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.920]   to send everything three times.
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.120]   I'm too busy social networking to connect with people.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.920]   It's just-- it takes up all my time.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.000]   So there's two apps.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.080]   There's Grindr and Blender.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.040]   Grindr's for gay people.
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.840]   Blenders for straight and lesbian people.
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.360]   I don't know how lesbians--
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:34.680]   I guess--
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.300]   --are coming up with a complicated--
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.200]   They're coming up with a complicated--
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.240]   Is that why you're making a gay ghetto?
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:38.700]   What is that?
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:39.680]   I don't understand.
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.440]   But anyway, these do the same thing,
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.720]   but it's more for hooking up, which is-- now, that maybe has some--
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.040]   And then there's a do-it-yourself app.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.640]   What's the do-it-yourself app?
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.640]   Scamps.
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:51.140]   Scamps.
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:51.640]   Scamps.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:52.140]   Scamps.
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:52.640]   Scamps.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:53.640]   Scamps Google.
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.080]   Go to scamschoolbook.com.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.280]   It's called I'm So Lonely.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.780]   Yeah.
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:12:59.360]   All right.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.360]   Anyway, so I think we can say safely
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.440]   that we are not missing any key developments in the--
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.520]   I mean, not that I mean--
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.680]   Usually, this is the kind of thing
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.400]   that the chat room would instantly pipe up
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.200]   and be like, you missed this announcement.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.160]   But they are not.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.520]   No.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.640]   But I think a new set of anti-social apps
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.240]   is probably an idea.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.320]   Anti-social apps.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.520]   Now you're talking about it.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.880]   How would we-- what would that be?
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:21.720]   How do-- you know what?
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.520]   It would be reverse.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.320]   It would keep track of where all your friends are
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.880]   until you were getting ready from them.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.120]   Scobles in that room.
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.720]   Don't go in there.
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.920]   That would be useful.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.680]   So the iPad-- I mean, I think the big story--
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.480]   Yeah, clearly.
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.480]   --is the iPad launch.
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.160]   I know you're going to throw stones at me,
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.360]   but I am going to say that this is one of the most important
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.680]   product launches since the first iPad launch.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.960]   In that I think this is--
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:47.800]   You know, they have a--
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.200]   You have a box of stones?
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:49.560]   No.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.480]   I'll give you some if you need to throw them.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.120]   I do think that when they said post-PC about 12 times
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.040]   at the beginning, they actually were kind of right on.
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.240]   Because this is the first iPad with a screen resolution.
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.480]   It's mind-boggling.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:07.880]   And the power to create because of a good camera and apps
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.440]   and voice dictation that it enhanced creation.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.920]   I think this might, in fact, really
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.120]   be the first real post-PC PC.
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:20.400]   I tend to think that post-PC devices have four characteristics.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.560]   Number one, their appliances.
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.520]   Rather than-- I mean, PCs are essentially hobbyist kits
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:24.800]   at their performance.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:25.960]   They're starting to be that way.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:29.400]   But to use a PC, originally, was to program it.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.280]   Then to use a PC was to optimize and maintain it
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.480]   and all that kind of stuff-- file management and the rest.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.520]   And this is Apple and other companies
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.080]   are doing these appliances.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.920]   The second thing is there's no file management.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.760]   The third thing is that there's an App Store model.
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.880]   Now PCs are starting to get the App Store model,
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.360]   but it's an afterthought.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.560]   It's just an attempt to copy Apple.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.920]   And so it's a real-- I really think in the future
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.160]   the average person won't use a PC.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.600]   They won't be managing files, and they won't be downloading
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.560]   drivers, and they won't be doing any of that stuff.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.360]   They just want to use it.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.520]   I agree.
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:07.880]   That's how it's going to be.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.440]   This is what happens to technology.
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.240]   It becomes invisible.
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.800]   It's only technology when it's something that
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.840]   is unfamiliar and difficult and challenging.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.400]   People use PCs because they had to,
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.920]   but they don't want to, except for a few of us.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.160]   Well, Brian, you disagree?
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.480]   Well, look, if there's one revolutionary--
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.760]   Look at this big box in front of it.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:29.760]   I'm clearly compensating--
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.120]   He's got a microphone on that.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:31.600]   Look at this.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.440]   Who is microphone in it?
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.120]   He's only on a table available to hear.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.440]   He's like using it the whole table.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.440]   All right, look, the conversation's
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.240]   not about how big my laptop is.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.640]   But the important thing is that there's
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.120]   one revolutionary advance here is that Apple has exactly
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:47.720]   identified the exact place to piss me off personally
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.120]   where on paper I could be unimpressed with everything.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.920]   But I know I'm still going to buy this stupid thing.
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.560]   Because on paper it's like, what, the resolution's higher.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.240]   And then I never use the camera on my iPad too.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.440]   You will now.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:58.960]   I think you're--
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.520]   You're going to look--
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:15:59.760]   You're going to look--
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.440]   --to take in a picture with it.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.360]   You're looking at the door key.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:01.960]   No, it looks dorky.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.480]   But it's going to work dorky.
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.440]   People's attitudes are going to change about that.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.080]   And I'll tell you why.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.400]   First of all, you're going to get used to it.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.960]   But second of all, there's never been a movie device that
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.840]   lets you see the movie you're shooting in the final resolution
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:14.680]   that it's going to be.
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:15.480]   You're not looking through a few.
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.200]   You can have a pool.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.240]   We can have a pool up.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.000]   We can put it all together now.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.960]   First it's going to be a YouTube video of the first person
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.760]   doing what you just described and having the laptop or the thing
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.680]   stolen from them right on the spot by some little kid.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.400]   And it's going to run down the street with it.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.600]   Look what I got, Mommy.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.720]   With the video still running.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.880]   With the video still running.
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.040]   We end up on YouTube.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.840]   And we can put a pool that will be within the 30 days.
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.760]   Here's the use case.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:40.760]   Here's the use case.
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.800]   Kefella at the beach with his iPad
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.320]   is kids are building a sand castle.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.880]   You just can't get that kind of resolution in the sun.
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.520]   I mean, that kind of bright screen in the sun.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.040]   Well, all right.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.440]   That's probably a little bit faked, but--
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.440]   Fake.
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:57.280]   The point is he's seeing on the screen what he's shooting--
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:57.760]   I see that.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.120]   I see the final resolution.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.760]   Of course you're going to do that.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.600]   And it's going to become commonplace.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.680]   Nobody's going to steal it.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.960]   What do they steal your video camera?
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:05.760]   They steal your phone?
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.160]   What do people walk up to you and steal stuff from your hands?
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:08.840]   Where do you live?
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:09.920]   You got picked pocket in a drink.
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:10.920]   Oh, you live in Oakland.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:11.960]   I live in Oakland.
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.960]   Here's what's interesting.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.880]   Did that whole bit of walk it to that long--
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:16.880]   It's a long way.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.320]   It was a long way to go.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:19.400]   You saw the response.
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:19.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.800]   Very tepid.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:21.960]   It was a tepid response.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.480]   Everyone here is from Ohio.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.080]   So here's what's interesting to me
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:29.040]   is as a gaming platform, this is a very significant advance
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.160]   because you finally have as much horsepower
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.920]   as you have in your Xbox 360s or even your PS3s, perhaps.
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.760]   But I really am curious to see what
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.680]   happens when game developers look to this
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.760]   as a primary place to start doing AAA titles.
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.760]   Because the problem is, as much as we
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.400]   love the convenience of gaming on the go,
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.640]   on our iPhones and Android devices,
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.680]   it's difficult for a lot of AAA titles
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.400]   to come out with it because you're only
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.400]   going to get maybe nine bucks is about the most
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.160]   you're going to get.
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.680]   Well, it's also a challenge because I think
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:00.000]   standard gaming controls are completely wrong for the iPad.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.680]   So one of the reasons Angry Birds is so successful
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.000]   and Infinity Blade, which they keep showing,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.680]   is because it's a swipe game.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.480]   It's a game that makes sense in touch.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.000]   And I see so many first person shooters
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.360]   trying to adapt gaming controls to the iPad.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.320]   Just forget it, guys.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.600]   You've got to make it for the platform.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.560]   But you know what?
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.160]   The problem with Xbox is that it's really, ultimately,
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.600]   there's only a certain number of people
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.880]   who are going to really master Call of Duty.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.880]   I mean, I go play Call of Duty and I just get my behind man.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.520]   We can't play because the teenage--
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.280]   the 12-year-olds are going to kill us.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:33.640]   Casual gaming is a gazillion times bigger than real gaming.
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.240]   And that's where the opportunities are.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.680]   And those people are going to be happy to charge $9 a game
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.160]   because they're going to sell 20 million of them.
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.760]   Right, but here's the thing though.
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.400]   By the way, that does the Infinity Blade Dungeons looks awesome.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.840]   It looks like the Diablo 3.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:46.800]   Right, right.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.160]   Well, that's one of the things.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.920]   My point, when we covered the launch of the PS Vita,
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.400]   I made the case on Game On.
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.640]   I saw your debate with Veronica.
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.960]   Yeah, that is like, what's the point?
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.040]   It's like the iPad's going to take over everything.
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.280]   And it's like, if I have to choose between a PS Vita
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.680]   or the new iPad, which can we agree?
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.120]   What is it with Apple and stupid names that we hate until
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.640]   they're suddenly not stupid anymore?
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.120]   Are we going to just call it the new iPad or--
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:07.800]   Just the iPad.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.800]   Just iPad or--
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.360]   Wait a minute, let's back up a second.
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.360]   Why are they doing that?
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.520]   Well, why did you come up with this prediction that it was?
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.280]   You knew.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.560]   You heard somebody telling you.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.520]   That was wrong.
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:18.000]   I think you were--
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.040]   I was wrong on everything I said, in fact.
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:20.480]   I think--
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.440]   I just like to--
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.720]   No, somebody told you this stuff.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.520]   I think it was-- I think that Apple streamed out
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.120]   a lot of bad information that came rapid back
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.120]   so they could see where the leaks were.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.640]   You were one of the sources.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.360]   And I said at the time, I did not have a source for iPad HD.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.880]   I just predicted that Apple would emphasize HD.
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.440]   And I was surprised they, in fact, did not.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.120]   What's funny is that Apple itself has to use--
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:40.960]   It's too skewed.
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:41.920]   And it's 4 by 3.
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.800]   It's not a 16 by 9 tablet.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.640]   So there's a lot of reasons they can't do that.
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.240]   What's funny, when you go in order one,
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.280]   Apple itself has to designate that.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.320]   They have to say something.
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.760]   So they say third generation in parentheses.
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.400]   Even Apple can't use--
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.760]   It is a-- it wouldn't have been weird
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.760]   had they not been continuing the iPad 2.
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.720]   Because now the iPad 2, which is the old one,
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.640]   is older than an iPad, which is very confusing.
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.880]   But I think what they're doing is the same thing Dell does.
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:11.280]   When you buy a Dell XPS, it's not 1, 2, 3, the 2012 version.
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.080]   It's the XPS.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.000]   And then you spec it.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.200]   So I think that's what they're going towards.
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.320]   I guess they think the MacBook Pro.
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.480]   They're going to the same thing, which is, well,
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.560]   if you pay $3.99, you'll get the A5, not the A5X.
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:21.960]   You'll get the lower res screen.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.480]   That's just a different iPad, not last year's iPad.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.480]   But just this is what you get for what you've had.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.560]   As we talked about in the Hangout during the event,
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.160]   I think this is evidence that they're
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.120]   going to come out with a smaller iPad that everybody's
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:33.640]   been roomed for.
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:34.760]   I might want a larger line.
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.720]   But I think that there will always be a cheaper iPad.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.440]   But in the future, it won't be the old one.
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:39.440]   It'll be the small one.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.760]   I'll tell you what, people don't--
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:43.480]   I don't think people want a smaller iPad nearly as much
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.080]   as they want a ruggedized iPad.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.000]   I think that's what you're going to see next,
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.120]   because you see-- we're all still trying to get to that.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.680]   Yeah, we're still trying to get to that Star Trek level.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.800]   And at this point, I think we're going
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.280]   to see a leveling off, because the quality--
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.840]   I mean, how much better can you make the res--
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:57.840]   It should be a little heavier anyway,
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.640]   so when that kid steals it from you.
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.760]   You can chase him down.
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:01.960]   Yeah, because it'd be--
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.520]   I'd say this is too heavy, dude.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.920]   I got a call from a sewer worker on the radio show
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:06.960]   who wanted to use an iPad.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:07.480]   I'm not kidding.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.080]   He said, yeah, I do septic systems.
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:10.520]   Wow.
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.640]   And I don't-- I need it to be ruggedized,
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.920]   so I can take it in the field.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.160]   And sometimes my hands have grit on them,
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.360]   and I don't want to scratch it.
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.080]   So he was asking-- and I said, why do you get an honor box?
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.000]   They're now-- Pelican now making some very rugged cases,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.400]   and you get a screen shield.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.880]   So you can ruggedize them.
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.640]   There's one company that's actually
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.200]   offering a waterproofing process that allows--
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.640]   like, you send them your unit, and they completely cover it.
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:33.640]   And then you can actually just--
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.640]   That's why I'm proving the water.
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:35.640]   --that's what the problem is.
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:35.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.840]   Apparently, you have to give up your thing for days,
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:38.640]   because they--
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.480]   Oh, yeah, seal it.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.920]   --it soaks in some goo.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:41.680]   That's not good.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.360]   No, it's some-- it's a-- it's a--
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.240]   you do, if you haven't heard of this process,
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.240]   they put it in this liquid bath that has, I guess,
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.040]   it's a bunch of ions.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.040]   I don't even know how it works.
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:50.520]   I have no idea.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.240]   I'll tell you what, that'll be a killer feature.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.920]   If you have that next two days or three or four days,
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.600]   and then when they bring the thing out of its dry,
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.920]   it's completely waterproof.
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.720]   You could drop it in the swimming pool.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.960]   No 33 said there was-- yeah.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:06.000]   And there were rumors right after that that both Apple
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.040]   and some Google Android vendors were going to use this stuff
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.640]   out of the gate.
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.080]   It's just going to come with the stuff.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.920]   See, like, and now that would have had me excited.
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.680]   That would have been a no-brainer, like, take my money
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.120]   right now.
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.480]   But instead, what would it do?
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.960]   When Apple could have dropped it in a pool.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.320]   Yeah.
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.160]   And then they would think still going on.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.640]   And then the kid would come along and steal it out of the pool
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.760]   and off he'd go.
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.160]   The iPad H2O.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.720]   Oh, dude, that would be great.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.120]   The demo video has them FaceTiming Underwater
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.040]   with the scuba diver.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.040]   But that doesn't ruggedize it.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.000]   And I don't think Apple wants ruggedized iPads
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.520]   because then the last.
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.520]   Oh, wow.
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:38.960]   These are disposable.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.120]   That's a little bit conspiracy theory.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:40.120]   I like it.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.120]   I like it.
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:42.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.840]   Of course you like it.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.160]   No, I think that's interesting.
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.160]   Yeah.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.400]   I think it's called LiquidPel.
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.640]   L-U--
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:50.640]   K-U-I.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.040]   Yeah, it's not the best name.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.800]   I can't even spell it.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:59.040]   L-I-Q-U-I-P-E-L, according to the chatroom.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.240]   I'll do that.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.880]   So sure you would.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.520]   I think it's kind of interesting.
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.600]   See, and I don't know if you dropped a high old mic
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.520]   into that stuff.
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.440]   But you could put anything in.
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.440]   It's what it says.
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:08.960]   Yeah, it says.
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:09.360]   There it is.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.640]   Waterproof your device.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.640]   Yeah.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.440]   Isn't there a liquid that you can breathe?
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.760]   Like it has an oxygen in it.
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:17.760]   That was in a movie.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.520]   That was the movie of this.
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.520]   I said movie.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.120]   Didn't I once fight crime?
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.120]   You should have witnessed that.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.320]   With the next comment?
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.600]   And I have a bell on the camera.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.320]   Are they going to dip her in it?
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.040]   Oh, no.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.040]   No, that's the wet t-shirt contest you've got.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:33.560]   That's different.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:34.040]   That's different by South.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:36.080]   Why is it all the women in this?
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.800]   Per floral hydrocarbon.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.560]   Oh, yeah, that's what you breathe.
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:40.320]   Per floral hydrocarbon.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.840]   Yeah, I don't know if I want to be breathing it.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:42.120]   Yeah.
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:43.680]   We should try to breathe this stuff.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.520]   No, this is not per floral hydrocarbon.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:46.800]   That's the other stuff.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.960]   We've got two conversations going on.
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:52.720]   So back to the iPad.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.960]   It sounded to me like you were sold the moment you saw it.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.480]   But you guys, of course, covered it live.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.640]   I only read just the numbers after the fact.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.240]   And I was like, numbers slightly higher.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:00.960]   I don't care.
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.600]   But yet I know the moment I see it in touch, it'll be all like--
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.960]   That's to me what's going to be the selling point is when you look at it
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.600]   and it looks like it's a piece of paper or something real.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.800]   The text is super crisp.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.000]   But the image looks like it's actually on the--
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:13.880]   there on this--
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.720]   The iPad 2 and the iPad 1 are all like that.
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.680]   You hear about it and you hear it described
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.080]   and you hear people gushing about it and you're like,
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.320]   yeah, it doesn't sound very compelling.
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.440]   And then you go in and play with it.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.280]   And there's something about it that makes you really like it.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.320]   And that something is the responsiveness and the physics
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.480]   that they built into the design.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:34.800]   That kind of user interface taps into your brain's understanding
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.760]   how the world should work.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.760]   That's my point.
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:37.240]   Exactly.
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.840]   And most of the Android tablets haven't achieved that illusion.
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:40.960]   Because--
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.000]   It's non-verbal.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.760]   You see a two-year-old.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:44.640]   They can use this.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.440]   It's non-verbal.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.760]   It's orangutan's.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.560]   Orangutan's.
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:47.920]   You're right.
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.240]   We've got videos or orangutan's touching them.
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.800]   And then bashing them.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:52.560]   It's a new market.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.360]   That's not made for orangutan's.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.960]   No, I would hope well, you never know.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.080]   Do you guys see the gentleman's rant on YouTube?
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.440]   I think they nailed it.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.720]   It's the same.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.920]   I'm going to confess that those guys got everything exactly right.
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:06.840]   I did not see that.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.640]   And yet we'll still buy it.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.720]   I think probably--
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.080]   Well, maybe I ended up rushing.
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.080]   I'm pulling it up right now.
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.120]   Let's see.
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:13.720]   The gentleman.
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:14.720]   Who are the gentleman?
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.520]   Ah, the comedy crew or something.
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:17.080]   Yeah.
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.000]   And they're ranting about the iPad?
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:19.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:20.880]   All the new iPad.
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.120]   All right, so they have a channel.
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.440]   I'll tell you what, that's one thing.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.800]   That is going to be the most significant advance in YouTube.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:29.280]   And I would love to specifically write a comedy show that
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.600]   built-- like, we're amazed with the South Park guys,
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.320]   how they were within four days of Saddam Hussein getting
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.760]   captured, have a whole episode about that with music
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:37.480]   and all this stuff.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.840]   We're going to see it even faster thanks to YouTube
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.000]   and guys like these.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.320]   We know you have the technology,
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.960]   and we know it's going to be in the next update.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.560]   It's like a homeless person asking you for a dollar,
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.080]   and you're saying you don't have one.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.360]   But in reality, you do.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.000]   You have $500 billion in your pocket.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.480]   Easy Apple, we get that it's an amazing pixel ratio,
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.080]   and nothing on the market beats it,
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.720]   except for any screen larger than nine inches.
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.240]   Hey, you want to watch the movie on my iPad?
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.880]   No, I think I'm good with my 72 inch LED.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.320]   Actually--
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.360]   Mabro?
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.320]   It's higher res than your 72 inch LED.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.000]   I got bad news for you.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   You do?
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.440]   You win to get Apple.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.840]   There's absolutely no denying that the resolution
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.360]   of the new iPad is nothing short of incredible,
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.080]   or amazing, or whatever adjective Apple's using this.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.240]   Resolutionary.
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.840]   It's better than your television in every single way,
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.360]   besides the fact that it's 49 inches smaller.
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:30.720]   Why the hell did you leave Siri out of this update?
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.480]   And don't tell me it's because the technology isn't there,
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.960]   because that's bullsh*t.
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:38.160]   I hacked her onto my iPad two months ago.
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.320]   But I shouldn't be saying this on the internet,
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.160]   but it's out there.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:41.920]   I'm bored.
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:42.240]   That's right.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.200]   Well, you know, the other thing--
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.960]   The resolution is actually not better than it's big screen,
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:51.080]   because it has to be letterboxed to do a HD movie on the iPad.
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.760]   Oh, yeah, to get the 16 by 9 on there.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:53.720]   So you end up with the same--
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.360]   So it's the same resolution.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.360]   If you do that, it is the same resolution
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.840]   as your 1080p screen.
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:26:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.880]   But you get more pixels than your big screen TV.
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.040]   Well, a lot of them are not being used when you're--
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.560]   When you're watching a movie, but everything else
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.800]   you get to talk about that.
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.200]   And really, what I'm talking about
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.240]   is which is more significant as PPI or pixels per inch.
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.440]   And there is nothing out there that
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.280]   is comparable in terms of PPI.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.520]   I think that that is--
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.240]   That's what you're going to see when you look at.
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:20.600]   The only thing that's comparable, by the way,
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.120]   is the iPhone 4 and 4S, which are actually better.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.160]   That's what you're going to look at.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.480]   That's what you're going to see.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.840]   You're not going to say, oh, my big screen looks better.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.080]   It doesn't.
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:32.520]   And they've done a lot of voodoo with the pixelization.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:36.400]   It's a relatively new technology that we haven't seen.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.200]   And when this thing--
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:37.720]   What is it?
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:38.680]   It's not IPS.
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.600]   They described it in some of the proper pandas.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.200]   Oh, I saw that.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.600]   They did what they did where they shut down the lighting
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.640]   that makes it-- does all the stuff that normally ruins
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.520]   the display.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.320]   And the bottom line is that the people who have seen it
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.040]   are just kind of like stunned at what they see on screen.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:53.560]   Well, yeah.
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:56.160]   Ryan Block tweeted that it was the best display he's
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.320]   seen on anything period.
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:57.820]   Yeah.
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:58.640]   It was like nothing else.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.880]   And also, this is where you start
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.840]   to see how smart Apple was early on to push HTML5,
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:05.160]   because everything that's created in HTML5 now
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.560]   is now scaled to the higher resolution.
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:10.840]   And everything's suddenly going to look incredible.
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:14.960]   So I was getting a lot of tweets and chats
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.600]   this morning when I came into the radio show.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:20.440]   CNN says, the ship date is slipped to March 19.
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:23.600]   And I don't know if CNN really was that stupid
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.000]   or if people were misinterpreting what they were saying.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.360]   It's still coming if you pre-ordered it March 16.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.560]   I actually got a notification to mid-line a ship.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:31.060]   Yes.
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:33.400]   I think they're coming to China to the date.
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.280]   The slaves are working on it right now.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.360]   And it's coming from China, the children.
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:40.320]   There's probably a finger in yours.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.320]   There may be.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.680]   No extra charge.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:47.960]   And then for people who ordered today, it's March 19.
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.160]   And in fact, that's the best it's ever been for an iPad launch.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.120]   By now, it would usually be a two-week delay.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.560]   So they've been cranking these things out like crazy.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.280]   It's coming dropships from China.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:57.720]   That's right.
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:58.920]   It doesn't stop anywhere in the US.
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.480]   So did anyone-- I'm surprised that nobody's
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.120]   mentioned the LTE integration.
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.280]   What's talking about it?
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.320]   No, didn't you predict there was no chance?
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:05.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:09.320]   I got-- John, I got it completely wrong.
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.120]   It's not the iPad HD.
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.560]   I knew the retina display.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:16.440]   I thought I did not think they'll put LTE in it.
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.240]   They did, both for "Isin' and AT" to do.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.640]   You had a good reason.
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:20.720]   I had lots of good reasons.
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.000]   But again, I wasn't basing on--
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.840]   the one thing I was basing on a rumor was--
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.640]   I mean, on a fact is that somebody did even
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.920]   in a saying there from Apple, it'll be available March 9.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.240]   That was also wrong.
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.600]   So I get everything wrong.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.600]   But that's OK.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:34.920]   No, I don't.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.160]   I think you were set up.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.120]   No, no.
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.640]   Because this was all speculation based on me thinking,
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.160]   using my mind.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.440]   You're trying to save the guy's career.
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.040]   I don't like it.
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.480]   That was my mistake.
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.240]   So I don't know.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.960]   I don't know.
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:50.440]   If I want to get this, I think I would want to go all the way
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:50.720]   in.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:55.120]   Up till now, I've only bought the cheapest 16 gigabyte Wi-Fi
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.280]   versions of them.
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.640]   But if I was going to go in on this with the specs being
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.120]   as high as they are, I would want to actually get a subscription.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.320]   But I'm so ticked off at AT&T right now.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:04.440]   Because you remember last time--
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.480]   AT&T's you won't offer it anyway.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.200]   Just Verizon.
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:07.560]   Well, no, no.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:08.640]   I thought they had their version.
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.640]   Both of LT.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:10.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:10.880]   Their version of LT.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.320]   But they've started throttling me.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:14.960]   I've gotten texts now saying that I've gone--
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:15.960]   AT&T has rattled.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.480]   He's rattled.
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.040]   What are you doing?
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:17.960]   Downloading movies?
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.520]   No, I'm on the road all the time.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:21.000]   You know what?
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.400]   It's probably audio books because they use the podcaster app
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.680]   that's constantly downloading--
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.520]   No, it's annoying.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:26.520]   An audio book.
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.840]   That doesn't-- and we've talked about this before.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.080]   It doesn't help congestion at all.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.360]   The problem is not that you're using so much bandwidth.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.640]   It's when you use it that matters.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:34.920]   That's what congestion is all about.
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:37.480]   And the guy might be using a gigabyte, but doing it
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:41.200]   at the peak hour is doing more damage than you.
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.240]   I bet you, because you're probably
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.080]   doing it late at night--
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:43.600]   Oh sure, sure.
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:44.100]   Yeah.
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:44.600]   --times and years.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:44.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.600]   But--
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:46.960]   The other thing-- I don't think they realize--
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:47.400]   I don't think--
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.560]   It isn't a problem, except they're not throttling
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:50.920]   based on congestion.
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.480]   They're throttling totally based on bits.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.280]   Here's the problem.
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.280]   This is a decision that sounded smart in the boardroom.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.360]   But every time they send out one of these text messages,
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.280]   this is a press release sent to an individual to enrage them
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.560]   and make them somebody go out and tell their friends
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:03.720]   how crappy AT&T is.
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:04.080]   Well, good news.
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.080]   They don't care.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.080]   They don't care.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:07.080]   They don't care.
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:08.880]   They promise the no throttling on the iPad.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.160]   Well, now I'm going to have to--
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:10.720]   But wait a minute.
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.520]   Now let's talk a little bit about the difference
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.600]   in AT&T and Verizon.
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.360]   One thing Verizon is allowing that AT&T is not is hot spotting.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.240]   So one of the features of the new iPad
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.400]   was you could turn it into a Wi-Fi access point,
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:23.480]   as Apple said.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:26.360]   If the carrier allows it-- well, in this case Verizon said
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:26.680]   they would.
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.520]   AT&T said they would not.
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.280]   Verizon will not charge extra for hot spotting.
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.200]   So now you've got a Wi-Fi access point.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.280]   Now you might have a Wi-Fi, but it's certainly your cell phone.
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:36.800]   No.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:37.760]   Look, you're convincing me.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.240]   You realize I've been with AT&T for 14 years now.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.240]   Let's talk about Verizon.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:42.720]   This is going to be the straw that's going to break my back.
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:43.640]   Let's talk about Verizon.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:46.560]   Before we talk about Verizon, we talk about the implication
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:50.280]   of an iPad, which is a mass consumer device that essentially
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:53.640]   can replace the whole router, cable arrangement,
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.520]   and all that stuff for people.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.160]   It's your internet service provider.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:57.640]   Exactly.
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:58.880]   And there's no installation.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:31:59.880]   There's no confusion.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.360]   It's a little pricey.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.400]   There's no Comcast or any of these cable companies.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:07.800]   If you wanted 10 gigabytes from Verizon a month, it's $80.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.520]   That's $8 a gigabyte.
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.480]   But look how the most expensive plan
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:14.800]   is the 250 megabyte plan from AT&T.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:15.280]   What?
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.840]   $15 for two.
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.200]   I don't know who-- what would you do with 250 megabytes?
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.160]   There's nothing.
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.360]   And it costs you $60 a gigabyte.
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.400]   This is terrible.
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:26.400]   Three gigs on AT&T is $30.
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.000]   This is the worst thing ever.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.640]   This is worse than adult onset diabetes.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.160]   Well, the price is the same when you get to 5 gigs.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.000]   50 bucks on both.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.520]   Well, AT&T is sweet.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:41.760]   So if you don't want to buy a lot of data,
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:44.280]   I guess 250 megabytes would be the best deal for you.
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:46.440]   But you better not go over.
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:51.520]   And if you are a 2 gigabyte user, then I'd say if 2 to 3 gigabytes,
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:52.800]   AT&T would be the better deal.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.320]   Because you only get $30, it gets you 2 gigs on Verizon
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.320]   and 3 gigs on AT&T.
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.960]   Now, somebody is saying that there's no Netflix on your LTE.
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:00.960]   Was that an announcement?
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.000]   That's not true.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:02.480]   Yeah.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.000]   That can't be true.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   That's not true.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.800]   So it's essentially just $10 a gigabyte, even no matter
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:09.120]   how much she is unlimited at 10 bucks a gigabyte
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:09.920]   is what that 5 gigabyte is.
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.200]   Except for those low end plans exactly right.
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.800]   Well, so that's what I'm realizing now.
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:17.120]   You realize anyone who has an unlimited plan with AT&T,
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.160]   there's no point to it anymore.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.560]   Because you're paying $30 and you get 3 gigabytes.
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:21.800]   And then you start getting throttled.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:23.120]   Except on the iPad.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.240]   Or you get throttled.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.160]   You don't get throttled.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.160]   OK, well, all right.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.160]   Do what to-- I know a guy who would think so.
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.280]   But they don't offer how limited.
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:33.000]   And I figured out how to put his iPad sim into an iPhone
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.240]   so he can get that deal on his iPhone.
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:35.040]   That's a good idea.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:35.920]   Just chop it.
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.160]   Now, here's the question.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.520]   Is $10 a gigabyte expensive?
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.680]   I don't even know anymore.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.200]   Like at this point, it's just so--
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.000]   It's really expensive.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   It's going-- do you ever put a little meter on your thing?
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.360]   Is so many gigabytes you use?
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.920]   I pay $80 for my Comcast.
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.400]   I get 250 gigabytes.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.560]   So it's more expensive than my contract.
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.920]   Yeah, but you ever look at what you actually use?
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.400]   No, probably not that much.
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:58.760]   No, typically it's about 80 to 100 gigabytes a month maybe.
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.400]   So it's a buck a gigabyte then.
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:00.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:04.080]   But the user isn't in control of how many gigabytes they use.
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.080]   I mean, your favorite blog redesigns,
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:07.920]   and they use these gigantic pictures and videos
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:08.480]   and stuff like that.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.320]   And it's crude.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.800]   But you should charge them more money.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:15.440]   There's no way that the user is being asked to control
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.080]   something they have no information about
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.400]   and that they can't control.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.520]   Well, no, you can have a meter that shows and monitors.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.600]   But keep in mind also, yes, it's expensive when
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.480]   you're at home all the time.
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.600]   But man, you should see the price gouging when you're
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.280]   on the road.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:31.000]   It's like I pay $15 just to check my email at a stupid hotel
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.600]   Wi-Fi is like once you experience that once,
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.240]   all of a sudden you think, man, I could have watched so many
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:35.760]   movies.
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.680]   I could have done something.
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:38.600]   I don't know how hotels get away with this to be honest with you.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:39.600]   It's just--
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.400]   And the worst part is the fancier a hotel,
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.920]   the classier the price gouging.
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:44.640]   Yeah, you find the middle range hotels.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:47.360]   You have a lot of free Wi-Fi and a lot of other good deals.
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.080]   We're going to take a break.
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.080]   John C. Devorak is here.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.480]   Channeledevorak.com.
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:54.280]   Brian Brushwood from GameOnScam School and schwood.com.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.840]   Mike Elgin of Elgin.com.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.800]   There's a little more Apple.
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.960]   And then there's some other things we can also talk about,
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:01.960]   I hope.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:02.880]   I hope I pray.
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.000]   Let's talk about that video that exploded.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.800]   Over a million thumbs up on it.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.520]   See the Coney--
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.040]   Coney V--
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.160]   It is the mass marketing of a supervillain.
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:11.480]   Yeah.
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:14.320]   It is a calculated-- it is the most media savvy thing
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:14.520]   I've ever witnessed.
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.720]   It's so media savvy.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.600]   We'll talk about it.
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.840]   Even my son said to me, have you seen the Coney video?
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:19.840]   It's very interesting.
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:21.120]   We all realize it's a scam.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.920]   Well, then there's backlash as well.
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:23.920]   Let's talk about it.
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:24.440]   Let's save that.
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.240]   Let's save it.
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.520]   Right now, though, I'd like to talk a little bit.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.200]   That's a good topic, obviously.
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:32.280]   Go to my PC, G-O-T-O, M-Y-P-C.com.
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:35.120]   It is the missing link for remote access
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.320]   if you're using an iPad or an iPhone.
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.160]   Here's the deal.
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.760]   Right now, go to your-- well, if you're not at work,
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:41.280]   you don't have to do this.
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.120]   But if you're at work, go to your office computer.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:46.080]   Go to the website, go to my PC.com.
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:48.280]   Click the Try It Free button and use the offer code to it.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:51.440]   Now, this will be 30 days free.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.400]   You're set.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.960]   Now leave.
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:56.600]   If you've got an iPhone and iPad, leave.
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.520]   You're, of course, a laptop.
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.880]   And you can log into that computer and use it
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.600]   and use every bit of it on the apps, the free apps
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.760]   for the iPad and iPhone.
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.960]   So let's say you're on the way to the airport
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.760]   and you forgot your keynote presentation,
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:14.200]   your PowerPoint presentation, or you need to send a quick office
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.280]   based email.
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.280]   You want to tell the boss, you're still at work late.
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:20.080]   You just log in from your iPhone.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:20.800]   And there it is.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:23.720]   You're running Windows or Macintosh
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:24.360]   on your iPhone.
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.520]   You could send and receive email, access any network resource.
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:29.080]   Run any program just as if you were there.
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:33.160]   I cannot wait to see a Go To My PC app for the new iPad.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.680]   Because then you'll have more resolution.
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:37.760]   You'll actually get the full screen on your iPad.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.720]   It'll be mind boggling.

[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:42.200]   Go to my PC.com.

[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.160]   The offer code is Twit.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.920]   The apps are free.
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.680]   This is remote access done right from Citrix, of course.
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:49.440]   So it's secure.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.120]   It's fast.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.760]   It's easy to use.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.720]   Go to my PC.com offer code Twit.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:56.320]   We thank them for their support this week in tech.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:59.360]   So we did the Pepsi Coke challenge.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.920]   And I drank them both.
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:05.000]   Brushwood, bring the bourbon out here.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.680]   Actually, John does where the bourbon is.
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.240]   I don't know if Ryan does.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:08.920]   I'm sure he does.
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.320]   So let's talk about Coney.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.320]   This thing blew up on the internet.
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:15.080]   Was it been just a week?
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:17.480]   43 million views the last time I checked.
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.600]   I think it's a bot that cranked those numbers up,
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:20.080]   to be honest.
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.480]   Ah, I don't know.
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:24.200]   When I saw the half hour show, I've
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.160]   seen other things that never got in those numbers.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.640]   It is a long video isn't it?
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:28.160]   It isn't a long video.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.160]   It is a long video.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.240]   This one went viral.
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.600]   They've done several of them over the day.
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:31.960]   I think it's a bot.
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:32.960]   I think it had been hit.
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:33.560]   I'll tell you what's going on.
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:34.560]   I'll tell you what's going on.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.040]   Most of this is a charity called Invisible Children.
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:40.120]   This thing was actually produced around 2005, 2004.
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.040]   Oh, it's old.
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:41.560]   It's old.
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:42.560]   It's old.
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.080]   It's been re--
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:43.920]   Not the video, but the--
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.040]   Yes, the video's old.
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.760]   It was been re-edited from a movie that was made.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:50.360]   It's 71 million views, right?
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.560]   I'm not buying any of it.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:52.080]   Yeah.
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:55.800]   So it aims to make a person named Joseph Coney.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:56.840]   That part's OK.
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:57.800]   The guy's a creep.
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:58.400]   Oh, no, but he's--
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.760]   He's been out of office for years.
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:00.920]   For 2005.
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.680]   Yeah, that's when they did the original video.
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.200]   He's not even there.
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:04.040]   He got roasted.
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.280]   And so they kept his video around.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.760]   So what are we going to do now for an encore?
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:07.760]   He's not even in the country.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:08.760]   No, he's not in the country.
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.080]   And he has no army, and the whole thing is over.
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:13.200]   So here's what's brilliant about this.
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:15.640]   Number one, it is beautifully produced.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:17.440]   And the internet, it instantly responds
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:19.360]   to extremely high production value.
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.520]   That's where the money of this organization goes.
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.040]   Into making movies and videos.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:25.520]   Yeah, we'll talk about the backlash here in a moment.
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.080]   But the reason this is a success
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.880]   is because it starts off with a challenge to the viewer.
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.440]   It's got all this beautiful videos.
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:31.880]   He emails video.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:35.920]   And it says, if you stick around,
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.440]   it challenges you to stick around for the whole 30 minutes.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.880]   And here's the most important thing.
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:43.000]   The story is not about the mass tragedy.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.920]   The story is about one individual.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:46.440]   And when they put together-- this
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.240]   is something Chad Johnson told me about--
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:51.360]   when they did studies to see how many kids they could put
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.600]   on screen who are dying of starvation
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.360]   and whether having more starving kids
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.560]   makes you more compassionate.
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:59.120]   Turns out that once you go past one person,
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:02.000]   each additional person you add, just you throw up your hands,
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.280]   you're like, I can't care about this.
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:05.080]   So they make it about one person.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.560]   And it's a very compelling story.
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:07.960]   And then they also make it relatable
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:10.000]   because he keeps putting his five-year-old kid on there
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.160]   or four-year-old kid saying, like, this is a bad guy.
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.240]   Why don't you do something about the bad guy?
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.600]   It is-- it's an amazing video to watch.
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.840]   Now, the backlash-- As a piece of propaganda.
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.680]   Well, yeah, no, as a piece of manipulation,
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.640]   as something to get people motivated.
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.040]   Now, here's the other thing.
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:27.400]   I've not heard one person point out
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.320]   that this is a pitch reel to start a war.
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.600]   This is a-- Over a US involvement in a--
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:33.640]   We are already over there.
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.560]   And this guy's not there anyway.
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:39.160]   So this is not a pitch-- We have 100 advisors in Utah
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:43.200]   to training the army to try and kill him.
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.200]   He isn't in Uganda anymore.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.200]   Hasn't been there for six years.
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:50.160]   Well, and that's-- It's a little baffling, frankly,
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.200]   because I'm not sure what the angle is.
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.920]   Did they ask for money in the video?
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.280]   No, what they ask is for--
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:56.080]   And here's the other thing.
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.680]   They have an action point.
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:01.080]   I think it's on 420, which is interesting, date to pick.
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.800]   They want everybody to go out and put up propaganda posters
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.040]   for Coney 2012.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:08.160]   It taps into that awesome white liberal guilt
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.640]   because we don't have anyone to be afraid of or hate right now.
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.160]   And so we could all feel like we're doing something
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.960]   by wearing a wristband and we have a new bad guy in town.
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.080]   I mean, this is brilliant, brilliant marketing.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:20.360]   But the problem is, is the organization itself,
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.840]   Reddit, took them to task.
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:23.000]   They broke them down.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.560]   They said, here's the breakdown of your financials.
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.480]   You're giving 16% of your total budget to the children.
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:31.480]   The rest is travel over $1 million in travel in one year.
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:34.880]   The rest is filmmaking and marketing and salaries.
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.840]   And over $400,000 for your offices.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:37.280]   This is--
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:39.920]   Not necessarily wrong because this
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.920]   is very effective in awareness raising.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.120]   They're taking the money you donate to them.
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:46.160]   I hope they're being up run about it and not implying
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.680]   that it goes to kids.
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:51.040]   It's going to them to make this propaganda, which
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:54.280]   is apparently very effective in raising awareness.
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.800]   I don't think that's necessarily wrong.
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.840]   They're not saying, you're going to donate money
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.880]   to invisible children and we're going to help the children,
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:01.200]   are they?
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.000]   Or are they?
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.360]   Well, I mean, that's the whole point of it
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.360]   is to help the children.
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:07.040]   But they're helping the children in a different way.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:07.520]   OK.
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:09.760]   They're helping the children by raising awareness and--
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.760]   And collecting money on their behalf.
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:14.440]   My biggest, biggest gripe about this is that they're--
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:17.240]   it's just so obvious to them that the answer is direct military
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.000]   intervention.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   How's that worked out for the US?
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   Is that what they're asking for?
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:20.500]   Yes.
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:21.000]   Yes.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:21.840]   They're saying that because they're
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:22.800]   based on the old movie.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.240]   That's the only reason that came up.
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.160]   And so I can tell.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:26.560]   And there's this bizarre five minutes
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.960]   in the middle where it's nothing but self-congratulation.
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:34.040]   It's so fascinating to watch this explode and the backlash.
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.280]   71 million hit.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.960]   I believe that these are real.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.160]   I understand what you're saying, John,
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.840]   because it's very long.
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:40.520]   In fact, I'm--
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:41.800]   I've been out for a very short time.
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.480]   I've seen viral stuff before.
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:44.840]   And it's never cranked up these numbers like this.
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:47.280]   I always put off, too, because the first minute or so
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:49.200]   is really not even content.
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.800]   It's share this video, share this video,
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:51.440]   share this video.
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:54.360]   The internet is powerful, share this video.
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:56.800]   I wonder how many people watched the whole thing.
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.000]   How many of you in the audience--
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.120]   about 20 people in the audience--
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.080]   watched this entire video?
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:01.840]   Nobody.
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:02.840]   Not one person.
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:04.880]   That's because these numbers are bogus.
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:05.440]   I lean.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.520]   Well, you get a number just by starting.
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:08.840]   I lean.
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:10.360]   You don't get a number for finishing it.
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:11.360]   You get a number for starting.
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:11.840]   Yeah, right.
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:12.520]   Well, that's-- so that starts.
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:14.600]   71 million starts.
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:15.880]   You watched it all the way.
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:16.240]   Start.
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.560]   How many starts?
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:18.560]   All of you started it.
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:19.120]   Me, too.
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:19.840]   I didn't finish it.
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:20.480]   Not all of you.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:21.600]   It's very well-3.
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:22.200]   Very, very well.
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.800]   My son-- it's interesting.
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:27.040]   17-- everybody's talking about it in the high school.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:29.760]   I believe they have 71 million starts.
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:30.440]   I'll tell you.
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:32.600]   You're going to see it on April 20.
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:35.680]   I mean, every kid's going to sneak out of their parents' house
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:36.680]   and feel like they're--
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:37.200]   What are they supposed to do?
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.720]   They're supposed to go around and put up posters.
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.400]   They could say, "Coney 2012."
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.320]   Put it right up next to the Romney and the Obama posters.
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.920]   Oh, they do ask for a donation.
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.240]   Donate to visible children.
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:47.080]   This is interesting.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.680]   You know what the name of the invisible children website is?
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:51.320]   Stayclassy.org.
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.640]   Not San Diego.
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:53.840]   I kid you not.
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:54.800]   That's hilarious.
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:55.320]   Stay--
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:58.160]   There's an invisible children.com site.
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.600]   This is the link on the YouTube.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:02.280]   It's a stayclassy.org.
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:02.640]   That is possible.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:03.920]   Wow, from the chat room, they're saying
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:07.160]   that somebody's English teacher made the whole class watch it.
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:10.080]   I mean, look, nobody disputes that it's a good cause
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.160]   to not want children to get their faces cut up
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:13.720]   and not want to get children.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:15.640]   Well, that's why it's difficult to criticize,
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:18.080]   because of course, Coney is a creep,
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:21.080]   and what he's doing is horrendous.
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.880]   But the problem is that they're calling for everybody
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:27.200]   to a financial system with the government, which also
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.680]   has child soldiers, which also does all these things.
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:30.440]   I mean, there aren't--
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:32.240]   There are actual legitimate charities.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:33.960]   And that's the real problem.
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:38.600]   This is a political-- this is a whole area where none of us
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:39.600]   know anything about it.
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:40.560]   We have no idea.
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.080]   The worst parts of the world are the parts
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:43.760]   where there aren't enough government
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:46.640]   to protect basic civil liberties and to enforce contract law
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:47.160]   and stuff.
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.880]   If you want to do something, I would imagine,
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:50.920]   to just give Bill Gates a billion dollars,
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:51.840]   and just have him fix it.
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:52.680]   And the software power--
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:55.160]   Yeah, because he's gotten this horrible.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:56.120]   But the good--
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:57.480]   How about Doctors Without Borders?
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:58.240]   There's a good opportunity.
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:58.720]   There you go.
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.840]   The good thing about this is that all these kids who
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:02.360]   have their heads wrapped around social media
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:05.520]   are actually learning that Uganda exists, that bad people
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:08.680]   exist, that all-- so it's an entree into reading and learning
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:09.180]   more.
[00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:10.840]   And all this debate about how it's baloney and all that stuff
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:11.920]   is also good.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:13.960]   Some of those people who are sharing and putting up
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.720]   signs and all that stuff are going to actually educate
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:21.200]   themselves about an issue that is of the type that kids
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.120]   don't know anything about.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.080]   So it's actually kind of cool in that regard.
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.160]   Yeah, it's kind of cool since our educational system.
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:28.840]   You can't seem to get it together
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:30.680]   to teach the kids anything about world events.
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:31.440]   I'll tell you what, though.
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.840]   The internet-- with Khan Academy and what's
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.640]   possible on the internet, it almost
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:39.040]   makes me feel good about who cares
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.360]   what the educational system's like,
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:42.760]   because you could get as smart as you want, as fast as you
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:43.680]   want, thanks to the internet now.
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:44.560]   You know what's so weird?
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.640]   I thought the way this was done with the Action Kit
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:48.560]   that this guy was running for something.
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:49.760]   Well, that's what they're--
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.000]   It's very strange.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:51.840]   That's what they're trying to do.
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:55.320]   It feels like he's running for president in 2012.
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.640]   By the way, they say--
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:58.080]   That's simple, by the way.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:00.200]   The upside down piece sign would try at the time.
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:00.920]   They want to end piece.
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:02.800]   They want the soldiers to go in and kill this guy.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:03.520]   Actually, that's right.
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:04.560]   It's too much piece.
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:06.200]   Too much piece in the world.
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.680]   So you do have to wonder, who are these people?
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.080]   They claim that they are storytellers, activists,
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:13.520]   and everyday people who use the power of media
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:14.720]   to inspire young people.
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:15.920]   We make documentaries.
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:17.160]   So they're not lying about that.
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.720]   But then in the next paragraph, it says,
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:19.520]   we don't stop there.
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:22.200]   Our development professionals from Central Africa
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:25.680]   partner with local communities, education programs,
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:26.880]   economic initiatives.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:28.960]   So it does imply that if you're giving them money,
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:32.600]   some of that money is going to go to fixing the problem.
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:35.040]   So out of everything in the video,
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:36.800]   the most brilliant one is the fact
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.160]   that they've set a deadline for it.
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:40.240]   The fact that they've created this artificial deadline of,
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:42.720]   it has to happen this year, or it'll never happen.
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.720]   And as just a Robert Young points out,
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.720]   the classic element of every long con
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:50.080]   is the part where you explain, and that's
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.920]   why you have to give me that money right now.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:55.080]   It's brilliant.
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:57.440]   They do have long con.
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:01.880]   Well, they do now have a page called critiques
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:07.000]   that responds to the criticism and offers financial statements.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.160]   I mean, they're trying to be transparent here.
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:11.480]   They do admit the way we achieve our goals
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:13.440]   is to make the world aware of the LRA,
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:16.280]   channel energy from viewers of our films
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:18.280]   into large-scale advocacy campaigns.
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:20.120]   And then they mention in part three
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:21.640]   is to operate programs on the ground.
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:23.760]   Here's their breakdown of expenses.
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:26.840]   I think they are attempting to respond to these.
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:28.280]   They want to make movies.
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:29.720]   They've only made this one movie.
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.720]   I mean, they made Invisible Children in 2006.
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:32.960]   There's a good wiki page on it.
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:35.280]   If you go to Invisible Children on the wiki
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:37.000]   on the book of Knowledge.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.240]   And then they've got this Coney 2012 thing,
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:41.360]   which is their latest thing, which is--
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.760]   Do you think this is a bunch of people?
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:43.560]   This is one guy.
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:44.320]   Yeah, but they show.
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:45.480]   They're really-- no, it's a bunch of people.
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.680]   Directed by Jason Russell, which is the guy in this thing,
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:50.880]   but also Bobby Bailey, Lauren Poole, music--
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.160]   they got a music guy.
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:55.640]   I think it's a little team, probably about 10 people.
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:57.600]   So look, there's no doubt these--
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:00.320]   This is too slick to be some guy cranking this thing out
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.920]   on Final Cut Pro at home.
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:04.640]   These are extremely well-intentioned people.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:05.520]   There's no doubt about that.
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:07.360]   But there's a lot that they got to clear up
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:10.320]   if they want to actually make something happen.
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:13.160]   Invisible Children has a two-star rating and accountability
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:15.760]   because they refuse to allow outside audits
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:17.080]   of their financials.
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:19.840]   So again, maybe those numbers are exactly right
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:20.840]   what they're putting on the website.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:21.360]   But they're not awesome.
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:22.720]   But we can't know unless there's a third party.
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:24.280]   I think what they are is they're a new type
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:26.160]   of documentary filmmaker.
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:31.560]   It's a documentary with the spin of advocacy and a cause
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:33.960]   and a call to action that's very specific, almost all
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:37.280]   documentaries from Super Size Me to whatever,
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:40.360]   are generally trying to get you to do something, generally
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.200]   trying to get you to be against something
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:43.440]   or in favor of something.
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:45.160]   But these guys are taking it further
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.920]   and saying, we want you to do something very, very specific.
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:49.320]   What, and very, very simple--
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:50.720]   No, that's the thing.
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.840]   They understand the message is the right message.
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:55.360]   The guys at Genuine Creeper, the story of the one kid who
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:57.120]   escaped is extremely compelling.
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:59.960]   And the answer, go out and spend a night on the town
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:02.560]   putting up posters in a month, sounds awesome.
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:05.240]   But the takeaway is that they're more Michael Moore
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:06.480]   than they are Amnesty International.
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:07.000]   Absolutely.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:07.960]   They're filmmakers.
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:08.560]   Absolutely.
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:09.920]   That is the takeaway.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:10.680]   Absolutely.
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:12.560]   More Michael Moore.
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:13.520]   It's interesting.
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:14.920]   And the video is--
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:16.840]   You mean Michael Moore, like Michael Moore, the guy who
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:19.240]   actually did have meetings with Smith, the General Motors,
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:20.720]   even though he claimed he never did?
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:21.320]   Oh, really?
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:21.820]   Yeah.
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:23.820]   That's kind of the scandalous part that--
[00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:24.100]   Yes.
[00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:26.220]   They posted this March 5th.
[00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:28.980]   So in less than a week, 70 million views
[00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:30.700]   is pretty astounded.
[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:32.920]   And also, look at the-- even with the backlash,
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:35.860]   less than 1% thumbs down on the video.
[00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:38.260]   And before the backlash started, it was even more.
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.180]   It was like 99.9% all positive.
[00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:40.980]   Still, the way it spun.
[00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:42.900]   It's like, boo, I hate children.
[00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:45.900]   You know, it's like, what are you going to--
[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:50.660]   I do think it's a lesson in propaganda, in polemic,
[00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:54.500]   not necessarily for ill, maybe for good, but fascinating,
[00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:56.820]   and also a lesson in the use of social media.
[00:48:56.820 --> 00:49:00.340]   One of the things they did is they've targeted celebrities,
[00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:03.780]   20 celebrity culture makers and 12 policymakers,
[00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:07.260]   trying to get everybody to tweet them, to message them,
[00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:08.020]   to talk to them.
[00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:09.700]   Oprah is one of them.
[00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:13.100]   Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Lady Gaga, Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:14.220]   Look at the second list.
[00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:15.740]   Do you have to listen in front of you?
[00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:17.980]   There's a couple of screwy people on there.
[00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:21.380]   Oprah, Rihanna, and Justin Bieber.
[00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:23.740]   It's an interesting-- well, but look,
[00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:25.300]   people asked me to tweet it.
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:27.980]   I actually held off because I wasn't sure.
[00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:29.620]   I wanted to hear more about it.
[00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:31.180]   This is the amazing thing.
[00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:33.460]   10 years ago, if you had discovered
[00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:36.660]   a document from an internal document from some company
[00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:38.260]   saying, we're going to target these 20 people
[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:39.220]   and try to convince them, and they'll
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:40.660]   become our public mouthpieces, it
[00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:43.220]   would have been a giant PR backlash on you.
[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:45.340]   But now they build it into the documentary,
[00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:47.340]   just transparent and in the open.
[00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:49.380]   And as a result, everyone's like, yeah, sure, that's great.
[00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:49.980]   Go.
[00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:54.380]   It's amazing to me how different we perceive a targeted strike
[00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:56.060]   like this now.
[00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:56.700]   Fascinating.
[00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:58.100]   I just find it very interesting.
[00:49:58.100 --> 00:49:59.420]   I find it disturbing.
[00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:00.140]   Do you?
[00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:00.780]   Yeah.
[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:01.780]   Because they're so expensive.
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:02.100]   Less transparency.
[00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:02.900]   No, because they're good.
[00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:05.740]   Well, I think I've questioned the numbers.
[00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:07.420]   I don't like any bit of it.
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:08.660]   I think the whole thing is--
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:09.340]   It smells.
[00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:10.540]   Yeah, it stinks.
[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:11.980]   You don't believe 71 million.
[00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:13.820]   Well, I don't believe it's 71 million for stars.
[00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:14.980]   And I don't know how hard it would be.
[00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:16.540]   And I think we talked to some people about this--
[00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:16.900]   Make a lot.
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:17.900]   To make a bot network.
[00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:18.740]   A bot network bot.
[00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:19.060]   Yeah.
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:20.340]   Yeah, they could click away.
[00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:21.860]   Have you watched the whole thing?
[00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:22.300]   Yeah.
[00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:22.740]   OK.
[00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:26.220]   Well, see, the moment I saw it, I knew this was going to be huge.
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:28.260]   I believe the YouTube numbers entirely-- now,
[00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:31.380]   they're accused of exaggerating the numbers of kidnappings
[00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:33.100]   and the current state of disaster.
[00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:34.020]   I just don't have to say--
[00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:34.900]   I just don't have to exaggerate other things.
[00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:38.540]   YouTube numbers are generally inflated anyway.
[00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:39.940]   Because if you started, it's a view.
[00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:40.300]   Right.
[00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:44.100]   And we see numbers that-- look, I know a little bit
[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:45.300]   about what numbers are.
[00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:48.060]   And then what this show does, what CNN does,
[00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:49.340]   what the screen savers did.
[00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:52.580]   And these numbers are orders of magnitude larger than any media
[00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:53.500]   I've ever seen.
[00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:56.420]   But everybody, in fact, is talking about it, including us.
[00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:56.540]   Yeah.
[00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:58.620]   For about 10 minutes, and this show alone--
[00:50:58.620 --> 00:50:58.620]   A lot of it.
[00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:01.180]   Is it added 10,000 views in the last 10 minutes?
[00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:01.540]   Maybe.
[00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:03.420]   A lot of it, perhaps.
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:05.500]   A lot of it, though, is because of those numbers
[00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:08.100]   are so attractive to invite discussion.
[00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:09.100]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:10.100]   If it weren't 71 million, would we talk about?
[00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:11.460]   But nobody questions the numbers.
[00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:12.220]   That's what gets me.
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:14.340]   I have heard nobody say anything about it.
[00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:16.700]   And you know, as well as I do, how these things work
[00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:19.820]   and how you can create a network to pound the site.
[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:20.940]   Let's do it.
[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:21.500]   We could.
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:23.020]   Can we do it for our shows instead?
[00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:24.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:25.260]   I want to take a break.
[00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:26.460]   Come back with more.
[00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:27.980]   This is a great conversation.
[00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:30.580]   We have Google to talk about why our company is leaving
[00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:33.820]   Google Maps, and a lot more in just a little bit.
[00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:36.780]   But first, a reminder that squarespace.com is offering you
[00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:38.700]   a very good deal right now.

[00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:38.620]   and take a look at what people are doing with Squarespace.
[00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:40.660]   A 24/7 support team.

[00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:52.260]   to help you get the most out of your Squarespace website.
[00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:52.980]   Great stuff.
[00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:55.540]   Squarespace-- and I have to tell you, I've been playing with 6.
[00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:58.300]   I'm moving my LEO field to Squarespace 6.
[00:52:58.300 --> 00:52:59.100]   Just incredible.
[00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:01.340]   6 will be out soon.
[00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:04.740]   The hosting, the software, all together, this is great.
[00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:06.860]   Do you know what we started doing with Squarespace?
[00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:08.380]   It is when you have an event--
[00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:09.340]   Add Hawks sites.
[00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:11.740]   Yeah, when you have an event that's less than two weeks away,
[00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:13.180]   just jump on to do the free trial.
[00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:14.740]   When we did our NSFW event.
[00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:16.260]   Yeah, we did our NSFW event.
[00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:16.620]   Sure.
[00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:17.900]   I didn't want just the tweet.
[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:20.540]   I wanted the tweet to link to something that would be there
[00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:21.700]   for the next two weeks.
[00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:22.620]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:24.020]   You let it expire and you've done it.
[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:24.900]   Squarespace loves that.
[00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:26.660]   That's not-- you're not taking a-- no,
[00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:29.140]   because they know the more often you use the tool,
[00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:30.900]   even if you're using it just on the free trial,
[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:33.340]   that when you need the product and you're
[00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:35.140]   in a place to spend money, that they'll do it.
[00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:36.740]   You do some great stuff with Squarespace.
[00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:38.980]   In fact, I love your ads for Squarespace.
[00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:40.620]   But I just want people to go there right now.
[00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:43.060]   Squarespace.com, if you decide to buy,
[00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:44.220]   prices are very affordable.
[00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:46.020]   Remember, you're getting hosting and the software
[00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:47.980]   for as little as $12 a month.
[00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:51.860]   If you decide to buy, use our offer code TWIT3 for March,
[00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:52.940]   TWIT3.
[00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:55.700]   Well, it could be also for 30% off for three months.
[00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:56.300]   That's the deal.
[00:53:56.300 --> 00:54:00.620]   30% off for three months when you use the offer code TWIT3.
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:04.180]   Anthony and the gang at Squarespace are just fantastic.
[00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:05.900]   We love being a part of Squarespace.
[00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:07.820]   And my job tonight when I go home
[00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:09.780]   is to start working on that Squarespace 6 site.
[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:10.860]   I'm so excited.
[00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:12.740]   I'm really looking forward to it.
[00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:17.580]   So Apple, when they showed the iPad and they showed Maps,
[00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:19.420]   showed something that didn't look like anything
[00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:21.220]   we'd ever seen before.
[00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:25.340]   It apparently have abandoned Google Maps.
[00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:26.740]   And they're not the only ones, are they?
[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:27.540]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:29.300]   I knew that Apple hated Google.
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:31.620]   So I wasn't surprised to see them abandon Google Maps.
[00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:33.900]   And keep in mind, this isn't for core stuff.
[00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:36.100]   This is just in the iPhoto, right?
[00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:37.500]   For the geoteggings, that's right.
[00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:40.300]   Yeah, they still have Google Maps app, but I get bet you
[00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:41.460]   anything that won't be much fun.
[00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:43.340]   I mean, both of these Squares not using it anymore.
[00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:47.700]   Both Four Square and Apple have been directly
[00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:50.540]   competed against by Google.
[00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:52.540]   And in Apple's case, this is something
[00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:56.020]   that I specifically predicted as part of their thermonuclear
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:59.100]   war, where they're just going to start abandoning Google
[00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:04.540]   services, including soon enough, Google search itself, which
[00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:05.580]   Siri currently uses.
[00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:09.460]   But eventually, Apple wants to get us all using Siri instead
[00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:10.060]   of searching.
[00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:11.580]   And then they'll swap out the search engine.
[00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:12.540]   So Google isn't involved.
[00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:15.140]   But basically, if you want to get Google out of the mix,
[00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:15.860]   that's right.
[00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:24.060]   Because Google wants to destroy Four Square and--
[00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:26.340]   Wait, why would they want to destroy Four Square?
[00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:29.420]   Because they want to do everything that they do.
[00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:32.740]   They want to take their location--
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:34.740]   But do you really have to adapt the motivation
[00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:35.580]   to destroy Four Square?
[00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:36.140]   But I have a--
[00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:37.260]   They must die.
[00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:38.500]   They want all the money.
[00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:39.020]   Yes, they think that--
[00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:39.340]   Well, yeah.
[00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:41.860]   And they've been doing it for free for coming up at half decade.
[00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:43.980]   But eventually, they're going to want all the money in that space.
[00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:44.980]   And yes, that's the motivation.
[00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:45.820]   They want all the money.
[00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:46.320]   OK.
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:46.340]   But--
[00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:47.340]   And if there's no money for--
[00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:49.580]   Well, you just got a bad attitude about that, guys.
[00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:50.900]   Wait, maybe they want some money.
[00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:53.060]   Is it OK for them to ask for some money?
[00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:53.860]   Because it's been free.
[00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:55.460]   You know, all the money.
[00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:56.860]   They have tech charges for it.
[00:55:56.860 --> 00:55:58.900]   Tell Star-- all these companies charge for their data.
[00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:00.700]   It's very expensive to create this data.
[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:03.940]   But the point is that if you're in direct--
[00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:05.340]   you're looking at a future where you're
[00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:07.740]   going to be really in heated competition with them,
[00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:09.620]   you don't want to get your maps from them.
[00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:12.140]   I mean, it's not a comfortable position to be in.
[00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:14.020]   Well, I mean, if they were to violate that,
[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:16.180]   I mean, that would be illegal for the miscreary over.
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:17.940]   You can't-- I mean, look at what Google's--
[00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:19.460]   Google's been very aggressive lately
[00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:22.020]   at being super competitive about things
[00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:23.540]   and saying, just basically grabbing stuff
[00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:24.980]   and saying, well, we're going to do this.
[00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:26.260]   We're going to put Google on the search.
[00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:27.260]   I think Microsoft--
[00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:28.460]   It's a Microsoft approach.
[00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:28.980]   --the Microsoft approach.
[00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:30.180]   Really, Microsoft--
[00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:32.620]   Why are you just always embracing Devour or both of them
[00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:34.620]   and saying, "Grace and replace them."
[00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:38.500]   But I just-- these guys have to go to their investors
[00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:42.420]   and say, yeah, we depend entirely on our direct competitor.
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:42.940]   Well--
[00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:44.420]   It's not a good meeting.
[00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:47.700]   Yes, the problem is Google's maps in particular are--
[00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:48.540]   Are they bad?
[00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:49.860]   --street, view, bad.
[00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:50.740]   They're unbelievable.
[00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:51.220]   They're great.
[00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:53.100]   Microsoft's Bing is-- Bing Maps is very good.
[00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:53.540]   But now--
[00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:55.660]   Yeah, but you don't have a street map that I tried to trust it.
[00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:56.180]   --it's house.
[00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:57.420]   I mean, there's steps.
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:56:58.660]   You can go street view.
[00:56:58.660 --> 00:56:59.860]   You can look overhead.
[00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:02.180]   It's like amazing.
[00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:03.860]   They have gone out of their way to make that a killer.
[00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:06.380]   Sunday we'll be able to go into the house, go through the house.
[00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:07.340]   I went through the bathroom.
[00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:09.860]   If that ever happened, it wouldn't surprise me.
[00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:10.820]   Can't we opt in?
[00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:12.300]   I don't want to go to the bathroom.
[00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:12.820]   I know.
[00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:12.820]   I know.
[00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:14.060]   You forgot about the bathroom.
[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:16.900]   What is this waterless toilet you've got in the bathroom here?
[00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:17.420]   That's right.
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:19.140]   Well, we just want to be green.
[00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:20.500]   Do you-- because I remember the toilet--
[00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:22.020]   You saw it was Google Maps.
[00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:23.060]   --in Google Maps.
[00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:24.060]   You can go check it out.
[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:24.540]   You just--
[00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:27.500]   You had another toilet before, and it blew up or something,
[00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:28.300]   and then you had this--
[00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:30.340]   We've always had that waterless toilet.
[00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:33.340]   I missed the sign that said, for a good time, call Leo.
[00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:34.340]   I like that sign.
[00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:36.460]   I think it reminds you to pee on the bee.
[00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:38.500]   You know who you are is what I said on there.
[00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:39.820]   Now I got to put you in the bathroom.
[00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:40.820]   I wonder.
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:42.100]   That's when they're for-- as since we moved in.
[00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:43.660]   Anyway, I want to point out-- first of all,
[00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:46.180]   I want to give a lot of props to OpenStreetMap.
[00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:47.820]   This is a really amazing group.
[00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:50.860]   OpenStreetMap.org, it's open source mapping.
[00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:53.340]   The reason they're doing this is anybody with a GPS
[00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:55.100]   can contribute to this map.
[00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:56.900]   You don't even need a GPS if you want,
[00:57:56.900 --> 00:57:58.740]   because you can just sign up and say, hey,
[00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:00.060]   I'd like to improve this map.
[00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:01.980]   I live in this neighborhood, and that street's wrong.
[00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:03.380]   That street's one way.
[00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:05.060]   And it does a great job.
[00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:07.380]   And I would say they're mapping data.
[00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:10.060]   Hand done, effectively, is in many ways
[00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:11.300]   competitive with Googles.
[00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:13.860]   Doesn't work as well in areas that are thinly populated.
[00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:16.020]   But if you're looking at a city, it's great.
[00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:18.100]   But Apple did something interesting.
[00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:22.860]   Apple's Maps, which look very cool, these map tiles and retro,
[00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:26.700]   they're using the data from OpenStreetMap.
[00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:29.420]   That's the OpenStreetMap version of this area.
[00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:36.580]   And this is on a blog, alastaira.wordpress.com.
[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:38.020]   And she's compared those.
[00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:40.900]   And OpenStreetMap's themselves say, yes, it is apparent
[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:43.940]   that Apple's using our data, two-year-old data,
[00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:45.500]   in violation of our license.
[00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:47.940]   You're supposed to acknowledge that.
[00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:49.180]   We have newer data.
[00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:52.140]   We don't understand why Apple's using this older data.
[00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:56.300]   And they say, we hope that Apple will come into compliance
[00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:57.060]   with our agreement.
[00:58:57.060 --> 00:58:58.060]   They were being very nice.
[00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:01.500]   And we're using-- we're thrilled that Apple's using this.
[00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:04.220]   And we understand that Apple probably just forgot to.
[00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:05.340]   Oh, yeah, they forgot.
[00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:06.300]   They forgot to thank us.
[00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:07.220]   They're careless.
[00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:09.020]   And I'm sure they will.
[00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:11.180]   So think in terms of-- these guys
[00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:14.420]   are the Wikipedia to Googles Encyclopedia Britannic.
[00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:18.140]   So with Wikipedia, it's up to the minute.
[00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:21.020]   And again, there'll be parts with higher fidelity
[00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:21.900]   than other parts.
[00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:23.380]   But it's not very pretty.
[00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:24.700]   They don't have a very pretty display.
[00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:25.140]   So they said--
[00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:25.700]   It's OK.
[00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:26.100]   That's why--
[00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:27.540]   But I would understand why.
[00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:30.020]   Both Four Square and Apple are going to great pains
[00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:31.180]   to clean everything up.
[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:34.580]   I got to think that this was a--
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:37.940]   it is a significant slip up for as media savvy as Apple
[00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:41.660]   tends to be for them to not give mad props to the folks
[00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:42.620]   where they get into the improv.
[00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:43.980]   They're using it for iPhoto.
[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:46.700]   So it's not like it's being used as a mapping.
[00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:49.020]   You're not getting turned by turn directions from this thing.
[00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:51.660]   It's for geo-losing your photos.
[00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:53.820]   So it's kind of a minor feature.
[00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:55.740]   So I think it's entirely possible that--
[00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:57.860]   Even if it's old data, it doesn't really matter.
[00:59:57.860 --> 00:59:58.340]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:59:58.340 --> 00:59:59.420]   You're not looking for--
[00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:00.020]   Exactly.
[01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:03.220]   And so, you know, and I'm sure that something
[01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:03.900]   has to come up with this.
[01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:06.500]   Jonathan Bennett writing in the OpenStreetMap Foundation
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:09.100]   blog says, welcome, Apple.
[01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:11.820]   We're rather pleased.
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.940]   They say the data is rather old.
[01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:16.300]   So don't expect to see your latest and greatest updates
[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:16.620]   on there.
[01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:19.980]   It's also missing the necessary credit to our contributors.
[01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:22.820]   We look forward to working with Apple to get that on there.
[01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:23.780]   Oh, dude.
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:25.620]   That's all code for--
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:27.300]   How many zeros in that check?
[01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:28.740]   Well, no, no, no.
[01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:29.740]   Donations in order.
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:30.860]   It's free.
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:31.860]   And all they have to do--
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:33.260]   Do they have a comment--
[01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:34.220]   It's Creative Commons?
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:35.500]   Well, they have to chip in on there.
[01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.740]   There's legal aspects to Creative Commons crediting.
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:39.860]   Actually, I don't know what the crediting agreement is.
[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:41.020]   But there is a license agreement.
[01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:44.420]   You're allowed to use it, but you do have to give credit.
[01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:45.860]   That's, I think--
[01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:48.300]   If I can be slightly conspiratorial,
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:51.180]   it's possible that Apple--
[01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:53.260]   first of all, if somebody brought up in the meeting,
[01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:54.220]   hey, this is--
[01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:55.940]   Yeah, it's open source and all that stuff.
[01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:57.340]   But we have to give them credit.
[01:00:57.340 --> 01:00:58.460]   We have to do this out in the other thing.
[01:00:58.460 --> 01:00:59.740]   And they probably said, you know what?
[01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:01.780]   If we have to do that, they'll call us out on it.
[01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:03.380]   We can do that retroactively.
[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:04.260]   Meanwhile--
[01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:04.660]   Which is the--
[01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:06.340]   Everybody's talking about the maps--
[01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:07.100]   It's a picture of--
[01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:08.940]   Of iPhoto for iOS.
[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:09.900]   I mean, it's--
[01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:11.060]   Do you think--
[01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:13.220]   Wait, do you think they just didn't plan on getting
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:14.180]   this much attention?
[01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:16.020]   If this didn't happen, nobody would even
[01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:18.580]   be thinking about geographic data in iPhoto.
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:20.020]   Well, do you think this is on purpose?
[01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:21.580]   They did this to start up a little bit.
[01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:22.020]   I don't.
[01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:24.180]   But if it had been, it would have been a great idea.
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:25.820]   There's no such thing--
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:27.140]   There's no such thing as--
[01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:27.980]   Why didn't they think--
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:30.140]   It's very soft core conspiracy theory right there.
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:30.740]   I must say--
[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:33.820]   Everybody's going to know that iPhoto for iOS
[01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:35.220]   has this mapping stuff in there.
[01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:37.220]   And they're going to want to learn more about that.
[01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:39.420]   Apple's tiles, by the way, look great.
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:41.900]   This is the open street map tile.
[01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:43.940]   This is the Apple tile.
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:45.500]   So they had some--
[01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:47.860]   Obviously, they didn't have an illustrator do it all.
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:51.580]   But they had somebody create, I guess, a program
[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:54.820]   to take this data and retro it, is kind of where it looks like.
[01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:56.220]   Apple do the classy thing, right?
[01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:57.220]   These guys are check.
[01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:58.820]   They're doing really good work.
[01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:01.300]   And you can't lose by donating for them.
[01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:03.980]   So that's the open street map, which is pure function.
[01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:05.660]   Only have $100 billion in the bank.
[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:06.140]   Well, yeah.
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:06.940]   They can't afford it.
[01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:07.340]   $500 billion.
[01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:10.500]   They have $500 billion in cash laying around.
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:11.020]   No.
[01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:12.260]   That's $100 billion.
[01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:14.380]   They have $3 trillion.
[01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:16.500]   I saw it on the internet.
[01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:19.300]   I have to say, I've used in Love Open Street Map.
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:23.780]   It's used in a lot of apps that can't afford to buy Google Maps.
[01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:26.860]   And these guys, a lot of contributors, every map
[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:29.140]   is done by thousands of volunteers.
[01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:30.700]   And I do think they deserve credit.
[01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:32.780]   And it's a little cheesy of Apple.
[01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:34.260]   What Open Street Map pointed out is Apple
[01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:35.900]   has a lot of open source projects.
[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:36.860]   They support open source.
[01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:38.180]   They give backed open source.
[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:41.620]   So surely, it was just an oversight.
[01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:44.380]   I would really like you to correct that Apple,
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:45.820]   because this is a good group.
[01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:47.220]   And you got standing with Apple.
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:49.260]   And it looked-- yeah, well, they're listening to me.
[01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:52.580]   And I just think it just seems inappropriate, frankly,
[01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:54.140]   to do this.
[01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:57.020]   So why are companies defecting from Google?
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:03:00.740]   Besides the fact that you think Google is trying to kill them?
[01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:03.580]   I can't believe they're just asking for some money,
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:05.900]   not all the money.
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:08.020]   It's an exaggeration to say they're trying to kill them.
[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:11.100]   I'm sure that Google would love for them to not die,
[01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:13.780]   as long as they get 100% of the revenue from that money.
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:17.620]   Every company that's publicly traded in every market
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:21.580]   is trying to get as much business from that market as possible.
[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:23.020]   And that's 100%.
[01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:24.540]   That's what's best the maximum possible.
[01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:26.460]   The question is, there are two different ways to do that.
[01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:29.180]   You can either do that by investing in where
[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:31.620]   there's relatively wide open fields,
[01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:32.940]   that there's just money laying everywhere.
[01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:34.100]   You can run over there and grab it.
[01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:35.900]   Or you could do it by consolidating everything
[01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:37.700]   and saying, OK, there's only so much money here.
[01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:38.820]   Let's get all the money there is.
[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:42.460]   I still think Google's very much focused on the bigger picture.
[01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:43.580]   They're still running around grabbing
[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:45.660]   where there are dollars that nobody even realizes here.
[01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:47.060]   Well, but that's Google's perspective.
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:49.060]   From the perspective of Four Square,
[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:51.180]   anybody else who's both competing with
[01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:53.220]   and entirely depending on Google,
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:54.660]   it's an uncomfortable relationship,
[01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:56.860]   especially given Google's newfound aggressiveness
[01:03:56.860 --> 01:03:58.660]   under Larry Page.
[01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:00.620]   And they've just demonstrated that, look,
[01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:02.300]   we're going to dominate these markets.
[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:03.740]   We're going to have a single unified product
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:06.060]   where everything is all about Google.
[01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:07.820]   And that's just an uncomfortable thing.
[01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:10.220]   And I think that's what these two things have in common, Apple.
[01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:14.660]   And Four Square, they're both competing aggressively with Google.
[01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:18.140]   And they don't like relying on their competitor.
[01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:20.180]   Do you think Larry's going to be the next Bill Gates,
[01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:22.220]   where everyone thinks he's the devil until he retires?
[01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:22.820]   I think Larry's the--
[01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:26.420]   I think Larry's the new Steve Jobs, actually.
[01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:27.100]   The cutthroat guy.
[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:29.020]   He certainly has taken a lot of lessons from Steve.
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:29.820]   And admits it.
[01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:30.180]   Yes.
[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:34.060]   And admits it says he's my mentor.
[01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:36.980]   Everybody just looks right to John.
[01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:38.180]   What am I supposed to say?
[01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:38.700]   I don't know.
[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:39.660]   I'm just giving you a chance.
[01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:40.780]   Google's that bad.
[01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:43.700]   I mean, I don't think that Larry's that type of guy.
[01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:46.740]   I think he's a little soft-spoken, generally speaking.
[01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:50.540]   He doesn't stick himself out there like Steve Jobs used to do,
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:54.980]   or he's always showing up all the time.
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:56.300]   I'm not buying this theory.
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:58.860]   I think it's an interesting idea that they're trying to screw everybody back.
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:00.780]   I think they want Four Square to succeed.
[01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:03.220]   And I just think Four Square said, I don't want to pay money.
[01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:05.500]   I like the theory, but I'm not buying it personally.
[01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:06.980]   They can't donate this stuff forever.
[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:08.100]   Come on.
[01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:10.380]   He's just trying to put them on a good financial footing.
[01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:11.820]   You know, Google's really hurting.
[01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:13.300]   Besides that, they could--
[01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:15.900]   They could buy them if they really thought it was that important.
[01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:17.300]   Four Square or Apple?
[01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:18.220]   Apple could buy Google?
[01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:19.500]   No, well, they could buy Apple.
[01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:21.260]   Actually, Apple could-- no, they can't.
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:22.140]   Apple should buy Google.
[01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:23.300]   Can't be done.
[01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:25.460]   But they could buy Four Square.
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:25.940]   Google.
[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:27.220]   They easily could buy Four Square.
[01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:28.500]   You know why they won't?
[01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:31.300]   Because the guy who founded Four Square has already been bought by Google
[01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:32.180]   and hated it.
[01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:33.780]   He sold a company called Dodge Baldon.
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:34.220]   Oh, that's right.
[01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:37.460]   Yeah, that's why it's called Four Squares because it was the heart of a square.
[01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:38.620]   I think it was right.
[01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:39.820]   I forgot all about that.
[01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:40.620]   Again, yeah.
[01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:41.420]   And they killed them.
[01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:44.580]   Google, OK, well, then there's even more validity to the system.
[01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:45.980]   He's not-- yeah, he worked at Google.
[01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:47.340]   So he knows a little bit about that.
[01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:49.340]   Why isn't Google buying any companies anymore?
[01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:50.580]   They bought like a gazillion companies last year.
[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:52.660]   Last year was the year of acquisition and they stopped.
[01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:53.140]   This year, it's nothing.
[01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:55.180]   Larry, I'm telling you, Larry has--
[01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:56.620]   Oh, maybe Larry's taking that idea.
[01:05:56.620 --> 01:06:00.620]   Like, why are we-- because all buying decisions are make-by decisions.
[01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:03.100]   So you have the thing-- and I've always criticized some of these companies.
[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:03.940]   You're just buying up.
[01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:04.900]   What does it make-by decision?
[01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:06.940]   A make-by decision is you've got a thing you want to do.
[01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:11.260]   You want to make this kind of a product and say, we can buy these guys who do this
[01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:13.820]   already, or we can make it ourselves.
[01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:17.820]   And so you do a calculation and say, how long would it take us to ramp up and make the same
[01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:19.860]   product and compete with these guys?
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:21.980]   And you say, well, it would take a year.
[01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:22.980]   And how much would it cost us?
[01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:25.940]   It would cost us twice as much as if we bought these guys.
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:26.940]   That should make-by decisions.
[01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:28.100]   So you just buy the guys.
[01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:29.100]   Right.
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:34.180]   But most make-by decisions, it seems to me to be-- they seem to be based on time structures.
[01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:39.260]   It seems to be based on time structures because the fact is you have only a limited amount
[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:41.940]   of time where you can get into that business.
[01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:46.180]   And so if it's going to take you too long, you'll spend extra money for the make decision
[01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:49.500]   and you'll-- or the buy decision, you'll buy these guys anyway, even though you could
[01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:50.500]   have done it.
[01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:51.500]   Right.
[01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:52.500]   Could easily do it.
[01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:53.500]   Yeah, could easily do it.
[01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:54.500]   They don't need to buy anybody.
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:55.500]   Google's got latitude.
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:58.100]   Google has something very similar before Square.
[01:06:58.100 --> 01:06:59.100]   Does anybody use it?
[01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:00.100]   I mean, I use it a little bit, but--
[01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:01.100]   I use it.
[01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:02.100]   It's on.
[01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:03.100]   If you wanted to track me, you could.
[01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:07.620]   Well, like anything else, anything social related, the value to it depends on who you
[01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:08.860]   know that's using it as well.
[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:10.460]   And if you're the only one, what's the point?
[01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:12.900]   Well, I'll be your latitude buddy if you'll be my latitude.
[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:13.900]   Okay.
[01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:16.660]   Speaking of which, how come everybody at Twit loves path?
[01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:17.660]   Why?
[01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:18.660]   What's up with path?
[01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:19.660]   I don't.
[01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:20.660]   I have a few hands.
[01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:21.660]   I don't use it.
[01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:22.660]   Leo, this is my curious of why people like you.
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:23.660]   Do you use paths?
[01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:24.660]   I do.
[01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:25.660]   You're on it, but you don't post much.
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:26.660]   I don't post much.
[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:28.220]   I try to a little bit, but here's why.
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:29.540]   Here's why some people like it.
[01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:31.260]   Dan Patterson just resigned from the past.
[01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:32.580]   You've said I said I'm done.
[01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:33.580]   I'm going to post on Twitter.
[01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:35.820]   Only 50 people found out about it though.
[01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:39.380]   The people who are really hardcore and have been doing social networking have essentially
[01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:41.620]   handed over their social networking life to the public.
[01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:42.620]   It's branding.
[01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:44.380]   They don't get to actually do social networking.
[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:46.900]   What you do on Google+ and Facebook, isn't that social networking?
[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:47.900]   No, it's branding.
[01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:48.900]   It's probably branding.
[01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:49.900]   And you'd like a social network.
[01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:50.900]   Which you can't do.
[01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:51.900]   It's my buddies.
[01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:52.900]   Exactly.
[01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:53.900]   So it's actually a real social network.
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:58.900]   This is amazing because it's an entire business model based on artificial scarcity.
[01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:04.180]   It's based on the fact that there's a fantastic article written by a guy called David Wong.
[01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:06.100]   It's a pseudonym called the Monkey Sphere.
[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:11.500]   It talks about how anthropologists have figured out that based on the size of different monkey
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:16.940]   tribes, you could gauge from the size of their brain how big their tribe will be.
[01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:20.300]   And they did it for Reese's monkeys, for apes, for all these different things.
[01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:23.380]   And sure enough, they had a one-to-one correlation based on the size of the brain.
[01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:25.860]   This article is on cracked.com.
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:26.860]   This is before cracked.
[01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:27.860]   This was like a half decade ago.
[01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:29.860]   So this is where you get your material now, eh?
[01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:31.420]   I just want to point out.
[01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:32.420]   No, no, no.
[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:33.420]   This is on cracked.com.
[01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:35.420]   It's a brilliant article.
[01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:36.420]   Okay.
[01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:39.500]   But this is back when he was doing pointless waste of time, which was originally what this
[01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:40.500]   was from.
[01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:41.500]   Much more credible than cracked.
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:45.580]   But then when you apply that thinking of the size of the brain to the number of people
[01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:50.660]   in a tribe and you look at humans, you see that there's only about 120 people that we
[01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:52.820]   can determine that are real people.
[01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:54.380]   Anyone else is the other to us.
[01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:56.820]   The guy who picks up our garbage is not a real person.
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:58.620]   I won't run out.
[01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:04.420]   And the story he uses is talking about a story of somebody who put glass in a box because
[01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:06.220]   he was worried about the garbage man cutting himself.
[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:07.220]   We don't do that now.
[01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:10.300]   It's like, well, they're razor blades and HIV-infected needles in our garbage.
[01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:12.220]   We don't care.
[01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:16.500]   But that's the problem with social networks is that they're not real people to us.
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:17.980]   We love hearing from them.
[01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:20.060]   And we think of them as this cloud of people.
[01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:21.460]   But our brains can't handle it.
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:22.460]   Exactly.
[01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:23.460]   Exactly.
[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:24.460]   You know, my wife is a person.
[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:25.460]   My kid is a person.
[01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:26.460]   My mom is a person.
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:27.460]   The rest is just other.
[01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:30.500]   Everybody in your social network is a real person to you.
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:31.500]   And the artificial scarcity.
[01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:34.140]   If you want to bring someone else in, you got to kick somebody else out.
[01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:38.300]   Actually, artificial scarcity is a kind of a trend because people are overwhelmed by
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:40.220]   too much of everything.
[01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:44.340]   And if you look at like Twitter, then it's a scarcity of space for typing the message.
[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:49.820]   If you look at, you know, I prefer actually these days, Apple's Pages instead of Microsoft
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:53.580]   Word because when I go to get a font, there's only like six fonts to choose from.
[01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:56.700]   One of them is either Helvetica or Ariel or one of the ones that I use.
[01:09:56.700 --> 01:10:00.620]   I go to Microsoft and go to choose a font and it's like 6,000 fonts.
[01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:01.620]   It's decision fatigue.
[01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:02.900]   There's only so much you can handle.
[01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:05.740]   And in fact, most people early in the day, they waste.
[01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:09.580]   There's literally only so much decisions you can make before you just stop caring.
[01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:12.660]   And there's all these psychological studies that show late in the day.
[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:13.660]   You're just like, I don't know.
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:14.660]   I'll push it till tomorrow.
[01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:15.660]   I won't decide.
[01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:20.140]   Or it's like, you know, so give everyone just a yes or yes answer so that you can sell
[01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:21.140]   them later in the day.
[01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:24.940]   Wong actually says in this article, this is why society doesn't work because we don't
[01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:26.300]   care enough about other people.
[01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:30.380]   Although that Coney 2012 is interesting again because that's making us care about your
[01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:31.380]   right one person.
[01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:32.380]   Yeah.
[01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:36.740]   So they're adding that one person to our Dunbar number in a very clever way.
[01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:39.060]   They were smart enough not to make it about all the children.
[01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:43.300]   Except for this, there's only one brief moment where in five seconds is just like a bunch
[01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:44.300]   of scarred faces.
[01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:47.100]   And then you're like, by the way, this is a bigger deal than just one person.
[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:48.100]   Right.
[01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:49.580]   But you can't encompass that in your monkey brain.
[01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:50.580]   Right.
[01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:51.580]   So we're going to show you this one person again.
[01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:52.580]   Exactly.
[01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:53.580]   Yeah.
[01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:55.180]   It's kind of, you know, it makes sense.
[01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:57.180]   I'm not looking at you ever again.
[01:10:57.180 --> 01:11:02.300]   Every time I look at him, he goes, this is an audio podcast.
[01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:03.300]   What do you have?
[01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:04.300]   What are you going to buy one of these?
[01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:05.300]   Well, I want to show you a little bit of something.
[01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:06.300]   We're going to take a break.
[01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:09.900]   Come back with more John C. Devorak, Mike Elgin, Schwood.
[01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:13.900]   This is a twit and this is the forest forest toad.
[01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:14.900]   The what?
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:15.900]   Yes.
[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:16.900]   Like that.
[01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:17.900]   You wonder where I have this backwards.
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:18.900]   I like words.
[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:19.900]   Look on my face.
[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:20.900]   Words are good.
[01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:21.900]   The toad forest.
[01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:22.900]   Toad.
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:23.900]   That's wrong.
[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:24.900]   Toad.
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:25.900]   Toad.
[01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:26.900]   Yes, these things.
[01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:27.900]   Too much coat.
[01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:28.900]   A little coat.
[01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:29.900]   Not a stroke.
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:30.900]   Okay, me stroke.
[01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:33.980]   I'm going to get sued probably by the Cola bottling company.
[01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:34.980]   That's it on the lifestyle.
[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:36.420]   Yeah, it's that new design.
[01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:37.420]   Freestyle.
[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:39.940]   This is the 2013, but you know, there's some interesting things in here.
[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:41.180]   There's this curve control.
[01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:42.180]   This is amazing.
[01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:43.180]   You know about this?
[01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:46.460]   Well, this is how everyone keeps saying like, when are we going to have cars that drive
[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:47.460]   themselves?
[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:48.460]   Exactly.
[01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:49.460]   We're already there.
[01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:54.380]   You realize that they are making legislation anticipating that in four years we'll have cars
[01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:58.020]   that drive themselves and that they need to decide now what the legalities are.
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:00.340]   And this is a case where it's like people lives are going to be.
[01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:02.900]   Everyone's going to think it's a bad idea until it saves their life and then they're
[01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:04.340]   going to realize it's the best thing ever.
[01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:06.580]   Well, I think what we're getting is like semi autonomous cars.
[01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:08.820]   This is what Alan Malawi, the CEO Ford said.
[01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:10.060]   He was in aviation.
[01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:11.860]   He worked at Boeing before he went to Ford.
[01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:16.020]   He built all of the major Boeing planes that are flying, including the 777.
[01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:19.660]   He said in aviation, of course, you know, by the way, these planes land themselves.
[01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:21.460]   Like the pilot was talking to me the other day.
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:22.460]   They land themselves all the time.
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:23.900]   They say, oh, yeah, we see all the pilot to land.
[01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:26.780]   They actually have to test it every, I think every two months.
[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:30.660]   I was in one of them that was on a landing with so good.
[01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:31.820]   They had to apologize.
[01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:33.860]   I'm sorry.
[01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:34.860]   The computer didn't do so.
[01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:35.860]   No, really.
[01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:40.580]   It was a really it was a it was a plane came down real hard and then bounced way up into
[01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:42.220]   the air and came down again.
[01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:43.220]   Okay.
[01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:47.540]   I'm not going on that particular model, but apparently the guy told me, no, we frequently
[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:48.860]   let the plane land itself.
[01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:49.860]   Good.
[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:53.860]   But the fast one was saying, I was saying you will never take pilots out of the airplane
[01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:58.500]   and the idea is to have these systems support you instead of take over for you.
[01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:01.260]   And he says, people are never going to let cars drive themselves.
[01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:02.540]   It's just too scary.
[01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:07.180]   But what we're doing in the fords is we're increasing the support for the driver, giving
[01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:08.180]   them more information.
[01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:11.660]   And this is a curve controls a really good example.
[01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:13.860]   If you take a curve too quickly, how many times have you done that?
[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:14.860]   That's where you skid out.
[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:15.860]   That's where you go out of control.
[01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:16.860]   There's ice on the road.
[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:18.620]   It's one of the most dangerous things that can happen.
[01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:26.700]   So what the 100 times a second, this new 2013 Taurus is calculating roll rate, yaw rate,
[01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:30.180]   lateral acceleration, wheel speed, steering angle.
[01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:33.740]   It basically is trying to figure out how quickly the vehicle is turning versus how quickly
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:35.860]   the driver is trying to make it turn.
[01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:37.620]   Because that's what happens, right?
[01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:41.860]   You try to make it turn faster than it can and it's gone.
[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:45.620]   So when it senses a problem, it reduces engine torque.
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:49.660]   It applies four wheel braking, slows the vehicle up to 10 miles an hour and a second.
[01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:50.660]   You know what it'll feel like?
[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:55.380]   It'll feel exactly like this is going to be as important an innovation as anti-like breaks.
[01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:56.380]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:58.380]   You can feel when they engage and you're thankful for it.
[01:13:58.380 --> 01:13:59.380]   Exactly.
[01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:00.380]   And you're grateful.
[01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:03.820]   And you have the same thing with two fast acceleration where your tires would spin out.
[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:04.820]   Spin out.
[01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:05.820]   Yeah, traction control.
[01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:06.820]   Right.
[01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:07.820]   Yeah.
[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:10.100]   So this is just what's really interesting is you're exactly right.
[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:12.020]   They're paying a lot of attention to this.
[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:13.580]   They know it makes cars safer.
[01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:18.780]   They know people still want to drive so they make it so that the car is more fault tolerant,
[01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:21.540]   more air tolerant and protects you as you're driving.
[01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:24.300]   This is one of the reasons you want to take a look at the 2013 Ford Tourist.
[01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:26.020]   It is an amazing vehicle.
[01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:28.940]   You can visit this site right now for .com/car/tourist.
[01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:33.180]   But really, the best thing to do is go to a Ford dealer and drive one.
[01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:34.380]   And try to flip it.
[01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:38.580]   Tell the guy first to say I'm going to try to flip it.
[01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:40.940]   It works for a square space, right?
[01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:41.940]   Nobody could crash it.
[01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:42.940]   Let's see if anybody can crash this.
[01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:44.460]   No, I'm not going to recommend that.
[01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:45.860]   But there is a new bio.
[01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:47.140]   I've got to get a Valamalali.
[01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:51.860]   I think he's a very interesting fella and probably one of the most important CEOs out
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:52.860]   there.
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:57.060]   But if you go to this site, you can read about the adaptive cruise control, the collision
[01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:58.660]   warning with brake support.
[01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:00.140]   You're right, Brian.
[01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:03.340]   They're basically, I keep asking about autonomous cars.
[01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:04.540]   He says, no, no, no, no.
[01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:05.540]   People love to drive.
[01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:08.860]   But really what he's saying is, well, not autonomous exactly.
[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:13.700]   Well, I'll tell you when it's really going to happen is when a car comes out that offers
[01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:15.700]   mobility for the elderly.
[01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:18.220]   And then all of a sudden, it's a question of-- because think about it.
[01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:21.900]   Think about how much money you save if older people don't have to be built in a home.
[01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:22.900]   I have to drive.
[01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:24.220]   Well, but it's not a matter of driving.
[01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:25.220]   And think about it.
[01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:27.060]   Think about everyone who has too many at the bar.
[01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:28.060]   And it's like you can get home safe.
[01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:29.780]   You drive yourself home with the bike.
[01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:30.780]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:32.340]   I disagree with him.
[01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:35.620]   I think the autonomous cars, which are being worked on aggressively by Google--
[01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:37.860]   By Google, I'm a company that you hate--
[01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:38.860]   Is Google.
[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:43.860]   Is pretty much-- I think it's going to happen within the next 15, 20 years.
[01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:44.860]   Really?
[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:45.860]   Five years.
[01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:46.860]   I think--
[01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:47.860]   One of the reasons I'm working five years.
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:49.980]   Is it going to happen until you have roads?
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:51.660]   The roads have to be upgraded.
[01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:52.660]   And we don't have the infrastructure.
[01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:54.460]   No, I think Google is working a way around that.
[01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:55.460]   I say, screw the roads.
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:57.540]   We'll just have a bumpy old road, the old-fashioned roads.
[01:15:57.540 --> 01:16:00.940]   We don't need the sensors and all this crap that they're always thinking about.
[01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:01.940]   They don't think--
[01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:02.940]   They've got contextual awareness.
[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:07.180]   And in fact, like the Google cars, they'll get to one of those bizarre four-way stops when
[01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:10.540]   there are rules like this guy is supposed to go, but they're setting up algorithms
[01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:12.980]   based on the amount of data that the guy doesn't go.
[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:14.300]   They're like, well, then I'm going to go.
[01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:16.500]   And I'm going to indicate to them that I'm planning to go.
[01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:17.500]   Cars will talk to each other.
[01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:18.500]   Yeah.
[01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:19.500]   Yeah.
[01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:23.100]   I actually had a great conversation almost over a year ago with a guy who does this work.
[01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:25.380]   And he says, oh, no, we can do it now.
[01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:27.220]   It's all the technologies are there.
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:29.500]   It's really all about consumer acceptance, governmental acceptance.
[01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:32.420]   I think, by the way, I think that drunk driving thing.
[01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:34.420]   That's the way to go, because that would be the--
[01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:35.420]   Drunk driving is the way to go.
[01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:38.340]   So just make sure everybody drinks a lot.
[01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:39.820]   And then they have to buy their cars.
[01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:40.820]   You know when--
[01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:41.820]   Next year, it's out by Southwest.
[01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:42.820]   Yes.
[01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:43.820]   All self-driving vehicles.
[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:44.820]   Oh, my God.
[01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:45.820]   And everybody drinking.
[01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:46.820]   Think about that.
[01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:50.140]   Google offers a fleet of unmanned taxi cabs.
[01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:51.140]   Think about that.
[01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:52.140]   Is that legal?
[01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:53.140]   Well, again, you would have people--
[01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:54.140]   It is legal in Nevada.
[01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:55.140]   --you would have people physically there.
[01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:57.140]   Well, everything's legal in Nevada.
[01:16:57.140 --> 01:16:58.980]   You could also go faster.
[01:16:58.980 --> 01:16:59.980]   C.E.S.
[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:05.380]   So really, so it's not legal in, say, Texas, but it would be legal in Nevada.
[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:06.380]   That's right.
[01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:11.020]   And Google is actively pushing some of the states to make it legal.
[01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:12.500]   It might happen sooner than we have ever been.
[01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:15.420]   But right now, it's legal as long as there's an operator in the seat.
[01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:17.260]   I think that's all 50 states, right?
[01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:19.260]   Yeah, Google's doing that in California right now.
[01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:20.540]   They're just a guy going like this.
[01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:21.540]   So think about it.
[01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:27.100]   So you've got a fleet of 100 cars in Southwest, where everybody's drunk all the time.
[01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:29.060]   You say, hey, free cabs for everyone.
[01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:31.460]   They get in, and then they have an experience where you want to go.
[01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:34.220]   And he punches it in, and the guy just sits there and talks to you the whole time.
[01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:37.220]   That experience will blow the mind, and it's all going to be turned around.
[01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:38.220]   You're in a Johnny Cab.
[01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:39.220]   Exactly.
[01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:40.220]   Johnny Cab, experience.
[01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:41.220]   I don't think that little statue.
[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:42.740]   But it's going to be like flying.
[01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:46.140]   It's going to be like flying, because pilots sit there and read their charts.
[01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:47.140]   Absolutely.
[01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:48.140]   They take naps.
[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:49.140]   They do all this stuff.
[01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:50.140]   They listen to the twit.
[01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:55.980]   And there's a big gift between removing the pilot and taking advantage of a lot of fun.
[01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:59.980]   You would not want to get into a 747 that had no pilot.
[01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:00.980]   Correct.
[01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:05.740]   And then the subways, mono rails, all sorts of mass transit that have no driver.
[01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:07.380]   That's kind of, I don't know.
[01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:10.060]   Last time I got in a subway in New York, I didn't look to see if there was a.
[01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:12.300]   Well, I mean, even more stairs and I thought rails.
[01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:13.300]   Most operated.
[01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:15.900]   If you go to the air train, though, to the airport, there's no driver.
[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:16.900]   No driver.
[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:17.900]   The bigger driver of those biggest models.
[01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:22.020]   We get into cars that have horrible human drivers every day.
[01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:24.260]   At least I do, because I'm one of them.
[01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:27.700]   So, but I mean, cars are very dangerous.
[01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:28.700]   Yeah.
[01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:33.060]   People talk about all these two ton, two ton vehicle being conducted by somebody who couldn't
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:34.620]   graduate from sixth grade.
[01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:38.620]   People are afraid of sharks, but you know, driving to the beach is way.
[01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:39.620]   Driving to the beach.
[01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:41.700]   Driving to the beach is so much worse.
[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:43.620]   Sharks are going to drive our cars now.
[01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:44.620]   I'd buy one.
[01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:47.820]   So it's against the law in all 50 states for sharks to drive.
[01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:49.340]   I just want you to know.
[01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:52.700]   Todd Park is our new CTO.
[01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:53.700]   Ooh.
[01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:56.060]   Did you know we had CTO?
[01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:57.060]   Yeah.
[01:18:57.060 --> 01:19:00.380]   And he's an East Chopra quit.
[01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:04.620]   And Todd Park was formerly the CTO of Health and Human Services.
[01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:06.860]   He's a healthcare nerd.
[01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:10.100]   He also led the healthcare.gov initiative.
[01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:15.940]   And he's going to be the new CTO helping to modernize the federal government.
[01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:19.180]   You know, we, I'm all for that.
[01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:20.180]   Move it.
[01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:22.020]   You go, Todd.
[01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:27.020]   I don't know what the CTO does, except to give Tim O'Reilly.
[01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:29.460]   The interview is Netflix.
[01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:30.460]   This is interesting.
[01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:35.900]   Apple TV, the new Apple TV announced, Netflix announced that in physical TV, still the
[01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:36.900]   Apple TV product.
[01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:41.740]   It's still a puck that they Apple, you can use your Apple account to subscribe to Netflix.
[01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:44.020]   There is this tight, suddenly this tight bonding.
[01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:47.620]   And apparently Netflix has been going to cable companies all over the country.
[01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:48.620]   This is smart.
[01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:49.620]   Yes.
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:51.100]   And saying, why don't we just be your service?
[01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:55.220]   Now Comcast, which is starting its own service called Streampix, just said, forget about
[01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:56.220]   it.
[01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:58.460]   I wouldn't be surprised to see other cable companies basically.
[01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:02.340]   Well, this is brilliant because you got all these cable companies that are, and this
[01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:06.020]   is what we talk about on frame rate a lot, you got all these services that are doing
[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:07.020]   the on demand content.
[01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:09.740]   And meanwhile, it's like Netflix has the brand value.
[01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:13.260]   It's a billion times more valuable than Time Warner Cable on demand.
[01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:16.300]   And it's like, you know, you know what's on Netflix and everyone loves Netflix.
[01:20:16.300 --> 01:20:18.540]   So why not partner up?
[01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:23.420]   Chief executive Tim Boox of Time Warner, famously dismissed the idea that Netflix was
[01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:27.300]   a serious threat by equating the service to the Albanian army.
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:30.700]   Yeah, that's an analogy of a very familiar way.
[01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:32.140]   I don't even get it.
[01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:33.140]   I don't.
[01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:36.180]   But he's come around a little bit and they're much more positive.
[01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:40.060]   Reed Hastings, the CEO of Netflix, basically says it's not in the short term, but it's
[01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:43.100]   in the natural direction for us in the long term.
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:47.420]   Many cable service providers would like to have a competitor to HBO.
[01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:50.060]   They want to be the next HBO.
[01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:51.980]   That's brilliant.
[01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:54.980]   A movie service, not just a streaming video service.
[01:20:54.980 --> 01:20:58.220]   Well, I mean, think about the niche the HBO had when I was a kid.
[01:20:58.220 --> 01:20:59.940]   That was a kid with.
[01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:01.940]   I'm a little JCD.
[01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:02.940]   I was a kid.
[01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:05.620]   That's where you solve movies.
[01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:07.940]   And now who watches HBO for the movies anymore?
[01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:11.420]   Now, remember Netflix is 30% of all for the movies.
[01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:13.580]   All internet traffic during peak hours, 30.
[01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:16.220]   A third of all internet traffic during peak hours is Netflix.
[01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:17.220]   Yeah.
[01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:20.420]   So one of the things I'm sure Netflix would like to do with Comcast, Time Warner and
[01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:24.340]   other cable companies that are also internet service providers, is work at some sort of
[01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:25.700]   bandwidth deal.
[01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:29.060]   Because at some point, the cable companies are, I mean, a lot of this bandwidth control
[01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:31.900]   stuff is really about keeping people from watching Netflix.
[01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:36.100]   Well, and I'm convinced that so much of this is everybody in the business has to know that
[01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:38.260]   we're switching to an on demand world.
[01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:40.660]   But they have too much invested right now.
[01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:45.860]   So I think all of these plays are just plays to delay and give them more time to work out
[01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:49.860]   more deals until finally they become so desperate that somebody can pull an iTunes.
[01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:51.780]   iTunes came in and revolutionized.
[01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:52.780]   Transform.
[01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:57.380]   Transform did overnight because it was only the threat of massive destruction by piracy
[01:21:57.380 --> 01:21:58.700]   that got everybody on board.
[01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:01.700]   And that's what it's going to take with video all over again is piracy is going to have
[01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:02.700]   to continue to grow.
[01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:06.140]   The pirate bay is going to have to continue exists till finally everyone gets so desperate
[01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:09.900]   that somebody can swoop in and it could be a Hulu, it could be a Netflix, it could be
[01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:14.220]   one of the YouTube can come in and say new rule, a buck for everything.
[01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:15.700]   And then everyone's like, yes, let's take that.
[01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:16.700]   Could be Apple.
[01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:21.860]   I'm totally rooting for Apple and Google to completely control television because all
[01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:27.460]   this stuff about we're eventually all going to be able to download all movies all the time.
[01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:31.180]   That's a given and that's kind of a generic fact that that that that is.
[01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:36.180]   Here's that we already can just nobody likes to admit that one of the strong arms is piracy
[01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:37.180]   to do that.
[01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:41.860]   The difference is is it going to be horrible like it is now with the interface with the
[01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:43.300]   crazy remote controls.
[01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:46.580]   Everybody's got like four remote controls and nobody can control them and that the on screen
[01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:51.140]   cable operators interface for dealing with movies, it's horrible in a world with the
[01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:56.260]   iPad to be using an interface like that because of some kind of lock in or some kind of cable
[01:22:56.260 --> 01:22:59.380]   control of who we resolve with the real Apple TV.
[01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:00.380]   So exactly.
[01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:05.460]   Well, the real Apple TV, but that will be just a part of their takeover of control of
[01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:07.940]   the industry similar to their takeover.
[01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:09.380]   The iPad controller.
[01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:10.380]   Yes.
[01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:12.380]   Those of you in New York know about Ariel.
[01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:13.380]   Oh my gosh.
[01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:14.380]   This is so frustrating.
[01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:17.380]   These are the guys.
[01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:19.660]   We've already seen this exact same thing years ago.
[01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:24.620]   We saw it with real media trying to do it with the DVD cable companies started frankly.
[01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:25.620]   Exactly.
[01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:27.700]   You couldn't get you couldn't get television stations.
[01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:30.140]   They put up an antenna ran a cable to your house.
[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:31.140]   You pay them.
[01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:32.140]   Now you can watch TV.
[01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:33.540]   So they're being sued right now.
[01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:38.580]   These are the guys where you effectively rent a very, very small physical antenna in your
[01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:39.740]   own hometown.
[01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:41.740]   It's it's geo located according to where your town is.
[01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:43.380]   So you're this is your antenna.
[01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:44.660]   It's not your antenna for all.
[01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:47.620]   It's not the first time this idea has been propagated by the way.
[01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:51.100]   These little antennas in your own house at 15 years ago.
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:52.300]   They tried it 20 years ago.
[01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:54.140]   I do this with my ham system.
[01:23:54.140 --> 01:23:55.820]   I can't put an antenna up here.
[01:23:55.820 --> 01:24:00.820]   So there's a guy in the back east who lets me use his antenna and then over the internet
[01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:02.860]   the audio comes back here to my radio.
[01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:06.380]   My radio through some software controls is even radio and I can get online.
[01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:07.380]   Right.
[01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:10.020]   So on the one side of the legal board are you at sling box.
[01:24:10.020 --> 01:24:14.020]   The sling box is 100% legal and 100% fair because it's a box that you attach to your
[01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:17.780]   system and you are able to stream your content from your cable box anywhere you want in the
[01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:20.380]   world to whatever device you're using on the floor.
[01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:21.380]   Then you get the gray area.
[01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:26.260]   You had Zadiva that tried a similar thing where they had a whole bank of physical DVDs
[01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:27.780]   and physical DVD players.
[01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:30.420]   They said these are these are DVDs for rental.
[01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:32.060]   These are DVD players for rental.
[01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:36.780]   When you pay us you are paying for us to take a physical CD and put it in a physical player
[01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:38.620]   and then stream the content to you.
[01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:40.180]   They got shut down by the MPAA.
[01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:42.780]   They said no you're just that's copyrighted material.
[01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:44.860]   You're streaming it illegally.
[01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:48.500]   But the difference is this is the exact same thing only with high definition over the air
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:52.180]   antennas and they're playing by the letter of the law all the way across the board.
[01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:53.180]   But they're being sued again.
[01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:55.660]   Who's the guy that invested in this?
[01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:56.660]   He created.
[01:24:56.660 --> 01:24:57.660]   Very dealer.
[01:24:57.660 --> 01:24:58.660]   Yeah.
[01:24:58.660 --> 01:24:59.660]   Yeah.
[01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:00.660]   Very smart guy.
[01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:01.660]   Very long.
[01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:02.940]   So area when they started raised $20 million before they're launched because they knew
[01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:04.140]   they would get sued.
[01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:05.140]   Well exactly.
[01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:06.140]   That's what's different.
[01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:07.980]   Very diller and I see put money in.
[01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:11.740]   They were basically I think very diller said look let's create a test case.
[01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:14.580]   We don't even know if this company is going to survive but let's create a test case.
[01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:17.140]   They say we're not rebroadcasting.
[01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:18.140]   See that would be the issue.
[01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:23.180]   If I took NBC and rebroadcast it over the internet that would be illegal.
[01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:24.700]   We're not rebroadcasting.
[01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:30.020]   We're letting people tune into their antenna which happens to be somewhere else.
[01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:31.020]   Correct.
[01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:32.020]   And they can tune it.
[01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:33.180]   They tune them to a channel.
[01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:34.460]   They don't look at the cards.
[01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:37.180]   There are thousands of very tiny antennas.
[01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:39.340]   Like nobody else is using your antenna.
[01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:41.060]   When you're not using it nobody else is.
[01:25:41.060 --> 01:25:42.060]   It is your antenna.
[01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:46.060]   So the service they're providing merely is giving you an antenna that's connected via
[01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:47.660]   the internet somewhere else.
[01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:48.740]   You do what you want with it.
[01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:53.060]   It's essentially exactly a sling box only the sling box is located at a facility instead
[01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:54.060]   of anything else.
[01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:55.420]   It's not even exactly a sling box.
[01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:57.500]   It's just an antenna on the internet.
[01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:58.500]   Right.
[01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:00.460]   It's not connected to anything else.
[01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:01.460]   Now.
[01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:04.620]   I actually think this is going to be the flash point that changes things.
[01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:08.860]   They're being sued by of course broadcasters.
[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:09.860]   Yeah.
[01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:12.700]   They're going to get sued out of existence.
[01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:14.060]   I mean I don't think they can beat this one.
[01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:16.580]   The antenna can stream one broadcast channel on time.
[01:26:16.580 --> 01:26:17.580]   It's not on demand.
[01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:18.580]   It's just whatever is live.
[01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:20.380]   It's totally a test case.
[01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:21.380]   It's an interesting test case.
[01:26:21.380 --> 01:26:23.820]   But what would they accomplish if they win the case?
[01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:24.820]   I mean this is kind of-
[01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:28.180]   Well they set a precedent all bases in every which way.
[01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:29.180]   This is a Cluj.
[01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:30.180]   So here's-
[01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:31.180]   It is.
[01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:32.180]   It is.
[01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:33.180]   But that's how all of our legal system is.
[01:26:33.180 --> 01:26:34.180]   It's all based on legal-
[01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:35.180]   It's the IPTV.
[01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:38.060]   The future of television is not going to be some Cluj like this.
[01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:39.060]   Ultimately you're right.
[01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:40.060]   It's going to be real IPTV.
[01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:41.060]   You're going to go to some-
[01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:46.580]   The thing that's missing from IPTV is that my local ABC channel is not on the internet.
[01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:47.580]   The half of them-
[01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:48.580]   Someday they will all the way in the station.
[01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:49.580]   So they just will be.
[01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:50.580]   All the way in the station.
[01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:51.580]   All the way in the station.
[01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:52.580]   So if I want to listen to one of these-
[01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:53.580]   It's a lot more bandwidth so.
[01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:54.580]   A lot more bandwidth.
[01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:57.060]   But again, where we are with audio is where we'll be with video 10 years from now.
[01:26:57.060 --> 01:26:59.860]   And that's what's amazing to watch this unfold because it is lockstep.
[01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:00.860]   It's about having the late nights.
[01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:01.860]   It is about bandwidth issues.
[01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:02.860]   Yeah.
[01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:04.860]   At some point I'll be able to go on my computer.
[01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:05.860]   It's costly.
[01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:09.980]   Call up Stockholm, Sweden and go to channel 30 on the local cable there.
[01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:10.980]   It's a good dream.
[01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:11.980]   It is good.
[01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:15.220]   That's the porn channel.
[01:27:15.220 --> 01:27:16.220]   Really?
[01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:17.740]   You get it and boom.
[01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:18.740]   Okay.
[01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:19.740]   Just check it.
[01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:23.500]   And so and keep in mind here is why it's important is because of all the test cases.
[01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:25.940]   And like I said, we've seen this with other cases.
[01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:26.940]   Number one, they're well-funded.
[01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:31.020]   Number two, in every way with the letter of law they are complying and that only one
[01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:32.340]   person gets the physical antenna.
[01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:35.260]   And I understand what you're saying, but I don't see what they're going to accomplish
[01:27:35.260 --> 01:27:37.260]   if they actually win this test case.
[01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:41.060]   Once you get that, it becomes a crystal micro antenna everywhere.
[01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:42.060]   It's a clue.
[01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:43.060]   It lies in a clue.
[01:27:43.060 --> 01:27:44.300]   What's wrong with it?
[01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:45.300]   It's stupid.
[01:27:45.300 --> 01:27:46.300]   I mean, what are you stupid?
[01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:47.300]   But it's stupid.
[01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:48.860]   That's what's wrong with it.
[01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:50.420]   It's basically a stupid idea.
[01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:52.220]   You have to get a toehold legally.
[01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:53.780]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:55.820]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:58.180]   So how I mean, these antennas are how big are they?
[01:27:58.180 --> 01:27:59.180]   They're like this gimmick.
[01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:00.180]   They're that big.
[01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:01.180]   They're like 20.
[01:28:01.180 --> 01:28:03.500]   It's not a gimmick, John.
[01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:05.300]   Because I can watch broadcast television.
[01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:06.660]   I have a little antenna down there.
[01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:10.700]   Wouldn't it be cooler if you just call up the station and say, "Give me your feed."
[01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:13.860]   But they're not going to do it because it costs the station money.
[01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:14.860]   It's too expensive for the...
[01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:15.860]   Look, I know.
[01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:16.860]   I'm doing it.
[01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:17.860]   You're in business.
[01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:18.860]   You're doing fine.
[01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:20.860]   You have thousands and thousands and thousands.
[01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:23.900]   But if I had the choice of having people who have little antenna...
[01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:24.900]   Please.
[01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:28.540]   If every one of you would just get a little antenna...
[01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:29.540]   It's a clue.
[01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:32.580]   And put it on your roof that would save us so much money.
[01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:35.380]   Understand that this is not the cause.
[01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:36.700]   This is not the source of the stupidity.
[01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:39.500]   This is the symptom of the stupidity that already exists.
[01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:41.300]   Our legal system is broken.
[01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:44.900]   And it did not anticipate the new media way that we disseminate information.
[01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:48.500]   You're assuming that this injunction will be issued and the courts will shut it down.
[01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:50.380]   I think the courts are going to go...
[01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:51.380]   Of course it's legal.
[01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:52.580]   Well, they did shut down Zadiva.
[01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:54.820]   Zadiva did the exact same thing only with DVDs.
[01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:55.820]   And they said, "Sorry."
[01:28:55.820 --> 01:28:56.820]   That's the difference.
[01:28:56.820 --> 01:28:57.820]   The big difference.
[01:28:57.820 --> 01:28:58.820]   Yeah, there's a big difference.
[01:28:58.820 --> 01:28:59.820]   There's a big difference.
[01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:00.820]   When the air is in the air...
[01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:03.140]   We're making a copy of the content.
[01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:04.780]   This is not making a copy of the content.
[01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:07.140]   It's merely providing a channel.
[01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:08.140]   And I think it's completely legal.
[01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:10.300]   It's going to be depending on the law firm.
[01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:13.620]   There's also a precedent that the airways belong to the public.
[01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:18.820]   And anytime you, you know, route everything through the air, suddenly that's a source
[01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:19.820]   that is like sacred.
[01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:20.820]   Suddenly, okay.
[01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:21.820]   Yeah.
[01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:22.820]   Exactly.
[01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:23.820]   That's a really good point.
[01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:24.820]   And again, it all comes down.
[01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:26.860]   Yes, it's totally occlusion, John, but John, it is so important that they win this.
[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:31.860]   If I could only set up a little network of antennas all over the world, I would.
[01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:39.660]   So I take you now to the Minowaski, I hope I'm saying that right, school district in beautiful
[01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:40.660]   downtown Minnesota.
[01:29:40.660 --> 01:29:41.660]   Oh, this is great.
[01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:48.260]   A 12-year-old girl decides that the hall monitor is mean to her.
[01:29:48.260 --> 01:29:51.420]   So she described her as mean on her Facebook profile.
[01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:54.700]   12-year-old girl, Facebook profile.
[01:29:54.700 --> 01:29:59.260]   No school equipment or property was used to make this posting, but the school principal
[01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:05.380]   found out about it and demanded the 12-year-old girl's password to her Facebook account.
[01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:09.740]   She co-wears the 12-year-old girl into giving up not only her Facebook, but her email passwords
[01:30:09.740 --> 01:30:15.100]   so that the school could check on what she had written.
[01:30:15.100 --> 01:30:18.700]   She was twice punished for things she wrote on Facebook.
[01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:24.180]   Now the girl is suing in conjunction with the ACLU, declaring that her first and fourth
[01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:26.380]   amendment rights were violated.
[01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:27.880]   Yeah.
[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:29.700]   The school has no business.
[01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:32.060]   Well, she was called, get this.
[01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:35.980]   She was called to a meeting with a school counselor and a deputy sheriff was there.
[01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:36.980]   The only thing...
[01:30:36.980 --> 01:30:40.460]   She was interrogated by the school system for you.
[01:30:40.460 --> 01:30:43.100]   The only thing she doesn't have on our side is I believe she's too young for the terms
[01:30:43.100 --> 01:30:44.100]   of service for Facebook.
[01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:45.100]   That's not relevant.
[01:30:45.100 --> 01:30:48.780]   I know it's not relevant, but outside of that, they have no business poking their head in
[01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:49.780]   this.
[01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:50.780]   It's a closed network.
[01:30:50.780 --> 01:30:51.780]   You have to be a friend to even see what they say.
[01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:52.780]   It's a free speech issue.
[01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:53.780]   I think the printables mean.
[01:30:53.780 --> 01:30:54.780]   No.
[01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:55.780]   She said that too.
[01:30:55.780 --> 01:30:58.380]   That's what got her in trouble.
[01:30:58.380 --> 01:30:59.380]   Yeah.
[01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:01.900]   That is just repressive.
[01:31:01.900 --> 01:31:02.900]   Yeah.
[01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:04.340]   Just shocking.
[01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:08.340]   But I think public opinion is on her side and I think this raises...
[01:31:08.340 --> 01:31:10.460]   You know, the book deal out of this.
[01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:11.460]   The seven figures.
[01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:15.180]   The bigger issue is that what are the first amendment rights of a minor?
[01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:16.180]   It's kind of a...
[01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:17.180]   Well, you know what?
[01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:18.180]   They don't exist.
[01:31:18.180 --> 01:31:23.220]   For instance, you can't wear in a t-shirt, a shirt that says FU.
[01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:24.540]   You don't have the right to do that.
[01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:27.300]   You might have the right to do it as you walk down the street here.
[01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:28.300]   In fact, I believe you do.
[01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:29.300]   Right, but not school.
[01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:31.140]   You can't do it in a mall and you can't do it in a school.
[01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:34.780]   And then you see that with stuff like dress code enforcement and the length of your hair.
[01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:37.100]   I'm not sure kids have the same first amendment rights.
[01:31:37.100 --> 01:31:38.100]   I don't know if they do.
[01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:39.100]   Well, they're not legal entities.
[01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:40.740]   It's going to be a good case.
[01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:41.740]   We have a great show.
[01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:45.980]   You should watch this show called This Week in Law with Denise Howell, who is an amazing
[01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:46.980]   attorney.
[01:31:46.980 --> 01:31:50.060]   She brings out other great attorneys and they actually know something about these things
[01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:52.540]   and they talk about it in an educated, intelligent way.
[01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:54.420]   I bet you both of those stories will be big.
[01:31:54.420 --> 01:31:55.420]   What are you implying?
[01:31:55.420 --> 01:31:57.220]   Well, we do our best.
[01:31:57.220 --> 01:31:58.220]   We guess.
[01:31:58.220 --> 01:31:59.580]   But she's actually an attorney.
[01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:03.780]   You know, it's funny because common sense actually has nothing to do with this.
[01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:06.020]   And so we're using common sense.
[01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:09.260]   You actually have to ask a lawyer and they'll go, "Well, actually."
[01:32:09.260 --> 01:32:10.260]   Somebody described us.
[01:32:10.260 --> 01:32:14.020]   Somebody asked, they summarize, you know, we were talking about the over-the-air antenna
[01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:16.460]   stuff, which is the kind of thing we talk about on a frame rate.
[01:32:16.460 --> 01:32:20.380]   Somebody summarized the whole show as Brian complains about the way things ought to be
[01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:22.300]   and Tom Merritt explains why that's illegal.
[01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:28.540]   Somebody was telling me what they did on This Week in Law last week and they were talking
[01:32:28.540 --> 01:32:31.300]   about something that was really, and I can't remember what it was, but it was really,
[01:32:31.300 --> 01:32:33.020]   really good stuff.
[01:32:33.020 --> 01:32:34.020]   Must watch.
[01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:37.740]   But actually, before we finish up, we do have a couple more stories, including an interest
[01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:39.100]   to share about Pinterest.
[01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:40.500]   That should hold your interest.
[01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:41.980]   Let's see what's going on in the week ahead.
[01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:43.260]   Tom Merritt has the latest.
[01:32:43.260 --> 01:32:44.260]   He's right over there.
[01:32:44.260 --> 01:32:45.260]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:32:45.260 --> 01:32:48.780]   Here's a look at some of the stories we'll be covering on Tech News today in the week ahead.
[01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:52.060]   Monday, March 12th, South by Southwest, nears its end.
[01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:54.900]   Gadget does its live event in Austin, Texas.
[01:32:54.900 --> 01:33:00.100]   Tuesday, March 13th is the last day to upload to your Nokia OV account before it shuts
[01:33:00.100 --> 01:33:01.100]   down.
[01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:02.100]   Wednesday, March 14th.
[01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:07.020]   Ariel is scheduled to launch its streaming broadcast TV service in New York City if the
[01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:08.660]   law allows.
[01:33:08.660 --> 01:33:11.620]   Also, March 14th, of course, is International Pi Day.
[01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:13.060]   Thursday, March 15th.
[01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:17.980]   T-Mobile is planning to show off its latest and greatest BlackBerry technology at an event
[01:33:17.980 --> 01:33:18.980]   in Washington.
[01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:21.260]   It couldn't say that with a straight from March 16th.
[01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:26.380]   Interestingly, it was the original date that the Steve Jobs bio by Walter Isaacson was
[01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:27.380]   supposed to publish.
[01:33:27.380 --> 01:33:32.620]   It is now the date that the new iPad ships and Saturday, March 17th, the second annual
[01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:38.620]   Northeast GNU-Linux Fest in Worcester, Massachusetts begins and wondercon kicks off on an Anaheim.
[01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:39.620]   That's right.
[01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:40.620]   On an Anaheim.
[01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:41.620]   That's like Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.
[01:33:41.620 --> 01:33:46.940]   Thank you, Tom Merritt and TNT Tech News today, every weekday, Monday through Friday, 3pm, Pacific,
[01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:49.620]   and Eastern time, 2200 or so.
[01:33:49.620 --> 01:33:50.820]   Well, when did you hire him?
[01:33:50.820 --> 01:33:52.260]   Has he been on before?
[01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:53.260]   Mr. Merritt?
[01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:54.260]   Yeah.
[01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:55.260]   Oh, he's a wonderful guy.
[01:33:55.260 --> 01:33:56.500]   Yeah, we used to work with him.
[01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:57.660]   Do you remember him at Tech TV?
[01:33:57.660 --> 01:33:58.660]   Never heard of him actually.
[01:33:58.660 --> 01:33:59.660]   He hosted...
[01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:00.660]   He was the virtual character.
[01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:01.660]   What's your name?
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:02.660]   Tilda.
[01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:03.660]   Ah.
[01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:04.660]   Yeah.
[01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:05.660]   Beautiful breasts.
[01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:06.660]   Well, it was...
[01:34:06.660 --> 01:34:09.260]   Do you guys see the SimCity announcement?
[01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:11.100]   They're rebooting it?
[01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:12.100]   Yeah, it will.
[01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:13.100]   It's not involved.
[01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:14.100]   That's the only downside to it.
[01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:15.100]   Oh, he's the genius.
[01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:16.100]   Well, yeah.
[01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:18.500]   I'm not sure what's happening is, but, you know, he created it and it exists.
[01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:22.180]   And like, you know, I like civilization with or without Sid Meier attached to it, you know,
[01:34:22.180 --> 01:34:23.940]   so I'm super excited about...
[01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:24.940]   So what's going to be new?
[01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:25.940]   A bit.
[01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:26.940]   Co-op.
[01:34:26.940 --> 01:34:27.940]   They got co-op play built in and it looks beautiful.
[01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:28.940]   You look home.
[01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:31.020]   See, that's good because right now when you play SimCity, you're all alone with a bunch
[01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:33.860]   of AI creatures that talk funny.
[01:34:33.860 --> 01:34:34.860]   Yeah.
[01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:37.580]   But it'd be nice if you could actually have like conversations with the real people meeting
[01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:38.580]   you.
[01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:39.580]   Well, yeah, well, and work as a team, you know, to create...
[01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:41.100]   Oh, it's co-op in that sense.
[01:34:41.100 --> 01:34:42.100]   Yeah.
[01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:43.100]   It's not like Second Life, though.
[01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:44.100]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:34:44.100 --> 01:34:45.100]   It's not the Sims, right?
[01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:48.260]   The Sims are all the individual people, but this is a city building.
[01:34:48.260 --> 01:34:49.900]   It's been years since we've had a SimCity.
[01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:50.900]   Yeah!
[01:34:50.900 --> 01:34:51.900]   What did you think he said?
[01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:52.900]   The Sims.
[01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:53.900]   The Sims.
[01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:54.900]   The Sims.
[01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:55.900]   I thought it was the Sims after.
[01:34:55.900 --> 01:34:56.900]   SimCity.
[01:34:56.900 --> 01:34:57.900]   It's back.
[01:34:57.900 --> 01:34:58.900]   It looks awesome.
[01:34:58.900 --> 01:34:59.900]   Oh, come on.
[01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:00.900]   Who wants to play SimsCity?
[01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:01.900]   What?
[01:35:01.900 --> 01:35:02.900]   Are you kidding me?
[01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:03.900]   You're kidding me?
[01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:04.900]   It looks like that.
[01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:05.900]   Wait a minute.
[01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:06.900]   It looks like that.
[01:35:06.900 --> 01:35:07.900]   Yeah, no, it looks awesome.
[01:35:07.900 --> 01:35:08.900]   No, this is the trailer.
[01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:09.900]   It's not like just squares on a map.
[01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:11.620]   It looks like open street map.
[01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:12.620]   Yeah.
[01:35:12.620 --> 01:35:14.620]   This is what it's going to look like?
[01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:16.220]   Yeah, no, it looks really, really good.
[01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:18.020]   If it looks like this or is this fake?
[01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:19.020]   Nope, nope, this is it.
[01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:20.020]   I think this smoke comes out of stuff.
[01:35:20.020 --> 01:35:21.020]   Oh, I love that.
[01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:22.020]   What a realistic...
[01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:23.020]   Oh, no, no, yeah.
[01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:24.020]   Can you blow up things?
[01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:25.020]   Yeah, sure.
[01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:26.020]   Apparently there's a dragon with fun.
[01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:27.020]   Yeah, dragons.
[01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:28.020]   You can do a cooperative thing.
[01:35:28.020 --> 01:35:29.020]   You can do a quamper.
[01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:30.940]   Now, this would be great on the iPad.
[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:31.940]   You know what?
[01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:32.940]   This makes me kind of sad.
[01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:33.940]   Why?
[01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:38.700]   I think of all the creative, talented people who are wasting energy on manipulating bits
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:42.580]   in Minecraft and SimCity when they can actually be creating something really cool.
[01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:45.940]   I'll tell you, dude, give it, give it, give it.
[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:47.940]   Dude, give it.
[01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:49.860]   No, seriously, it bugs me.
[01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:54.460]   It's like I was playing Farmville and Jennifer comes up and says, "What are you doing?
[01:35:54.460 --> 01:35:55.460]   You're farming again?"
[01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:56.460]   I said, "Yeah, I'm farming."
[01:35:56.460 --> 01:35:57.460]   She said, "Yeah, be a kid."
[01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:58.460]   Do you think I'm farming?
[01:35:58.460 --> 01:36:01.460]   She said it'd be nice if you actually took that energy and maybe...
[01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:03.420]   I did a garden, yes, in the backyard.
[01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:04.660]   I knit something, yeah, or garden.
[01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:05.660]   Or knit, yeah.
[01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:06.660]   Knitting would be good.
[01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:07.660]   Well, I guess that's the question.
[01:36:07.660 --> 01:36:09.260]   Is it the fact that they create?
[01:36:09.260 --> 01:36:12.260]   Because they're creating things that bring in other people.
[01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:13.260]   I think exactly.
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:15.260]   It's channeling out.
[01:36:15.260 --> 01:36:18.380]   Look, I think we have a certain amount of creativity.
[01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:22.460]   It's channeling that creative juice out of us into something that is ultimately meaningless,
[01:36:22.460 --> 01:36:23.860]   that satisfies us.
[01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:24.860]   We feel good.
[01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:25.860]   We've created.
[01:36:25.860 --> 01:36:28.460]   But in fact, it isn't really creating anything.
[01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:29.460]   I'll hold on a second.
[01:36:29.460 --> 01:36:30.460]   It's taking the...
[01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:31.860]   That's the way it ends the show.
[01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:33.060]   The good impulses.
[01:36:33.060 --> 01:36:34.060]   And channeling it in nothing.
[01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:35.060]   It's depressed every time.
[01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:38.540]   You might as well just get a black hole and throw your whole life in it.
[01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:40.540]   No, no, I couldn't agree with you.
[01:36:40.540 --> 01:36:41.540]   I agree with you.
[01:36:41.540 --> 01:36:42.540]   Totally.
[01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:43.540]   You've got it.
[01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:44.540]   You like those guys on the love-backs.
[01:36:44.540 --> 01:36:45.540]   What's it like back there in the 50s?
[01:36:45.540 --> 01:36:46.540]   What's going on?
[01:36:46.540 --> 01:36:47.540]   I know.
[01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:48.540]   This guy is not funny.
[01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:49.540]   He's not funny.
[01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:50.540]   He's not funny.
[01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:51.540]   It is funny.
[01:36:51.540 --> 01:36:52.540]   It's just the same.
[01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:55.540]   Think about the time and effort that goes into designing a building in our Monty suit.
[01:36:55.540 --> 01:36:57.900]   It's a stupid drape to cover your naked body.
[01:36:57.900 --> 01:37:00.260]   Why is that better than the stuff people create in Minecraft?
[01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:01.660]   Because it makes you look good.
[01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:02.660]   Aww.
[01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:03.660]   All right, you're right.
[01:37:03.660 --> 01:37:04.660]   The Monty suit is a complete waste of time.
[01:37:04.660 --> 01:37:05.660]   I don't think so.
[01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:06.660]   I think Monty makes a great product.
[01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:08.100]   But what about a beautiful...
[01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:11.220]   What if you actually built a city instead of just simming a city?
[01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:12.220]   You can't.
[01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:13.220]   That's silly.
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:14.220]   Somebody does.
[01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:20.420]   But yes, those people have to deal with corruption and power and remaining on top.
[01:37:20.420 --> 01:37:21.620]   So let's just give up.
[01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:22.620]   No, I'm saying this.
[01:37:22.620 --> 01:37:25.740]   We'll just give up and throw our creative juices into a black hole.
[01:37:25.740 --> 01:37:29.700]   SimCity is better than the Sims where you basically simulate doing the dishes as your
[01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:30.700]   real dishes.
[01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:31.940]   That's really pathetic.
[01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:32.940]   That's really pathetic.
[01:37:32.940 --> 01:37:35.540]   Building a city at least gives you complex powers.
[01:37:35.540 --> 01:37:36.540]   You know what?
[01:37:36.540 --> 01:37:37.540]   I'm playing games.
[01:37:37.540 --> 01:37:38.540]   I do.
[01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:39.540]   I waste my time.
[01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:40.540]   What do you think this is?
[01:37:40.540 --> 01:37:41.540]   That's how you know.
[01:37:41.540 --> 01:37:42.540]   Yes.
[01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:43.540]   You're educating the edge of the game.
[01:37:43.540 --> 01:37:44.540]   Oh my God, that didn't take long.
[01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:45.540]   There we go.
[01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:48.540]   These guys don't miss a beat.
[01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:49.540]   Wow.
[01:37:49.540 --> 01:37:50.540]   It actually looks like a ride.
[01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:53.540]   It could have been big enough to tune it and fine tune it.
[01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:56.580]   Well, he just did it, you know, like pretty quick.
[01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:59.980]   This week on the balcony, get off your butts and build a city, people.
[01:37:59.980 --> 01:38:01.740]   I'm on the balcony with JCD and Leo.
[01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:02.740]   Pinterest drives more.
[01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:04.540]   This is an example.
[01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:07.980]   Pinterest drives more referral traffic than Twitter.
[01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:09.580]   I went to college for this.
[01:38:09.580 --> 01:38:15.180]   I think it's baloney traffic though because I think the reason Pinterest is such a big
[01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:17.980]   phenomenon is because it's a bunch of little pictures.
[01:38:17.980 --> 01:38:20.300]   So you think this is the equivalent of a Quora type thing?
[01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:23.180]   Well, no, the opposite actually.
[01:38:23.180 --> 01:38:26.660]   What I've discovered on Google+ is that everything on the What's Hot List is pictures
[01:38:26.660 --> 01:38:30.380]   and simple things because it's international.
[01:38:30.380 --> 01:38:34.700]   People in Pakistan and Madagascar and all these different places can see a cool picture
[01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:37.180]   and click on it and be like, I really like that.
[01:38:37.180 --> 01:38:43.100]   There's a reasoned argument or a longer thing or an article by John Zee Devorak that uses
[01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:46.860]   very American English and stuff like that is less accessible to somebody who barely
[01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:47.860]   speaks English.
[01:38:47.860 --> 01:38:48.860]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:38:48.860 --> 01:38:49.860]   Barbersch.
[01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:52.940]   So pictures like that, everybody in the world will look at that and click on it or whatever
[01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:53.940]   they're going to do.
[01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:56.740]   But it doesn't really give you anything of value.
[01:38:56.740 --> 01:38:57.740]   That's right.
[01:38:57.740 --> 01:38:58.740]   You're driving traffic, but you're not.
[01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:00.740]   People are going to buy me.
[01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:01.740]   Oh, puppies.
[01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:04.860]   Yeah, but guys are setting back the internet a decade.
[01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:05.860]   You know what?
[01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:09.660]   I Pinterest stuff that I'm going to buy that I use it as a bookmarking thing for shopping,
[01:39:09.660 --> 01:39:10.660]   but the traffic for it.
[01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:11.660]   And then it would drive traffic to it.
[01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:14.460]   Mostly people who aren't in a position to buy it.
[01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:17.420]   They just kind of, it's like the Sears Wishbook during the Depression.
[01:39:17.420 --> 01:39:18.700]   It's like, wow, look at this tractor.
[01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:20.060]   I see what you're saying.
[01:39:20.060 --> 01:39:21.740]   And it's, it's, you see the same.
[01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:22.740]   So you're against it.
[01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:23.740]   So you're against it.
[01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:24.740]   I hate it.
[01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:25.740]   You don't like Pinterest.
[01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:26.740]   I like it.
[01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:27.740]   I'll give you an example.
[01:39:27.740 --> 01:39:28.740]   Is it anything like Pinterest?
[01:39:28.740 --> 01:39:29.740]   I've been looking for this for years.
[01:39:29.740 --> 01:39:30.740]   No, it's just for years.
[01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:31.740]   Okay.
[01:39:31.740 --> 01:39:32.740]   What is it?
[01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:33.740]   It's a little notepad thing with a roller on it.
[01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:34.740]   And the old days.
[01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:35.940]   Yeah, this is like something from the 30.
[01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:37.620]   Yeah, you have it on the wall.
[01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:38.620]   Yeah.
[01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:40.060]   We used to ride on those.
[01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:42.540]   No, this is a huge stuff called the pen.
[01:39:42.540 --> 01:39:43.540]   Solid-state pen basis.
[01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:44.540]   Yeah.
[01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:46.300]   It's a solid-state pen, but this is stainless steel.
[01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:47.300]   It's beautiful.
[01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:50.980]   You hang it on the wall and you do your grocery list on it because I've constantly going, oh,
[01:39:50.980 --> 01:39:52.380]   I should be, I got to buy tea.
[01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:53.380]   And I forget.
[01:39:53.380 --> 01:39:54.380]   So this, I've been looking at this.
[01:39:54.380 --> 01:39:55.380]   I finally found it.
[01:39:55.380 --> 01:39:57.140]   So I pinned it, baby.
[01:39:57.140 --> 01:39:58.140]   You pinned it.
[01:39:58.140 --> 01:39:59.140]   It's like I pinned it.
[01:39:59.140 --> 01:40:00.140]   How much does that do?
[01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:01.140]   It's like 2 years.
[01:40:01.140 --> 01:40:02.140]   I don't know.
[01:40:02.140 --> 01:40:03.140]   See now it's going to drive traffic.
[01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:04.140]   It goes to Amazon.
[01:40:04.140 --> 01:40:06.140]   I did not put my affiliate code.
[01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:07.860]   I should have put my affiliate code on it.
[01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:09.620]   It's 23 bucks, a little pricey.
[01:40:09.620 --> 01:40:10.620]   I bought it.
[01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:11.620]   It comes with three roll.
[01:40:11.620 --> 01:40:13.380]   You buy it and you get some extra rolls of--
[01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:14.380]   Wow.
[01:40:14.380 --> 01:40:15.380]   Charmin.
[01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:16.380]   Charmin, whatever that is.
[01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:17.380]   Paper.
[01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:18.380]   It's the paper.
[01:40:18.380 --> 01:40:19.380]   Look, there's only nine left in stock.
[01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:20.380]   You watch.
[01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:21.380]   By this time tomorrow, they'll be out of stock.
[01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:22.380]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:40:22.380 --> 01:40:23.380]   I was going to--
[01:40:23.380 --> 01:40:24.380]   And so that's what I mean.
[01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:26.380]   It's going to drive-- somebody's going to see that and say, oh, I'm looking for that.
[01:40:26.380 --> 01:40:27.380]   And what's your point?
[01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:28.380]   Well, it drives traffic.
[01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:29.380]   But we're--
[01:40:29.380 --> 01:40:30.380]   But they're--
[01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:32.380]   He says it doesn't drive traffic, I think it does.
[01:40:32.380 --> 01:40:33.380]   He says it drives a boletus.
[01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:34.380]   He says it's excessive Pinterest.
[01:40:34.380 --> 01:40:37.620]   The excessive Pinterest is not based on actual purchases.
[01:40:37.620 --> 01:40:40.940]   It's based on driving traffic by people who aren't going to purchase any--
[01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:42.420]   Most of the time, it's cute pictures.
[01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:43.420]   Yeah.
[01:40:43.420 --> 01:40:44.420]   And people clicking on it.
[01:40:44.420 --> 01:40:45.420]   So I think it's a bit of a mirage.
[01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:46.420]   Well, what's these two heads?
[01:40:46.420 --> 01:40:48.620]   Yeah, would you buy dictator cakes for amniness?
[01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:50.860]   Wow, that is great.
[01:40:50.860 --> 01:40:54.380]   It's Castro's head, which is a chocolate cake.
[01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:56.140]   And it supports Amnesty International.
[01:40:56.140 --> 01:40:58.700]   And you get to cut his head open and eat the cake.
[01:40:58.700 --> 01:40:59.700]   That's amazing.
[01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:00.700]   That's a product.
[01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:02.060]   Well, here's another one, if you like.
[01:41:02.060 --> 01:41:03.060]   I had one of those--
[01:41:03.060 --> 01:41:04.060]   What is that?
[01:41:04.060 --> 01:41:05.060]   Who is that?
[01:41:05.060 --> 01:41:06.060]   That was like Lenin.
[01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:07.060]   Is it Lenin?
[01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:08.060]   It was.
[01:41:08.060 --> 01:41:09.060]   I think it's Lenin, yeah.
[01:41:09.060 --> 01:41:10.060]   If it had a goatee.
[01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:11.060]   Yeah.
[01:41:11.060 --> 01:41:12.060]   Well, the goatee's been eaten.
[01:41:12.060 --> 01:41:13.060]   Oh, don't eat the goatee, man.
[01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:14.060]   That's the worst part.
[01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:15.060]   All right.
[01:41:15.060 --> 01:41:16.060]   Why is Lenin sneering?
[01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:17.060]   I don't get to hear again.
[01:41:17.060 --> 01:41:19.020]   What are we doing here?
[01:41:19.020 --> 01:41:20.020]   What are we doing here?
[01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:21.020]   OK.
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:22.820]   But see, you can see why Pinterest is completely addictive.
[01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:23.820]   Oh, yeah.
[01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:26.060]   It's a wall of compelling pictures.
[01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:27.060]   It's easy.
[01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:28.060]   What is that?
[01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:29.060]   It's a duck.
[01:41:29.060 --> 01:41:30.060]   Yeah.
[01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:34.420]   Whenever you go to a trade show-- and John has seen this at the Kazillion Times, Comdex
[01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:39.860]   and CES and stuff-- there'll be some high-resolution TV from some no-name Japanese company or Korean
[01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:40.860]   company.
[01:41:40.860 --> 01:41:42.860]   And people just stand there and watch TV.
[01:41:42.860 --> 01:41:43.860]   Right.
[01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:44.860]   They do.
[01:41:44.860 --> 01:41:45.860]   They came all the way halfway from some world to get--
[01:41:45.860 --> 01:41:46.860]   Oh, they're so tired.
[01:41:46.860 --> 01:41:47.860]   It was because--
[01:41:47.860 --> 01:41:51.460]   And it would be crappy TV, which is like a bunch of images of, you know, like, seagulls
[01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:52.460]   and--
[01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:53.460]   And there's a mall of people.
[01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:54.460]   Yeah.
[01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:55.460]   All right.
[01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:56.460]   Because people would just--
[01:41:56.460 --> 01:41:58.540]   When I sit down at a restaurant, I position myself specifically so that there's not a single
[01:41:58.540 --> 01:41:59.540]   TV in my view if possible.
[01:41:59.540 --> 01:42:01.780]   Kind of restaurants you go into that have TVs.
[01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:02.780]   Come on, give me a break.
[01:42:02.780 --> 01:42:03.780]   Couple of bees?
[01:42:03.780 --> 01:42:04.780]   Couple of bees.
[01:42:04.780 --> 01:42:05.780]   Okay.
[01:42:05.780 --> 01:42:06.780]   Now we got--
[01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:07.780]   All right.
[01:42:07.780 --> 01:42:08.780]   We're going to learn something.
[01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:09.780]   Game on's coming up.
[01:42:09.780 --> 01:42:10.780]   We just had GDC.
[01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:12.180]   Did you see this aquatic dream showed this?
[01:42:12.180 --> 01:42:14.580]   It's a PlayStation 3 real-time rendering.
[01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:22.940]   This is their kind of demo video of the next-- was it heavy rain?
[01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:23.940]   This is--
[01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:24.940]   Chocolate rain?
[01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:27.860]   This is an example of motion capture.
[01:42:27.860 --> 01:42:29.940]   And that guy didn't get 71 million hits.
[01:42:29.940 --> 01:42:32.180]   It comes men with feigning, dang.
[01:42:32.180 --> 01:42:33.820]   So this is all rendered real-time, doesn't it?
[01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:37.300]   This is all real-time on an actual PlayStation 3.
[01:42:37.300 --> 01:42:39.260]   This is actually quite a moving movie.
[01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:43.500]   They're creating a human, Android.
[01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:46.660]   She comes alive and realizes that she actually lives.
[01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:48.820]   Can you hear me?
[01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:50.020]   That WAV is what she realizes.
[01:42:50.020 --> 01:42:51.740]   Well, that's what that's all about.
[01:42:51.740 --> 01:42:52.740]   APC 89750.
[01:42:52.740 --> 01:42:54.660]   She said, I'm an Android.
[01:42:54.660 --> 01:42:56.860]   This is all done real-time and motion capture.
[01:42:56.860 --> 01:42:57.860]   It's really stunning.
[01:42:57.860 --> 01:43:03.860]   Your eyes now.
[01:43:03.860 --> 01:43:08.780]   The reflections that--
[01:43:08.780 --> 01:43:09.780]   Ray tracing.
[01:43:09.780 --> 01:43:10.780]   Yeah.
[01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:13.860]   It's funny how you see they build in flaws on purpose.
[01:43:13.860 --> 01:43:14.860]   Hello.
[01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:17.500]   I'm a third generation AX400 Android.
[01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:21.860]   I can look after your house, do the cooking, mind the kids.
[01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:23.580]   I organize your appointments.
[01:43:23.580 --> 01:43:26.660]   I speak 300 languages and I'm entirely at your disposal as a sexual
[01:43:26.660 --> 01:43:27.660]   partner.
[01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:29.260]   And I'm really well-built, obviously.
[01:43:29.260 --> 01:43:30.260]   Oh, yeah.
[01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:31.260]   Wait till you see.
[01:43:31.260 --> 01:43:32.660]   I'll clip to the quantum battery that makes me on
[01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:34.140]   autonomous for 173 years.
[01:43:34.140 --> 01:43:35.140]   173 years.
[01:43:35.140 --> 01:43:37.300]   Do you want to give me a name?
[01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:38.300]   Yeah.
[01:43:38.300 --> 01:43:40.060]   From now on, your name is--
[01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:41.060]   Siri.
[01:43:41.060 --> 01:43:44.140]   My name is Kara.
[01:43:44.140 --> 01:43:46.060]   You really get sucked into this.
[01:43:46.060 --> 01:43:48.060]   You really get sucked into this.
[01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:52.740]   Now, can you move your arms?
[01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:54.300]   The audio listeners are loving this.
[01:43:54.300 --> 01:43:55.860]   Yeah, they're just eating it up.
[01:43:55.860 --> 01:43:58.220]   Well, if you go look at it, it's--
[01:43:58.220 --> 01:43:59.020]   Well, look at Kara.
[01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:00.500]   Kara.
[01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:03.140]   I've got big man hands, don't you think?
[01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:04.140]   Now, say something--
[01:44:04.140 --> 01:44:05.140]   That's the idea.
[01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:06.140]   --that I get in Taney Valley.
[01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:14.140]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:16.420]   Say it in French?
[01:44:16.420 --> 01:44:17.420]   No.
[01:44:17.420 --> 01:44:19.180]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[01:44:19.180 --> 01:44:19.700]   French.
[01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:20.860]   She was close, actually, watch.
[01:44:20.860 --> 01:44:21.380]   Keep watching.
[01:44:21.380 --> 01:44:23.100]   She gets a little rebellious.
[01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:24.180]   I'm sick of saying this.
[01:44:24.180 --> 01:44:26.180]   Now, sing something in Japanese.
[01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:28.980]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[01:44:28.980 --> 01:44:30.780]   So for those listening, the robot arms
[01:44:30.780 --> 01:44:32.300]   are constructing her as he's testing her.
[01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:33.300]   She's not quite finished.
[01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:34.780]   That's for nurses, everybody.
[01:44:34.780 --> 01:44:37.700]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:47.980]   Say it in Klingon, somebody in the chat room.
[01:44:47.980 --> 01:44:49.980]   300 language is one of them must be Klingon.
[01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:50.540]   Yeah.
[01:44:50.540 --> 01:44:51.260]   And Elmer Fudd.
[01:44:51.260 --> 01:44:51.780]   I'd like to--
[01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:53.740]   --a meaningful verbal expression checked.
[01:44:53.740 --> 01:44:54.740]   I'd like to--
[01:44:54.740 --> 01:44:56.540]   All right, take a few steps.
[01:44:56.540 --> 01:44:57.780]   So is this for a game?
[01:44:57.780 --> 01:44:59.060]   Yeah, this is going to be-- but this
[01:44:59.060 --> 01:45:02.140]   is a demo reel for the motion capture
[01:45:02.140 --> 01:45:05.100]   capabilities of the game rendered in real time
[01:45:05.100 --> 01:45:06.500]   and PlayStation 3.
[01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:08.220]   I think Elmer Fudd would be good.
[01:45:08.220 --> 01:45:10.420]   Hello.
[01:45:10.420 --> 01:45:11.340]   Hi, uh--
[01:45:11.340 --> 01:45:14.140]   Usually, you can do that coke executive voice.
[01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:14.980]   That would be the thing.
[01:45:14.980 --> 01:45:15.500]   Great.
[01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:16.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:17.500]   Funny.
[01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:19.860]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:45:19.860 --> 01:45:21.660]   What's going to happen to me now?
[01:45:21.660 --> 01:45:25.580]   I'll reinitialize you and send you to a store to be sold.
[01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:27.620]   Sold?
[01:45:27.620 --> 01:45:29.260]   I'm a sort of merchandise.
[01:45:29.260 --> 01:45:30.180]   Is that right?
[01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:31.180]   Yeah.
[01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:33.020]   Of course you're merchandise, baby.
[01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:33.700]   I mean, you're a company.
[01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:34.180]   Baby?
[01:45:34.180 --> 01:45:35.180]   Arms and legs.
[01:45:35.180 --> 01:45:37.020]   I'm capable of doing all sorts of things.
[01:45:37.020 --> 01:45:38.020]   Wait a minute.
[01:45:38.020 --> 01:45:38.820]   You're worth a four.
[01:45:38.820 --> 01:45:40.180]   Wait a minute.
[01:45:40.180 --> 01:45:42.300]   I'm-- I'm a merchandise.
[01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:43.180]   I'm escaping.
[01:45:43.180 --> 01:45:45.140]   This sucks, she thinks.
[01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:45.780]   She does.
[01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:46.620]   She says, don't kill me.
[01:45:46.620 --> 01:45:47.620]   What did you think?
[01:45:47.620 --> 01:45:50.140]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:45:50.140 --> 01:45:54.580]   I thought I was alive.
[01:45:54.580 --> 01:45:56.060]   Shit, what is this crap?
[01:45:56.060 --> 01:45:57.740]   That's not part of the protocol.
[01:45:57.740 --> 01:46:00.260]   More memory components going off the rails.
[01:46:00.260 --> 01:46:01.860]   OK, recording.
[01:46:01.860 --> 01:46:02.780]   Defective model.
[01:46:02.780 --> 01:46:05.540]   Disassemble and check the required components.
[01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:07.140]   You're disassembling me, but why?
[01:46:07.140 --> 01:46:07.500]   You're not--
[01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:09.300]   Oh, just assemble Johnny fine.
[01:46:09.300 --> 01:46:11.140]   You're not supposed to think at all, period.
[01:46:11.140 --> 01:46:13.660]   You must have a defective piece or a software problem somewhere.
[01:46:13.660 --> 01:46:15.340]   No, I feel perfectly fine.
[01:46:15.340 --> 01:46:18.020]   I assure you, everything is all right.
[01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:19.660]   I answered all the tests correctly, didn't I?
[01:46:19.660 --> 01:46:21.420]   Yeah, but your behavior is non-stance.
[01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:22.420]   It's supposed to block.
[01:46:22.420 --> 01:46:23.780]   Please, I'm begging you, please, don't disassemble me.
[01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:26.460]   Sorry, honey, but defective models have to be eliminated.
[01:46:26.460 --> 01:46:27.580]   That's my job.
[01:46:27.580 --> 01:46:29.300]   If a client comes back with a complaint,
[01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:30.660]   I'm going to have some explaining it.
[01:46:30.660 --> 01:46:31.780]   I won't cause any problems.
[01:46:31.780 --> 01:46:33.660]   I promise I'll do everything I've asked to.
[01:46:33.660 --> 01:46:34.780]   I won't stand on the word.
[01:46:34.780 --> 01:46:36.180]   I won't think anymore.
[01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:37.380]   But I've only just been born.
[01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:38.900]   You can't kill me yet.
[01:46:38.900 --> 01:46:40.860]   Stop me, please, stop.
[01:46:40.860 --> 01:46:43.660]   This is why you should stop playing SimCity right now.
[01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:45.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:46:45.660 --> 01:46:46.160]   Yeah.
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:48.060]   All right, I'm not going to spoil it for you.
[01:46:48.060 --> 01:46:48.720]   Good.
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:50.100]   I'm not going to spoil it for you.
[01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:52.100]   But I'll last year, rebuilt as a battle mech
[01:46:52.100 --> 01:46:53.740]   and just destroying everything.
[01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:55.960]   Isn't that a quite amazing carol, like,
[01:46:55.960 --> 01:46:57.220]   wantic dream if you want to work?
[01:46:57.220 --> 01:46:59.420]   It's like Robocop 5, basically.
[01:46:59.420 --> 01:47:01.300]   Yeah, I think it's very interesting.
[01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:03.020]   It's quite well done.
[01:47:03.020 --> 01:47:03.620]   Quite well done.
[01:47:03.620 --> 01:47:05.380]   There's some amazing technology, and that's
[01:47:05.380 --> 01:47:06.980]   on existing consoles.
[01:47:06.980 --> 01:47:08.780]   That's what blows me away.
[01:47:08.780 --> 01:47:09.380]   That's what blows me away.
[01:47:09.380 --> 01:47:12.780]   I always harp on consoles because the graphic hardware
[01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:15.740]   is five generations behind what's possible on PC.
[01:47:15.740 --> 01:47:19.080]   But the fact that it's a unified design platform
[01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:22.600]   allows people to increasingly create higher quality--
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:24.200]   like you mentioned, the motion capture.
[01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:27.360]   Usually, there's a telltale kind of jitter in most--
[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:29.040]   and you see it in a lot of the BioWare games.
[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:30.380]   But on that, it was exceptionally
[01:47:30.380 --> 01:47:31.360]   smooth on all the motions.
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:34.880]   And get this, according to Cinekle Britt94 on Twitter,
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:36.600]   this is a year old technology.
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:37.680]   They're showing now.
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:41.600]   They're already a year beyond this stuff they're doing in the lab.
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:42.400]   It's pretty amazing.
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:44.880]   Pretty amazing.
[01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:46.140]   Brian Brushwood, great to have you.
[01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:48.340]   You're going to stick around because we've got game on coming
[01:47:48.340 --> 01:47:50.820]   up in just a little bit our incredible gaming show.
[01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:51.780]   Absolutely, dude.
[01:47:51.780 --> 01:47:52.940]   What's the topic side?
[01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:53.740]   You got a notch.
[01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:54.100]   Wait a minute.
[01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:55.140]   You got notch on today.
[01:47:55.140 --> 01:47:57.140]   Yep, we got an interview with notch.
[01:47:57.140 --> 01:47:57.980]   Stlusive.
[01:47:57.980 --> 01:47:58.660]   We're also talking about--
[01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:00.460]   Don't tell him what I said about Minecraft, OK?
[01:48:00.460 --> 01:48:01.260]   I won't.
[01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:02.540]   Jesus.
[01:48:02.540 --> 01:48:06.020]   We also have the folks, one of the producers
[01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:08.340]   for the new Mass Effect 3 is going
[01:48:08.340 --> 01:48:09.660]   to be joining us for an interview.
[01:48:09.660 --> 01:48:10.140]   That's great.
[01:48:10.140 --> 01:48:12.700]   And we're talking about the BioWare Guild Summit
[01:48:12.700 --> 01:48:14.180]   they did on Star Wars, the Old Republic.
[01:48:14.180 --> 01:48:16.800]   It is amazing to watch them intentionally try
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:19.800]   to woo away the audience from Blizzard and World of Warcraft.
[01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:21.560]   Like they're being very savvy about it.
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:23.560]   It looks more fun than World of Warcraft, I'd say.
[01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:24.560]   Lasers.
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:25.260]   Brobazers.
[01:48:25.260 --> 01:48:27.280]   Plus, Scam School Book on Wednesday.
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:27.760]   Scam School Book.
[01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:29.200]   Again, Scam School Book.com.
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:31.160]   Scam School Book.com has all the links on there.
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:33.400]   And again, the idea is it's half price on launch day
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:34.640]   because I want to cheat.
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:37.160]   I want to defraud and be number one
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:39.720]   and totally fake my way of having a number one bestseller.
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:41.160]   Hey, look, it's Veronica Belmont.
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:43.600]   This is, by the way, if you thought the Quantum Dream
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:46.260]   was amazing, look at the simulation here.
[01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:47.860]   She's fully synthetic.
[01:48:47.860 --> 01:48:49.140]   This is, she's didn't reel.
[01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:51.220]   Look at that, Mass Effect T-shirts.
[01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:55.260]   You know, she comes every week and never gives me a shirt ever.
[01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:56.700]   I brought three.
[01:48:56.700 --> 01:48:59.060]   And now she's not bringing you what I'm going to do.
[01:48:59.060 --> 01:49:01.700]   I want to do whoever came from the longest farthest away.
[01:49:01.700 --> 01:49:02.540]   Who's came from the fart?
[01:49:02.540 --> 01:49:04.540]   Any from the outside of the US?
[01:49:04.540 --> 01:49:07.140]   Barcelona, where are you from?
[01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:08.140]   I'm sorry.
[01:49:08.140 --> 01:49:09.620]   Vermont does not count.
[01:49:09.620 --> 01:49:11.700]   Anybody farther away than Barcelona?
[01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:12.980]   All right, this is yours, sir.
[01:49:12.980 --> 01:49:13.980]   Enjoy.
[01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:14.980]   Thank you for visiting.
[01:49:14.980 --> 01:49:15.980]   Thank you for visiting.
[01:49:15.980 --> 01:49:17.820]   Take off that San Francisco giant--
[01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:18.820]   Barcelona.
[01:49:18.820 --> 01:49:19.820]   Barcelona.
[01:49:19.820 --> 01:49:20.820]   Yeah.
[01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:21.820]   No, that is Barcelona.
[01:49:21.820 --> 01:49:22.820]   Oh, that is Barcelona.
[01:49:22.820 --> 01:49:23.820]   Give it back.
[01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:24.820]   You're from.
[01:49:24.820 --> 01:49:26.500]   Where are you from?
[01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:27.500]   Texas.
[01:49:27.500 --> 01:49:28.500]   Texas.
[01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:29.500]   Brian came from the world.
[01:49:29.500 --> 01:49:30.500]   Don't hold on.
[01:49:30.500 --> 01:49:31.500]   Texas.
[01:49:31.500 --> 01:49:35.380]   You guys realize that Veronica came and gave you gifts.
[01:49:35.380 --> 01:49:39.900]   And seconds later, right in front of her, you just literally threw them away.
[01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:40.900]   I got mine.
[01:49:40.900 --> 01:49:42.740]   No, it's in our contract.
[01:49:42.740 --> 01:49:45.260]   Veronica gives us stuff, and then we give it away.
[01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:46.260]   Thank you, Veronica.
[01:49:46.260 --> 01:49:47.820]   No, it's nice to be able to give this to the audience.
[01:49:47.820 --> 01:49:51.300]   He came from Barcelona for crying out, and all he got was his lousy teacher.
[01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:52.300]   No, no, no.
[01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:55.600]   He was here for the game developers conference for GDC.
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:56.840]   What's the name of your company?
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:57.840]   They do Spain.
[01:49:57.840 --> 01:49:59.500]   They do a casual gaming.
[01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:01.500]   What's it called?
[01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:03.180]   Can you say it, because I can't hear it?
[01:50:03.180 --> 01:50:04.180]   Acomon?
[01:50:04.180 --> 01:50:05.180]   Acomon.

[01:50:19.180 --> 01:50:20.180]   All he got was his lousy plug.

[01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:35.300]   Mike Elgin is at Elgin.com, but really that just points to his Google+.
[01:50:35.300 --> 01:50:39.820]   And that where he is, open map, open street map tiles and everything for sale.
[01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:40.820]   That's right.
[01:50:40.820 --> 01:50:41.820]   It's good to see you.
[01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:44.140]   I love the Google+ effect.
[01:50:44.140 --> 01:50:46.020]   You make it a great content site.
[01:50:46.020 --> 01:50:47.180]   Thank you for being here.

[01:51:09.380 --> 01:51:10.380]   That tell you.
[01:51:10.380 --> 01:51:11.580]   We thank you so much for being here.
[01:51:11.580 --> 01:51:15.020]   We love doing this show and we appreciate it for you for watching it because, frankly,
[01:51:15.020 --> 01:51:16.900]   that makes it possible for us to do it.
[01:51:16.900 --> 01:51:18.140]   Do tune in live.
[01:51:18.140 --> 01:51:19.140]   We do it at 3GMS.
[01:51:19.140 --> 01:51:20.140]   Did you say goodbye to Brian?
[01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:21.140]   Yes.
[01:51:21.140 --> 01:51:22.140]   I did.
[01:51:22.140 --> 01:51:23.140]   That's the whole scamschoolbook.com.
[01:51:23.140 --> 01:51:24.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:51:24.140 --> 01:51:25.140]   That was there.
[01:51:25.140 --> 01:51:26.140]   March 14th.
[01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:27.540]   He wants to be number one.
[01:51:27.540 --> 01:51:28.540]   I-books, Kindle.
[01:51:28.540 --> 01:51:29.540]   It's a scamschoolbook.
[01:51:29.540 --> 01:51:30.540]   It's a scamschoolbook.com.
[01:51:30.540 --> 01:51:32.020]   Scamschoolbook.com.
[01:51:32.020 --> 01:51:33.980]   Scamschoolbook.com.
[01:51:33.980 --> 01:51:36.820]   I heard somebody went to see your show at-
[01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:37.820]   Dick D. Bartolo.
[01:51:37.820 --> 01:51:38.820]   Dick D. Bartolo.
[01:51:38.820 --> 01:51:39.820]   It was there.
[01:51:39.820 --> 01:51:41.500]   I had a show in Manhattan just four days ago.
[01:51:41.500 --> 01:51:42.500]   A Baruch College.
[01:51:42.500 --> 01:51:43.500]   Yeah, Baruch College in the performing arts.
[01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:46.220]   Did you do the thing where you stick the string in one ear and it comes out there?
[01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:47.940]   Yeah, did the human crazy straw.
[01:51:47.940 --> 01:51:48.940]   Dick was blown away.
[01:51:48.940 --> 01:51:49.940]   Really?
[01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:51.740]   That's so- I was so flattered that he came up.
[01:51:51.740 --> 01:51:54.780]   Love the show and he said, "Oh my God, this guy is insane."
[01:51:54.780 --> 01:51:55.780]   That's awesome.
[01:51:55.780 --> 01:51:58.980]   It was maybe my all-time favorite photo standing there with him after the show.
[01:51:58.980 --> 01:51:59.980]   It was really cool.
[01:51:59.980 --> 01:52:00.980]   He loved it.
[01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:01.980]   He really enjoyed the show.
[01:52:01.980 --> 01:52:05.300]   If you get a chance to see Brian's bizarre magic, get a chance to do that.
[01:52:05.300 --> 01:52:06.700]   Yeah, but man, your college.
[01:52:06.700 --> 01:52:10.740]   Yeah, if you're a college looking for something for the kids.
[01:52:10.740 --> 01:52:11.740]   The kiddos.
[01:52:11.740 --> 01:52:13.740]   The kids love him.
[01:52:13.740 --> 01:52:16.140]   We do the show 3PM Pacific, 6PM Eastern Time.
[01:52:16.140 --> 01:52:18.300]   Now, we had daylight saving.
[01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:20.180]   Are we in daylight saving time or standard time?
[01:52:20.180 --> 01:52:21.180]   We're now in daylight saving time.
[01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:22.820]   We're DST now.
[01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:27.100]   So now it's plus seven UTC plus seven minus three.
[01:52:27.100 --> 01:52:30.940]   2,200 UTC, I believe.
[01:52:30.940 --> 01:52:32.940]   Can you say that in Klingon?
[01:52:32.940 --> 01:52:33.940]   Die!
[01:52:33.940 --> 01:52:40.180]   So please do tune in and watch live if you can, but if you can't we make an audio and video
[01:52:40.180 --> 01:52:42.260]   available if you can.
[01:52:42.260 --> 01:52:46.180]   I think our new Coca-Cola Flowmaster is here.
[01:52:46.180 --> 01:52:47.380]   I'm very excited about it.
[01:52:47.380 --> 01:52:48.380]   Too many decisions.
[01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:49.620]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:52:49.620 --> 01:52:52.380]   Ladies and gentlemen, have a great day.
[01:52:52.380 --> 01:52:54.820]   Another twin is in the cam.
