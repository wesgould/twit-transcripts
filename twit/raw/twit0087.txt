[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.800]   >> Bandwidth for this weekend tech is provided by
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.880]   AOL Radio at AOL.com/podcasting.
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.080]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.640]   >> This is Twit, this weekend tech, episode 87 for
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.520]   February 5th, 2007, we've got wood.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.720]   This is a special edition of Twit, thanks to George Wood,
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.040]   who made a best of for our request.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.880]   We'll be back live next Sunday, but meanwhile, thanks George.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.240]   Enjoy.
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.640]   >> John C. Devorek had an interesting idea.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   Neither John or I went to Vegas, I just didn't go because I'm lazy.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.320]   But John actually is trying something out.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.000]   You're doing a virtual CES?
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   >> Yeah, I gave up on the idea of going to CES and I'll tell you why.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.040]   There's over 6,500 analysts and media people, they are covering 2,500 booths.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.960]   >> Well, it's like over covered.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.440]   And so I put up a metasight instead, which is basically I went and
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.320]   looked at all the people that are linking to CES or that have news about CES.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.920]   Which includes PC magazines, if Davis, ZeeDeeNet, PCWorld, NGajit, Gizmodo.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.640]   And you go to my site, devorek.org/ces and you'll find it.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.720]   And that's essentially as far as I'm concerned, you can get the whole show that way.
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.120]   And in fact, it's very well covered if you take a look at those particular sites.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.280]   >> So it was a very, I think a very exciting keynote.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.600]   It was kind of like a rock show, really.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.960]   I mean, you didn't go, John, who was at the keynote?
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.640]   >> I just got the thing, you know, I did smart money.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.480]   >> It's not the same.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.680]   >> The MacRumorsLive.com thing is a minute by minute breakdown works for me.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.440]   >> And you know, that's every bit as good as being in there.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.440]   >> Yeah, it is.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.320]   >> Come on, it's an Apple keynote, which means it's going to be a pause at every announcement.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.720]   >> Yes.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.880]   >> There's going to be a huge number of basically engineers and Mac employees in the back to
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.560]   make sure if there's no clapping and clapping starts at the back and moves it way forward.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.520]   They take the journalists and they bury them in the middle or off to the sides so
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.800]   that they're surrounded by enthusiastic people.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.960]   They're brilliantly managed.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.880]   >> Oh, you think you're so smart.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.320]   The Apple people were in front this time.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.400]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.240]   >> You know?
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.800]   >> They were all over it.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.520]   >> They've never seen those old Betty Boop cartoons.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.280]   But the audiences that they show typically when a Betty Boop cartoon with everyone's clapping and
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.720]   jumping up and down hippopotamuses and whatever.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.040]   >> It's pretty much the same thing.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.040]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.000]   >> So there was a hippopotamus?
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.160]   >> It's in Steve's contract.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.160]   >> There was a couple of hippopotamuses.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.160]   >> In A22.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.720]   >> Is that Steve was kind of down today?
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.720]   I think he was actually sick.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.880]   >> You think he was down?
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.080]   >> No, I think he was sick.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.080]   He was slow.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.680]   He kept referring to his notes, which kind of surprised me.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.680]   He's usually got that stuff.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.760]   >> And he misspoke a couple of times and that is not like Steve.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.320]   >> I mean, if Steve could clone himself, he would have fired himself for the first time.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.320]   >> So tell us the story.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.240]   >> So that's what, here's the first story that I was.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.400]   We've been sitting on for a while, but this is the story that ran in info world in a
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.720]   few other places, which in this title, the IBM expert warns of short lifespan for burn
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.720]   CDs.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.720]   >> Did you all get this?
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.400]   I got this from 30 different people in the email.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.480]   It's like, what about this?
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.960]   He says two, two and a half years?
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.560]   >> Two years to five years max.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.320]   >> Well, for burn CDs?
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.320]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.000]   >> Is that coming from like a specific period, like CDRs created back in like '99 or '99?
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   >> I had no idea.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   To be honest about it, I have no idea what he's talking about.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.960]   >> Well, an application I had on the CD that I've had for six years.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.960]   >> I think it's a bug.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.960]   >> I have.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.960]   >> What is the CD?
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.960]   >> Are you talking about using CDRs for archiving purposes?
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.960]   >> No, he's made of it.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.960]   >> I think it's a terrible idea to archive stuff on burn CDs.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:33.960]   >> What do you archive it on?
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.960]   >> I think it's a bug.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.520]   >> Well, I mean, I think it's pretty much been proven that like a CD that's pressed
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.920]   last longer than a CD, it's burned.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.920]   >> Oh, yeah, well, that's a fact.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.920]   >> It is a fact.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.920]   >> It is a fact.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.920]   >> But like, so what?
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.720]   >> If I have a bunch of stuff like family heirloom type stuff that I want to keep, I'm
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.600]   not going to burn it on a CD and I'm already, here's what's really, I've had a kind of
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.280]   a, I recently bought a damn flicker count because I figured, you know what, I can upload
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.480]   all of my stuff there and flicker will be around in six years.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.320]   >> But you know what, I trust that right now more than I would stick in a CD in a CD.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.120]   >> Oh, no, I do.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.120]   >> I don't like the brother.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.320]   Listen, this guy, you're back.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.960]   >> I jumped up by putting stuff on my hand.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.920]   >> Listen, Gereki, the guy from IBM, he recommends that the, that people use magnetic tapes.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.560]   >> Amazon now admits it's going to open a music store.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.720]   It's going to make its own MP3 player.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.720]   They're going to take, they're going to basically model themselves after Apple with the closed
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.720]   music store.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.080]   >> Are they going to license the iPod design?
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.080]   >> No.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.680]   >> Well, it's a dog, it's not going to work.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.200]   >> But the, well, what they're saying is, look what Apple did right.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.000]   They said, we're going to create a music store that only plays on our player.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.160]   You want to play our music, you got to have your player.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.000]   So if we create a better, I think this is their thinking, if we create a better music
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.760]   store, and they're going to do subscription by the way, not, so you pay out monthly or
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.040]   yearly fee, and you'll get all you can eat, and you'd have to use the Amazon player.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.040]   >> Good idea.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.040]   >> I wonder how long they'll take to crack.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.040]   >> I don't know.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.040]   >> Better idea.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.040]   >> But, can I already do that?
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.040]   Like, you know, wraps it up.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.960]   >> I don't think it's a good idea at all.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.480]   I don't think the Apple idea is very good idea.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.480]   >> I think it's an old idea.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.480]   >> The problem comes down to the DRM.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.560]   >> Yeah, it does this, this, this locked in stuff.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.920]   >> Apple doesn't license fair play to anyone.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.000]   So you're stuck using their player with the Apple iTunes store.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.560]   If Amazon licenses their DRM technology cheaply to enough people, then it would make at least
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.560]   an open platform distribute music on.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.040]   More open than Apple's current is.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.320]   >> Their goal would be to make a close, I mean, if you're going to compete with, if
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.280]   you're going to do what Apple did, you make a close platform, right?
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.440]   And hope that people like your music store so much that they buy your player.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.720]   >> And you're placing then dependence on creating good hardware that people want to
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.240]   buy, and that could be tricky.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.400]   >> I think you've got to hope that Apple doesn't, that Apple doesn't lose their lawsuit
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.840]   over tying their music store to their player too.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.840]   >> That's true too.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.560]   >> But that keeps the record companies hacking on Apple's side.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.160]   That's the other thing, the Ola cart, one, or one fee per all the downloads you want.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.920]   I think the music companies are going to go a little crazy about that one.
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.480]   >> Sunday, I should announce this also.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.320]   John, you won't be there, I'm sorry to say.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.760]   You'll be in the handover.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.280]   But next Friday, I should say March 3rd, we're going to be doing the show live from the Apple
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.600]   store.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.040]   So, yeah, Wausi said he'd join us for that, so that'd be fun.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.280]   >> That'll be pretty exciting.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.280]   >> I got lucky to get out of that one.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.280]   >> You don't want to be there?
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.280]   Oh, yeah, that's right, they'd stone you.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.160]   >> At least currently, I mean, just close over, let's put it down.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.880]   >> Yeah, one of the biggest articles on dig.com right now is somebody, I guess, has written
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:24.040]   a point-by-point, you know, point-by-point refuting every single thing you pause it in
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.040]   that article.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.880]   And I keep running into Mac people that I know that know I know you, and they're like,
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.320]   "Do you have to worry just to believe that, doesn't it?
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.800]   I just need to say that for the column.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.960]   You just like to agitate people."
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.200]   I'm like, "Yeah, every, you know, six to 12 weeks."
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.120]   John goes, "I haven't pissed off the entire Apple-loving community a few weeks.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.560]   I could use a couple hundred extra thousand hits on this column."
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.520]   And it's just, but people are like, "People are like, "You don't believe that, does he?"
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.400]   >> I'm surprised anybody would take the time to do a point-by-point refutation.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.400]   That's what cracks me up.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.960]   >> It shows you how psychopathic some of these people are.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.960]   >> It's just nuts.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.640]   Well, I spend the energy on that.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.960]   I mean, it's only just, you know, it's a consideration.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.000]   Somebody wrote me something nasty, and I said, "You know, it's not like I'm on the board
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.800]   of Apple suggesting this, and you should be yelling at it."
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.800]   >> Right, right.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.800]   It's just a thought.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.800]   >> It's just a call.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.920]   On February 28th, this Tuesday, Apple is going to make a big announcement, and I think that's
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.920]   exactly what they're going to announce.
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.920]   >> What do you think they're going to announce?
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:17.920]   They're going to have a break.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.560]   >> They're going to show shipping windows.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.000]   Now, it's kind of like- >> Have you seen the pictures of their new iPod?
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   >> Yeah, I have.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.200]   I don't know how real they are.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.120]   Let me just tell a story- >> I just heard it was an announcement of something fun.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.160]   >> Yeah, let me tell a story, and we can see if we can decipher.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.880]   I mean, it's kind of, there's very cryptic.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.840]   I got the email myself that says, "It's just got a little ICal picture, February 28th,
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.440]   2006," and it says, "This is all.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.400]   It's just eight words, but everybody is reading into this eight words amazingly."
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.960]   Come see some fun new products from Apple.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.480]   It's all it says.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.480]   Now I'm going to go down there.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.560]   I'm going to go down with a camera crew, and we're going to cover it.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.080]   It could just be iPod Socks version 2.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:06.000]   One new product doesn't sound big.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.400]   Any thoughts from anybody?
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.160]   The speculation- >> There's so little information
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.400]   to work on this point.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:16.920]   It's like semiotics, you're trying to understand what could they have meant by fun.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.560]   What do they mean by products?
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.960]   Fun new products?
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.840]   >> It's a video player.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.280]   >> That's what, and then Gadget had a picture, very similar to the picture of the video iPod.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.680]   >> Except the whole thing is a display and it's touch screen.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.280]   >> You feel that that's accurate?
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.000]   David, or do you have inside information?
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.760]   >> I don't have inside information, but that's what everyone that thinks that they have accurate
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.760]   information.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.800]   >> I think it's a great idea.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.680]   iPod, high-five boombox arriving next week amongst the other products.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:51.160]   >> I guess really the story is how the press made such a big deal out of what Apple clearly
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.520]   wanted to be just a little announcement, right?
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.920]   >> Yeah, I mean the predictions of what was going to be crazy.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:03.360]   >> It was crazy, and you know, a severe letdown I believe is an understatement about it.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.400]   >> And we were guilty of it too.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.400]   I mean, you know, all Apple said was, "What are you looking at?"
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.240]   >> Yeah, the Apple just wanted it to be a small little gathering with four or five friends.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:15.480]   So they said, "And the rotations do everyone in every major media outlet in North America."
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:21.400]   >> Yeah, but it wasn't like, "Hold it, sometimes these announcements are get ready to get your
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.400]   socks blown off."
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.720]   This time it said, "Come join us for a few fun new products."
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.520]   >> And the rumors were not exciting enough to not expect too much anyway.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.960]   >> Well, I mean everybody, I think they were--
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.960]   >> I had this expectation.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.960]   >> What did people think?
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.800]   It was going to be a video iPod, right?
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.360]   >> I think people thought it would be everything from a video iPod to a standalone DVR to the
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.360]   Apple HDTV.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.480]   I mean, it doesn't really matter what the invitation says.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.480]   >> G5 is an interesting--
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.560]   >> It matters that you got an invitation and it's at Apple and it said it's going to be
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.560]   a thing.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.880]   >> And there's going to be a thing.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.120]   >> And that's enough.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.040]   >> I actually did not get an invitation at first.
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.040]   My man.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.040]   >> Oh, me neither.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.040]   >> I didn't have an invitation.
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.280]   >> And so I felt really left out of--
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.040]   >> Well, everyone was going to party.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.040]   >> Oh, look at that.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.040]   >> Oh, look at that.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.040]   >> He's here.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.040]   >> He brought beer.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.040]   >> Wow.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.040]   [ Applause ]
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.040]   >> What do you think this is?
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.040]   >> This is a big nation.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.040]   >> It wouldn't be--
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.040]   >> It wouldn't be enough for everyone.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.040]   >> Mr. Rose.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.640]   >> It wouldn't be a Kevin Rose show without some beer.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.120]   Can we get a mic on Mr. Rose?
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.120]   We do have a mic.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.120]   You don't have the fancy mics.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.120]   We do.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.120]   I'm so glad to see you.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.920]   We thought you weren't going to be here, so we just got started.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.320]   Actually, this is a van at Apple.
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.920]   I normally get invited to all the big Apple events, and I wasn't invited to this one.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.280]   Usually, I hear from Steve, but I may have actually turned it down because of a conflict
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.720]   and schedule, and then the conflict erased itself, but I know I wasn't there.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.840]   >> You know, okay, so then that's two new minis.
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.960]   I think overpriced, right?
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:44.120]   I mean, I like a couple hundred bucks, this mini, that you think?
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.120]   And then, what do you think?
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.120]   I don't know.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.360]   >> Well, I like to go to these events, and when they come to the pricing point, I like
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.080]   to try and guess the price.
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.920]   >> The prices were way under what they actually have the prices at.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.360]   >> Well, they actually raised the price of the mini.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.120]   From $4.99 to $5.99.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.120]   Why?
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:06.200]   Because it's in town, because it's got a remote control, because they felt they were undercharging
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.120]   for Airport Express and Bluetooth.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.600]   >> I don't know.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.800]   Maybe they just didn't want the people who bought the previous versions like me to feel
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.800]   like heels.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.800]   Are you kidding?
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.800]   >> Kevin's lawyer is asked.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.800]   >> Exactly.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.800]   He's like, "The wife I was hacked, so I guess we can't get on."
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.800]   >> Oh, yeah, you can't hear it.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.800]   I have something for you.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.800]   >> Plus, you don't want to.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.800]   >> The only picture comes up.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:29.000]   >> Well, John, you just wrote a column saying Web 2.0 was just Web 1.0, re-warmed and equally
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   dumb.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.400]   >> It's the same, you know, what you have to do is just, I think there's been some lists
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.680]   put on some websites and some blogs, where it shows you, you know, the old name and the
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:39.680]   new name.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:40.680]   It's the same thing.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.680]   They just renamed all these things.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.400]   >> Think free office rightly.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.080]   >> Well, there was a discussion about that at E-Tech too.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.080]   I don't know who said it.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.080]   I wish I could remember.
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.560]   But somebody said that Web 2.0 really is the same thing as Web 1.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.360]   But what happened in the meantime is that the investment community came in and popped
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.240]   the bubble or created a bubble and popped it.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.240]   So this is essentially the geeks taking the Web back from the investment community.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:06.680]   >> I think there was nothing wrong with Web 2.0, except that there wasn't a business model
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.680]   for a lot of these.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:13.840]   And now that banner advertising is successful and you can make some money, I don't, I mean,
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.400]   yeah, you might see some overheating.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:19.720]   I think Google's snapping up rightly so quickly is probably some evidence of that.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.280]   But is Web 1.0, was it so very flawed?
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.840]   I mean, who cares that the investment bust?
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:31.480]   >> Well, except that somebody needed to put a new spin on it so people would pay attention.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.000]   The techies are doing the same stuff we did all along.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   We never stopped.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   >> Right.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   >> So it's a continuum.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   I think John's writing that sense.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   >> Well, you know who else never stopped?
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.800]   Is Amazon and eBay and John pointed this out that some of those companies just kept on
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.800]   going?
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.800]   >> What's the big story?
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.800]   >> Is it sitting right behind you, Patrick?
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.840]   >> The DOJ, so this is bigger than the DOJ story.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.840]   >> I don't you think?
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.840]   >> Bigger than the Google.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:51.840]   >> In the long run, I'm putting up the instructions.
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.000]   >> Tell the listeners what I'm pointing to.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.920]   >> My God, it's a copy of Windows XP running on a Macintosh Mini.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.320]   >> On a Macintosh Mini.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.480]   >> On a Macintosh Mini.
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.480]   >> No graphics drivers.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.480]   >> It works.
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.480]   >> It works.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.480]   >> It works.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.480]   >> It works.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.480]   >> But it works.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.480]   >> But you can turn it on and you can move it to the mouse around.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.480]   >> But you can play with those native solitaire on it.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.480]   >> And you can go into the emulator.
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.480]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.480]   >> It's pretty nifty.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.840]   >> You can do a little bit yet.
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:15.840]   >> Yes.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:16.840]   >> Really?
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:21.360]   >> No, that doable, when you started up, when you, this is using the one that was posted
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.360]   for the third stream.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.360]   >> The slipstream.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:28.240]   >> So when you started up, you hit page up or page down and you go OS 10 or Windows
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.280]   and then you hit enter and you're in, you're in, you're good to go.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.840]   >> You have two partitions on there.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.840]   >> Yep.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.760]   >> And then you, like man, do you have, how's it, how's it work?
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.880]   Do you manually install each of the operating systems after you've been in the partition?
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.120]   >> Yeah, and I, I will admit that I didn't do it.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.720]   Ben Durbin here did it.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:48.880]   But that was what we were doing for Mac break and he, he did, he partitioned the drive and
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.680]   then installed each operating system on each.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.040]   >> Did you install one first or not?
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.920]   >> I think you, I think you installed the OS 10 version first.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:02.160]   And then, and it, it's really on that bleeding edge side of things where two hours before,
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.640]   you know, we needed it, they, they, do a new patch to work just without many.
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:06.640]   >> Right.
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.640]   >> What you needed for?
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.640]   >> The patch?
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.640]   >> No, I mean, what did you need to do?
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.280]   >> Oh, we wanted, we wanted to see if we could do it while we were shooting Mac break.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.160]   So we were, we were shooting all day and we were like, hey, let's see if we can, you know,
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.280]   actually it had just come out the day before.
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.120]   So we, we wanted to see if we could make it work before the end of the day.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.600]   >> So it's using the NT bootloader to swap between?
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.520]   >> I don't know what it's using.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.520]   It's using magic.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.520]   >> Welcome everybody.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.720]   We, we had invited Robert Scobull of Microsoft Corporation to join us to talk about our top
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:36.440]   story but he can't make it, maybe we'll get him back next week.
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.800]   Actually there's a bunch of Microsoft news.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:44.400]   The biggest story of course is that Vista Consumer Edition won't be out till early 2007.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.600]   Business Edition comes out late 2006 as planned.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.720]   >> That just makes me laugh.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:54.800]   >> Why would they release, clearly nobody in business is going to adopt it until the
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.400]   consumer edition is out, right?
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.400]   Is it just so they can test it?
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.400]   >> I don't think that's true.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.400]   >> What's the rationale?
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.840]   Why release the, what is the story?
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.840]   Why are they doing this?
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:11.640]   >> Well, I mean the word on the street is that they have some multimedia issues in the,
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:15.160]   in the main part of the code because you know they want to incorporate all this cool stuff.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.160]   >> Right.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.160]   >> Nah, I don't know.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.160]   I mean the whole thing sounds a little fishy to me.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.000]   I mean it's not as well they haven't done this before.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:26.800]   There's one rumor on the net that says it suggests that it's possibly some licensing
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:30.680]   deals haven't been signed off on and then maybe it's going to be harder to get them to sign
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.800]   off on them because you know Microsoft doesn't like to license anything.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.480]   >> Yeah, wait time says it's a big yawn.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.480]   Everybody's happy with XP.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.080]   I don't know about that.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.480]   >> Well that's my question too.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.040]   I mean you know take a look at an IT department.
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:49.200]   These guys have fought for years to get something stable and like it or not they've got something
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.200]   stable.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.560]   I can't think of anything worse than having to get rid of XP and go to Vista.
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.520]   >> Well and in fact that was same issue happened with Windows 2000.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.520]   I think they were very reluctant to go to XP.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.560]   >> Yeah, well it took a long time.
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.560]   >> A lot of them didn't.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.720]   Microsoft has to light a fire and I have to say well you're not going to get updates.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.360]   >> How many times even somebody's office and they fire up the computer and there's Windows
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.360]   2?
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.400]   >> If I had my choice that would be the version I'd be using.
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.400]   >> Really?
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:19.400]   So you know we all assume that every few years there's a new major version of Windows and
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.400]   we're all going to follow it.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:24.840]   I wonder if that eventually breaks and we just stopped doing it at some point.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:29.160]   >> Well you know one of the things I have an issue with is that what's the difference.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.960]   I mean what is Vista bringing to the party?
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.200]   >> Well Patrick you played with it more than anybody else.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.200]   What do you think?
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.840]   >> Oh boy.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.360]   >> So first of all happy anniversary.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:44.060]   Let me probably should introduce in order of Apple employee ID number and I think Bill
[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:47.480]   you'd probably get the pride of place until Waz gets here.
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.800]   >> I'm number four.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:49.800]   >> Number four.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:50.800]   >> Yes.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.800]   >> Hired.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:52.800]   >> Or was dropped in Markola.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.600]   >> And hired on April Fool's date 1976.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.800]   >> No I think it was like February.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:58.800]   >> Oh okay.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.840]   >> Or I'm not sure it went exactly what.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.160]   >> Well what a lot of people don't remember is that this is actually the anniversary of
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.720]   Apple's second incorporation.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.080]   >> Randy Wiginton.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:14.520]   >> The first was actually done at Jobs House and it was sometime in the fall it was like
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.960]   after one of the homebrew computer club meetings.
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:22.800]   Except then at that point I think like Ron Wayne owned a third of Apple which sold for
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:27.440]   $900 and other things.
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.320]   I don't think it was set up very well.
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.640]   But that was actually the first incorporation.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.080]   >> We were trying to track Ron Wayne down.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:38.000]   I thought it would be fun to see what he's up to and whether he has any regrets.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.240]   >> He's probably out drinking heavily.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:45.200]   >> Well I think Waz told me that he was just scared.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:50.560]   He was afraid of betting the farm on this crazy little company.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.960]   He had lost money on every investment he'd ever done.
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.800]   So he was thrilled to get his original investment back.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.040]   >> Yeah his money back.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.040]   Yeah.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.400]   Bill were you at all nervous joining up in those early days?
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.400]   >> No not really.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:09.720]   These were some people I knew and it sounded like a great and fun thing and I was still
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.360]   living with my folks and my car was paid off and I wasn't married so I figured what the
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.200]   heck I could take a risk.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:20.160]   >> And was your job moumaintly soldering what exactly were you up to in those early days?
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:26.120]   >> My title was electronic technician which means technical jack of all trades.
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:31.160]   I do everything from running to the store to pick up parts that have been ordered to designing
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.960]   and building burn in boxes and test fixtures.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.360]   >> And this was on the, at that time I guess it would have been the Apple One still or
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.360]   was the Apple Two?
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.360]   >> Yeah it was the Apple One.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.120]   I think we'd had the first batch of Apple One.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.520]   >> And who was next in the group?
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.520]   Was it you Randy or?
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.520]   >> I would be next.
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.920]   >> Rod Holt was number five.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.800]   I was number six and then Scottie was number seven.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.720]   >> It's fun.
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.320]   Do you still have those old badges?
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.320]   I still have mine.
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.320]   >> It'd be fun to have.
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.240]   >> I think they took mine when I left.
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.280]   >> They'd give it back.
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.960]   How long were you there Bill?
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.720]   >> Well I was there for about a year and a half and then some other friends I'd worked
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:16.800]   with before hired me away and then I went to Japan for a couple of years and then I returned
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:22.320]   in about 81 to work on the Mac project for the early 15 people on it.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:25.440]   >> That seemed -- >> Total life worked about 13 years for Apple.
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:29.160]   >> That seems very common that people come and go isn't it?
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.160]   >> Yes.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.160]   >> Many people have -- >> Common in this industry in particular.
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.400]   >> Yeah many people have multiple ten years.
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.760]   Randy what were you doing in those early days?
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.760]   >> I was in high school.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:40.760]   >> Really?
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:41.760]   >> Oh yeah.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.760]   >> Oh yeah.
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.320]   >> I actually started working at Apple before I could drive.
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.320]   >> Love it.
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:51.240]   >> The entire executive staff of Apple went to Randy's high school graduation I think.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.760]   >> That's true?
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:53.760]   That must be fun.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.760]   >> Very unusual honor.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:56.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.760]   >> Walt would come back from one of the homebrew computer clubs where he had taken an Apple
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:04.600]   wand to show and he'd come back raving about some high school student who'd done some fantastic
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:05.600]   demo on it.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.800]   Something with colors and something with graphics and I think Randy Wiggington was one and Chris
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:13.680]   has been also with another that I remember particularly in those days.
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:19.400]   >> So I mean for all of you, was this your first experience with a personal computer?
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.920]   >> I had actually worked on a friend's M-Zy.
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.720]   >> Yeah and there was the mid-soultzer too.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.880]   >> Yeah nobody had the Altero's too expensive.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.120]   We're going for the M-Zy.
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:33.360]   >> And I guess -- >> I was doing time sharing and I had my own
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:37.960]   KSR 35 which was the military version of the teletype.
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.200]   >> This must have been pretty exciting at that time though.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:44.160]   >> The idea of building a mass market personal computer.
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:48.320]   >> Well throughout high school, I and all of my electronics buddies, we wanted to build
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.320]   our own computers.
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.840]   So to finally be able to have your own computer was incredibly exciting.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:53.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:58.640]   >> Leo I don't think any of us really thought of in terms of a mass market for computers.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.360]   I mean we just wanted one for ourselves.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:08.120]   >> Actually I was excited about this story and it turned out to be not so Bill Gates doing
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.480]   a guest appearance in Doctor Who.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.480]   >> But not true.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.480]   What a let down.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.440]   >> Yeah I don't think that one's true.
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.000]   Bill does a lot of fun things though.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   >> He was in Frazier.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.640]   I mean he did in 2001 he did a cameo on Frazier.
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:25.160]   The thing that probably was the giveaway was in the original story was when they said that
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:30.120]   Gates would play an alien whose goal was total world domination.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.880]   See I don't see Bill doing that.
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:32.880]   >> Nah well maybe.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:37.880]   I mean you should see some of the funny videos they do internally for employees to see.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:41.680]   >> He got together with the guy who does Napoleon Dynamite.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:48.400]   I forget what the actor's name is but they did a fun skip for the employee meeting.
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.400]   That was fun.
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.400]   >> I saw that.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.000]   I actually think they posted that online right.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.480]   Didn't that leak out somewhere?
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:59.240]   >> Yeah they posted some of it but they did some other stuff that just was shown internally.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:03.480]   >> So if I go search YouTube for Bill Gates I'm not going to find it.
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.960]   >> Probably not.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:09.960]   >> I'm not sure.
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.040]   They usually don't share those because they only pay the actor for small group sharing
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.960]   and not internet sharing.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.400]   >> Well wait a minute here's a five minute.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.960]   >> You got a fair number of fees for that.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:20.840]   >> Here's a five and a half minute clip Bill Gates goes to college with, how long was
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:21.840]   the original clip?
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.200]   >> Yeah that was about it.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.440]   >> I think it's all, oh here's Bill.
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.440]   He's got a vote for Pedro T-shirt on.
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.440]   [laughs]
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:34.680]   Well I'm sure he'll be off YouTube by the time it looks like somebody had a camcorder in
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.600]   the conference because I could see people's heads.
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:40.520]   So this is one of those pirate videos that you would buy on the street corner in Tai
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.520]   Pei.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.520]   But that looks good.
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:43.520]   That's pretty funny.
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:44.520]   I want to watch that after the show.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.800]   >> Well here's an interesting story that came up in the news to change the topic a little
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.800]   bit.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:52.680]   There's AMD subpoenaed Microsoft in the antitrust case against Intel.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.720]   I thought was personally thought was quite amusing.
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:56.720]   >> The irony.
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.160]   >> Well no the reason I thought was funny is because Microsoft's always kind of been in
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.640]   bed.
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.600]   This has got to come out in the court.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.240]   But Microsoft's always been in bed with AMD.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:11.720]   >> You've said this before that Gates owned AMD stock and Microsoft preferred AMD to Intel.
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.720]   >> And remember they had that one product that one, there was some Windows only thing
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.360]   that AMD was making for them.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.440]   I forgot what I can't remember this was some years ago.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.440]   >> Yeah I remember that.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:26.960]   >> So this is, so you know, so you know, so you could ask a lot of fun by loading up your
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:32.240]   email with all kinds of negative stuff on the other company and you know who's going
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:36.040]   to be able to disclose that it's like hey wait a minute we never even had this meeting.
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.400]   >> I think people don't realize what you just said is true.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:43.960]   I think people assume that it's Windell, it's Windows, Microsoft and Intel are in bed together.
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.720]   >> I think it's because it's been so long.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:47.960]   It's people you know.
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:52.720]   >> Well everybody in the Valley knows for a fact that Microsoft and Intel have not gotten
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.800]   along for the longest time.
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:00.400]   >> But I think we should start off with Kevin Rose because you were in the news this week.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.080]   >> Oh it was all over the place.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.080]   >> It was all about dig.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.080]   >> That's right.
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.680]   >> So lots of digs being taken at dig.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:15.280]   People complaining about lack of transparency and how stories make it to the front page.
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:19.440]   People are alleging that you know you're doing stuff.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.840]   Where did it start with CNET?
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:21.840]   Who was it the first?
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:29.560]   >> Well it started with a blog that posted an entry about a spammer that had been posting
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.560]   stories to dig.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.560]   >> This is forever.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.560]   >> Forever geek.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.040]   >> Right, forever geek.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.880]   And there was two stories that made it on the homepage from a website called the List
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.040]   Apart which is an amazing website.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:45.920]   Both of those stories I dug and I was the 17th digger on both stories.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:49.640]   So they thought because of the order in which all of the digs were happening that I was
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:54.920]   a part of this like ring or bot that was actually digging these stories.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.440]   >> People are so conspiracy oriented.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.320]   >> Well it's kind of I can see where they're coming from though because if you look at the
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:05.440]   actual history because if you go into dig and you go into any story and then you go down
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:09.720]   to the very bottom is it lists all the diggers and what order that they were dug in.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:13.440]   You can see that this person was clearly using a bot to dig all the stories because it would
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.320]   wrap a dig at 16 different accounts.
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.280]   >> This is a spammer that you're talking about.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:23.120]   >> Oh this is a very very common way that we see happen all the time on dig.
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.840]   >> They're trying to game dig by using a bot.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:29.800]   Like the biggest the number one thing that we have to do at dig right now is fight spam
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:30.800]   on a daily basis.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.080]   >> And constantly, constantly fighting spam.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:38.880]   >> The reason is if you get dig on dig, if you rise up on dig people you go out clicks.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.720]   >> Yeah it's a ton of traffic.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.160]   So it's like instant traffic to your website.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:48.400]   But what the person really didn't point out is that this person was also listed as one
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.400]   of my friends.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:53.720]   Actually three of their accounts were listed as my friends because I track a bunch of different
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:54.960]   people on dig.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:26:00.160]   I have about 40 different people that I track through the friends feature that's built into
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.160]   the side.
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.840]   >> And you're tracking them though not because he's a friend may not be the best name.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:05.840]   >> Right.
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.080]   >> Because you're tracking them because you're tracking them like their stories and they
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.120]   submit good stuff.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.880]   So spamming is kind of evolved on the site.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:17.360]   So basically there's several different ways that people can spam the site.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.280]   There's the people that will sign up for a mass account.
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.760]   So they'll come in, they'll create 50 different accounts.
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:27.720]   And their main goal is to all dig the same story and get their blog or their website
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.680]   or their story on the front page.
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:35.800]   So that doesn't work because we've kind of put in a karma system behind the scenes.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:40.120]   This was a long time ago, like a year and a half, right about a year ago we added a karma
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.120]   system behind the scenes.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:44.360]   It kind of takes a look, kind of creates a baseline of all the different digging activity
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.960]   that's done on the site.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:51.400]   And then we can very easily tell when someone is a spammer or just creating fake accounts
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:56.760]   or is all behind the same IP is behind one of the many, many anonymous proxies that are
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:03.280]   out there or we'll see the same URL that's getting reported by users submitted over and
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.440]   over again.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.280]   So that's the old way of spamming the site.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:11.160]   Now the new way that we've seen in the last probably, I don't know, 60, 90 days is when
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:18.040]   you have people that are submitting quality content to create these fake accounts that
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.960]   appear to be real.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:20.960]   >> Right.
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:27.280]   >> So you'll see sites that will, or spammers that will create and submit, a couple dozen
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.320]   stories that are actually quality stories.
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.440]   Some will make the home page, some won't.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.440]   And then they'll somehow get in there with their own unique URL and try and promote it
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.440]   that way.
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.440]   >> Well that makes sense.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.440]   So then it doesn't look like it's the same guy over and over.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.440]   >> Right.
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.680]   And it's very hard for our systems to detect that kind of stuff because obviously if they're
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:48.440]   using unique IPs, if they're not behind proxies that we can detect, it's hard to really
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:55.480]   kind of put, it's hard to detect when users are kind of digging together.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:04.320]   >> Is it the same people who are doing the Fenteremin blog spam or who are these spammers?
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.360]   >> People that want to, I mean it's all different kinds of sites.
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:14.800]   We ban dozens of URLs per day, dozens of accounts and these just happen to be a couple of really
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:18.680]   good submitters that I had added to my friends list here probably several weeks ago and I
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.720]   was digging their stories because there were submitting stories from Wired, there were submitting
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:25.560]   stories from just a variety of different really good high quality sites.
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:30.160]   I was digging their stories and listed as number 19 on that day.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.200]   >> And then they spam you.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:36.080]   Big story of course, I guess, I mean it was kind of a slow week this week.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:39.080]   If this is the biggest story then that really proves it.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.400]   Nintendo and the Wii.
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:47.160]   >> Actually, I thought I put an article in the show notes that I thought was kind of
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:53.480]   right on saying that this is really just bogus attempt to get some publicity as we approach
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:54.720]   E3 and they're really.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.040]   >> Bogus attempt by Nintendo?
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.040]   >> Yeah, it's just.
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.240]   >> Bogus attempt, how can it be bogus?
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.760]   We're giving them publicity now.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:00.760]   >> It worked.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.200]   You're right, it's not bogus but so what I guess.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.120]   There's no really, there's nothing new to say except that they've changed the name from
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.680]   Revolution to Wii.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:12.800]   >> Well, I think the main problem aside from the fact that I'll even agree that Wii is
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:18.880]   kind of a stupid name is that they have a significant amount of branding that's vested
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:19.880]   in Revolution.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:24.080]   Everyone is familiar with Nintendo Revolution and everyone seemed to like it.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:29.800]   So basically I think a lot of people have said about is that why throw Nintendo Revolution
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.320]   away?
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.320]   >> Wii is friendlier.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.320]   >> Wii.
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:37.120]   >> The more friendly name than Xbox, it's more friendly name than PlayStation.
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.840]   And since it is in fact a kid's.
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.000]   >> Well, look what happened with Windows Me.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   >> Me and Wii.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   Oh, it could go down.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.600]   It could be like the Coke classic of technology, me and Wii.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:52.000]   >> Well, I think Nintendo stands by the merits of their system as a gaming machine and not
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   a home media center.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.840]   >> Aaron McKenna writing in Tom's hardware said that Wii is not even pronounceable in
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.120]   Japanese.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:05.000]   The Japanese can't even say it, although they like it in France because it means yes in
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.800]   France, right?
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:07.800]   >> Wii.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:08.800]   >> Wii.
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:09.800]   Say Wii.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:13.520]   But he also points out there's nothing really to say about it and it's just attempting.
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:17.320]   I mean, look, I guess E3, what E3 is, main ninth.
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:22.080]   Microsoft's going to try to get attention by announcing a Blu-ray for the Xbox 360, but
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.080]   all eyes are really.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.080]   >> HDV.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.080]   >> Oh, it's HDV, not Blu-ray.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.080]   >> Oh, no.
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.080]   >> Now Microsoft.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.080]   >> Oh, that's right.
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.920]   Well, I can't follow it all.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:30.920]   Sony is Blu-ray.
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.680]   Microsoft is HD DVD.
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:36.760]   Although a lot of computer manufacturers like Blu-ray because it stores more on the disc,
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.480]   I mean, it's a better data format, right?
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.840]   >> Supposedly.
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:46.560]   >> So of the panel here, is anybody else going to E3 besides Will?
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.560]   Nope.
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.560]   >> That's how excited it goes.
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.560]   >> I was going to go.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:54.280]   I got a funny phone call from Al Lowe last week.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:56.000]   The guy who did leisure is Larry.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   >> He said Larry, Al Lowe?
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.600]   And he said, can you be my guest at E3?
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.560]   And I said, wow, yes, but then I just have so much to do.
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:06.440]   >> So I guess the big hubbub is that all the booth babes are gone.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.040]   >> Yeah, that's the main reason I'm not going to go.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.600]   >> I'm kind of cleaning it up.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.600]   >> They're cleaning the whole thing up.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.400]   >> Do they still have the taiko drummers though?
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.840]   I mean, because that's really what drove me.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.960]   >> I was invited to a thing that Viya is doing.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:23.160]   You'll probably go to this, Will, and featuring the girls of destruction, but I have no idea.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:27.320]   >> So that's a really interesting thing because we actually went, the girls of the
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.120]   destruction is like a girl gaming clan, right?
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.120]   >> Oh, all right.
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.120]   So they're not booth babes.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:36.760]   They're actually gamers and they've got a house in Sweden of all places.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:40.600]   And they've basically got a training house for this girl gaming clan.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.360]   And we went out there to see it.
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:45.120]   >> Are they Swedish?
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.120]   Are they Swedish?
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.120]   Why are they in Sweden?
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:50.320]   >> Well, I think it's because Sweden has really chunky broadband.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.760]   You can get 100 megs there just for nothing.
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.760]   >> So they went there for the broadband.
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.400]   >> And so they flew in.
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.600]   They've got a girl from England, a couple of girls from California.
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.040]   A girl from Japan or somewhere.
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:09.280]   And they've put them all in a house to train together and to hone their elite skills, I
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:10.440]   guess.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:13.720]   And then they're flying them off to different tournaments and stuff around the world.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.720]   >> Great.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.640]   >> Maybe it's just me, but I think if you got a bunch of girls together to live in a
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.640]   house to play video games.
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.440]   >> You wouldn't be video gaming, would you?
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:24.120]   >> Well, I'm just thinking it probably looks just like a frat house.
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.120]   They're probably no different than a bunch of guys.
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:29.920]   They probably sit around in their box or shorts, drink and beer, playing games, right?
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:30.920]   >> No, that's about right.
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:31.920]   >> I wouldn't think I mean.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:34.920]   >> Why wouldn't they be there?
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:35.920]   >> So they're --
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.920]   >> Why do you think like Chardonnay is being served?
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:38.920]   Come on.
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:39.920]   >> Yeah.
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:40.920]   >> I'll try to frat something.
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:41.920]   >> I could tell you that right now.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.920]   So Vi, I guess what has hired them or is sponsoring them as --
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:45.920]   >> Yeah, so we're sponsoring them.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.920]   I mean, they're all pretty good gamers.
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:50.560]   They want some stuff at QuakeCon last year.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.880]   And it's like a promotional thing.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:57.560]   Vi, I guess their name is associated with these cool gamers.
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:58.760]   >> Thoughts on E3.
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.720]   What was the big story, E3, Jen?
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:04.840]   >> I think far and away from me and a lot of others was definitely the Nintendo Wii,
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:09.120]   just finally getting to play it and see it in action and wave around the controller.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.120]   >> Really?
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.600]   The Wii stole thunder from the Xbox 360.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.560]   I guess there wasn't much to say about the Xbox 360.
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.160]   It's been out for almost a year.
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.760]   And PlayStation 3, which is kind of a surprise.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.320]   How do you agree?
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.200]   Does the Wii get you excited?
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.760]   >> We went in as the underdog and came out as the winner.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:28.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:29.760]   Kind of a surprise.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:30.760]   What made the Wii -- >> Yeah, roughly story.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:31.760]   >> What -- yeah, it is.
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:36.240]   What made the Wii so interesting to the attendees now?
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:42.560]   >> Well, I think the controller, I think the integration of the software with the machine,
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.000]   just the general buzz about the whole thing.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.880]   Everyone that I talked with said that was the big story.
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.880]   >> Isn't that funny?
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:55.480]   I wouldn't -- if you'd asked me a year ago, is Nintendo out of the game?
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.240]   In fact, I think I might even have said this.
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:02.320]   You know, it's now between Microsoft and PlayState and Sony, and nobody cares about Nintendo
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.320]   anymore.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:04.320]   I did say it.
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:05.800]   And a number of people said, "Oh, wait a minute.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.640]   The DS is a great product."
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:11.400]   Jen, did you ever count Nintendo out or was I just misguided?
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:16.240]   >> Well, I am one of the people I started playing games on television and then NES.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:20.240]   So I do have a soft spot for Nintendo, but the DS have been going strong since pretty
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:24.440]   much day one, and the Wii is kind of capturing that same market, that market of people who
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.880]   don't really play video games.
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.240]   >> I have a major confession to make.
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:32.920]   I didn't go to New York to buy it, but the minute I -- I guess it was Monday morning,
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:33.920]   or was it Tuesday?
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:34.920]   It was Tuesday morning.
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:39.920]   Without a fanfare, without a, you know, no Steve Jobs speech, no mystery invitation to
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:44.000]   the press, Apple just kind of put it up on their website, the new Macbrook.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:50.320]   And I admit, not only did I buy one, but I paid the $150 premium to get it in black.
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.320]   >> And how'd you like it?
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.320]   Am I a sucker?
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:35:02.040]   >> This is -- Leo, you are the most unbelievable example of it, like beyond early adopter.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.880]   Anything that happens, I mean, we can go on with some of these things we've done like
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.240]   Vintrilio and some of these other things.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.120]   It's amazing that you jump on anything.
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:12.560]   >> I have no impulse control.
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:15.680]   >> I have a funny -- one of the funniest posts I've ever done right now, it's online.
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:16.680]   It's a cat.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:22.560]   Has anyone seen this thing, by the way, it's like some jokers put a cat toy on an overhead
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:25.600]   fan and his cat's reaching for it and then he gets caught in it.
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:26.600]   >> Oh, my goodness.
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.600]   >> Come on.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.600]   >> Well, it's not bad.
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:30.600]   He catches goes around and around and gets thrown against the wall.
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:31.600]   It's quite human.
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:32.600]   >> Is it a video or an animation?
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.600]   >> It's a video.
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:34.600]   It's a video.
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:35.600]   It's very real.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:36.600]   >> Oh.
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:41.240]   >> Actually, somebody's put together like a 25-minute collection of viral videos of cats doing weird
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.240]   things.
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.240]   >> Cats doing weird things.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.240]   >> Yeah, that's definitely worth checking.
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.240]   >> You call it UCAT.com.
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.240]   >> Yeah.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:47.240]   Remember the CAT scans?
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.240]   Remember that?
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.040]   They had scans of cats.
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:53.920]   They would upload their kitty on a scanner and they would scan it.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:55.720]   >> Yeah, cat people plus that people.
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:56.720]   >> I don't remember that.
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:57.720]   >> Bad combination.
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:58.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:35:59.720]   >> Let's talk about the first story, the big story.
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.480]   There really is only one story this week.
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:03.040]   Bill Gates stepping down at Microsoft.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:05.960]   He says in two years he's not going to be in charge of Marshall State Chairman of the
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:11.160]   Board, but he's already handed Ray Aussie the keys to the car saying you're now the chief
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.000]   software architect.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.560]   Good news, bad news.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.560]   The market said...
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:17.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:21.080]   >> The market's holding its breath on VISTAs release, I think more than anything else.
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:25.920]   >> Well, and Microsoft lost something like 25% in April, so it was our...
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:26.920]   >> Right.
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:27.920]   >> It's already depressed stock to begin with.
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:28.920]   >> I think judging from...
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:34.840]   I looked up the stock price earlier and judging from aftermarket and today, it's after hours
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:36.480]   trading and today it's like dead even.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.480]   >> Yeah.
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:38.480]   >> Like no change.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.480]   >> Which is probably what all the pundits say.
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.920]   I mean, it could be good.
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.400]   It could be bad.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.400]   >> Let's talk about Blu-ray.
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.400]   Because we've got...
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.400]   We're still way our Blu-ray box is supposed to show up Friday, so hopefully it'll be in
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.400]   Monday.
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.880]   >> First Blu-ray players are now shipping.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:55.320]   >> From Samsung, Sony's are delayed another month or three months or six months or they're
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:58.080]   going to drop it to push PS3 sales.
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.080]   But we've actually...
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:03.600]   We've had one of the desktop VIOs and a notebook VIO in-house.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:08.400]   And I got to tell you, the Blu-ray software that they ship with the VIOs really needs
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.760]   some more time in the oven.
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:10.760]   >> Uh-oh, what's wrong?
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:11.760]   What goes wrong?
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:12.760]   >> It doesn't work.
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:13.920]   >> Yeah, but one of the...
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:17.320]   We're still waiting for Sony to get back to us to explain why the stuff on VISTAs is
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.200]   on the desktop doesn't work.
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.200]   >> You would think that if they...
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:23.720]   >> And they're playing architecture issues on the notebooks for its occasional slowdowns
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:24.720]   while playing VIO.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:25.720]   >> Hey, Patrick.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:30.280]   >> Can you ask Sony a question when you're going through the discussion on this thing?
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:37.400]   I'd like to know exactly how their primary competitor in consumer electronics, Samsung,
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:42.120]   manages to roll out what's essentially Sony's product before Sony.
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:50.520]   And we have, I think, this fascinating explanation of net neutrality from Senator Stevens.
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:54.720]   >> What the Senators are talking about is allowing all of these entities that support
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:38:01.480]   this to provide streaming stuff going on to the internet.
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:04.240]   Now, the internet, let's go back.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:11.120]   That started with a concept of local to local connections across the country.
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:16.360]   And you could go for air Alaska, but you had to go through local connections to get their
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:19.120]   industry wisely provided for streaming.
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:22.800]   In fact, a new kind of long distance.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.120]   And that's what we've got.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:27.880]   We've got a service that's immune to distance.
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:30.240]   And it's there for the consumer.
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:42.120]   But when we take and really indicate that anyone that wants to use this system for massive,
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:46.800]   massive commercial purposes, there's one company now.
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:55.600]   You can sign up and you've got a movie delivered to your house daily by subscription service,
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.320]   by delivery service, okay?
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:03.460]   And currently it comes to your house, you put in a mailbox, you get home, and in your
[00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:05.840]   monthly you change your order.
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:07.920]   But you pay for that, right?
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:10.400]   This service is now going to go through the internet.
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:15.720]   And what you do is you just go to a place on the internet and you order your movie.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:16.720]   And guess what?
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:21.360]   You can order 10 of them and the delivery charge is free, right?
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:25.280]   10 movies streaming across that internet.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:28.240]   And what happens to your own personal internet?
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:32.480]   I just the other day got internet was sent by my staff at 10 o'clock in the morning
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.480]   Friday.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.280]   I got it yesterday.
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.280]   Why?
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:40.640]   Because you got tangled up with all these things that are going on the internet commercially.
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:46.040]   And here we have this one situation where enormous entities want to use the internet
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:49.920]   for their purpose to save money for doing what they're doing now.
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:50.920]   They use FedEx.
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.120]   They use the delivery services.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.080]   They use the mail.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:59.920]   They deliver in other ways, but they want to deliver vast amounts of information over
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:00.920]   the internet.
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:05.000]   And again, the internet is not something that you just dump something on.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.320]   It's not a big truck.
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.080]   It's a series of tubes.
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:11.640]   And if you don't understand those tubes can be filled.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:15.520]   And if they're filled, when you put your message in, it gets in line, it's going to
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:19.720]   be delayed by anyone that puts into that tube and enormous amounts of material.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:23.280]   It reminds me of that old April Fool's Gag.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:27.760]   It said years ago, right, you said these guys were trying to pass a law saying you can't
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:31.680]   be drunk when you're using a modem.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:35.840]   Lawsuits fly over Google founders big private jet.
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:40.360]   I didn't realize that they had bought a 767.
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:44.280]   This is a jet that normally carries 180 passengers.
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:48.000]   It's three times as heavy as the conventional executive jet.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.560]   Sergey Brin and Larry Page bought this.
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:56.880]   He was a used one from the Qantas fleet and they're converting it to hold 50 passengers,
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:03.960]   including, by the way, a special executive suite for the president of Google, Eric Schmidt,
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:10.320]   a lounge in the front with two adjoining state rooms for the co-founders farther aft.
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:13.680]   There's a plan, if you want to look at it in the Wall Street Journal of the jet, this
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:16.200]   thing is this thing is talk about excess.
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.960]   So what are the lawsuits for?
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:23.800]   Well, the company that they hired to do the blue city holdings is the company that owns
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:30.360]   it and the company that they hired to do the redesign, Leslie Jennings, a high-end aviation
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.360]   designer.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.560]   Apparently, it's not going well in the transformation.
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.000]   This is the guy who did Paul Allen's jet.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.600]   He also does the queen's jet.
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:43.160]   Paul Allen's got a 757 though, right?
[00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:44.920]   Is that bigger than a 767?
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.440]   No, no, a 767 is big.
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:47.840]   That's pretty big.
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.360]   Yes, it's generally an over-to-use plane.
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:55.040]   So, it's just to be a plane that these guys could, it's a little more practical, I think.
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:58.600]   I don't want to defend the fact that these guys are throwing money at stuff like this,
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.840]   but it's a little more practical of plane.
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:05.440]   If you can afford it, then these private, little private jets that don't really make,
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:10.160]   you can make a trip from San Francisco to Paris on a 767 nonstop.
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.800]   You can't really do it with too many other planes.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:12.800]   That's a good point.
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:20.000]   Dateline Hanoi, more than 20 desperate students in Vietnam, paid up to 50 million dong.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.200]   I didn't know that was their unit of currency, it is.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:29.560]   It's about $3,000 to don elaborately wired wigs and shirts that allowed them to cheat
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:31.680]   on their college entrance exams.
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:36.360]   That's a good idea.
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:41.520]   During a week, I'm sure you've blogged this already, John.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:43.920]   During a weekend, you get to it.
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:44.920]   You get to it.
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:45.920]   You slow.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:50.480]   During a weekend, Ray Hanoi Police confiscated 50 mobile phones, 60 earphones, 150 SIM cards,
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:54.720]   8 shirts and 5 wigs.
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:43:02.400]   I guess the idea was that they were going to phone in the answers.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:06.040]   The reason they wore the wigs because their hair was too short to cover the earphone and
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:07.920]   then they would wire up the shirts.
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:10.160]   It's pretty competitive in Hanoi.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:14.160]   It says only 10% of the students who take the exams get in to the universities.
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:19.720]   So really the big story of the week, and it's still at the rumor stage, although I think
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:27.720]   it's less of a rumor than just a matter of time, AMD, a friendly takeover of ATI for
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:31.040]   five and a half billion dollars.
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:33.000]   A billion.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:40.720]   An interesting merger because, of course, you've got the NVIDIA ATI battle and then the Intel
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:44.760]   AMD battle and the C AMD take on a partner here.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:48.200]   Now, I want to say right up front, Kevin, that we're going to say right up front, you
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.080]   are not speaking for NVIDIA in any way.
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:52.680]   You're not here as a representative of NVIDIA in any way.
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:53.680]   That's correct.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.760]   I want you to feel able to speak freely.
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.040]   And so I'm not asking NVIDIA this.
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:59.360]   I'm asking you.
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:00.360]   It is a rumor.
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:02.480]   It seems pretty credible, yes.
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:04.960]   It's a rumor that's been around for a few weeks now.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:07.200]   It actually goes back to just before Computex.
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:10.720]   And it's a rumor that just doesn't seem to want to die.
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:14.800]   So it's spread quite widely on Friday.
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:19.600]   And at this point in time, it's looking fairly realistic.
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:26.080]   I mean, it's something that you would expect AMD and ATI would have denied heavily if there
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:27.520]   wasn't actually something ongoing.
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:31.840]   Apparently, somebody in the boardroom at AMD leaked the fact that the vote occurred on
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.600]   Friday.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:36.360]   The fact is that the stock market believes it.
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:42.560]   AMD declining ATI going up considerably.
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:47.720]   And all the other tech companies were going down on Friday except ATI.
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:49.400]   What's the advantage of?
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:50.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:52.240]   What was AMD get out of buying ATI?
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:56.280]   Well, actually, short term, there's a couple of things.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:45:02.840]   One, they get to zing Intel because Intel invested heavily in ATI and CrossFire for the
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:03.840]   launch of Conro.
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:07.200]   So there's a little bit of a zing to Intel.
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.200]   That's by far not important.
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:11.560]   That's a transient type of thing.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:15.440]   The most important thing is AMD now can say they have a full complete solution.
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:19.040]   They have chipsets that work with their processors.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:23.520]   And they've always felt a little bit disadvantaged to some extent that Intel had their own chipsets
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:26.840]   and AMD did not, lying on third parties.
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:35.320]   Now, that said, AMD's partners ourselves, NVIDIA and ATI, as well as via server works,
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:39.280]   have been doing a pretty good job supporting AMD over these years.
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:44.680]   Yeah, I mean, NVIDIA makes a great AMD chip set, the M4's chip set.
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:45.680]   Well, thank you.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.520]   Well, no, but I mean, like literally, that brings me back to you.
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:49.520]   What do I have?
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:53.880]   I'm not sure I see the corporate synergy that justifies a leveraging of assets.
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:55.840]   Well, you're not allowed to stock market, didn't you?
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:58.400]   They thought they even stock tanked.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:01.360]   When it is, it's actually a long-term bet.
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:04.800]   Partly, it's all the fab capacity AMD is putting in place.
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:08.280]   So now, ATI would get access to that directly.
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:15.200]   And even though ATI could always sign an agreement to access the fab as a, you know,
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:21.840]   as a foundry type deal, having an ATI design group, part of AMD would make it easier.
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:28.280]   The real long-term issue is about four years from now, two more process generations.
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:31.400]   We're going to go from multi-core to many core.
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:36.680]   You know, there will be, there will be going from two to four next year and then eight.
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:40.880]   And eventually, what you have is Moore's law keeps giving you more and more transistors
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:41.880]   to play with.
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:45.160]   And what do you do with those transistors on the silicon?
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:50.280]   Somewhere along the way, you really seriously consider adding the GPU function onto the
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:52.280]   same silicon with the CPU.
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:59.560]   Much like back in the, the 46 days, we added the math code processor onto the same silicon
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:01.060]   with the CPU.
[00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:05.960]   So Kevin, this is essentially, you're releasing the earliest long-distance rumor about the
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:07.800]   acquisition of NVIDIA by Intel.
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:08.800]   I was going to say that.
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:12.880]   Yeah, there's always, there's traditionally some tension between Intel and NVIDIA, because
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:15.240]   NVIDIA makes a chipset competing with Intel's chipset.
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:16.240]   They make up.
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:18.680]   Not as much as it's going to be after the buyout attempt.
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:24.600]   Okay, so the mainstream media, you know, or you hope you know that that's going on, but
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:30.920]   who's watching over user-created content like podcasts and blogs and how do you know whether
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:32.000]   to trust them or not?
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   The blog is fair.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.360]   It's, it's a self-correcting mechanism.
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:36.840]   That's what makes it so powerful.
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:37.840]   People will know.
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.840]   You think people can tell?
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:41.720]   You can do it this way.
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:49.120]   You can say, yes, indeed, people are paying me to write about their products, but their
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:55.880]   products I use, products I endorse, products I would not endorse if I did not believe I
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:57.760]   can recommend them to you.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:01.640]   Now that, at that point, it's a matter of how credible are you?
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:03.320]   Well, we're faced with that on Twitter.
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:07.040]   I mean, we have some advertisers, both, both advertisers I use.
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:12.600]   We have two more coming, both of which I use.
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:16.520]   And we also make it very clear that now comes the ad.
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:20.480]   And I think we also make it very clear that our coverage, and I think if you listen, our
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:25.000]   coverage is not biased toward, or, you know, in fact, in some ways it's somewhat biased
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.880]   against, I shouldn't say this, but the advertiser, we're certainly bent over backwards not to
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:32.040]   look like we're in their pockets.
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:34.480]   Well, but Leo, that's a real problem.
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:39.560]   What happens more than once in people who think they're trying to be fair, they end up being
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:42.240]   unfair to the people who are supporting them?
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:43.880]   And that's not right either.
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:47.400]   We certainly, you know, AOL has been very good providing bandwidth for this podcast from
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:49.160]   day one, and they provide a lot of bandwidth.
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:57.280]   In fact, I just found out a podcast, a Twit 55, which emerged at the same time as a big
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:03.240]   ad campaign on Morpheus Fortuit had 700,000 downloads in about three or four weeks.
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:04.240]   Wow.
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:05.240]   So, seven hundred four thousand.
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:06.800]   Are people paying for those?
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:07.800]   No.
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.080]   Well, that's the thing AOL gives us the bandwidth.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:12.440]   If I were paying for the bandwidth, this network wouldn't exist.
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:19.440]   So AOL is a sponsor in kind, and I have to admit, if there's a negative story about AOL,
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:22.400]   I'm disinclined to ignore it.
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:27.040]   I certainly don't want to look like we're ignoring the negative stories.
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:28.200]   But you're right, Jerry.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:30.880]   That would be biased in the opposite direction.
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:37.880]   bandwidth for this weekend tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com/podcasting.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:52.400]   This is Twit, this weekend tech, episode 65 for August 6th, 2006, the $60 million
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:50:05.840]   tech.
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:08.440]   All right, let's get started.
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:13.160]   Then we've got a great panel, and I'd like to introduce everybody via cell phone because
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:15.840]   he can't get grounded from Los Angeles.
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:18.520]   He's back in the States, ladies and gentlemen, Corey, Dr. Row.
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:19.520]   Howdy.
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:22.120]   It's great to have you back on Twit.
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:26.760]   And we'll talk a little bit about what you're up to because you're no longer the European
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:28.400]   Affairs Coordinator for the EFF.
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.080]   You're in LA now.
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:33.600]   What could that mean?
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:36.600]   We also have Will Harris from Britain, who very kindly stepped out of the way for Jerry
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:37.600]   Parnell last week.
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:39.440]   So we owe him one.
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:40.440]   Hey Will.
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:41.440]   Hello, how's it going?
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:42.440]   Bit-tech.net.
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:44.640]   And you were up late last time.
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:46.840]   I think it was what two in the morning when we bumped you.
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:48.120]   Yeah, something like that.
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:51.040]   I apologize.
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:55.280]   Also with us, the poster boy for Web 2.0, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:56.280]   Oh, no.
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:59.720]   We're just proud of you, Kevin.
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:05.200]   Although the picture on the front of Business Week was in exactly the best picture of you.
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:06.520]   I have a story about that.
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:08.360]   We can talk about that, right?
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:13.520]   And then, of course, to anchor this whole mess, John C. Devorak, who only got one plug-in
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:14.520]   last week.
[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:17.360]   I only need one plug, Devorak.org/blog-am-in-business.
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:19.360]   Is it that good?
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:20.960]   Does it work that well, really?
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:24.000]   Well, it's actually diminishing returns.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:29.160]   If I probably-- at some point, I noticed that I got a bunch of-- I got a run-up and then
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:30.880]   it's pretty much nothing now.
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:31.880]   Nothing.
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:32.880]   You get nothing, huh?
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:33.880]   You get nothing.
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:36.760]   So you just appear out of the goodness of your own hire?
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.520]   Well, I thank you very much.
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:42.480]   You did blog this week about Kevin's cover.
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:44.440]   We might as well just start off with that.
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:47.040]   First of all, Kevin, embarrassed or not.
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:48.040]   I think it's wonderful.
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:50.120]   You're getting a lot of recognition from Business Week.
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:53.800]   It was kind of the counting in the article was a little strange as they pointed out in
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:56.240]   the article, your dig is breaking even.
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:52:00.480]   But on the front page, they say, this kid made $60 million in 18 months.
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:02.680]   Actually, a dig isn't even breaking even.
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:04.400]   So they got that wrong.
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:07.440]   Hey, Kevin, you're taking us out to dinner tonight with all that money?
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:08.440]   60 million.
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:11.360]   I have no-- there's no-- I'm not a multi-millionaire.
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:13.520]   I'm not even a millionaire or a thousandaire.
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:16.320]   I don't know how they came up with that cover.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:20.880]   But I guess it was just based on-- they put a value to the company.
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:21.880]   And then they had 80%--
[00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:22.880]   200 million.
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:23.880]   And you have 80%--
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:24.880]   They estimated how much.
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:25.880]   Yeah.
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:26.880]   It's all estimates.
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:27.880]   And obviously, it's just paper fake money.
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:30.000]   Hey, I thought, Leo, you kind of liked that piece.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.720]   I thought the article read like a slip shot hit piece.
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:34.720]   Really?
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:35.720]   I think it was a hit piece.
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:36.720]   I would seem like it to me.
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:37.720]   It was snide.
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:38.920]   You call them a kid.
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:42.560]   I mean, the guy-- you know, Kevin's 30 or close to it.
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:46.280]   And I mean, if you look on the picture, he's got a six o'clock shadow for God's sake.
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:49.320]   I mean, it doesn't even look like he's young in that thing except for the crazy outfit.
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:50.320]   And they call him--
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:53.520]   And then they had all these Tom Cruise's doe-er little brother and--
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:54.960]   Yeah, and they were snide stuff.
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:58.800]   Yeah, and they had about the tech TV loser, you know, kind of a loser on tech TV, you know,
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:02.160]   with unknown-- I mean, the whole thing just rang.
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:03.160]   It was--
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:04.160]   You know what?
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.160]   You're right.
[00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:06.160]   I'm mad as hell now.
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.160]   I'm mad.
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:08.160]   Dang it.
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:12.600]   Before we do anything, I think we should commemorate, as we have done in the last few
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:15.400]   tweets in anniversary.
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:19.960]   So remember we talked about the 15th anniversary of the inner narrow, the worldwide web, 10th
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:25.520]   anniversary of Flash, August 1981.
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:29.680]   Twenty-five years ago, something important happened in technology.
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:30.680]   Oh.
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:32.080]   Have anything to do with IBM?
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:33.080]   It might have the first--
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:34.080]   There we go.
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:37.720]   --I mean, we see the 5150.
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:40.720]   It cost $1,565.
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:44.840]   But that's because it didn't come with any drives.
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:49.200]   It came with 16K of memory and a cassette port.
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:50.200]   Woo-hoo.
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:52.200]   Wow, it's right.
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:53.880]   Yeah, I remember the cassette port.
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:57.680]   You know, I just wanted to-- does anyone remember that used the Kansas City standard or not?
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:00.960]   What are you talking about, Kansas City standard?
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:01.960]   Was that the--
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:02.960]   You remember that?
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:03.960]   Is that a cassette data standard?
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:04.960]   Yeah, Kansas City.
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:05.960]   John, do you still have your 50--
[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:07.560]   It was called the Kansas City standard.
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:09.440]   That was the upgrade to the old whatever.
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:10.800]   There were some original ones that came out.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:14.360]   And then the Kansas City standard were up the ante and it was like the high speed--
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:15.360]   Yeah.
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:16.360]   --it said--
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:19.560]   My Atari would make-- and I think the apples would make noises they read in the tapes.
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:21.600]   Did the IBM do that also?
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:22.600]   [BARKING]
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:28.520]   Well, you know, it was like you could-- the drive you want-- you could use any drive that
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:35.960]   had kind of-- you were looking for a monophonic drive, like a radio shack.
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:39.800]   And you would push the buttons manually and you'd load the data from this thing.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:44.360]   And it wasn't like a tape drive that was controlled by the computer necessarily.
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:45.360]   Right.
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:49.160]   It was like, you know, you had it going into this port and you pushed the button and it
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:52.320]   would load the data maybe.
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:53.320]   And--
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:55.240]   It was very reliable, I have to say.
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:56.520]   Yeah, you know, I disagree with that.
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:58.920]   I never had a problem with reliability of those things.
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:54:59.920]   Well, fortunately--
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:00.920]   Yeah, I thought they--
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:04.200]   At the right-- if you had the right cassette player, they were quite reliable.
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:08.600]   Fortunately, they came out with a floppy and a hard drive very soon after.
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:10.920]   I'm sure that cost them thousands of dollars at the time.
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:12.600]   Actually, the floppies were available immediately.
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:13.600]   Were they?
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:14.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:16.000]   These things were built like tanks.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.080]   I mean, literally, they were steel, sheet steel.
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:20.080]   Well, they're kind of--
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:21.080]   I had an 8088.
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:22.080]   Which one was this?
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:23.080]   The keynote--
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:24.080]   Yeah, this was an 8088.
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:25.080]   This was an 8088.
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:26.080]   Okay.
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:27.080]   It was 4.77 megahertz.
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:30.680]   Wasn't as cool as my Atari though.
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:31.680]   4.
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:34.160]   I mean, 25 years ago, this was 4.0.
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:38.600]   0.77, not gigahertz, megahertz.
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:41.680]   Yeah, well, that's pretty fast for those days.
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:46.320]   I mean, it fasted chips before that, where you're like a megahertz or something like that.
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:47.320]   Less than that.
[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:48.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:51.360]   The 6509 that ran in the Apple, I think, was 1.7 megahertz.
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:53.000]   That's what the Atari had.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   It was like 1.4.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.200]   It was really amazing, really.
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:59.080]   Anyway, I just thought we'd mention that.
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:01.720]   Ray Aussie said, last week, it's the end of the PC era.
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:02.720]   Here we are 25 years later.
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:04.120]   I don't know if I agree with it on that.
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:05.120]   What are you talking about?
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:06.880]   What's that supposed to mean?
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:09.600]   Should we talk about, what do we want to talk about?
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:12.080]   Any, you want to talk about Apple's announcements on the phone?
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:13.880]   No, actually, let me call one, Leo.
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:15.280]   Oh, and please.
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:20.480]   What is this about Microsoft shutting down MSN chat?
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:21.480]   What is it about that?
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:25.560]   Is it, are they afraid of, you know, it's not the first time Microsoft has shut down something.
[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:29.120]   Remember, they used to run those minute meeting servers and they turned out to be a hotbed
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:31.840]   for horny men and women.
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:33.920]   Could it be the same things going on here?
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:38.920]   Oh, you know, if it is, I mean, it's just like new.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:44.000]   This has been, this thing's been here for a decade and now all of a sudden they've discovered
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.960]   that like, you know, people are like flirting with each other in some odd way online.
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:49.680]   We are shocked to find out.
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:51.440]   There's some else going on here.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:52.440]   Why would they?
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:56.200]   Well, according, will they say that after October the 18th, it says, "MSN chat will no
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:57.200]   longer be offered.
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:59.480]   Please download Windows Live Messenger."
[00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:00.480]   That's really what's happening.
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:01.840]   They're moving to live.
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:03.440]   Everything's going live.
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:06.400]   Is MSN chat and Windows, they're the same thing.
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:07.680]   Have you used Live Messenger?
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:11.120]   It's just a relabeled MSN chat.
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:12.880]   They say MSN chat has...
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:17.760]   No, I think they're talking about shutting down MSN chat as in like the Yahoo chat kind
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:18.760]   of web page.
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:20.400]   Oh, the website chat, not MSN.
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:21.640]   Yeah, and then the net.
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:22.880]   Oh, oh, oh, I see.
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:24.880]   So it's just relabeling it.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:26.560]   I don't know.
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:27.560]   Nobody uses it.
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:28.560]   Does anybody use it?
[00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:30.640]   I mean, people use the messenger chat.
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:36.400]   Yeah, but this is, as Will has correctly pointed out, this is web-based chat.
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:37.400]   Who uses it?
[00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:38.400]   Well, I think that's the point, isn't it?
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:42.040]   Is that web-based chat used to be really the thing back in the day and everybody would
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:46.400]   hang up on Yahoo chat and you'd have all these gazillions of different rooms and stuff.
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:47.400]   But no, come on.
[00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:48.400]   You just got the right...
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:49.400]   No, but the a-l-l-dot-m.
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:51.400]   Do you even have...
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:52.400]   Everyone just uses I-am, actually.
[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:53.400]   I'm not buying it.
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:54.920]   I like MSN Live, actually.
[00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:57.320]   Have you played with Live at all?
[00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:58.320]   Not me.
[00:57:58.320 --> 00:57:59.880]   Robert, have you played with it?
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:00.880]   The Live website?
[00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:01.880]   Yeah, well, of course.
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:03.120]   That's where the chat's going to live.
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:06.200]   I think Microsoft's doing some really interesting things there.
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:07.200]   It's live.
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:09.440]   You're the only one who thinks that.
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:10.440]   Am I?
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:11.440]   I don't know.
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:13.080]   Does anybody else in the group think that?
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:17.520]   Actually, there is one thing that Microsoft is doing with Live and with Messaging that
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:23.040]   is really cool and that's linking Xbox users with Windows users and then they'll play against
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:24.480]   each other and chat with each other.
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:25.480]   I love that idea.
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:31.160]   To be on your PC and if you're in like I-am and you can see if one of your mates is playing
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:35.800]   an Xbox game and then you can just go and join in the game with them and that's pretty
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:36.800]   neat.
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:39.720]   But aside from that, it's a billion dollar idea.
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:42.120]   You want to see some cool things.
[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:46.880]   Microsoft's doing kind of the same thing that Google does with the research Google Labs.
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:49.280]   If you go to, I think it's labs.live.com.
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:52.720]   There's some really neat stuff that...
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:57.880]   Microsoft's got some smart people working there, right?
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:01.160]   So this is their kind of clever thing.
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:03.760]   Let's say a little background.
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:07.360]   WIPO is the World Intellectual Property Organization.
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:12.800]   You and Chartered, originally the idea was for the nations to get together and kind of
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:13.800]   make a...
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:14.800]   Which makes sense.
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:18.240]   A global policy for copyright and trade, market, and all of that because after all,
[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:19.800]   it's a global economy.
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:20.800]   Unfortunately...
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:21.800]   Actually, hang on.
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:24.520]   That's not why they were put together.
[00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:28.400]   They had been an industry association whose job it was to promote that.
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:31.600]   And what happened was they went to the UN and they said, "You know, knowledge goods,
[00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:35.920]   copyrights, and patents, and trademarks, they're really important to humanitarian efforts.
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:40.960]   What you need is a humanitarian agency to do humanitarian work in respect of knowledge
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:41.960]   goods."
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:46.000]   Then, of course, they got a UN charter and threw out any kind of notion of being humanitarian
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.920]   agency and just worked on making more and more exclusive rights for the corporate members
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:49.920]   that had started it.
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:53.640]   There's really a Trojan horse to get them UN charter.
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:55.040]   It's not clear when you're doing the commercial.
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:56.880]   I think when I start talking about Visa, that's pretty clear.
[00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:57.880]   It's a commercial.
[00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:02.080]   But I'm going to say now, this podcast brought to you by Visa.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:04.160]   And then now you know it's a commercial, right?
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.160]   Do you have a...
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:06.360]   Maybe you'd have a horn like...
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:09.840]   A web site to go to?
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.840]   I mean, Visa.
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:15.320]   Why does Visa have to advertise?
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:16.480]   Aren't they like this?
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.320]   That's a good question, but I'm not going to...
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:21.220]   No, I'm just saying because everybody knows who they are.
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:22.880]   No, everyone knows who they are.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:26.880]   It's like there's two cars, Visa Mastercard, and then there's...
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:27.880]   I guess...
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:28.880]   John, John...
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:29.880]   John, John...
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:30.880]   They need to advertise.
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.520]   It's so important for their image.
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:33.520]   You know what, they're trying to...
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:36.040]   Actually, they have the best image of all these products.
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:37.040]   I think they do have the most...
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:38.040]   Compared to what?
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:41.320]   They're indistinguishable from Mastercard and they're in a long running battle with American
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:42.320]   Express.
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.320]   Maybe that's what it is.
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:44.320]   It's a different style.
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:45.740]   American Express is a different game.
[01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:46.740]   I think so, too.
[01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:49.720]   You may think so, but a lot of the public may not know the difference.
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:54.060]   Well, I think also when you get a credit card, do you have a choice?
[01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:56.200]   Can you go to your bank and say, "Can I not have a Mastercard?"
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:57.200]   I'd prefer a Visa.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.240]   In some cases, they do have a lot of the one there.
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:02.360]   In other words, what Visa's doing by advertising is trying to...
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:06.320]   It's really advertising to banks to get them to use them and so the other guys.
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:07.320]   The reason they want...
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.880]   I'll tell you why they wanted to be on Twitch.
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:09.880]   They wanted...
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:10.880]   And that's the whole network, by the way.
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:16.660]   They wanted to tell people who understand security and who use their credit cards online
[01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:22.160]   that they're working to make sure that the fraud doesn't happen on Visa cards and they
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.320]   keep an eye on things and they actually do this.
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:29.000]   I've had this happen where if somebody uses your card out of context, you get a call
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.560]   and they say, "If you use your card out of context..."
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:32.760]   Well, I actually got that too.
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:35.440]   When I started using it in Canada, they called and said, "Do you go to Canada a lot?"
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.440]   And I said, "Yes."
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.440]   And they said, "Oh, great.
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.440]   We're just checking."
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.440]   I think that's good.
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:44.440]   And then I'm getting the award for a podcaster, a pod person of the year, I think.
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:48.620]   I was waiting for you to be talking about what you were going there for so I could introduce
[01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:50.180]   that fact and congratulate you.
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:52.380]   It makes you all swank and humble.
[01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:56.500]   You mean, if I hadn't tooted my own horn, you would have done it for me.
[01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.020]   I've been waiting for a chance since we started...
[01:01:58.020 --> 01:01:59.380]   You got my bag, baby.
[01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:00.380]   Thank you.
[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:01.580]   Is there a gift bag?
[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:02.580]   There is.
[01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:05.580]   I'm probably giving it away, but there's some nice stuff.
[01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:10.460]   Are they an out-of-the-hour-esque like the over at the Emmys?
[01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:11.940]   Not that kind of a gift bag.
[01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:15.280]   I don't have to worry about the Sopranos stealing my gift bag.
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:18.400]   No, I think I'm getting a Moran's 670 recorder.
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.280]   Like I don't have enough of those.
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:23.320]   A Paris-Soney headphones, something like that.
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:26.040]   But I think it's helping Don Blogger with it.
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.200]   I'll help a young blonde.
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.360]   I mean, Blogger, yes, I will, yes.
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:30.360]   No, I think it's a...
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:31.360]   I'm very honored.
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:32.360]   I think it's great.
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:37.120]   Doug K won the award last year, the first award and this is...
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.120]   I feel bad.
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:40.000]   I might give the money to Adam Curry, I think.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.920]   But anyway, that's nice.
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:42.920]   That's nice acknowledgement.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:44.980]   It'll be a lot of fun.
[01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:49.180]   We didn't win any awards for our podcast.
[01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:52.140]   I thought the podcast weren't eligible for the awards next year.
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:54.980]   We were not eligible for the podcast of the year award.
[01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:55.980]   We were not.
[01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:59.820]   But we were eligible in the categories and I think security now was nominated in technology
[01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:01.820]   but did not win.
[01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:04.300]   So, big hurt.
[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:05.660]   What would you say, Doug K?
[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:08.960]   You've been podcasting longer than anybody on this panel, longer than anybody except
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:11.000]   Christopher Leiden.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:17.320]   What would you say is different this year about podcasting from years past?
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:20.920]   I think last year it was still new to everybody.
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:22.760]   I think those of us who have been in it.
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:28.000]   I think what I'm seeing today is people who are podcasters and have been podcasters and
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.200]   can be considered veteran podcasters at this point.
[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:31.200]   A whole year.
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.200]   I think that's it.
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:35.640]   I think some of us are here for the second time.
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:36.640]   Wow.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:42.720]   So, I think at least for our little club of 2,500 people, we are mainstream.
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:45.160]   It does feel like a club though because you see the same faces.
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:49.400]   In fact, one of the things that kind of surprises me about this is a lot of people here promoting
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:52.960]   their podcast to other podcasters.
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:56.640]   And really what we need to do is promote it to people who don't know about podcasting.
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:57.640]   Right.
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:58.640]   Right.
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:00.640]   It's great and you want to get the word out but these are the last people that you'd
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:04.480]   probably say, "Hey, I have a podcast here."
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:07.560]   Scott Borne, you also a long time audio guy.
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:12.200]   In fact, you come from, as I do and I think Doug too, from Real Radio, Scott was...
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:13.200]   He's got that voice.
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:14.200]   He does.
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:15.200]   That radio voice.
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:17.800]   Do the thing you were doing, he's Scott Allen, is that...
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:18.800]   Allen Scott.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.440]   Allen Scott, he was a DJ.
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:21.440]   Go ahead.
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:22.440]   Let's just hear a little bit of the Allen Scott.
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:23.440]   Okay.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.440]   We're going to go back in time to the days of AOR Radio.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:26.440]   And this is the Allen Scott show.
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:28.240]   We got a brand new one coming at you on 30NAP.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.240]   Stereo 93, it's the Deep Purple.
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:32.280]   Anybody from Indianapolis recognize that?
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:35.760]   Yeah, a couple of fans there, including Elvis Paltry.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:36.760]   You're from India.
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:40.280]   That would be your only excuse for dressing in a chicken suit and singing Elvis.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:43.920]   I got to tell you, I never met anybody in a chicken suit in Indianapolis.
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:46.160]   Well, you just have to go back apparently.
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:47.440]   It's very big now.
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:49.200]   Things have changed since the days of Radio Radio.
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:51.840]   You were doing streaming radio before anybody.
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:52.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:55.320]   In 1994, we launched a company called Net Radio.
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.800]   We used Real Audio 1.0.
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:01.880]   We delivered music to folks on 1200 BOD modems and it sounded like your Aunt Edna's
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:04.560]   singing in a toilet.
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:07.000]   But we had an IPO and made a lot of money and got away with it.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.320]   But we wanted to do what's going on now.
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:10.640]   We didn't have the bandwidth.
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.640]   We didn't have anything like RSS.
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:15.960]   We did deliver information on demand through a company called Pointcast.
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:18.200]   As you and I discussed last week, we did Pointcast.
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:20.600]   We took Net Radio attached it to Pointcast.
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:23.800]   So technically, that was the first podcast.
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:27.720]   If your criteria is audio delivered on demand and that was done in 1994.
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:29.840]   And if you don't use the word POD.
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:31.800]   And you can't use the word POD.
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:34.240]   So we gather together to talk about the news.
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:39.920]   And Paul's here in a very timely way because on Friday, RC2 came out and it looks like we're
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:45.360]   very close to a final version of Vista.
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:47.560]   Paul, you're running RC2 right now.
[01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:48.560]   Yes, I am.
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:49.560]   What do you think?
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:52.480]   Well, first of all, if I drop off, that's why.
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:53.800]   Wow, that's great.
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.400]   You're actually in RC2 right now.
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:57.720]   Yes, I am.
[01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.720]   Wow.
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.720]   It's pretty good.
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:02.120]   I've got a lot of changes.
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:06.960]   As I have been telling people this weekend, I mean, this one new icon and control panel.
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:09.800]   And they colorized, maximized Windows.
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:10.800]   And that's about it.
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:13.760]   Well, you wouldn't expect really much change from RC2.
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.520]   It's all about the bug count, isn't it?
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:17.480]   It depends on how bad RC1 was.
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:18.480]   Right.
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:19.480]   Actually, it was pretty good.
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:20.480]   That's pretty good.
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:21.480]   Yeah.
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:22.480]   There's some compatibility stuff.
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:28.000]   I noticed that Photoshop no longer throws up a compatibility window.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.760]   But nothing major.
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:35.040]   The story was that you said when we were on Windows weekly October 15th, now they're
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:40.440]   saying October 25th is kind of their drop-dead date for ready to make a factor.
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:42.640]   And according to-- and I don't know if this is accurate.
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:43.640]   Maybe you can confirm it.
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:45.480]   I think it was Techter.
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:49.640]   They said that to get to RTM, you have to get 500 or fewer bugs.
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:55.440]   Yeah, that was actually in something I wrote earlier this week.
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:58.240]   I got a bunch of internal emails this week, which was kind of nice.
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:04.280]   But basically, they went from something like 2,500 bugs at the end of September to 1,500
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:06.040]   bugs a bit a week ago.
[01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:09.680]   And they need to get down to 500 to get into the RTM tree, I guess.
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:12.840]   And most of those bugs are cosmetic, I would imagine.
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:17.960]   In Ed Bot's Microsoft report at zdnet.com, taking a look at the Windows Vista team blog
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:22.520]   and now at the license terms for Windows Vista and come up with some pretty kind of
[01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:23.600]   stunning things.
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:29.120]   I think the one that is most annoying is that you can only move it once.
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:32.200]   If you buy a new computer, you can move it to that new computer once, but the second
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:34.760]   time, no.
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.600]   And you also can only sell it once.
[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:39.600]   It can't be resold after that.
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:43.040]   And also, it's going to cause some major problems if you are a heavy upgradeer.
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:45.840]   Well, yeah, because you can only reinstall once.
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:46.840]   Yeah.
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:51.080]   I mean, most people buy computers with Windows installed, but for those who build their own,
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:52.080]   this is a--
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:53.080]   No.
[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:57.360]   You know, my experience with Microsoft, I'm not going to take the-- I'm not a big fan
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:02.280]   of this concept either, but my experience with Microsoft over the years with these upgrades
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:06.080]   are moving the operating system, we're putting in a new hard disk or whatever.
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:09.520]   You know, you do get the error message and they give you an 800 number to call in.
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.040]   I think it's going to change, John, because of this new--
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:14.400]   Well, they'll do a genuine advantage thing, you know.
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:15.400]   Well, maybe.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:18.560]   But in the past, you used to be able to call them up and explain what you were doing and
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:21.080]   they'd say, OK, whatever, and they give you a code.
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:23.680]   Yeah, I don't think that's going to happen this time.
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:24.960]   Kind of a great story, I think.
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.120]   Good news for the good guys.
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:27.400]   Yeah, it's really interesting.
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:29.200]   I've been following this story for a while.
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:35.720]   Apparently, Logan Airport has a four pay Wi-Fi service where you have to pay some amount,
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:37.680]   maybe range for T-Mobile or somebody.
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:44.440]   But Continental Airlines was offering a free Wi-Fi service in their lounge for their customers.
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:48.480]   And Logan came along and said, "You can't set this equipment up because it interferes
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:49.480]   with our equipment."
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:51.840]   It interferes with our right to make money.
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:53.640]   That was really a bottom line.
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:58.200]   But they were claiming that because they were the property holder, that they had the ability
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:06.760]   to control the unlicensed band-- well, licensed in a broad way band of what Wi-Fi is, they
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:09.080]   claimed that they had the right to control that.
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:11.840]   And it was clearly seen as just a money grab.
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:15.920]   But the larger, more important issue is, you know, what really are the rights someone
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:20.280]   has to broadcast and receive in these so-called unlicensed bands.
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:22.440]   So what are the FCC rules?
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:26.520]   From the recent posting, apparently, the FCC did, in fact, side with Continental.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:30.800]   They said that Continental had the right to set up their own wireless as long as they
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.480]   were complying with the FCC's rules.
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:38.720]   In other words, the FCC claimed jurisdiction over the Wi-Fi signals in that building.
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:41.880]   And there are actually very few rules over this 2.4 gigahertz band.
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:43.080]   That's an unregulated band.
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:45.880]   That's why Wi-Fi is on that band in the first place.
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:49.480]   Speaking of-- you know, Dell is a sponsor on this program.
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:51.920]   I don't know if Dell pays President Bush.
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:54.480]   I know that Michael Dell is a supporter of President Bush.
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:56.480]   You know where I'm going with this, Molly.
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:57.480]   Yes, indeed.
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:05.320]   I want to play a little clip of it for you of the President's remarks in which he essentially
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:06.320]   plugs Dell.
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:08.440]   But do you think it was-- do you know what I'm talking about, John?
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:09.600]   Have you seen this video?
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:10.840]   You probably put it on your--
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:12.320]   No, I didn't put it on the blog.
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:13.320]   I'm familiar with it.
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:19.400]   And there's actually some sort of a violation, by the way, that did this kind of thing.
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:25.080]   He says people will be watching it on their Dell televisions.
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:29.520]   He says, oh, I meant to say televisions, but I started saying, "Del--" and then I stopped
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:31.020]   and I said, "Tell--"
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:34.360]   Although when you watch the video, I watched it a couple times just to make sure because
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:35.360]   it was so odd.
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:38.200]   And I actually had it on in my office live.
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.400]   And remember, turning around going, "Did he just say--"
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:41.960]   It sure sounded like it.
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.440]   It doesn't seem like a stutter.
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:45.600]   It doesn't really seem like he starts to say televisions.
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:46.600]   I'd like to play a little bit of it.
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:49.360]   And it's tough in a time of war.
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:52.360]   When people see carnage on their Dell television screens, you may think about that.
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:55.840]   That sure sounds like Dell television screens, doesn't it?
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:56.840]   It's absolutely deliberate.
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:01.680]   Well, it sounds like maybe he went to say, like, a curse with starting with the--
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:02.680]   Dan Television.
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:03.680]   --to do that.
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:04.680]   He was in a--
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:06.440]   You know, Dell is a big company out in Texas.
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:13.440]   He's got a-- that Dell's in Austin.
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:16.440]   They give a lot of money, Michael Dell is a big push supporter.
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:16.440]   When people see carnage on their Dell television screens, you may think that sure sounds like Dell television screens.
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:23.240]   All of the mail I've gotten this week is about personal audio players says simply,
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:25.960]   "Does the new little shuffle sound as good as the old shuffle?"
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:26.960]   It does, too, doesn't it?
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:31.640]   I mean, that's one of the things you've done that I really like is you've tested the audio on these.
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:33.640]   And I know you like the old iPods.
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:35.240]   The shuffle's good.
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:36.240]   The shuffle has superb.
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:39.240]   The first shuffle was the best of all of them, right?
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:40.240]   Yes, absolutely.
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:42.240]   And the new one is as good?
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:43.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:44.240]   Interesting.
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:47.240]   That's the amazing-- well, they're using the same technology.
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:49.240]   Oh, so, so shrinking it didn't--
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:57.240]   The shrinking it helps because they can't put the evil capacitors in there that they put in the regular iPods.
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:11.240]   And no one-- no audio engineer, no electronic designer that I've spoken with can figure out why Apple took the low road on the other iPods.
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:12.240]   What does the capacitor do?
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:24.240]   Well, the capacitors are-- they're coupling capacitors, and they-- basically, the signal that comes out charges the capacitor and your headphones discharge the capacitor,
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:29.240]   and that's how the sound gets from the transistors inside to your ears.
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:34.240]   And if you make those capacitors too small, they discharge too quickly on the bass notes.
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:38.240]   And that's-- it's just simple, you know, electronic physics.
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:40.240]   So it sounds like a-- instead of a--
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:41.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:42.240]   Was that again?
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:44.240]   Oh, instead of a--
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:51.240]   The creator of China's largest pornographic website jailed for life on Wednesday, according to Sinhua.
[01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:53.240]   I'm going to put a stop to it.
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:13:04.240]   He handed down life senses to this guy, and then in terms of 13 months to 10 years to eight others, convicted of profiting from pornographic dissemination.
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:06.240]   They should be given these guys awards.
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:07.240]   They should be getting-- no!
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:10.240]   What's-- you know, China's always whining about population control.
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:11.240]   We need fewer people.
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:12.240]   Great!
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:14.240]   Let them view porn and sit in dark corners.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:15.240]   Good point.
[01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:16.240]   I mean--
[01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:17.240]   Good point.
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:20.240]   I think that deserves a memo, Patrick.
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:24.240]   You should send one to the Chinese Ministry of Culture immediately.
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.240]   This is quite an amazing site.
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:33.240]   Apparently, according to Sinhua again, the site contained more than 9 million pornographic images and articles.
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:34.240]   That can't be right.
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:35.240]   Why not?
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:37.240]   The police said 9-- 9 million?
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:39.240]   You got a billion people in labor scheme?
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:42.240]   I mean, you can-- somebody can put together iPods for $60.
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:43.240]   9?
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:44.240]   For like $50.
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:45.240]   You know what I think?
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:46.240]   It's a miserable place to work.
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:49.240]   I think it was a 9 megabyte file.
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:52.240]   And they thought it was 9 million pictures.
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:54.240]   Any thoughts from the panel on that?
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:57.240]   Is Microsoft-- Andy, is Microsoft the innovator or--
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:59.240]   No, they're following.
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:02.240]   I mean, all you have to do is look at the Zoom.
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:05.240]   I mean, the Zoom is a big, fat disaster.
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:07.240]   And they didn't even do it well.
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:09.240]   They didn't even copy the iPod well.
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:10.240]   They did it badly.
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:14.240]   So this is a classic example of Microsoft following what they know best and missing--
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:15.240]   The boat.
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:21.240]   I played a clip on the Windows Weekly a couple of days ago from Ferguson, the guy who hosts
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:23.240]   the late, late show on the CBS.
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:25.240]   He's talking about the Zoom.
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:32.240]   And he says, "The Zoom, it's a Microsoft's attempt to beat Microsoft in the iPod market.
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:34.240]   To beat the iPod in the iPod market."
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:37.240]   He said, "It's five years late."
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:38.240]   It was funnier than that.
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:39.240]   There were some jokes in there.
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.240]   I'm just-- it's an upside.
[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:44.840]   But "The Zoom" is a good example of something that's not an innovation except, well, for
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:47.240]   a couple of things, is Wi-Fi music sharing that's innovative?
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:48.240]   I guess.
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:49.240]   I don't know.
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:52.240]   I mean, and then I look at Vista, which kind of looks like, you know, Mac OS X.
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:54.240]   Yeah, good point.
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:56.240]   What do you think, Jeremy?
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:58.240]   If you follow Microsoft longer than anybody, probably.
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:00.240]   Well, I think they do both.
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:03.240]   Clear type certainly was important.
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:08.240]   It made it comfortable to write books on computers.
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:09.240]   I love it.
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:10.240]   Especially LCDs.
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:11.240]   It made a huge difference.
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.240]   Yes.
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:16.920]   So the big story of the week, which just came out a few hours before we convened this,
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:22.640]   Time Magazine has declared, "The person of the year, ladies and gentlemen, is you."
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:24.040]   No, not you, John.
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:25.040]   No, no, no, no.
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:26.040]   Not you, Steve.
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:27.040]   No.
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:28.040]   You.
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:29.040]   The other you.
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.040]   Not-- yeah, that you.
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:32.240]   I thought we should maybe say, "It's you's guys."
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:34.240]   You-- you-- you-- you guys.
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:36.040]   That's the new listening audience.
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.040]   But you know what?
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:38.240]   That's assuming that there's no digital divide.
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:40.240]   I would just keep thinking if Time's goal is the--
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:41.240]   You really?
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:42.240]   That's true.
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:46.280]   Is it the event of the year for the six billion people on the planet or is it-- I still think
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:49.240]   it's a fantastic selection, though, or it's a fantastic idea.
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:50.240]   Oh, it's--
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:51.240]   It's-- it's a fantastic idea.
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:52.240]   Yeah, I think it.
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.240]   Well, let me-- let me-- you guys can debate this in a second.
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:54.240]   Let me just explain what they're talking about.
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:57.240]   They're talking about user-generated content.
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:58.240]   The subtitle is, "Yes, you.
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:00.240]   You--" this is a little bit like a commercial.
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:01.240]   "Yes, you.
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.240]   You control the information age.
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:05.240]   Welcome to your world."
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:07.240]   I thought they controlled the horizontal.
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:09.240]   You control the vertical.
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:14.240]   Lev Grossman writing this, he says, "Oh, he pulls up Thomas Carlisle.
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:18.240]   That's-- this is typical Time magazine overheated prose, but eventually says that it's not
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:22.240]   the great man who makes the difference in the world today.
