[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.360]   It's time for Twit, this weekend tech.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.880]   Today, the child centric version.
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.040]   Because in studio with us, Mr. Seamus Norton.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.240]   Hello Seamus, how you doing?
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.840]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.320]   And his father, Mr. Patrick Norton, hey, good to see you.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.040]   Good to be here.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.160]   His t-shirt today says science.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.640]   It works, bitches.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.280]   It's an XKCD. If you've never been to the cartoon side XKCD,
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.000]   you should go.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.600]   They're into science and math.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.360]   I love it.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.800]   Somebody said there's going to be an animated XKCD.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.880]   That's a really frightening thing to contemplate.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.480]   Because it's stick figures.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.000]   Well, I can deal with stick figure theater, actually,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.320]   is one of the best things I've ever seen.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.760]   Where they summarize, you know, it's like bunny theater.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.680]   It's like basically 60 second summaries of plastic sin they maw.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.480]   Like Jaws.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.880]   And now also with us, Mr. John C. Devorek.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.400]   Dead, dead.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.240]   So Seamus is looking at the monitor saying,
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.160]   "Dad, at the picture."
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.560]   Pointing at you and saying, "Dad, at the picture."
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.240]   Well, you know, when you had Patrick.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.240]   Well, let's put Patrick back.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.240]   Let's put Patrick.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.000]   It's "Dad, at" on the monitor.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.640]   Yes, channeldevorek.com, devorek.org/blog.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.480]   And whatever else we could.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.440]   Also with us, Mr. Dwight Silverman all the way
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.640]   from Houston of the Houston Chronicle.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.880]   And the tech blog at blogs.cron.com/techblog.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.600]   Hey, Dwight, good to have you.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.440]   Great to be here.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.880]   Leo, thank you for inviting me.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.480]   We had a Windows House Party here on Thursday
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.800]   for the launch of Windows 7.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.000]   And look, we have a Jigsaw puzzle, a Windows 7 Jigsaw puzzle.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.480]   And Seamus is going to put it together.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.840]   That's exciting.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.200]   Those just are chewing on the pieces.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.360]   He can chew it, so I don't keep-- do anything he wants with that.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.880]   That's--
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.720]   It's a puzzle.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.560]   It's a micro-- well, you know, actually we had a race.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.080]   We wanted to see if it would be faster to install Windows 7
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.440]   or put the puzzle together.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.800]   And puzzle one, but it was a pretty easy puzzle.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.840]   Dwight, are you hearing--
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.480]   Is that-- yeah, is that the picture of the guy floating
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.040]   in midair?
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.600]   Is that what's--
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.320]   It's the turtle with the city on its back.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.520]   One of the--
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.640]   One of the few things that they surprised us
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.820]   with, from those of us who used the release
[00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.560]   candidate 7100, in fact, as far as I could tell,
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.720]   the only thing that was different.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.800]   So it was that telling you that the thing runs like a turtle?
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.520]   Is that what the product is like?
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.360]   Is like a turtle's--
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.000]   It's turtles all the way down.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.520]   It's turtles all the way down.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.720]   I do know that's great.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.440]   Want to tell it?
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.120]   You'll do it better.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.560]   It's a great story.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.480]   Who was it they were talking to?
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.160]   It was a lecture.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.040]   And a great physicist was lecturing
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.280]   about the creation in the Big Bang.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.600]   Was it-- who was it?
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.760]   Heisenberg or is it Einstein?
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.400]   I don't know, Feinstein.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.280]   I mean, let me look at a Feynman movie.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.800]   Feinstein, Senator Feinstein.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.160]   I mean, I got to look at some--
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.600]   Great physicist, Diane Feinstein.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.480]   It's probably, if I Google turtles all the way down, I'm sure.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.280]   The infinite turtle theory.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.480]   So what's in the news this week?
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.360]   It's an anecdote published by Stephen Hawking.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.080]   I'll get to it in a moment.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.280]   The widely known version is a well-known scientist.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.680]   Some say it was Bertrand Russell once gave a public lecture
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.440]   on astronomy.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.240]   He described how the Earth orbits around the sun--
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.040]   how the sun orbits around the center of the vast collection
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.600]   of stars called the galaxy.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.080]   At the end of the lecture, a little old lady
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.920]   at the back of the room got up and said, what you've told us
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.120]   is rubbish.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.720]   The world is really a flat plate supported
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.480]   on the back of a giant tortoise.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.440]   Scientists gave a superior smile before replying.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.520]   Will Madam, what is the tortoise standing on?
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.680]   You're a very clever young man, very clever,
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.360]   but it's turtles all the way down.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.400]   It's a great story, classic story.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.040]   And you know, it's funny because that's what that desktop
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.120]   is of a turtle carrying the world.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.000]   So I think I would be willing to bet
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.240]   that's a little in-joke from my side.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.760]   I think it's about that or it's not
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.160]   about the speed of the product.
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.680]   I think it's more that than the speed of the product.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.800]   You know, the product's very fast.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.600]   Seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven,
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.640]   seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven,

[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.820]   seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven,
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.420]   seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven,
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:43.020]   seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven,
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.020]   seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven,
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.820]   Snow Leopard hasn't had major problems, they've had a few data issues.
[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.920]   So you can have one of the problems. If one of the people had the data issues,
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.020]   you might consider a major problem. That would be a major problem.
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.920]   Well, the difference is that Apple controls the hardware and Microsoft has
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.320]   no control over the hardware of what it runs. It has to hope and work to make
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.520]   sure that it runs on all that various, you know, the whole Windows ecosystem.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.020]   But, you know, Apple can kind of control the environment that it runs in.
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.320]   I think that's one reason why they can do it in secret.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:23.020]   But Vista had a lot of beta testers too. I remember seeing on Twitter some complaints
[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.520]   when bombers said that, "Oh, we had all these beta testers on Windows 7,
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.820]   and that's what made it different." That a lot of people said,
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.320]   "Hey, there were a lot, there were billions of people testing Vista too,
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.520]   and complaining about it at the time, and Microsoft didn't seem to do what they needed to do."
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.520]   They didn't listen. I think that that was part of the problem.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.820]   And there's also the CNN story talks about Windows Starter Edition,
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.920]   where Microsoft proposed that they were going to do a starter edition for netbooks
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.120]   that only allowed you to run three applications at the same time.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:56.520]   Well, netbook manufacturers howled, rightly so, and Microsoft backed down.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.920]   And that's something that they might not have done in the Vista days.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.320]   So I think it's a chastened Microsoft.
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.020]   Well, they still between Microsoft and Intel,
[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.720]   they've managed to cripple an entire generation of netbooks.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.720]   Yeah, but now, at the Adam deal where you can't put more than a gig in and all of that.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.020]   But now I think with running Windows 7, a netbook is not so bad.
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.520]   I think it's running XP on a netbook was kind of painful.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.120]   But actually, it hasn't bothered me that much.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:25.420]   I just can't try XP. XP reminds me of Fisher Price operating system,
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.220]   big buttons, and that might have been your term, actually.
[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.620]   I think it was. You claimed that.
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.020]   Somebody says that the chatroom has been down for some time,
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.220]   but not the chatroom I'm in.
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.720]   Oh, just to please, stop paying attention to those people.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.420]   What on Twitter? The Twitter people?
[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.220]   They know attention to those Twitter people.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.220]   They don't.
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.020]   The kids are coming to Twitter, apparently.
[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.720]   Do you see that article?
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.420]   It's becoming a youth culture.
[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.220]   There's two articles like this that have bothered me.
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:55.320]   That one and the one that say 20% of the entire US internet
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.320]   using population is using Twitter.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.320]   Oh, yes, sure.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.220]   That's what I said.
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.220]   They may be signed up.
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.420]   There's 120 million homes with broadband.
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:07.320]   So let me see if I can find this article that talks about the kids coming to Twitter.
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.320]   I've noticed it.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.820]   You know where you notice is on the trending topics?
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.620]   Because I look on-
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.120]   Do you think that they're interested in?
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:16.720]   Well, they're interested in it.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.420]   The stuff that's trending is not anything I would follow.
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.420]   I mean, it's weird stuff.
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.220]   What on Twitter?
[00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.020]   Yeah.
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.120]   Do you ever click those trends?
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.120]   Well, I noticed it.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.420]   I've noticed it with my daughter and her friend.
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:29.820]   Now, she's a journalism major.
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.320]   So, you know, she's there.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.020]   Journalists are more interested in Twitter, I think, than the average person.
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:40.220]   But more and more of her friends are using it and kind of in, I try to keep track of
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.620]   what is happening in Houston.
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.620]   And I see younger people all the time getting on it here.
[00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:48.320]   And I think that it really, that really has been happening for a while.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.020]   Probably when it became mainstream, it wound up on places like Oprah.
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.020]   And, you know, you see constant references to it in the media.
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.020]   So many references that's driving it.
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:58.820]   Yes, I think so.
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:03.820]   I think Twitter is not at the point yet where, you know, you can say it.
[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:07.420]   You can mention it and just automatically presume that people know what it is.
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.420]   I think you still have to have a little bit of explanation.
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.420]   And you see references to it all the time without explanation.
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.820]   And I don't think it's ready for that.
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:14.820]   This is a big shift.
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:18.420]   The Pew Internet and American Life Project, I really love it.
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.020]   They kind of dull out these factoids.
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.620]   It's kind of an ongoing study.
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:28.020]   The research in December found that users in the 25 to 34 year old group
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.620]   were slightly more likely to use Twitter.
[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:34.020]   And now it's 18 to 24 is the biggest cohort.
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:38.020]   And they've got a nice little graph which is reproduced on the Huff Po.
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.420]   As you can see, the shifting demographics.
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.620]   It's only a matter of time before us old farts start to say,
[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.020]   "Oh, it's too many kids on Twitter."
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.020]   So I'm looking at trending topics.
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:51.020]   And right now it's number one is it should be illegal.
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.020]   Okay, now click it.
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.220]   And what you get, you see a lot of these, they're continuations.
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:57.820]   It should be illegal dot dot dot.
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.820]   And you, I'm guessing, but I think that's a--
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.820]   Somebody started this up, yeah.
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:10.220]   If you use Brisley, which is a Twitter web clone, I mean, it's Twitter,
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.020]   but it's a different interface to it.
[00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:15.820]   And they have this really nice feature on the right where you can look at the trending
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.020]   topics and click why.
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.020]   And somebody will have written an explanation.
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:25.620]   In this case, it says, "People are tweeting things they think should be illegal to do."
[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.700]   There's another one, you know you are a thug.
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.340]   You know you're a thug when.
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:31.620]   Right, this is a--
[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:32.620]   It's kids.
[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:33.620]   It's kids.
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:34.620]   That is kids.
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:35.620]   It's kids.
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:40.020]   And then there's Sunday, so there's the Bears, the Saints, the Cowboys.
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.740]   This trending topic is not a useful use of Twitter.
[00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:50.820]   But I think very interesting this week that Twitter sold its firehose to Facebook, I'm
[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:54.740]   sorry, to Bing and Google as did Facebook.
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.180]   Although Facebook didn't sell it.
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.820]   Facebook apparently gave the information for forendexing.
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.780]   And Google has announced they're going to do something called Social Search.
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.340]   They're not going to mix it up with the regular search.
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.940]   They're going to both, I think.
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:08.940]   Bing is already.
[00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:13.620]   If you search for a, you know, a hot current topic on Bing, you'll get tweets as well as
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:14.620]   regular pages.
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.620]   Like Ms. Frank.
[00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.260]   Yeah, I don't know what that is.
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.260]   What is it?
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.260]   Maybe someone in the chat room knows.
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.260]   What's Ms. Frank?
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.260]   I'll go back to Brisley.
[00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.260]   I'll tell you.
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.260]   Ms. Frank.
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:27.700]   I'll challenge chat room versus the old room in the X Factor this week's losing act in some
[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.740]   sort of British idol thing.
[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:30.740]   Well, you beat them.
[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:31.740]   You beat the chat room.
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:32.900]   Of course I did.
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.940]   I've got Brisley on my side.
[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.700]   So what do you think, Dwight, I like Brisley?
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:37.700]   I like this.
[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:38.700]   Isn't that cool?
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:39.700]   Oh, you haven't seen it before?
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.700]   Yeah, I, oh, I had signed up for it, but I hadn't explored it.
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.940]   But for the print, for the trending topics, I'm trying to figure out what the hell people
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:47.940]   are talking about.
[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:48.940]   This is excellent.
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:52.380]   And it's a wiki thing because you can explain it if it's not explained or you can add your
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.380]   explanation to it.
[00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:54.380]   All right.
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.500]   Well, anyway, I know you hate the Twitter stuff, but there's one, but I want to know
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:02.140]   about what you think about the notion of real time search being incorporated into
[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:03.140]   beta.
[00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:04.140]   I don't like it.
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:08.460]   I don't think searching tweets is like going to be valuable to anybody.
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.460]   I think there's some value to it.
[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.420]   I think there's a special tab and you can just do that only.
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:13.580]   Well, that's what Google wants to do.
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:14.580]   They want to do.
[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:18.420]   Here's the, they want to do a social search, which takes the information from your Google
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:22.220]   profile because I don't know if you've created a Google profile yet, but you can.
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:23.220]   It's not a refuse.
[00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.580]   You want to see mine?
[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:26.580]   It's Google.
[00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.460]   I don't, yes, you know, I do everything.
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:32.300]   Google.com/profile/loport.
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:38.180]   And so you, you, if you actually populate it, you'll have all of the websites you use,
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:39.940]   all your Facebook log and all that stuff.
[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:44.020]   Google uses that information and then puts together a customized search based on the
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:47.060]   people you follow on all of those sites.
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.860]   I think that's a great idea.
[00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.660]   The port?
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:51.660]   Yeah.
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:52.660]   Google.com/profile.
[00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.580]   Do you think that's too complicated though?
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.340]   That's fairly, that's a fairly complex thing.
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.740]   As it doesn't exist.
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:13:59.740]   Google.com/profiles.
[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:00.740]   Oh, profiles/loport.
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:06.180]   I, it's complicated because you have to set up a profile.
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.180]   Huh?
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.180]   Right.
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.180]   Right.
[00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.180]   Yeah.
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:11.660]   But I think if, well, Google's trying to make these profiles more useful.
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:17.260]   If you use Wave, for instance, just a million pictures of you.
[00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.700]   One of the features of a Google profile thing.
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:20.700]   No, no.
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.860]   One of the features is it'll get your Flickr feed so you can put your pictures in there
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.620]   so that that way people know what I look like.
[00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:27.620]   And then it has.
[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.060]   It's just a way for some stalker to get it easy.
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.060]   No, no.
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:34.780]   This is, this is your, in my opinion, this is a way that you can control what Google
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:35.780]   puts out about you.
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:40.260]   Now the problem is that this shows up at the bottom of a Google search for you.
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.740]   If it showed up at the top, I think it'd be a little bit better.
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:47.460]   But the idea is that if somebody searches for my name and the search results are my
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.620]   Google profiles, this is the official stuff.
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:50.620]   Oh, so you can.
[00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:51.620]   You control it.
[00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.860]   Bogus it up to the max.
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.020]   You do whatever you want.
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.180]   If you're a vivid chundra, you can.
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:57.580]   When did you live in Santa Cruz?
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:00.020]   I went to Santa Cruz High School.
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:01.020]   You didn't know that about me.
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.020]   See?
[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:05.700]   If you visited my profile once in a while, you'd know a little more about me.
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.700]   That explains it.
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.700]   I'm a hippie.
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:13.340]   No, when we moved from Rhode Island and when I was in 10th grade, I went to Santa Cruz
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.700]   High and graduated from Santa Cruz High.
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.220]   Then left as quickly as my little feet could scamper.
[00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:21.980]   Hey, we're so happy.
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:22.980]   It can be wide.
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:23.980]   Sorry.
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:31.260]   Well, this is the other thing is that Facebook has also said we will give Bing and Google
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.020]   status updates, news information and so forth.
[00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:41.740]   But because Facebook has this privacy issue, they'll only do it if users say it's okay.
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:48.380]   And they say they're going to modify how Facebook works so that users can specify and are encouraged,
[00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:51.860]   I guess, to specify that their updates are public.
[00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:55.060]   They really, Facebook's got Twitter envy.
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:56.060]   That's pretty clear.
[00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.060]   Oh, definitely.
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.060]   And that's odd because they're so much bigger than Twitter.
[00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:01.060]   Isn't that silly?
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.260]   They're growing faster.
[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.700]   They got more going on.
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:10.220]   I think Facebook isn't as cool as there's a cool factor with Twitter that Facebook doesn't
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.220]   have.
[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.620]   I think I've said it before here and others have said it.
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.380]   It's AOL for the 21st century.
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.540]   And I think they know that.
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:23.980]   And they would like to be something cooler than AOL, but that's basically what they are.
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:24.980]   Could be worse.
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:30.820]   They're actually kind of almost classmates.com for the 21st century.
[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.860]   It's actually a little bit of worse.
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.500]   Let's go over some of this stuff.
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.340]   People who need to know this.
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.180]   What is Waka-pupa?
[00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:43.100]   John has discovered the...
[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.100]   What do you mean Waka-pupa?
[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.100]   Is that what it is?
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.100]   Oh, Waka-pupa.
[00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.100]   What are you looking at?
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.100]   Oh, this is my profile.
[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.100]   There's a list of your profiles.
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.100]   Okay.
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.100]   This stuff that Leo belongs to.
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.100]   Let's go over some of these things.
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.100]   Waka-pupa.
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.100]   I'll tell you what, Waka-pupa.
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.100]   Claim ID.
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.100]   Okay.
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.100]   Okay.
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.540]   Claim ID is an open ID site that tells you which...
[00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.380]   If you click on it, you'll see my claim ID page.
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.860]   And it shows you all the sites that I say I am responsible for.
[00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:06.860]   And all the sites...
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.220]   And sites that I'm not.
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:14.180]   So for instance, there's a not me section that has my fake Facebook page, my fake blog,
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.180]   my fake lies.
[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.180]   Okay.
[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:17.180]   So it's kind of a...
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.180]   You claim this.
[00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.180]   Okay.
[00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.180]   All right.
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:23.180]   Waka-pupa tracks the applications you use and posts them on a social site.
[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.180]   So it's...
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.180]   Why?
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:26.180]   Who cares?
[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.180]   It's a great site.
[00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:28.180]   You don't know about Waka-pupa?
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.180]   No.
[00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:30.660]   So the deal with Waka-pupa is you can see what other people are using.
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.660]   You can get some information about what's good.
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:33.660]   Okay.
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.820]   You can see how you use your computer.
[00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:41.860]   For instance, I know that last week I used mail, Apple Mail, then Firefox and VMware
[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:42.860]   Fusion the most.
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:43.860]   Geez.
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:48.700]   Although how do you feel real about kind of broadcasting the apps that you're using out
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:49.700]   there?
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:50.700]   Well, you know, I'll tell you where it gets...
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:51.700]   I'll tell you a little bit about that.
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:52.620]   A little squirrely.
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:53.620]   It also does...
[00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:55.260]   They added recently web apps.
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.860]   So you got to be careful about exactly how you use...
[00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:58.860]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:17:58.860 --> 00:17:59.860]   Exactly.
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:00.860]   How the foreign sites.
[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:01.860]   Exactly.
[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:02.860]   Okay.
[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:03.860]   Discus comments.
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:04.860]   Discus comments.
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.860]   Always pronounce disgust with a Q.
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:07.860]   Yeah.
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.220]   I pronounced it wrong.
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.500]   You know, I found out that Postorus is actually Postorus.
[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:12.500]   Yeah, that's preposterous.
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.060]   That's exactly.
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.380]   That was the earlier version.
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:16.380]   So okay.
[00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:17.980]   Discus comments is what again?
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.340]   It's a commenting system for blogs.
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.340]   Okay, fine.
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.340]   Drop IO, we know what that is.
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:25.220]   It's just basically an open thing that just puts crap in.
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:26.220]   Delicious bookmark.
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.220]   You too.
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.220]   We know.
[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:29.220]   Slicker.
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.220]   Smug mug.
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:31.220]   We all know that.
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:32.220]   Smug mug.
[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.220]   Yep.
[00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:34.220]   Google reader.
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.220]   Is anybody still do that?
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.220]   Yeah.
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.220]   What do you think?
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:38.220]   Friend feed.
[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.220]   What's Tumblr?
[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.220]   Tumblr.
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:41.220]   You know Tumblr?
[00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.220]   Yeah, no Tumblr.
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:43.220]   What's this?
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:44.220]   Tumblr.
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.220]   Well, that's my Tumblr log.
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.220]   Okay.
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.220]   I call it Tumblr.
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.220]   And then a blog and then the tech, radio show.
[00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.220]   Okay.
[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.220]   Well, just the ones at the bottom.
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.220]   So it's almost...
[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.220]   Well, that's why it's at the bottom.
[00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:53.220]   Those are like the...
[00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:54.220]   That's like the drag.
[00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:55.220]   Well, I will check out what...
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.220]   Waccupa.
[00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.220]   Waccupa is cool.
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.220]   Waccupa is a great site if you want to find out what people are using.
[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.220]   It has reviews.
[00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:01.220]   It has suggestions.
[00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:02.220]   But there's a better site.
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:03.220]   Ah.
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:04.220]   You want it already?
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.220]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.220]   You're all logged in?
[00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.220]   Yeah.
[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.220]   Yeah, of course.
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.220]   It's called alternative two.
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.220]   A alternate...
[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:11.220]   Wait, is that right?
[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.220]   Alternative...
[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:15.220]   We could just do a show just listening to this crap you do in your spare time.
[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.220]   (laughter)
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:19.220]   Now I have to find the website now.
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.220]   Turn it to...
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.220]   To.com.
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.220]   No, that's not right.
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.220]   Unfortunately.
[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.220]   What is it?
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.220]   It's alternative two.net.
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:28.220]   Sorry.
[00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:29.220]   Alternative two.net.
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.220]   Profer one.com.
[00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:31.220]   What is it?
[00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:32.220]   No, no.
[00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:33.220]   Alternative two.net.
[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:38.220]   So what this does is it shows you alternatives to mainstream applications.
[00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:42.220]   So you say, "Well, how am I getting a Twitch search box here all of a sudden?"
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.980]   Welcome to the Twitch cottage.
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.220]   I own everything in here.
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.220]   Even your searches.
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:47.220]   Huh.
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.220]   Now that's...
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.220]   You know what that is?
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:50.220]   What?
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.220]   Open.
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.220]   It's open DNS.
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.220]   You know what open DNS?
[00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.620]   I've heard of it, but I don't know anything about it.
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:00.820]   So the DNS we use here in the Twitch cottage is monitoring what you do.
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.820]   So when I make some error, it takes over.
[00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:03.820]   It takes over.
[00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:06.420]   So you must mean something else.
[00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.820]   It automatically adds it to John's Google profile.
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:15.900]   All his errors are moved by Wacupa to his profile.
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:17.300]   You know what it is, John?
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:23.020]   Is there's a vast world of Web 2.0 sites out there that you've just apparently ignored?
[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:25.700]   I know I actively ignore it.
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.300]   You don't want to know anything about.
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.460]   And this is why John and I...
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:31.460]   It's like Lennon McCartney.
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:32.940]   It's like Yin and Yang.
[00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.460]   By the way, this is coming from a guy who...
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:37.940]   Leo, a guy who never answers his email.
[00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.900]   I'm too busy playing with Wacupa.
[00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.940]   Who has time for email?
[00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:42.940]   Lennon McCartney.
[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:45.580]   No, because you...
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.460]   You hate everything on site.
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.460]   And I love everything on site.
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.980]   You're Lennon on McCartney.
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.980]   That was basically their...
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:53.980]   They're...
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:54.980]   They're mo.
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:55.980]   That's possible.
[00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:56.980]   Yeah.
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:57.980]   Paul with...
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.980]   Jack is dating Yoko-Ono.
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.980]   Yeah, I've met Mimi.
[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:02.980]   It might be...
[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.980]   I'm all right!
[00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:05.980]   Mmm.
[00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:06.980]   Let's see.
[00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.900]   I want to talk about Windows 7 a little bit more.
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:09.900]   Can we take a break?
[00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.380]   Because I could see John's had a little too much caffeine.
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:16.180]   I have to tight-trade his dose here for a little bit.
[00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:17.180]   He's feisty today.
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:20.020]   Before you do that, before you go into the commercial, what was the name of the site?
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:21.020]   I'm looking for a...
[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.020]   Alternative2.0.net.
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.020]   It's T-O.
[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.020]   T-O.
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.660]   Alternative2.net.
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:30.980]   The idea being, you're looking for Photoshop, you don't want to spend that much money.
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.340]   What's a good alternative?
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:36.420]   And it uses kind of a dig-style voting as people vote it up and down.
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:37.420]   You're not...
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.420]   You're still not finding it.
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:39.420]   I got it.
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:40.420]   I'm on it now.
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.420]   It's cool site.
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:42.420]   Go take a look at that.
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:43.420]   But while you're doing that, I want to invite everybody...
[00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:44.420]   You're a great meat.
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:45.420]   There's no meat.
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:46.980]   You could baste here.
[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.980]   Unless you brought like a grill with you.
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:49.980]   Mmm-hmm.
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.500]   Did you bring your hibachi?
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.500]   Did you ever have a hibachi?
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:54.500]   Yes, I did.
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:55.500]   I thought you might.
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.900]   It seems like a hibachi type.
[00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:02.780]   Let me talk about Audible actually this week because there's a special offer from Audible.com.
[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:06.980]   So we have a new Audible URL.
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:11.340]   Audible has a really cool sequel to the audio book of the year.
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:15.380]   Last year, remember the Chopin manuscript we talked about?
[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:23.860]   They brought together 16 authors, great thriller authors, to create a book called The Copper
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.020]   Bracelet.
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:31.700]   People like Jeffrey Deaver and Lisa Scotalini, lead child Joseph Finder.
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:37.780]   And so the sequel to the Chopin manuscript is called The Copper Bracelet.
[00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:42.820]   Exclusively for audio, 16 of the best thriller authors.
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:46.020]   This is another way to try Audible.
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:51.500]   If you like this, if you love the Chopin manuscript, which I did, it was incredible.
[00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.500]   You want to listen to the copper bracelet.
[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.420]   It's a clever idea.
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:23:00.740]   It starts with a peaceful picnic in the French countryside that explodes in violence and mysterious
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.900]   assassin hisses a deadly threat.
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:07.220]   And events are set in motion that could propel India and Pakistan down the road to nuclear
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:11.420]   confrontation.
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:12.420]   Try it right now.
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.660]   Go to audible.com/twitcopper.
[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.060]   Get the first chapter free.
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:19.020]   What do you look at me like that for?
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:25.300]   Two things.
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.060]   Michelle Malkin.
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.220]   She thinks it's fantastic.
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:30.700]   Malkin is the right-wing nutball.
[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.460]   And is your wife a right-wing nutball?
[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.980]   She's actually more of the reporter type that just doesn't do well on TV.
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:36.980]   Malkin is?
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.140]   I thought she was another one of those.
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.940]   No, she's actually a legitimate journalist.
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.860]   But she is a right-wing nutball.
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:46.060]   But she's not a talk show host type.
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.060]   No, she can't.
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.060]   I don't think she could do it.
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.700]   She wouldn't be able to pull it off.
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:51.700]   What's the book?
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:52.700]   I don't know.
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:53.700]   Well, just search for Michelle Malkin.
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:54.700]   It's not right now.
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:55.700]   I remember seeing it.
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:56.700]   Very hot.
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:57.700]   Very good.
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:58.700]   Now, I was looking funny.
[00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:00.420]   It's because you got 3205 over there.
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:01.820]   But that's not the right time.
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:02.820]   That time's crazy.
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:04.620]   I don't know what's wrong with that thing.
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:07.740]   It's had the wrong time ever since we put it in.
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:08.740]   Is it recording?
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:09.740]   You sure?
[00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:10.740]   Yeah.
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:11.740]   I don't know why it says 320.
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:14.380]   I think it's interesting that the VU meter, I can see it from here so I can kind of modulate
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.620]   my voice without a headset.
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:18.620]   So I'm going to turn that a little more towards you.
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:19.620]   There you go.
[00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.100]   Yeah, it's kind of cool.
[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.100]   Yeah, you can watch it.
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.540]   You can see what camera is next.
[00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.740]   You can see when you're about to be on.
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:27.740]   It's like a rocket.
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.900]   It's like the Houston Center in this place.
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:30.900]   I know.
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:31.900]   I love it.
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.500]   You know, that's the reason a lotterback came in.
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.500]   He just wanted to see it.
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:35.500]   Yeah.
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.500]   He didn't really want to be on the show.
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:37.500]   He just wanted to see it.
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.500]   No, I was having lunch with him and he says, "What about Leo?"
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:39.500]   I said, "Oh, you got to see this place."
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.500]   Oh, good.
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:41.500]   I said, "This is against the one-man shop.
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.100]   Is the combo dream come true?"
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.100]   I hope he enjoyed it.
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.100]   He says, "You're kidding."
[00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.900]   I said, "That Leo's place," and by the way, anyone who's out there that can make it
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:51.380]   possibly visit that you should.
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:52.380]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:53.380]   We invite people to come by all the time.
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.420]   Leo's like 20 people here for our Windows party.
[00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:57.300]   Leo's supposed to have nine.
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:58.300]   I know.
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:59.300]   I only had nine napkins.
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:06.620]   Leo's studio is probably the most advanced podcasting system in the world.
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:09.380]   I almost feel bad because people come by who want to start podcasts.
[00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:10.860]   But you probably put them off.
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:11.860]   Oh, my God.
[00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:12.860]   They go, "I can't do it."
[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.700]   How much did you spend on this?
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:16.820]   It's about $100,000 with a gear.
[00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:18.380]   Probably by now it is, yeah.
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:20.300]   Actually, you're right it is.
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:21.300]   Come to think of it.
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:24.300]   Yeah, I need to come by sometime next time.
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:26.260]   I would love you to come visit.
[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:28.700]   I would love you to come visit.
[00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:31.300]   Do go to audible.com/twitcopper.
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.500]   I guess I jumped the gun and I apologize.
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:37.860]   You must bear and jump in the shark or get the Michelle Malkin book.
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.780]   It's apparently very entertaining.
[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:41.540]   I'm sorry I said she was a right-wing nutball.
[00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:42.540]   I apologize.
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:43.540]   I'm doing nutball.
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:45.380]   Not that there's anything wrong with that.
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:50.740]   But she's also a journalist and she does a lot of research.
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:51.740]   She's not writing.
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:55.260]   You know all these other right-wingers that write the books are just...
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:56.740]   It's all rhetoric.
[00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:57.740]   It's all...
[00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:59.300]   Yeah, she actually has stuff she's dug up.
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:00.300]   Yeah.
[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.300]   Oh, good.
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:02.300]   Then I should read it.
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:05.420]   Culture of corruption, Obama, and his team of tax cheats, crooks, and cronies.
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:06.420]   That's it.
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:08.220]   That's a balance to look.
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.220]   Fair and balanced.
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.300]   Look at the Obama administration right there.
[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:14.740]   I'm downloading it right now because I want to show you that I am an open-minded fellow.
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:15.740]   Yeah.
[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.780]   We'll see how much of it you listen to before you go on.
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:23.340]   If I drive my car off the side of the road, does she read it herself?
[00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:24.340]   No.
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:25.340]   No, Johnny Heller does.
[00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:26.340]   You want to listen?
[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:27.340]   Listen a little bit.
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:28.340]   This is Johnny Heller reading.
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:32.140]   "Brain power and political muscle this early in a cabinet in our lifetimes."
[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:34.380]   Stephanopoulos dribbled.
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:38.620]   After blotting his chin a bit, he added, "He's managed his transition with the same kind
[00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:44.020]   of precision and discipline that he managed to show during the campaign."
[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:49.340]   It's hard to imagine this transition going much better for the president to elect.
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:52.060]   The Washington Post in Newsweek both indulged in...
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:57.420]   I could tell where she's going on this, but I like the Stephanopoulos dribbling.
[00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:05.660]   The problem that she has my wife caught this is that she writes for reading, silent reading.
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.460]   She doesn't write for a book reader and for somebody to read it.
[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.460]   That could be hard.
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.380]   That's actually something that writers...
[00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:16.860]   This is like I tell writers about writing for a magazine or a newspaper is different
[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.220]   than writing for the internet.
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:23.700]   You taught me very early on because I did some writing for you.
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:27.020]   This was very valuable to me to always read out loud.
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:30.260]   That's like part of your final edit is to read it out loud.
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.140]   You're writing always had...
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:35.140]   I could hear your voice maybe because I know you, but I could hear your voice when I read
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.140]   your writing.
[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.260]   It's almost spoken word.
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:39.260]   You do that Dwight?
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:43.020]   Do you read out your stuff out loud before you file?
[00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:48.380]   No, unless I'm doing it for audio, like if I'm doing something for radio, but for the
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:49.820]   most part I don't.
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:53.980]   I write horribly for radio if I don't do that.
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:28:01.140]   I have complex sentences and lots of commas and semicolons and I'm terrible at that.
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:06.340]   I have to stop myself and change it deliberately when I do that.
[00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:09.340]   Okay.
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:13.340]   Well, that was fascinating.
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:18.860]   I wanted to talk more about Windows 7.
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.900]   I do want to talk a little bit more about Windows 7.
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:25.700]   Have you heard Dwight, because I know you've got your finger on the pulse of users.
[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:27.260]   Have you heard of any problems?
[00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:29.060]   They're complaining vociferously.
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.060]   Are they?
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:31.060]   No, no, no.
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.060]   They're complaining with my fingers.
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:35.180]   They say getting your hand off my fingers, but I'm getting your fingers off my pulse.
[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:37.260]   No, but have you heard of any problems?
[00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:42.100]   This is the thing, the other shoot a drop you wait for when a new operating system comes
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:43.100]   out.
[00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:49.540]   It seems to me that Windows 7 was very robust, very reliable, very solid, but you never know
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:51.900]   until it goes wide.
[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:54.020]   The only thing that I've heard two things.
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:58.580]   I've heard from a couple of people who have had very long installations.
[00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:03.260]   If you remember, back in September there was a Microsoft engineer who did a blog post where
[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:08.460]   he said that if you have a lot of data on your drive when you do an upgrade, it's going
[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.380]   to take a long time.
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:13.500]   I've heard from a couple of readers who said that that's happened to them.
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:14.500]   Do we have any?
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.860]   Is there a rationale for this?
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:22.980]   Is there an explanation for this anomaly?
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:29.900]   The way both Vista and Windows 7 work is they kind of scoop out when you're doing an upgrade.
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:36.020]   They kind of scoop out your existing installation and set it aside and then they put down the
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:43.820]   Windows 7 bits and then they go back and kind of plug in your setup before.
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:48.980]   Apparently when it goes back and plugs in the setup before, if you have a lot of programs
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:55.420]   and a lot of data, it's a very complex process and that makes it happen very slowly.
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:30:00.340]   If you're doing something like a clean install or a custom install, it's like 20 to 30 minutes.
[00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:02.340]   It's really fast.
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:07.220]   That's by the way what everybody should be doing is a custom install.
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:11.980]   It's crazy to try to upgrade an operating system in place.
[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:16.820]   Particularly if you keep all your data on the same drive as your operating system and
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:22.540]   in the scenario that the Microsoft engineer was talking about, it was just a huge amount
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:28.380]   of data and 40 programs and it was all on the same drive.
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:32.780]   What you should do is move that kind of data off onto a separate drive or an external drive
[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:37.980]   at the very least when you're doing the upgrade or that's how you should run period.
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:40.660]   You shouldn't keep your data on the same drive with your operating system.
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:46.220]   Now I have a Dell laptop that I had separate partitions for my data and the operating system.
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:49.700]   Of course, all the applications, just because of the way Windows work, still have to be
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.220]   on it, really should be on the C drive.
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:55.220]   You can move that program file folder but it's always a mistake.
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:58.980]   I had to reinstall apps but boy, it was a smooth, I did a clean install too.
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:02.540]   I wiped the drive, installed seven.
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:06.620]   You can, this is weird, Paul Therott came up with the workaround.
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.020]   It's a very weird workaround.
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:13.780]   You can use the upgrade media to do a completely clean install as if there's never been any
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.020]   Windows there at all.
[00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:20.140]   What you do is you install it without the activation key.
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:24.100]   You format the drive install without the activation key and then there's a little bit of a registry
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:27.860]   modification and there's a command line you run and then you enter the activation key
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:32.980]   and you're fine which means no one should buy the full version of Windows 7.
[00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:34.820]   You don't need it.
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:37.900]   I said to Paul, well what about the ethics?
[00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:42.140]   He says, "Leo, do you know anybody who does not own a copy of Windows already?"
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:44.140]   I mean it's all an upgrade.
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:46.260]   Nobody's starting from scratch.
[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:47.740]   That's a good point.
[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.340]   Unless you only use Macs since 1984.
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:53.780]   Very few people use a Mac and then go back.
[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:57.980]   So I think that the ethics of it let your conscious be the guide but you certainly don't
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:59.580]   need to buy the full version of Windows.
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:01.340]   What's the difference in the price?
[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:09.660]   Well if you're a student, if you have an EDU email address, 30 bucks at win741.com.
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:14.020]   If you want to buy three licenses, you can get the home version of Windows Home Premium,
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:19.260]   the multi-seat package, three licenses for 150 bucks, that's 50 bucks per machine.
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:23.740]   That makes sense if you or somebody you know has, you can find three people with Windows,
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:24.740]   50 bucks.
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:29.780]   Worst case scenario, you don't know anybody, you don't want to buy the three licenses,
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:34.660]   you go to EDG Head, it's about 120 bucks for the OEM version of Windows 7.
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:36.340]   How am I, let's compare it.
[00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:39.220]   What's the price of let's say Ubuntu?
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:40.220]   Zero.
[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.260]   In fact they'll even send you the disk.
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:43.460]   That's interesting isn't it?
[00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:46.060]   You know the price of Mac OS X is?
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.060]   $30.
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:51.100]   $30 if you're upgrading from Leopard to Snow Leopard.
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.820]   But it doesn't check either.
[00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:54.380]   It doesn't right, it does not check either.
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.580]   So there's your other ethics.
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:02.100]   You had asked also about problems and you mentioned the $30 student edition.
[00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:08.340]   There were some issues downloading the 64-bit version from Digital River which was supplying
[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:10.540]   the e-commerce component of it.
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:16.060]   It sent it to you as an exe file and when you went to unpack the exe file it crashed,
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.900]   it cratered.
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:22.420]   And Microsoft is giving $30 refunds for that.
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:23.420]   Are they really the refund?
[00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:24.420]   Yeah.
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:25.420]   Yeah.
[00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:26.420]   I thought they might find a fix.
[00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:30.020]   Apparently if you burn it to an ISO, in most cases it works.
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:32.020]   But it's a kind of a mess, that $30 version.
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:35.020]   Because you get an exe file, it's kind of a mess.
[00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:40.900]   And you mentioned an edu file, an edu email address.
[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:47.700]   If you, a lot of people who have been at Winter University and maintain an alumni account
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.380]   with the Alumni Association, have an edu--
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:51.380]   Yeah, I actually have an edu--
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:52.380]   --he actually has an edu--
[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:53.380]   --he actually has an edu--
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:54.380]   --he actually has an edu--
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:55.380]   --he actually has an edu--
[00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:56.380]   Yeah, I have one from UT Austin.
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.380]   So--
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:58.380]   I tried it as well with my alumni address.
[00:33:58.380 --> 00:33:59.380]   It worked fine.
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:03.940]   I didn't actually buy it because I thought, well, it's very clearly you have to be a student.
[00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:08.540]   Is this your Yale alumni or the one from the Santa Cruz High School?
[00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:12.260]   It's from the Phoenix University of the--
[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:13.420]   --the University of the Phoenix.
[00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:15.380]   Right, everyone can get one of those.
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:16.380]   Yeah.
[00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:17.380]   Yeah.
[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:18.380]   University of Phoenix--
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:20.500]   You'll be able to get-- there's probably some open edu email that you can pull down
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:21.860]   some place or other.
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:26.460]   I think Microsoft sells so many copies of Windows that they don't really care.
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.020]   It's like-- it's-- it's the minimus.
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:30.140]   They figure that they get anybody to pay a net.
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:33.140]   30 bucks will take-- what is the cost of Windows, really?
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:34.420]   I mean, what does it cost them?
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:37.820]   They've done the R&D, which was probably half a billion.
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:41.500]   But you know, and they're going to get their money out of that.
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:45.420]   Somebody in the chatroom has a Phoenix.edu address.
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:48.060]   By the way, the people who are having trouble with the chatroom are trying to go through
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:52.140]   the web interface, MIBIT, which is our web interface.
[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:54.740]   There was-- there is a trouble with Web-- with the MIBIT for some reason.
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:57.900]   I don't know whether it's because we've got so many people in there or MIBIT's having
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:58.900]   trouble.
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:34:59.900]   Yeah, 868.
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.780]   Well, that's why I said, look, I'm seeing 800 people in there.
[00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:02.780]   Can't be too bad.
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:05.460]   I'm going through an IRC client and a problem at all.
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:08.060]   So it's a MIBIT issue.
[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:09.700]   Apple released-- it's interesting.
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:16.900]   Apple responded to Windows 7 by releasing three new ads directly aimed at Windows.
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:17.900]   I think there was four.
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:20.300]   There's a fourth one that I've only seen on the internet.
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:21.300]   Yeah.
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.300]   Here's one of them.
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:23.300]   Hello, I'm a Mac.
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:24.300]   And I'm a PC.
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:25.300]   Hey, Mac, did you hear the goodness?
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:26.300]   Windows 7 is out.
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:29.500]   And it's not going to have any other problems my last operating system had.
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:30.500]   Trust me.
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.300]   I feel like I've heard this before, PC.
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:36.580]   It's not going to have any of the problems that Windows 8 had.
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:38.700]   It's not going to have any of the problems that Windows M he had.
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:40.780]   It's not going to have any of the problems that Windows 8 had.
[00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:42.700]   It's not going to have any of the problems Windows 95.
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:43.700]   It's like, yeah.
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:45.420]   It's not going to have any of the problems Windows 2 had.
[00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:46.420]   Trust me.
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:48.420]   He's got a mullet.
[00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:50.260]   He rolled up, please.
[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:51.740]   I love John Hodgman.
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:54.220]   Oh, he's so funny.
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:55.860]   That's a pretty effective ad, I think.
[00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:58.420]   In a particular one, I think is the best of the group.
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:35:59.420]   Yeah.
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:04.060]   Essentially, which is the fractal of the Microsoft rollouts.
[00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:05.500]   It's one, they're always the same.
[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:07.420]   You always come out and every show you did the same thing.
[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:09.060]   It's the best version of Windows ever.
[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:11.340]   This is what you say every time you did it with Vist.
[00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:12.340]   I have a recording.
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:13.340]   Fantastic.
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:15.700]   I have a recording, John, of the show you and I did.
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:21.940]   And I'll have to find this when I'm saying, hey, I just tried Windows 3.1.
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:22.940]   And this thing's pretty good.
[00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:25.940]   And you're going, and you're going, you drank the cool.
[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:28.060]   And I said, yes, John, Windows 3.1.
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:30.180]   It is the best version of Windows ever.
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:31.180]   3.1.
[00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:32.180]   That's how long we've been working together.
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:33.180]   Yeah.
[00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:35.740]   And you've been saying the same thing every time a new Windows comes out.
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:37.580]   This, hey, it's not just me this time.
[00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:39.380]   Walt Mossberg agrees.
[00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:41.420]   Walt has gone both ways.
[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.420]   He's like going by.
[00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:45.420]   He keeps the side.
[00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:47.620]   He goes one way, then he's the other.
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:48.620]   You know what?
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:51.420]   He's trying to prove, as I am, his independence.
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:52.420]   Okay, fine.
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:54.860]   This is the best version of Windows ever.
[00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:56.580]   I think there's no question in my mind.
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:58.260]   That version is the best version.
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:36:59.660]   Well, but I mean, this really is--
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:00.660]   Are we recording?
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:01.660]   Are we recording?
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:02.660]   Will you say?
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:03.660]   Yeah.
[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.140]   So 20 years from now, you can say, Dwight, you said--
[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:06.140]   You said it.
[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:07.140]   It is.
[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.620]   But George, John has a point that every version should be better.
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:10.620]   But just it wasn't.
[00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:11.620]   And we knew it at the time.
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:13.020]   This is pretty good.
[00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:14.380]   Windows ME wasn't--
[00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:17.020]   No, Windows ME wasn't that bad.
[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:21.300]   In my opinion, the last great version of Windows was Windows 2000.
[00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:22.300]   I agree with that.
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:25.820]   This is, I would say, as good as Windows 2000.
[00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:27.460]   At least on the surface.
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:29.580]   That's why I'm asking you, Dwight, have you heard of any problems?
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.340]   Because I'm kind of waiting to be lost.
[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:34.940]   I have only two of those two things I've heard is the long installation.
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:43.340]   I had one issue myself with Windows 7 where it wanted to install older drivers than what
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:46.100]   I had put on the hardware.
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:53.820]   I had gone out and I had installed newer network drivers.
[00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:58.580]   And one of the things that they're trying to do with Windows 7 is have Windows Update
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:01.420]   provide the latest drivers so you don't have to worry about it.
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:06.420]   And so the whole time during the beta process, as well as in the release candidate, they
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:08.820]   kept giving you new drivers.
[00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:13.140]   And so when I put the RTM on it and I went out and installed the latest drivers for the
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:15.900]   network card, and then some more showed up.
[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.540]   And I thought, oh, great.
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:18.900]   Now I have better drivers.
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:19.900]   And I installed it.
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:21.820]   And it broke my network connection.
[00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:28.700]   I began having timeouts when I was transferring large amounts of data across my home network.
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:31.620]   I went back to the old drivers and that fixed it.
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:37.260]   And I talked to Microsoft about it and they asked for some data from it and some logs.
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:38.260]   And I sent it to them.
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:39.940]   I haven't heard back from them since.
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:43.780]   But they were concerned about the fact that it was indeed delivering the older drivers.
[00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:47.260]   The drivers were dated early 2007.
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:50.460]   They were early Vista drivers.
[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:54.940]   And what I had downloaded were drivers that were specifically for Windows 7.
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:56.860]   So that's not good.
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:03.100]   But that's one of those anomalies that probably doesn't happen that often, right?
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:06.700]   Well, there's, well, except that it's happened with the video drivers.
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:13.180]   I have the newest ATI video drivers and it keeps trying to give me the ones from about
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.980]   a month ago, even though I've got what's in place.
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:18.140]   Maybe there are some issues.
[00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:21.380]   I've had, I've installed it a number of times and very good results.
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:22.380]   I like it.
[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:23.380]   I like it a lot.
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:27.300]   And I think that, you know, it is, it's very stable.
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:28.740]   It doesn't get in your way.
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.860]   It does use fewer system resources.
[00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:33.380]   I love the arrow interface.
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:35.060]   I know a lot of people who are kind of clots.
[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:37.900]   Do you ever use shake and peak?
[00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:39.780]   I don't, I use peak all the time.
[00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:45.260]   I don't use shake, but I do use the thing where you can move two windows to the edge and put
[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:49.180]   them side by side, because I do a lot of drag and dropping.
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:50.500]   And that works really well.
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:51.900]   And they snap, do they snap to the edges?
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:52.900]   Is that what it is?
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:53.900]   Yes.
[00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:54.900]   Yep.
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:58.980]   See, that's not, when I do the, when I do the link posts on my blog, I can actually drag
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:04.860]   from Chrome into Windows LiveRider and it brings over the headline and as well as the
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:05.860]   link.
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:09.940]   And I have it, I use Windows 7 for that and it works great.
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:13.180]   Peak is where you, you have minimized programs.
[00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:17.020]   They minimize now all into the same icon, the original application icon and then you
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:20.220]   hover it over and it shows little thumbnails of all the windows.
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:21.220]   Right.
[00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:25.860]   And if you have, it doesn't work I think yet with Chrome or Firefox, but if you're using
[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:31.340]   Internet Explorer and you have multiple tabs open, it shows you what's in each tab.
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:35.020]   And so if you use, and if you're working on the web and you have a lot of tabs open,
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:36.020]   it can be really handy.
[00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:37.020]   It saves me time.
[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:38.020]   I think it's more productive.
[00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:39.620]   Oh, I love that.
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:40.620]   Shake is kind of weird.
[00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:41.620]   Were you shaking?
[00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:42.620]   I can never really.
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:43.620]   I think the window.
[00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:47.380]   That might be useful if you are, if you have a touch interface, if you're working on a
[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:51.180]   tablet and you do this, that might actually be useful in a touch.
[00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:53.660]   I think that a lot of this is touch focused.
[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:59.300]   In fact, Acer and a number of companies are doing touch laptops with Windows 7 and I think
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.780]   there's a lot of touch buried inside of Windows 7.
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:03.620]   I think that's what they already said.
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:04.780]   This was the case.
[00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:06.820]   One of the things, of course, touch with a laptop.
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:07.820]   I can just see it.
[00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:10.940]   You know, you go to touch something, you got some mustard on your finger and you make
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:14.060]   a mess on the screen so you start to wipe it off and then you start opening programs
[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:17.060]   by accident and the whole thing goes completely out of control.
[00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:18.900]   I just don't see it as practical.
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:20.700]   I love touch.
[00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:23.580]   I mean, look at the iPhone's success and that's a touch interface.
[00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:24.580]   But that needs to be.
[00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:26.100]   Yeah, because it's small.
[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:29.820]   Actually, it's interesting because Apple responded to Windows 7 not only with these
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:35.700]   ads but also two days before the Windows 7 launch on Tuesday with a launch of some pretty
[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:37.060]   nice hardware.
[00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:42.020]   A 27-inch iMac that has in and out video, in and out.
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:46.340]   It could really be used as a television, as a home theater PC.
[00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:50.660]   And also a new revised 999 MacBook.
[00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:53.860]   That's the white plastic one but it's got more battery life because it's got that sealed
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:56.380]   in battery that Apple seems to like so much.
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:57.380]   It's much thinner.
[00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:58.380]   It looks pretty attractive.
[00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:03.420]   I mean, they clearly, I think if you read, I don't know, Mac Minis, if you read the tea
[00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:05.780]   leaves, it's not something to celebrate.
[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:08.380]   It's Apple saying, "Huh, we're a little worried about Windows 7.
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:09.660]   We better have a response."
[00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:10.660]   Really?
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:12.100]   You think that?
[00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:13.100]   I think so.
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:14.100]   Yeah.
[00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:16.900]   It shows weakness on their parts.
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:17.900]   There's a blogger world.
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:19.540]   Do you think that shows weakness?
[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:20.540]   Yeah.
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:21.540]   Say again, Dwight?
[00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:25.380]   There's a blogger named Marco Arment, if you go to marco.org.
[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:34.260]   And he has a really interesting piece on the 27-inch iMac, which is an unusual size for
[00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:36.060]   a PC monitor.
[00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:38.140]   2560 by 1440.
[00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:39.140]   It's massive.
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:40.620]   And he talks about it.
[00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:50.060]   He says that the fact that you can get something like this for $1,700, the 30-inch display-only
[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:51.980]   cinema display is $1,800.
[00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:52.980]   It's more.
[00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:53.980]   Right.
[00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:56.220]   But it's $100 more.
[00:42:56.220 --> 00:43:01.140]   And he can see people buying this for the monitor alone and then connect.
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:08.580]   Because you can connect a notebook computer to it and run it as your main notebook display.
[00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:11.180]   And the pricing, he thinks the pricing is pretty unusual.
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:16.140]   He can't find anything like this looking around at other products.
[00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:18.100]   It's very aggressive.
[00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:20.900]   And you might say, "Oh, well, in fact, HP did."
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:27.380]   And as you go to Microsoft's Windows 7 launch page, you'll see HP saying, "Well, $11.99.
[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:29.300]   That's the bottom of the line, iMac.
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:32.100]   You can buy three HP computers and we'll throw in a wireless router."
[00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:35.460]   I mean, they're really hitting the Apple tax thing.
[00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:37.540]   But I think that people aren't maybe that price sensitive.
[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:44.020]   And when they see a 27-inch display and a very nice computer, i5 or i7-based computer
[00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:47.860]   for $100, $2,000, I think that's pretty...
[00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:49.380]   I think there are people who buy that.
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:50.380]   Obviously.
[00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:51.380]   Did you see Apple's results?
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:52.380]   They're quarterly results?
[00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:53.380]   Yes.
[00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.380]   I mean, they're obviously doing something right.
[00:43:55.380 --> 00:44:00.540]   I did a blog post where I actually said, "Okay, I've been wrong in the past.
[00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:03.340]   I've been calling on Apple to lower its prices."
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:04.860]   Yeah, it didn't hurt it.
[00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:11.620]   But I think that actually that they are doing exactly what they want to do, that they don't
[00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:12.900]   want to be...
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:15.540]   Apple does not want to be Microsoft.
[00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:16.540]   They do not want to be...
[00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:17.540]   They want to be BMW.
[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:18.540]   They want to be BMW.
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:19.540]   They want to be BMW.
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:28.580]   And actually, I think if they were to become a huge numbers, huge market share, let's say,
[00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:33.540]   25 to 50 percent market share, it would stress their systems, their support wouldn't be as
[00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:34.700]   good as it is.
[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:37.540]   I think they're much better off as a niche player.
[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:42.020]   And certainly, I think their shareholders agree at what they're doing is working.
[00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:47.180]   They posted 47 percent increase in profit in quarter four.
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:51.220]   A lot of companies are reporting better profits because of reducing cost.
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:52.220]   Cheating.
[00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:54.220]   I don't think there's evidence of that.
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:55.220]   No, Apple's not.
[00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:56.220]   Everybody else is.
[00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:59.100]   They sold 3 million max at 17 percent more than...
[00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:00.540]   Their revenues are up.
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:01.540]   Their revenues are up.
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:02.540]   That's what you look at.
[00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:03.540]   Revenues.
[00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:04.540]   The revenue is going up.
[00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:06.940]   Microsoft's revenues are going down even though they have...
[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:07.940]   Right.
[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:09.340]   The Microsoft saved money by cutting costs.
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:10.340]   That's where Microsoft...
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:11.340]   Yeah, they fired people.
[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:12.340]   Yeah.
[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:18.460]   Microsoft deferred a revenue from Windows 7 till after the Windows 7 launch.
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:21.700]   So they denied themselves some cash.
[00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:25.780]   They'll have such a better quarter next quarter, of course.
[00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:28.380]   Apple sold 7.5 million iPhones.
[00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:34.860]   That's up from 6.9 year ago, year to date.
[00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:36.100]   They had a hell of a quarter.
[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:38.180]   Their iPods, which is the only thing that's falling.
[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:40.340]   10.2 million iPods.
[00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:43.500]   That's 200,000 fewer than the Wall Street Project.
[00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:45.340]   They need to refresh.
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:46.340]   They did a refresh.
[00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:47.340]   It wasn't enough.
[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:48.340]   They need another design refresh.
[00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:49.340]   They need a major...
[00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:51.900]   Well, they need something compelling.
[00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:54.140]   I think they've saturated the market.
[00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:55.140]   Everybody wants an iPod.
[00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:56.140]   It has three.
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:57.140]   How many you have?
[00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:58.740]   I don't think I can't even count them.
[00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:00.220]   Yes, this is the problem.
[00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:02.380]   Everybody in my family has some.
[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:06.100]   Net income rose to $1.67 billion.
[00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:12.700]   That's the net kids for three months up from 1.1.4 year to date.
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:17.220]   Revenue up from 7.9 billion to 9.87 billion.
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:19.300]   Yeah, this is not a cost-cutting list.
[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:25.740]   You know, Horowitz and I discussed this on the Warwick Horowitz unplugged show, another
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:27.740]   podcast.
[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:31.900]   And Horowitz spotted something that was interesting, which is Apple's accostioning that there's
[00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:38.220]   going to be a problem in the next quarter because of increased shipping costs, which
[00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:39.220]   was definitely...
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:43.060]   Which led me to believe that the only thing that could cause that increased shipping cost
[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:44.060]   is the fact that...
[00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:48.300]   And other people have said this before, but I said it again and I wrote it up.
[00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:49.900]   Oh, I actually didn't write it up.
[00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:52.180]   I just chatted it up.
[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:53.900]   That Apple...
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:56.860]   And there's no reason for me not to think that they wouldn't do this because they got
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:03.580]   the stores and the infrastructure is to bring out an actual TV set, an LCD TV that has Apple
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:05.220]   TV built into it.
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:06.220]   So you have essentially...
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.420]   Calicana predicted that a year ago.
[00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:13.260]   Well, I predicted it two years ago then.
[00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:15.860]   But the idea to do that now is the time...
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:16.860]   And Apple may have...
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:20.700]   Well, then the way they have with this 27, I mean, it's got a computer in it.
[00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:21.700]   It's kind of a...
[00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:22.700]   You can hang it on a long way.
[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:28.140]   If you make... I can see Apple bringing out like a 32 or a 40 inch, 42, 47, 55 inch.
[00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:29.140]   Who knows?
[00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:30.140]   But that's the only thing that counts.
[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:32.540]   What else are they going to do that's going to affect shipping?
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:33.940]   Those things are expensive to ship.
[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:36.820]   If you ship a boatload of them over here.
[00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:43.860]   And also though, Apple's really good at under...
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:47.420]   Under-producing and over-producing it.
[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:50.500]   Warning the market of problems that don't ever exist.
[00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:52.500]   And that way they get these great expectations.
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:53.500]   Well, that's an old trick in Silicon Valley.
[00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:54.500]   Yeah.
[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.500]   They're good at that.
[00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:58.500]   During their conference call, they made reference to...
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:47:59.500]   Sambagg.
[00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:03.940]   ...that they were going to have enhanced or higher shipping costs because of a specific
[00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:07.260]   product that they were going to be selling.
[00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:10.340]   This was before they announced the 27 inch iMac.
[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:11.340]   And there may be something else...
[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:13.140]   That's going to cost some money.
[00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:14.220]   That is going to cost some money.
[00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:16.660]   But maybe there is something else.
[00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:21.940]   I like the idea of Apple TV built into a TV.
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:23.540]   I think that's just really natural.
[00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:26.660]   And they may not do it now, but I think they'll do it eventually.
[00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:27.660]   Probably after their tablet.
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:30.660]   Well, with those stores they've got that New York store, for example.
[00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:36.340]   I mean, they have room in there to set up a TV showroom and just push those things.
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:40.340]   And they could be nicely profitable.
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:42.140]   They could charge a little more than any...
[00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:43.140]   They can charge so many prices.
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:46.580]   It practically is that kind of high-end audio showroom already.
[00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:48.620]   Yeah, it looks like it has that look and feel.
[00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:50.620]   So you might as well put some fancy...
[00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:53.140]   You might as well have some Apple speakers while we're at it.
[00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:54.140]   Well, they tried that.
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:55.140]   Thank you.
[00:48:55.140 --> 00:49:00.020]   Remember when Steve Jobs comes on stage said, "These sound so good I threw out my stereo
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:04.620]   system and they were these crappy powered speakers which Apple has since discontinued.
[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:08.580]   I hope Steve didn't throw out his stereo system but just put it out in the maid's quarters
[00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:10.580]   so he could get it back when...
[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:13.940]   Once the speakers were off the market.
[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:14.940]   Let's take a break.
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:15.940]   I want to come back.
[00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:19.620]   Apple has a patent that is causing some people to think it may change its entire business
[00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:21.220]   model.
[00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:22.220]   But I...
[00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:23.220]   Well, we'll find out.
[00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:24.220]   But first I want to talk about GoToMyPC.
[00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:27.860]   This is the company that allows you to get remote access to your computer anywhere you
[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:29.820]   go anytime securely.
[00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:32.820]   It's easier to use but more secure than a VPN.
[00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:34.460]   This is a great solution.
[00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:41.460]   Go to myPC.com.
[00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:44.460]   I want you to try it right now absolutely free.
[00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:45.460]   That's right.
[00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:47.460]   All you do is go to GoToMyPC.com/twit.
[00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:48.460]   Sign up.
[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:49.460]   Get that account going.
[00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:52.460]   Press the download button within two minutes.
[00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:58.460]   With no configuration of your router you'll have an absolutely secure remote access setup
[00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:00.460]   on your system.
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:03.460]   Now wherever you go, anywhere you go, you just log on to GoToMyPC.com.
[00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:06.900]   Press the connect button and there it is.
[00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:07.900]   There's your computer.
[00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:12.420]   You can send and receive email, run any program access, any network resource just like you're
[00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:13.900]   there.
[00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:16.140]   It works in your web browser.
[00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:17.460]   It's 100% secure.
[00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:18.460]   It's super fast.
[00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:20.420]   It's just like being there.
[00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:22.260]   And you could try it free for 30 days.
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:24.860]   All you have to do is go to G-O-T-O-M-Y-P-C.
[00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:30.740]   Go to myPC.com/twit for your 30-day trial of GoToMyPC.
[00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:34.140]   If you haven't tried it yet, I really want you to give it a try.
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:38.900]   We're actually putting it on all of the computers, including our switcher.
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:42.220]   Because sometimes in the middle of the night the switcher will stop playing.
[00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:46.180]   Colleen says, "Lil, aren't you going to get me going to my PC?
[00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:48.300]   All right, Colleen, I'm going to put GoToMyPC on there.
[00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:50.660]   I think we have it installed everywhere.
[00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:52.500]   Go to myPC.com/twit.
[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:55.340]   You'll want to install it everywhere once you give it a try.
[00:50:55.340 --> 00:51:00.140]   We thank you so much for their support of This Week in Tech.
[00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:03.140]   John has left the studio.
[00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:04.540]   I don't know.
[00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:10.060]   I normally don't report on Apple patent filings because, like most big companies, they've
[00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:12.260]   got skunk works going all the time.
[00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:13.700]   They file patents like crazy.
[00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:14.700]   It doesn't mean anything.
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:24.420]   There is a blog called Patently Apple that talks about this Apple patent for ad-supported
[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:27.220]   operating systems.
[00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:28.220]   Now it could just be.
[00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:30.740]   I think a lot of times when you file a patent you're just protecting something.
[00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:33.380]   You don't have any intention of doing it.
[00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:37.980]   But lately there's been just this feeling that both Apple and Microsoft are looking at
[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:38.980]   this model.
[00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:40.780]   What is your sense of it, Dwight?
[00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:43.180]   Does it sound like something reasonable?
[00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:49.140]   Well, in that story they note that one of the names on the patent application is Steve
[00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:50.140]   Jobs.
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:53.020]   Does that make it more credible?
[00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:56.220]   It may make it more credible.
[00:51:56.220 --> 00:52:03.220]   There's this constant speculation that at some point Apple will start letting other manufacturers
[00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:11.020]   put OS10 on their machines despite the size star lawsuit.
[00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:15.540]   I wonder if this wouldn't help pave the way or if that's how they do it.
[00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:25.220]   You could use OS10 on a non-Apple product but you have to have to show ads at the time.
[00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:29.500]   I can't see them wanting to put this on their hardware.
[00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:33.980]   I just think it seems very non-Apple to me.
[00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:35.860]   It seems very anti-user to me.
[00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:39.220]   I don't want ads on my operating system.
[00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:44.860]   In fact this patent has buttons like click here within five seconds.
[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:54.140]   It almost requires you to act, to watch the ad, which is really kind of appalling.
[00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:55.140]   I don't know.
[00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:59.060]   This may be for some sort of a product we're unaware of or some of the other.
[00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:00.060]   Apple TV's?
[00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:01.060]   I don't know.
[00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:02.060]   That would be interesting.
[00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:04.300]   Apple TV or the tablet.
[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:06.300]   What if you did that on the tablet?
[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:11.100]   Does a tablet be so expensive and no carrier is going to subsidize that?
[00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:12.940]   The tablet is going to be a book reader.
[00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:14.540]   I don't believe it's going to be a computer.
[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:16.300]   Boy, that's the hot quantity right now.
[00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:19.340]   Because they could blow everybody out of the water with a nice book reader.
[00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:21.460]   What do you think of the Nookie?
[00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:23.620]   I'm sorry, the Nookie reader.
[00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:24.620]   I don't know.
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:25.620]   What do you think?
[00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:26.620]   What's he?
[00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:32.020]   Barnes & Noble in a perhaps mistaken attempt to go for it.
[00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:36.380]   I was waiting for the second version, the cranny.
[00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:38.820]   It's called the Nook e-book reader.
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:39.820]   Yeah.
[00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:42.620]   Say that fast and you get something else.
[00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:43.620]   It's from Barnes & Noble.
[00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:45.540]   It has some color at the bottom, which is kind of interesting.
[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:47.980]   Black and white e-ink at the top.
[00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:49.100]   But it's not just Barnes & Noble.
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:51.460]   Now everybody says we're making an e-book reader.
[00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:52.860]   Yeah, I like to see some numbers here.
[00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:53.860]   By the way, we're talking about patents.
[00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:57.060]   We might as well mention what's going on with the Nookie assuming Apple patent.
[00:53:57.060 --> 00:54:00.660]   Yeah, Nookie says, "Hey, we were there before with a smartphone."
[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:02.780]   And when we're, that's going to end up.
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:05.980]   I mean, talking to each other, they've been negotiating.
[00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:10.820]   This kind of indicates that the negotiation is not going anywhere.
[00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:14.180]   I just, you know, I think any time you negotiate with Steve Jobs, I just have a feeling there's
[00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:18.380]   a high, "I'm out of here" factor, you know, like, screw you.
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:19.380]   Right.
[00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:24.540]   So, you know, like, quick draw artists when it comes to, like, soon people left and right
[00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:25.700]   and now they're getting sued.
[00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:26.700]   Yeah.
[00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:30.780]   I think, you know, one of the reasons I don't really pay much attention to stories like
[00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:35.060]   that is because there just seems like there's always lawsuits flying back and forth.
[00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:38.140]   And it's just way, it's just the way of doing business.
[00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:42.380]   And I don't know if it's, if there, I can't tell if there's merit or not in this.
[00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:44.340]   It's part of the negotiating process for this.
[00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:45.340]   Exactly.
[00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:48.620]   They've been talking for a while and so now they're going to take it public and kind
[00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:50.940]   of want to try to shame them into it.
[00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:51.940]   Exactly.
[00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:52.940]   I will see.
[00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:54.820]   I mean, Nokia certainly had the first smartphones.
[00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:56.300]   You still use your E71, John?
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:57.300]   Yeah.
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:58.300]   I have it on me.
[00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:01.180]   You know what I just ordered and I'm really excited about the M900?
[00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:03.580]   I think it's a pro, maybe.
[00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:09.660]   It's running MIMO or MIMO, the Linux version, you know, the Linux, it's Debian under the
[00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:10.660]   hood.
[00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:14.260]   But, but Nokia's been developing this open source operating system for phones.
[00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:16.700]   It has, you know, it has a lot of the features of the iPhone.
[00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:17.700]   You can slide pages.
[00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:18.780]   It looks a little bit like a pre.
[00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:22.220]   You have multiple applications running in the switcher as you slide it.
[00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:27.540]   It's a big screen, touch screen with haptic feedback, five megapixel camera, high quality
[00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:28.540]   video.
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:30.780]   It's going to be better than the best of the best droids.
[00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:31.780]   I don't know.
[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:34.060]   I think what we're seeing is some real competition.
[00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:38.780]   I used the M71 because it's really light, very thin and it has a little keyboard.
[00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:39.780]   This is not bad.
[00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:43.860]   I can do messaging, but going on the web to do anything is just completely useless.
[00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:47.660]   So what I've discovered though, I don't think you need a phone that has web apps.
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:48.660]   It's not the same thing.
[00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:49.660]   It's not the same thing.
[00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:50.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:51.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:52.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:53.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:54.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:55.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:56.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:55:56.660 --> 00:55:57.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:55:57.660 --> 00:55:58.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:55:58.660 --> 00:55:59.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:00.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:01.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:01.660 --> 00:56:02.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:03.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:04.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:05.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:06.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:07.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:08.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:09.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:10.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:11.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:12.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:13.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:14.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:16.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:17.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:18.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:19.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:20.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:21.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:22.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:23.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:24.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:25.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:26.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:27.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:28.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:29.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:30.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:31.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:32.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:33.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:34.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:35.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:36.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:37.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:38.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:39.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:40.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:41.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:42.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:43.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:44.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:44.660 --> 00:56:45.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:46.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:47.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:48.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:49.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:50.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:51.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:52.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:53.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:54.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:55.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:56.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:56.660 --> 00:56:57.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:57.660 --> 00:56:58.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:58.660 --> 00:56:59.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:00.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:01.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:02.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:03.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:04.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:05.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:06.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:07.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:08.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:09.660]   It's the same thing.
[00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:14.660]   Hello, John.
[00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:17.660]   I'm back.
[00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:20.660]   800x480 resolution.
[00:57:20.660 --> 00:57:23.660]   That's a usable screen size, if you ask me.
[00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:24.660]   Full keyboard.
[00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:25.660]   Removable battery.
[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:28.660]   I asked the people who got one at the MIMO developers conference
[00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:30.660]   what kind of battery life they're getting this morning on
[00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:31.660]   Twitter.
[00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:34.660]   They said four to six hours if you're really rock it hard.
[00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:38.660]   Most people are saying it's like any smartphone.
[00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:40.660]   It's just a beautiful phone.
[00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:42.660]   It's really pretty.
[00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:45.660]   How heavy is the N900?
[00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:47.660]   6.8 pounds.
[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:49.660]   6 to 8 ounces.
[00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:52.660]   Now it says it's AGPS, assisted GPS.
[00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:57.660]   Does that mean it's using GPS or it's using the cell sites only?
[00:57:57.660 --> 00:57:58.660]   What is eight?
[00:57:58.660 --> 00:57:59.660]   I keep seeing...
[00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:00.660]   I'm in the chat room.
[00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:01.660]   We'll know their genes.
[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:02.660]   I think it's both.
[00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:06.660]   I think it means it uses the regular chunk of the S and then also
[00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:09.660]   does the cell triangulation as well.
[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:11.660]   I've done what you do, John.
[00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:13.660]   I outsourced my brain to the chat room.
[00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:14.660]   It's kind of similar.
[00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:16.660]   There's 918 people in there.
[00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:17.660]   See, it's a good brain.
[00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:21.660]   I've been actually figuring out what is the optimal size for a chat room.
[00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:23.660]   If it's going to be your brain.
[00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:26.660]   It has to be over 500 people, but under a thousand.
[00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:29.660]   One guy says it is the cell towers.
[00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:31.660]   Well, but some say it's both.
[00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:32.660]   Oh, here it is.
[00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:33.660]   Wikipedia's got the answer.
[00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:38.660]   Assisted GPS.
[00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:39.660]   Quick, quick.
[00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:40.660]   Help me.
[00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:47.660]   Generally abbreviated GPS is a carrier network dependent system which can under certain conditions to prove the startup performance of GPS satellite-based positioning system.
[00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:52.660]   So it is used with GPS capable cell phones to give you kind of a quick start.
[00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:57.660]   So it uses the cell towers to narrow it down, but then you do have true GPS.
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:59:01.660]   So it's just for a fake performance.
[00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:02.660]   Well, I'll give you an example.
[00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:03.660]   You know this.
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:07.660]   When you first start up a GPS in a new area, it has to download the all monac.
[00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:08.660]   Right.
[00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:09.660]   It's forever.
[00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:11.660]   So this says, okay, cell towers, where am I?
[00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:13.660]   Give me the all monac.
[00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:21.660]   The all monac is then downloaded over the 3G network and then it much more quickly.
[00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:24.660]   Network also can give you atomic time with accurate time assistance.
[00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:25.660]   Sounds good.
[00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:28.660]   This is a pretty hot little device.
[00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:30.660]   Now I had a Nokia 800.
[00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:35.660]   They're tablet and it was really slow and not very attractive, but I'm excited about this.
[00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:36.660]   We'll see.
[00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:37.660]   And how much is it?
[00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:40.660]   It's $5,000.
[00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:43.660]   It's a little under 600.
[00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:44.660]   But now here, well, okay.
[00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:45.660]   It's unlocked.
[00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:46.660]   It's unlocked.
[00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:47.660]   Well, here, listen to this.
[00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:48.660]   Listen closely.
[00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:50.660]   It's going to cost me less than the iPhone.
[00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:51.660]   And I'll tell you why.
[00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:53.660]   I'm all ears.
[00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:56.660]   And this is what actually, this is why I ordered it this morning.
[00:59:56.660 --> 00:59:59.660]   T-Mobile just announced this new plan.
[00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:01.660]   A new data plan.
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:08.660]   That is, if they say if we don't subsidize the phone, 79 bucks for everything.
[01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:18.420]   Unlimited phone calls, unlimited data, unlimited internet, unlimited texting for 79 bucks as
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:20.980]   long as we don't subsidize the phone.
[01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:25.940]   So in effect, I'm paying about 20 bucks a month less.
[01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:28.660]   I don't have a two year contract anymore.
[01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:33.660]   So even though the phone costs about 400 bucks more, I'm saving that much on the contract.
[01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:36.660]   I'm actually saving, what is it?
[01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:38.660]   $480.
[01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:40.660]   Can you bring an unlocked iPhone to it?
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:41.660]   That's a good deal.
[01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:42.660]   Yes.
[01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:43.660]   But you have the iPhone.
[01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:44.660]   What's the capital?
[01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:45.660]   We can unlock the iPhone to it.
[01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:46.660]   Yeah, you can bring an unlocked G phone.
[01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:47.660]   Any phone, yeah.
[01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:51.660]   But you wouldn't get the benefits of, you know, whatever it is, the iPhone.
[01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:53.660]   What the, what?
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:55.660]   I'm sure it's a five gig a day to cap.
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:56.660]   They don't, you know, I'm sure it is.
[01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:57.660]   But they say unlimited.
[01:00:57.660 --> 01:00:58.660]   Yeah.
[01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:00.660]   Well, I'll tell you, I'll let you know.
[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:01.660]   Yeah, okay.
[01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:02.660]   I'll let you know.
[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:04.380]   You'll be up five gigabytes and now I'm going to make.
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:06.420]   These are five megapixel images.
[01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:08.660]   T-Mobile is struggling, right?
[01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:09.660]   It has his sprint.
[01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:12.660]   Verizon and AT&T are sucking all the oxygen out of the room.
[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:17.140]   AT&T with the iPhone, Verizon with their better, better network because, you know, they've
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:18.860]   got a great network.
[01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:21.780]   Sprint's dying on the vine and T-Mobile is a weak fourth.
[01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:23.580]   They've got to do something.
[01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:27.620]   So they announced this morning, this is Project Dark or something they call it.
[01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:31.260]   And, uh, Project Darkside.
[01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:32.660]   I think it's their last ditch attempt.
[01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:33.820]   But you know, they're Deutsche Telekom.
[01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:37.980]   This is a little, something a little more common in Europe.
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:41.940]   In Europe, people don't, you don't expect a subsidized phone quite as much, do they?
[01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:44.340]   No, you can get most of the phones that are unlocked.
[01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:45.340]   Yeah.
[01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:47.980]   So this, this is called the even more plan.
[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:52.620]   They started $49.99 for unlimited calls and no annual contract.
[01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:57.980]   And then if you want the unlimited data and text, it's 79 and no contract.
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:01.900]   I think that that's kind of, that's really basically saying, okay, we want to be the
[01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:08.300]   company that people like you, John, with your E71 or me with the 900 go to.
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:14.260]   I think it's a very clever to differentiate or although they have the worst 3G network
[01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:15.260]   coverage.
[01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:18.140]   They have 3G in Petaluma with T-Mobile.
[01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:19.940]   No, it's Edge.
[01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:22.580]   I have 3G here with the AT&T.
[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:23.580]   Yeah.
[01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:27.260]   AT&T has a 3G here as of course does Verizon and Sprint.
[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:30.580]   You know, let me look at my, I have to look at my G1.
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:32.820]   I've been using a G1 on T-Mobile.
[01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:34.180]   I should look and see if it's still Edge.
[01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:35.980]   I think sometimes you get a 2G.
[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:36.980]   I hear.
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:37.980]   Your Seamus is back.
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:38.980]   Oh, Seamus.
[01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:41.740]   You let him drink the coffee.
[01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:42.740]   I told you not to.
[01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:43.980]   Did he drink that coffee?
[01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:44.980]   Yeah.
[01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:46.500]   Seamus, you like your, you like your dad.
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:49.900]   You like your coffee black and your woman strong.
[01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:54.620]   He's, he is a sweet, I have to say, he's the sweetest kid.
[01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:57.660]   I'm sorry that he's a little rambunctious.
[01:02:57.660 --> 01:02:58.900]   He napped on the way here.
[01:02:58.900 --> 01:02:59.900]   That was the problem.
[01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:02.820]   He pulled out of front and he was like out of the truck.
[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:03.820]   Yeah.
[01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:04.820]   Yeah, that's fine.
[01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:07.740]   I'm so glad to see you.
[01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:08.740]   Come next week.
[01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:09.740]   Anytime.
[01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:10.740]   Great to see you.
[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:12.580]   Patrick says he's sorry.
[01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:14.380]   He's taken off with the kid and the dog.
[01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:15.380]   And the dog.
[01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:16.380]   Leave the dog.
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:17.380]   Yeah, I like that dog.
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:18.380]   It's a great dog.
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:20.460]   I like that dog.
[01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:21.460]   Did I get that backwards?
[01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:22.460]   What did I get backwards?
[01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:24.500]   Oh, is women strong?
[01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:25.500]   No, is coffee strong?
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:26.500]   No, I don't know.
[01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:30.740]   Anyway, I like my coffee like I like why my men week and bitter.
[01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:33.740]   That's the one.
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:36.140]   Oh, dear.
[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:37.140]   Oh, dear.
[01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:38.140]   Oh, dear.
[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:39.140]   All right.
[01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:40.140]   What else is in the news?
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:41.140]   Oh, there's so much to talk about.
[01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:42.940]   I don't even know where to start.
[01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:46.900]   AT&T ways higher ways, higher fees for data hogs.
[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:47.900]   We were talking about limits.
[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:48.900]   There's a cap.
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:49.900]   What difference does it make?
[01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:56.300]   AT&T is finalizing a plan that could impose higher fees on big data users subject to the
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:59.540]   rules that may come from federal regulators regarding net neutrality.
[01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:00.940]   Oh, they're just trying to steal.
[01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:04.820]   If the government lets us do it, we will.
[01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:09.100]   See, I can't-- the net neutrality argument has got me bugged because there are arguments
[01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:13.380]   on both sides done by reasonable people that both make sense.
[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:20.660]   But then I go to Plan B, which is to analyze who is on each side of the argument and see
[01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:24.500]   what sleaze balls-- what the sleaze balls are saying.
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:27.020]   And sleaze balls are on both sides of the argument.
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:29.580]   Oh, I hate it when that happens.
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:33.060]   Kyle Lee, how dare they?
[01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:36.460]   This is for the data networks.
[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:42.700]   There's another article that you have in your list, Leo, from a woman who writes over
[01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:46.380]   at CNET about why she chooses 3G over--
[01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:49.060]   I thought that was really interesting.
[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:50.220]   That was really interesting.
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:58.940]   And it kind of plugs into this in that the argument that AT&T and Verizon CEO made last
[01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:05.460]   week was that because they have licensed spectrum and they have to manage that spectrum, this
[01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:07.580]   is not strictly internet.
[01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:11.180]   Before it gets to the internet, it goes over their network that they need the right to
[01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:15.620]   be able to manage their networks pre-internet.
[01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:20.620]   And that makes a certain amount of sense, particularly since they have paid for these
[01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:21.620]   licenses.
[01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:24.980]   Once you get out of the internet, that's open territory.
[01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:28.700]   And they're arguing that they should be allowed to manage that.
[01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:30.660]   I would AT&T's as part of that.
[01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:32.580]   I would buy that if--
[01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:35.340]   See, this is Marguerite Reardon writing.
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:40.340]   If Marguerite's contention that 3G was always better and less congested, then Wi-Fi were
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:41.340]   true.
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:42.900]   But it isn't true.
[01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:44.100]   It's just as congested.
[01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:49.500]   In fact, I think half the problems AT&T suffers, especially in areas where there are lots of
[01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:53.340]   iPhones like San Francisco, is it's just they have too many users and they don't manage
[01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:54.340]   it properly.
[01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:56.340]   I mean, if you do--
[01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:59.060]   Well, I think that, obviously, they're working on it.
[01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:03.500]   They're spending up-team amount of money trying to fix that problem.
[01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:05.740]   And I think I have a prediction.
[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:10.460]   I don't think that AT&T is going to lose the exclusivity next year.
[01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:13.420]   I think they're going to keep it on the iPhone.
[01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:14.420]   And I think you're right.
[01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:18.980]   I don't think you'd see this droid does commercials if Verizon had thought they had any chance
[01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:21.660]   of-- I mean, they're doing a hit piece on the iPhone.
[01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:23.300]   There's no way they're going to get it, obviously.
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:25.780]   If they thought they were going to get it, they wouldn't be doing the hit piece.
[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:26.780]   Right.
[01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:31.940]   And I also think that AT&T has shown to Apple and probably even more than we've seen at
[01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:36.580]   the moment that they're going to attack and solve the problem.
[01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:42.660]   I was in New York a couple of weeks ago, and I had heard about how bad it is there with
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:46.700]   the iPhone, but it was astonishingly bad.
[01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:55.940]   And if putting higher fees on data hogs helps that situation, should they do it?
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:57.260]   Well, there are people.
[01:06:57.260 --> 01:06:58.620]   We all know them.
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:01.580]   We might even be them.
[01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:04.460]   We'll use a lot of data.
[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:07.140]   I think you're in the top of the list.
[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:11.300]   I mean, when I'm blogging, I'm sending photos up, I'm using a lot of data.
[01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:12.300]   You're streaming videos.
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:14.620]   I'm sending different networks simultaneously.
[01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:15.620]   Yeah.
[01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:16.620]   So it's reasonable.
[01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:21.260]   But I pay more than $1,000 a month for upstream bandwidth because of it.
[01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:22.340]   So I don't mind doing that.
[01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:24.580]   And I think it's appropriate for me to do that.
[01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:31.020]   And it'd be kind of unconscionable for me to use my local Comcast to suck off all the
[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:32.020]   bandwidth in the neighborhood.
[01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:35.380]   Well, I got an internet network to run here.
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:38.220]   So we buy special bandwidth for that purpose.
[01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:39.220]   But I think that you're right.
[01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:41.140]   I think there are a lot of people out there who are just...
[01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:44.380]   If there's caps, it doesn't make any sense to me.
[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:45.780]   A caps a cap.
[01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:46.780]   Well, that's what we...
[01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:49.460]   We've had this conversation so many times now.
[01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:50.460]   Tier it.
[01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:51.460]   That's all anybody says.
[01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:52.460]   I hate caps.
[01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:53.460]   Tier the damn thing.
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:54.460]   If you want to have...
[01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:55.460]   That's work for me.
[01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:56.460]   Yeah, tier it.
[01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:58.060]   So Verizon, go ahead.
[01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:01.940]   If you have an iPhone, there's a real...
[01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:04.700]   AT&T has an app that lets you monitor your data usage.
[01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:06.260]   Did it app for that?
[01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:07.260]   There is an app for that.
[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.060]   And you damn well better use it because if you use...
[01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:10.060]   They better use it.
[01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:15.620]   If you use the built-in app as I did in Egypt, get ready to be screwed.
[01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:21.660]   I used the usage stat from the iPhone as AT&T told me to, and it was off by 200%.
[01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:23.820]   Was that this app or...
[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:25.420]   No, wasn't the My Wireless app?
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:28.540]   It was the built-in iPhone usage.
[01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:29.540]   And you're right.
[01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:32.900]   You now you have to use the My Wireless, but the problem is that uses data.
[01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:34.460]   Right, to get it.
[01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:35.460]   You get it.
[01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:36.460]   The phone knows how much data it's used.
[01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:40.020]   I don't understand why I can't trust the phone.
[01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:41.020]   Well this is...
[01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:42.020]   I think that...
[01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:46.180]   I've been using this and I find I use actually less data than I thought I did.
[01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:47.180]   I trust them.
[01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:49.260]   Yeah, five gigs is more than...
[01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:51.820]   I mean, it's not a bad amount of data, right?
[01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:54.020]   Particularly the way you use this phone.
[01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:59.780]   I don't know how the apps work, but my suspicion is that there's some kind of compression with
[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:04.860]   a lot of the apps that allows it to use less data than say if you were just using a straight
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:05.860]   HTTP connection.
[01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:07.860]   Did I say Egypt?
[01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:11.140]   It wasn't Egypt, it was China that I got screwed.
[01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:12.700]   You're all over the world now.
[01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:13.700]   You can't even keep track.
[01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:15.420]   I have no idea where I am right now.
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:17.460]   You did get screwed in China.
[01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:19.420]   Yeah.
[01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:22.140]   And I'm never doing it again.
[01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:23.140]   Great foot rubs though.
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:24.140]   Can I tell you that?
[01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:26.740]   I never had a foot rub there really.
[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:28.300]   You sure it was a foot?
[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:31.100]   Great tea and foot rubs.
[01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:32.100]   So here...
[01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:36.180]   I don't know whether you would classify him as a sleaze bag or not, John.
[01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:45.860]   The Verizon CEO Ivan Seidenberg, speaker at Supercom, says I'm worried about the FCC's
[01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:49.260]   proposal for stricter regulation on net neutrality.
[01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:53.900]   He says, "Proponents of net neutrality have a world view."
[01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:55.180]   Now see if this is you.
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:10:02.860]   Have a world view that network providers and application providers like Google occupy different
[01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:04.460]   parts of the internet.
[01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:05.460]   Huh?
[01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:06.460]   What?
[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:07.460]   What does that mean?
[01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:08.460]   Oh, what does it mean?
[01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:09.460]   I'm glad you asked.
[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:12.260]   Dumb pipes versus smart apps.
[01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:13.260]   What?
[01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:16.260]   This is what he said.
[01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:19.020]   I'm reading it.
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:20.260]   What trucks?
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:24.140]   This is a mistake.
[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:26.380]   This is a mistake pure and simple.
[01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:29.340]   It's an analog idea for a digital world.
[01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:35.420]   It completely understates the need for sound practices and ignores the benefits of smart
[01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:36.420]   networks.
[01:10:36.420 --> 01:10:39.820]   It's actually what you were saying, John, which is a managed network costs more but gives
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:43.380]   you more value for your dollar.
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:49.460]   And the net neutrality prohibits these guys, say, keeps us from doing a managed network.
[01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:51.300]   I would submit that that's not the case.
[01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:52.300]   I don't think so.
[01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:53.300]   I think you can manage.
[01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:54.300]   Bull crap.
[01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:55.300]   Yeah.
[01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:56.300]   You just have to manage fairly.
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:58.420]   You can't prioritize one company.
[01:10:58.420 --> 01:10:59.420]   You can't say I prioritize.
[01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:01.900]   Of course, it depends on the way they write this up.
[01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:05.540]   I think that's the concern a lot of these people have because the government gets involved.
[01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:09.260]   As somebody mentioned in one of the articles I was looking at, John McCain is all upset
[01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:10.260]   about this.
[01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:12.020]   He doesn't use the internet or know what it how it works.
[01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:13.020]   Oh, McCain's really off.
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:14.020]   He's crazy.
[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:17.020]   And so you have a bunch of the government's going to get involved.
[01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:18.020]   They're going to write something.
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:20.900]   If you don't know what they're going to do, the thing, the only concern that I've ever
[01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:30.580]   had and so far as the net neutrality debate is concerned is the idea that I'm Verizon
[01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:36.100]   or I'm AT&T and I decide all of a sudden to do a newspaper at home, as a matter of fact,
[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:37.100]   did this.
[01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:38.260]   They had a content service.
[01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:39.260]   Remember that.
[01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:42.260]   And so you all of a sudden that you're running a content service and then you find that somebody
[01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:46.780]   else like say somebody else does a content service that's directly competitive and you
[01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:48.300]   just screw them.
[01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:49.300]   You shut them a lot.
[01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:50.300]   Well, that's what this is all about.
[01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:51.300]   That's what I thought it was about.
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:52.660]   But apparently there's more to it.
[01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:53.660]   Yeah, no, no, no, no.
[01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:57.540]   But if that's what it's all about, how come right now, for example, the Dvorak Uncensored
[01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:02.580]   blog, Dvorak.org/blog, is like I can't get in half of Russia won't take this thing because
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:07.100]   the ISPs have blocked it because of some software and I still have corporations all over the
[01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:08.100]   country.
[01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:09.100]   Right.
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:10.100]   You guys say, I can't get to your blog.
[01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:11.100]   I said, well, it's why.
[01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:16.580]   This is why they go, everybody's outsourcing some little filtering system that keep porn
[01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:19.420]   from going on the net or whatever.
[01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:21.100]   And I put on the list.
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:25.860]   In fact, there's one company which I'm going to blow right up and market watch if they
[01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:27.100]   never even got back to me.
[01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:30.020]   It's one little ISP in the middle of nowhere.
[01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:32.420]   McCain's bill, the Internet Freedom Act.
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:34.220]   I mean, well, I have a beef, obviously.
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:36.500]   Yeah, I can tell.
[01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:41.060]   McCain's bill, the Internet Freedom Act, basically says the FCC, quote, "The Internet
[01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:46.260]   quote shall not propose promulgator issue any regulations regarding the Internet."
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:48.660]   What does that mean?
[01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:51.780]   Well, that's what they do.
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:58.820]   You're saying the FCC, basically you're saying the FCC cannot in any way talk about the Internet.
[01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:00.620]   Stick with what you know, the TV.
[01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:06.820]   Here's my, I think it comes down to the same arguments you hear all the time from business
[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:10.820]   interests, which is the government's got our hands, it's hands in our pockets.
[01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:12.780]   We don't want to be regulated.
[01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:17.420]   And then this liberals like me who say, "Well, wait a minute, government regulation protects
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:18.500]   everybody."
[01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:19.500]   And your example is very good.
[01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:24.540]   I'll use the example of Skype versus Comcast's voice service.
[01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:28.340]   Comcast is going to take those Skype packets, slow them down just a little bit.
[01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:31.460]   That's why they have deep packets sniffing on all these new routers.
[01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:33.100]   They do it in Canada right now.
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:34.100]   Shaw admits it.
[01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:36.900]   Shaw says, "Yeah, we deprecate Skype packets.
[01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:41.180]   We don't want people using bandwidth for free phone calls."
[01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:44.620]   Comcast could also say, "We don't like BitTorrent because you're getting movies for free.
[01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:45.620]   That's our business."
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:48.020]   So Comcast isn't doing that now, is it?
[01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:49.900]   Well, you're right.
[01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:54.300]   That's the argument people say is, "We'll show us where it's been a problem in the US."
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:56.020]   Comcast is doing deep packet inspection.
[01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:57.380]   They have cut off BitTorrent.
[01:13:57.380 --> 01:14:01.140]   The question is, are they doing it because of data hogs?
[01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:04.140]   Or are they doing it because it hurts their business?
[01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:08.860]   Which reminds me when we're done with this debate, I have Google Voice now.
[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:09.860]   Isn't that cool?
[01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:10.860]   You got it?
[01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:11.860]   Love it.
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:12.860]   Well, there's something.
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:13.860]   No wonder AT&T's all bent out of here.
[01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:14.860]   Yeah.
[01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:15.860]   Yeah.
[01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:16.860]   Cheap phone calls around the world.
[01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:17.860]   Cheap free.
[01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:18.860]   Using data.
[01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:19.860]   Using data.
[01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:20.860]   Yeah.
[01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:21.860]   Instead of...
[01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:22.860]   Well, I know about this.
[01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:25.300]   So if I go right into the real system and it comes out, you can make a phone call in
[01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:26.300]   your own real phone.
[01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:27.300]   There's issues with it.
[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:28.300]   There's a lot of latency.
[01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:29.300]   But nevertheless...
[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:31.140]   I've gotten some pretty good connections.
[01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:32.140]   You're right.
[01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:33.140]   That's why they're scared.
[01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:36.660]   Well, Dwight, give us the other side.
[01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:38.300]   Give us the argument.
[01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:44.100]   Are you saying that it's anticipating a problem that doesn't exist yet?
[01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:50.220]   I think that what people are looking at is the fact that data is exploding and all these
[01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:55.900]   people are saying that as phone conversations and more video goes out over the internet,
[01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:59.940]   they've got to have a way to be able to control it.
[01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:03.580]   The fear is, yeah, that you'll end up choking out your competitors.
[01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:09.100]   And I think if you have regulation that says, you don't do that, I don't think you necessarily
[01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:10.100]   need to over-regulate.
[01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:11.100]   I think you can't...
[01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:12.100]   No, I agree.
[01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:13.100]   Stick to the basics and then you're in good shape.
[01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:17.660]   So we agree that it's possible to write a rule that simply says, "Do not discriminate."
[01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:18.660]   Right.
[01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:24.500]   Now, what's happening is this often occurs in these overheated debates.
[01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:28.860]   You have a lot of people who are starting to kind of see monsters under the bed.
[01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:35.180]   There's a significant part of the conservative blogosphere that is now thinking that net
[01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:38.180]   neutrality is the new fairness doctrine.
[01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:42.420]   It's there worried about being re-instituted and that this is a way they'll get the fairness
[01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:44.580]   doctrine in.
[01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:46.460]   I don't think that that's what's going to happen at all.
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:51.100]   I think you need anything draconian, you just need something simple, but not as simple
[01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:54.460]   on the other side as saying McCain's don't touch anything at all.
[01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:55.460]   That's just...
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:56.460]   That's going a little far.
[01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:57.460]   Hey!
[01:15:57.460 --> 01:15:58.460]   I understand.
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:00.660]   I'm not sure that's on both sides.
[01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:04.460]   Clearly there's an explosion in the use of the internet and companies want to make the
[01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:08.020]   most with Verizon says Steinberg pointed to telemedicine.
[01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:14.820]   He says, "Look, we need to be able to prioritize packets that are transmitting medical monitoring
[01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:19.740]   data over email to make sure they get through the network quickly, but he's afraid that
[01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:21.620]   rules will keep him from doing that."
[01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:24.020]   That's not what anybody is saying.
[01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:26.900]   Nobody's saying you cannot have quality of service.
[01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:28.660]   You're saying it's the opposite.
[01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:33.180]   You can't slow somebody down because you don't like them.
[01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:38.020]   Are those different things or is speeding up medicine traffic the same thing as slowing
[01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:39.020]   down everybody else?
[01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:40.020]   It's two sides of the same argument.
[01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:41.020]   What?
[01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:42.820]   With a positive spin and one with a negative spin.
[01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:45.180]   It's a half a full half empty thing.
[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:46.180]   Yeah.
[01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:50.780]   It's a tough one and that's why maybe you need smarter legislation that takes into account
[01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:53.260]   whose ox is being gored.
[01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:58.620]   If it's telemedicine then the FCC would say, "Well, of course you can prioritize telemedicine."
[01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:04.020]   If it's Skype, the FCC might say, "Well, of course you can't slow down Skype."
[01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:07.380]   Is there a problem right now with telemedicine going telemedicine packets?
[01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:08.380]   Not that I know of.
[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:09.940]   I haven't heard anything about it.
[01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:12.900]   The only problem we've had in the US now, and as I said, I use Canada as an example
[01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:18.140]   because there's been absolute blatant and complete, the telcos there have even admitted
[01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:24.660]   that they do this, that they slow down voiceover IP, they've had no problem admitting it.
[01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:29.500]   In the US, the only example we have was a Comcast doing deep packet inspection interestingly
[01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:33.100]   enough using Canadian software and turning off BitTorrent.
[01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:38.940]   They said to protect the network from bandwidth hogs, some might say, to protect their business
[01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:40.100]   interests.
[01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:42.700]   That's the only example I can think of.
[01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:43.700]   They have stopped doing that.
[01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:44.700]   They have stopped doing it.
[01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:46.980]   Because the FCC said to stop doing it.
[01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:55.660]   They also now have a 256 gigabyte cap, which nobody ever approaches that I know of.
[01:17:55.660 --> 01:18:02.780]   They promised Comcast promised last year in 2008 at this time that they were going to
[01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:09.020]   have a bandwidth meter that would let its customers measure the amount of bandwidth and
[01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:10.020]   it hasn't appeared.
[01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:12.220]   They've not been able to produce it.
[01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:18.660]   I have a bandwidth meter on my machine and I'm on Comcast and I don't know how you can
[01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:20.340]   possibly get to those notes.
[01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:22.820]   People don't use the amount.
[01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:26.260]   In my opinion, the 250 gigabytes of a month, maybe.
[01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:27.620]   A gig a day is a lot.
[01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:31.740]   In my opinion, even if you watch our network all the time, but in my opinion is really
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:33.140]   not about 250.
[01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:38.420]   It's just about having some limit, which they can then lower.
[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:42.660]   Chain, well, or raise.
[01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:44.500]   I want to talk a little bit about Droid.
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:45.500]   We haven't talked about Droid.
[01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:50.020]   We've alluded to it and I'm curious if you know anything about it, Dwight or John, or
[01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:51.580]   have anything to say about it.
[01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:52.580]   I'm intrigued by this.
[01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:53.860]   You know what's interesting about Droid?
[01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:57.100]   When you look at the ads, if you get to see a newspaper ad, if you ever see a newspaper,
[01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:58.100]   I got the Sunday Chronicle.
[01:18:58.100 --> 01:18:59.100]   What's that?
[01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:00.100]   A newspaper?
[01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:01.100]   What is that?
[01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:02.100]   It's like the Sunday paper is so small now.
[01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:07.700]   The areas of the ad, Droid is a registered trademark of Lucas Films.
[01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:09.300]   Used with permission.
[01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:11.220]   Used with permission, yeah.
[01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:13.500]   They paid a little money to them.
[01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:15.260]   I hate those ads.
[01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:16.260]   The Droid ads?
[01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:17.260]   The Droid ads?
[01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:18.260]   The iPhone doesn't?
[01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:19.260]   Yeah.
[01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:20.700]   Well, for several reasons.
[01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:23.900]   Number one, it's extremely geeky.
[01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:26.620]   It's not the kind of ad that's going to appeal.
[01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:28.460]   It says, "I don't do open development."
[01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:32.180]   You notice that your mom knows what open development means.
[01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:33.700]   And then it's all light and happy.
[01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:39.940]   When they come to the product that they want to sell you, it gets dark and ominous.
[01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:40.940]   Droid.
[01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:48.020]   I'm not sure that the mainstream is going to appeal to that.
[01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:49.020]   It's very interesting.
[01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:51.100]   It's obviously aimed at us.
[01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:52.460]   It's aimed at geeks.
[01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:53.460]   I don't run widgets.
[01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:56.420]   I don't have interchangeable batteries.
[01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:59.220]   And then the Droid thing is very saw.
[01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:00.220]   Very scary.
[01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:01.220]   Right.
[01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:02.220]   Yeah.
[01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:03.220]   Yeah.
[01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:07.860]   Don't you wish you had a robot sidekick that moved at light speed?
[01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:10.620]   Could get you out of any problem and lived in your pocket?
[01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:11.620]   I don't know.
[01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:13.620]   A little scary right there.
[01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:14.620]   It's got a creepy--
[01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:17.220]   Is that a delight in your pocket or--
[01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:18.220]   Yeah.
[01:20:18.220 --> 01:20:22.300]   Well, I have to say, in the boy genius report had a hands-on review that made it look very
[01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:25.820]   sexy and it's a good looking phone.
[01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:26.820]   I think it's interesting.
[01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:27.820]   It's taken three years.
[01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:32.180]   But finally-- I don't know why it took so long, but finally Motorola and Nokia coming
[01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:37.460]   up with handsets that at least can give the iPhone a run for its money.
[01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:41.940]   I don't know if they will, but you know, one thing you can't underestimate is 85,000
[01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:43.340]   applications.
[01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:45.620]   That's something nobody else can do.
[01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:51.780]   Although it's-- on the other-- on the flip side, it is 85,000 applications, 99% of them
[01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:52.780]   are crap.
[01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:53.780]   OK.
[01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:57.180]   And finding the good ones is not necessarily easy.
[01:20:57.180 --> 01:20:58.180]   Yeah.
[01:20:58.180 --> 01:21:00.500]   That's a good point.
[01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:06.420]   I mean, if the-- but the Android development-- Android runs Android and Nokia runs MIMO,
[01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:10.660]   which runs any Linux app, you're going to have even more crap, right?
[01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:12.380]   Because you don't have anybody overseeing that.
[01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:17.060]   Apple at least is trying to maintain some standards successfully or not.
[01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:18.060]   I don't know.
[01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:19.060]   Yeah.
[01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:26.580]   Every time somebody says, oh, I like the fact that there are 85,000 apps, the problem
[01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:30.220]   is that's both a good thing and a bad thing.
[01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:32.020]   Very excellent point.
[01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:36.060]   I'm going to take a little break, come back with a little bit more in a bit.
[01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:39.860]   You're listening to "Twit" with Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle, John C. de Vorac
[01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:41.380]   of Channel de Vorac.
[01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:46.380]   I'm Leo Laporte, and I want to talk a little bit about my friends at Squarespace.
[01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:48.100]   You do a great Squarespace ad, John.
[01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:53.460]   I have to say the-- the things-- is that on the tech-- you know, it's about the tech
[01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:54.460]   grouch, are you?
[01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:55.460]   Tech grouch.
[01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:57.820]   But you do a demo of like the Squarespace feature.
[01:21:57.820 --> 01:21:58.820]   I love that.
[01:21:58.820 --> 01:22:00.580]   It's really clever.
[01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:02.380]   In fact, I would like to steal it, but--
[01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:03.700]   You can just do it.
[01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:04.700]   Yeah.
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:05.700]   Here's how it works.
[01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:11.140]   Squarespace.com, it's a web design, a wonderful web design tool, but it's-- you know, really
[01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:17.060]   what it is is web hosting with an amazing content management system behind it.
[01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:19.700]   It's kind of the best of both worlds.
[01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:25.420]   If you go to squarespace.com/twit right now, you can try it free with no credit card or
[01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:28.940]   anything for two weeks.
[01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:34.060]   And I'll tell you, it's a great way to try it because it can import the data directly
[01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:40.260]   from your WordPress or your TypePad, Blog, Blogger.
[01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:42.340]   Get it right in there.
[01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:44.340]   You have the incredible templates.
[01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:45.340]   They're so beautiful.
[01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:48.580]   And then you do is drag and drop with Ajax to build your site.
[01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:50.980]   It's just incredible.
[01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:53.660]   And then if you decide to buy, it says little-- oh, listen.
[01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:55.600]   Squarespace is an exceptional--
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:57.540]   Ooh, Squarespace.
[01:22:57.540 --> 01:23:02.500]   As little as $8 a month for the hosting and the hosting is so good, you'll never, never.
[01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:07.340]   There's no Twit effect because they use virtualized hosting that just gives you bandwidth when
[01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:08.340]   you need it.
[01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:12.980]   If you go to squarespace.com/twit right now and try it, I think you're going to be amazed.
[01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:14.220]   I get emails now every day.
[01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:17.460]   You must too, John, every day from people say, "Hey, I tried Squarespace because you're
[01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:18.460]   talking about it."
[01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:19.460]   You're right.
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:20.460]   This is amazing.
[01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:26.820]   It's the first century web hosting with some of the best templates, the best design stats
[01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:27.820]   and more.
[01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:30.180]   Read all about it at squarespace.com/twit.
[01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:31.580]   Take the tour.

[01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:37.300]   I think you're going to want-- if you're designing a website, I think you're going to want this.
[01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:44.900]   A forum, a photo gallery, a blog, squarespace.com/twit.
[01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:45.900]   You're going to love it.
[01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:48.020]   Give it a try today.
[01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:50.220]   Houston Chronicle hosts your blogs, huh, Dwight?
[01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:53.540]   So you can't really-- you can't freelance out.
[01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:55.500]   Are you there?
[01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:57.100]   Did I lose you?
[01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:59.580]   We don't hear you, Dwight.
[01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:01.340]   Are you sitting on the mute button?
[01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:03.580]   I am sitting on the mute button.
[01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:06.580]   I was communicating with my lovely wife about lasagna, so--
[01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:07.580]   Were you?
[01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:09.340]   Is that what's for dinner?
[01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:10.340]   I'm jealous.
[01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:11.340]   Come on over.
[01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:12.340]   Oh, I love the meat.
[01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:13.340]   You told me to do the wine grouch.
[01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:14.340]   Oh, that'd be good.
[01:24:14.340 --> 01:24:16.220]   Life knows there's going to be one bit.
[01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:17.220]   I only have one joke.
[01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:18.620]   That'd be-- it takes--
[01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:19.620]   It stinks.
[01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:20.620]   Throw the wine out.
[01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:21.540]   Drink more, though.
[01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:23.380]   It stinks.
[01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:24.740]   Drink more, Bordeaux.
[01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:27.700]   You were talking-- John and I were talking about Bordeaux.
[01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:29.540]   This is like the most addictive wine, right?
[01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:30.780]   I mean, this is like how--
[01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:31.420]   No, burgundy.
[01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:32.420]   I'm sorry, burgundy.
[01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:33.420]   Yeah.
[01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:34.460]   I thought you liked bordeaux.
[01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:35.140]   I like bordeaux.
[01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:35.900]   I prefer bordeaux.
[01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:37.980]   I drink bordeaux because I can afford bordeaux.
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:39.740]   Burgundis are only for rich people.
[01:24:39.740 --> 01:24:41.060]   Oh, I misunderstood.
[01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:42.940]   So burgundis, what you want to get into.
[01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:44.220]   Yeah, no, no, you don't want to get into it.
[01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:45.220]   So I thought I tried.
[01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:46.300]   Because they're extremely addictive.
[01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:47.940]   Sorry, I'm ready to be like the hunter-ish Thompson
[01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:48.820]   of podcasting.
[01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:51.620]   And you start drinking these burgundis.
[01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:53.340]   If you get the good ones, the trouble with burgundy
[01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:54.380]   is that there's a very--
[01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:55.740]   You have to know it's a game.
[01:24:55.740 --> 01:24:56.940]   You have to know what to get because it's really
[01:24:56.940 --> 01:24:58.260]   most of it's crummy.
[01:24:58.260 --> 01:24:59.340]   But the ones--
[01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:01.220]   You could do the wine grouch.
[01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:02.580]   I could do the wine grouch.
[01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:05.060]   I think I'm doing the wine grouch now.
[01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:06.060]   So--
[01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:06.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:09.260]   Yes, you don't get much bang for your buck,
[01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:10.060]   but they're very--
[01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:10.700]   It's a segment.
[01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:14.900]   There's certain burgundis that are just incredibly compelling.
[01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:16.180]   I've got to try some.
[01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:18.260]   Actually, maybe there's a listener.
[01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:19.220]   Hurst.
[01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:20.100]   He could come--
[01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:21.380]   You know, we should get him on the show.
[01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:22.420]   The problem is he clams up.
[01:25:22.420 --> 01:25:22.820]   Yeah, he does.
[01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:23.340]   He clams up.
[01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:24.860]   But now he's no longer like--
[01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:27.060]   He's like a normal clam up this time.
[01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:27.500]   He could talk.
[01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:29.620]   He can give you the burgundy tips
[01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:31.260]   because he's a collector.
[01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:32.220]   Let's get Will up here.
[01:25:32.220 --> 01:25:33.860]   We'll do a burgundy show.
[01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:34.420]   OK.
[01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:35.820]   Could you get Gary V on?
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:37.820]   Or would that be too much?
[01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:40.420]   I like Gary, but he's a little too high energy for me.
[01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:41.420]   It makes me--
[01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:42.020]   I watch him.
[01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:42.780]   I get tired.
[01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:51.340]   Amazon says Windows 7 was the biggest pre-order of all time.
[01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:52.340]   Not surprising.
[01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:53.180]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:54.420]   Did you see Amazon's results?
[01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:55.820]   Unbelievable.
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:57.420]   Holy cow.
[01:25:57.420 --> 01:25:58.420]   I just thought--
[01:25:58.420 --> 01:25:59.900]   This is an example of a company that
[01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:03.180]   went public because they could go public in an era
[01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:06.220]   that it was easy to go public before Sarbanes Oxley.
[01:26:06.220 --> 01:26:08.660]   And now we have one of the great retailers of the world,
[01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:10.100]   amazon.com.
[01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:11.580]   It's a very successful company.
[01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:12.940]   Then very well for itself.
[01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:17.180]   And we have not seen anything like this since Sarbanes Oxley
[01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:21.300]   came out in 2002 and pretty much put the key-bosh on anybody.
[01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:23.260]   Do you think that's keeping somebody from competing
[01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:24.260]   with Amazon?
[01:26:24.260 --> 01:26:25.260]   I think I--
[01:26:25.260 --> 01:26:26.460]   You can't raise the money?
[01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:28.340]   With Google, your small company is
[01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:29.940]   trying to compete with somebody like, let's say,
[01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:31.340]   Google, another search engine.
[01:26:31.340 --> 01:26:33.980]   You can't raise enough money to stay in business.
[01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:35.420]   Not with an IPO, but just with VCs
[01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:37.060]   because the VCs have no exit.
[01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:37.540]   Right.
[01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:39.460]   And it won't give you any money because without the exit,
[01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:41.420]   what good is it except to sell to Google?
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:43.500]   The whole thing is in the toilet,
[01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:46.460]   and it's all because of Sarbanes Oxley.
[01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:49.940]   And Sarbanes Oxley was created after the Enron scandal
[01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:51.420]   that required better reporting.
[01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:53.900]   And if you really look at Sarbanes Oxley and the Enron
[01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:55.620]   scandal and reverse engineering,
[01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:56.860]   it wouldn't have done anything.
[01:26:56.860 --> 01:26:58.140]   Wouldn't have helped.
[01:26:58.140 --> 01:26:59.140]   Well, there is an example.
[01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:02.140]   If you want to do an argument against net neutrality,
[01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:04.100]   the law of unintended consequences--
[01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:07.740]   sometimes you pass a law with the best intentions,
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:09.540]   but the regulation can kill you.
[01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:12.540]   Yeah, which is one of the arguments against the net
[01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:13.340]   neutrality force.
[01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:14.740]   And that's actually big.
[01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:15.460]   I understand that.
[01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:16.460]   Yeah.
[01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:17.460]   I'm kind of sitting there.
[01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:18.500]   Well, there were arguments at the time
[01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:22.500]   that Sarbanes Oxley was proposed and debated
[01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:24.980]   that the exact things that we're seeing now
[01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:26.540]   what happened did happen.
[01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:27.540]   Nobody listened.
[01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:28.220]   Right.
[01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:29.100]   No, we listened.
[01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:33.140]   But the thing is with the current VC climate,
[01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:37.780]   there are companies that still emerge that are small
[01:27:37.780 --> 01:27:40.220]   and that find favor because what they do is good.
[01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:42.380]   And the best example of that is Twitter.
[01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:43.820]   Right.
[01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:44.660]   But they're small.
[01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:46.060]   And that's the key.
[01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:50.260]   You can't do an Amazon because it's so capital intensive.
[01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:52.500]   What do the Amazon do with all that IPO money?
[01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:55.940]   They build distribution centers everywhere.
[01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:57.340]   Physical-- physical plants.
[01:27:57.340 --> 01:27:59.740]   Physical plants, which Twitter doesn't need to do that.
[01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:01.500]   So yeah, you can have a small web company.
[01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:03.700]   Yeah, but Twitter is something that can be cloned easily.
[01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:04.540]   Well, exactly.
[01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:06.500]   That's the point is that you're not going to get somebody--
[01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:07.500]   Right.
[01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:08.500]   Nobody has.
[01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:10.900]   Nobody has because they look at Twitter and say,
[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:12.740]   well, this is just a money drain.
[01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:13.980]   There's not making any money yet.
[01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:14.820]   There's no money to be made.
[01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:17.220]   So why would anyone want to clone it?
[01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:18.140]   If somebody comes out--
[01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:19.140]   That's so powerful.
[01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:21.340]   --I guarantee if somebody comes up with some way of really
[01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:25.820]   making a ton of money like Google did out of Twitter,
[01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:28.140]   then you'll start to see Microsoft will do it.
[01:28:28.140 --> 01:28:29.340]   Well, that's what I've been waiting for.
[01:28:29.340 --> 01:28:31.540]   I should spend ways to put about a money exchanged
[01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:34.260]   in the deals with Google and Bing and Facebook.
[01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:35.500]   I think there was some cash there.
[01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:38.900]   It was interesting because Twitter said,
[01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:41.580]   use the word sold, the information.
[01:28:41.580 --> 01:28:43.860]   Facebook was very clear to point out
[01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:46.220]   that there was no money exchanged.
[01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:48.180]   So I don't think Facebook made any money.
[01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:50.740]   But of course, Facebook makes plenty of money on advertising.
[01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:53.340]   They've had a net positive this year,
[01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:55.140]   mostly because of Zynga.
[01:28:55.140 --> 01:28:56.020]   You play Farmville?
[01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:58.380]   Do you know about Farmville?
[01:28:58.380 --> 01:28:58.940]   I don't.
[01:28:58.940 --> 01:28:59.940]   I had to start.
[01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:00.420]   Farmville.
[01:29:00.420 --> 01:29:02.260]   Are you on Facebook, Dwight?
[01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:05.220]   I am on Facebook, but I'm a real--
[01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:07.940]   Get off my lawn, the kind of guy on Facebook.
[01:29:07.940 --> 01:29:09.580]   I don't let--
[01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:12.340]   I don't do any of the apps, and I don't--
[01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:14.860]   I don't friend anybody who isn't really my friend.
[01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:17.300]   So I stay away from that stuff.
[01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:18.300]   I don't want to--
[01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:19.380]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:20.900]   See it in terms.
[01:29:20.900 --> 01:29:23.260]   So I have a 4-ack in training on Facebook.
[01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:25.100]   I started playing this game Farmville.
[01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:25.980]   Zynga is the company.
[01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:28.580]   Zynga recently was estimated they're
[01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:31.700]   making $150 million a year on Facebook apps.
[01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:33.940]   They have Yoville, Farmville.
[01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:36.980]   As far as I know, the mafia wars, they have a few others.
[01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:38.020]   They are--
[01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:41.260]   this is an interesting lifecycle on here.
[01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:43.380]   Somebody is just using Facebook,
[01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:45.100]   and they see their friends using Farmville.
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:48.180]   Because all of these post updates into the newsfeed.
[01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:51.460]   So you see, oh, Leo just found a black pig in Farmville,
[01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:53.220]   and it goes up, and there's a cute little picture.
[01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:53.980]   So they go, oh, what's that?
[01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:54.740]   They click it.
[01:29:54.740 --> 01:29:56.100]   They kind of start playing with it.
[01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:57.740]   Just kind of futzing around pretty soon.
[01:29:57.740 --> 01:29:58.980]   They're addicted.
[01:29:58.980 --> 01:29:59.820]   And I was that way.
[01:29:59.820 --> 01:30:01.060]   You can't stop.
[01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:02.980]   I'm starting to check in a Facebook 10 times a day
[01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:05.540]   to make sure that I have harvested my artichokes.
[01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:07.940]   And that the lambs don't need milches effect.
[01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:08.980]   This is effect.
[01:30:08.980 --> 01:30:10.060]   This is pathetic.
[01:30:10.060 --> 01:30:11.100]   This is effect.
[01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:12.940]   It was horrible.
[01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:14.940]   It was a horrible job.
[01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:19.540]   So finally, and it has all the social engineering,
[01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:22.420]   because you trade with your friends, you give them gifts.
[01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:23.940]   You can-- and here's their smart moves.
[01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:25.660]   Zynga made a very smart move.
[01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:28.900]   Pretty soon you start buying social objects.
[01:30:28.900 --> 01:30:30.980]   This is the new economy.
[01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:34.900]   You give them actual money so that you can have fake Farmville
[01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:40.380]   money so that you can buy a fake fence or a fake pig.
[01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:42.260]   And it's somehow compelling people.
[01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:44.380]   And they're spending a lot of money on this stuff.
[01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:47.100]   There was a bunch of a massive multiplayer
[01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:49.020]   online games that did this kind of thing.
[01:30:49.020 --> 01:30:50.300]   Be sure to write that.
[01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:51.940]   And people would start to accumulate things.
[01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:55.100]   And they'd sell their city to somebody else on--
[01:30:55.100 --> 01:30:56.820]   Second life is an example.
[01:30:56.820 --> 01:30:58.300]   World of Warcraft.
[01:30:58.300 --> 01:30:58.820]   World of Warcraft.
[01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:00.700]   And they'd do it through Craigslist.
[01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:02.220]   Gold farming.
[01:31:02.220 --> 01:31:05.220]   One of my kids was wanted to buy something like that.
[01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:08.300]   So I think I'd like to catch up and get a whole city
[01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:09.300]   of little peasants.
[01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:10.060]   What did you say?
[01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:11.060]   I said no.
[01:31:11.060 --> 01:31:12.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:16.100]   Chad, I thought you were like the permissive guy.
[01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:17.460]   Not when they're spending money on--
[01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:18.460]   Really money.
[01:31:18.460 --> 01:31:20.420]   --virtual nothing.
[01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:22.460]   Well, this is a big part of the economy now.
[01:31:22.460 --> 01:31:23.980]   And if you create an addictive game,
[01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:27.460]   it really is-- it's a little cynical if you ask me.
[01:31:27.460 --> 01:31:30.340]   The CEO was at the Web 2.0 conference this week
[01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:32.660]   in San Francisco talking about this.
[01:31:32.660 --> 01:31:35.380]   And they create these addictive games
[01:31:35.380 --> 01:31:36.180]   that have these cycles.
[01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:37.620]   And then there's always another one,
[01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:39.500]   because it's only about a month.
[01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:41.700]   I finally deleted it.
[01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:46.940]   At one point, I got enough self-worth into it.
[01:31:46.940 --> 01:31:48.820]   I said, OK, I'm good enough.
[01:31:48.820 --> 01:31:50.660]   I don't need Farmville.
[01:31:50.660 --> 01:31:52.300]   And I deleted it.
[01:31:52.300 --> 01:31:53.100]   Oh, man.
[01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:54.380]   I feel like I have a new life.
[01:31:54.380 --> 01:31:56.780]   I have time for my friends, my family.
[01:31:56.780 --> 01:31:58.260]   I talk again.
[01:31:58.260 --> 01:31:59.300]   How much did you spend?
[01:31:59.300 --> 01:31:59.940]   Did you spend?
[01:31:59.940 --> 01:32:02.580]   No, I didn't fall for that.
[01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:03.860]   No, but then they have-- oh, well,
[01:32:03.860 --> 01:32:06.620]   I almost fell for something, because they have partners
[01:32:06.620 --> 01:32:10.460]   who, if you click enough, links will give you some gold.
[01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:12.220]   So you start down this path.
[01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:14.260]   They say, you know, $20 free gold dollars.
[01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:15.860]   And you can't, by the way, you need a lot of money
[01:32:15.860 --> 01:32:17.060]   to build a bigger farm.
[01:32:17.060 --> 01:32:18.660]   And I really wanted a bigger farm.
[01:32:18.660 --> 01:32:20.180]   $20 free gold dollars.
[01:32:20.180 --> 01:32:22.260]   But you just have to click these few offers.
[01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:24.020]   Pretty soon they're asking you for your sell number.
[01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:25.100]   You go, OK, whatever.
[01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:27.260]   It's a 10-year text, OK, whatever.
[01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:29.860]   It was just a matter of time before it, a $20 a month bill
[01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:31.900]   from somebody I didn't even know I was doing it.
[01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:34.020]   Yeah, it stayed away from the burgundy, for sure.
[01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:36.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:38.860]   You're right.
[01:32:38.860 --> 01:32:40.060]   I have an addictive personality.
[01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:42.500]   So Geo City's closes tomorrow.
[01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:43.020]   Yeah.
[01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:46.180]   Should we have a moment of silence for the old Geo City's?
[01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:47.140]   It's kind of sad.
[01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:50.100]   It was like I remember everybody talking about it back in '98.
[01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:52.460]   It was the free web hosting, right?
[01:32:52.460 --> 01:32:53.140]   Yeah, kind of.
[01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:55.820]   Yahoo decided to pull the plug.
[01:32:55.820 --> 01:33:00.340]   Tomorrow, if you have a site on Geo City's,
[01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:02.940]   you might want to download that great-looking site.
[01:33:02.940 --> 01:33:04.620]   Yeah, right.
[01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:08.380]   Take one screenshot of it and forget about it.
[01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:10.540]   There's a lot of links that point back to there.
[01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:11.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:13.500]   There's a lot of historical data on there.
[01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:14.420]   And if you--
[01:33:14.420 --> 01:33:15.180]   Archive.org.
[01:33:15.180 --> 01:33:15.700]   They're going to delete it.
[01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:17.420]   They're not just going to decommission it.
[01:33:17.420 --> 01:33:18.740]   They're deleting it.
[01:33:18.740 --> 01:33:22.020]   And that'll be a lot of information law.
[01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:23.980]   Archive.org.
[01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:25.820]   Well, it'll always be-- you can always go back and look,
[01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:26.540]   I guess.
[01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:29.820]   It says, what if I don't save my files and images?
[01:33:29.820 --> 01:33:31.740]   If you do not download your files and images
[01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:33.820]   before October 26, you will no longer
[01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:35.620]   be able to access that data.
[01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:37.980]   After October 26, your Geo City's files
[01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:39.500]   will be deleted from our servers
[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:42.820]   and will not be recoverable in italics.
[01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:45.260]   So is it too late to put up a Geo City site?
[01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:46.380]   Yeah, you can't sign up.
[01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:48.380]   Unless you have an account still.
[01:33:48.380 --> 01:33:49.580]   If you have an account, wouldn't it
[01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:51.860]   be good to put up like a goodbye Geo City's site?
[01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:52.780]   There's something.
[01:33:52.780 --> 01:33:56.780]   I mean, I don't remember any great Geo City sites.
[01:33:56.780 --> 01:33:57.780]   They were all kind of--
[01:33:57.780 --> 01:33:59.140]   I didn't think I ever signed up for it.
[01:33:59.140 --> 01:33:59.820]   I never did.
[01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:00.300]   I don't think--
[01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:01.460]   It's like Tripod.
[01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:03.300]   Whatever happened to Tripod?
[01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:03.700]   Somebody called them.
[01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:05.740]   I think Tripod is still there, actually.
[01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:07.060]   You're kidding.
[01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:08.340]   I think so.
[01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:08.980]   Oh, yeah, it is.
[01:34:08.980 --> 01:34:10.700]   Tripod.lycos.com.
[01:34:10.700 --> 01:34:13.140]   Whatever happened to Lycos?
[01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:14.820]   Who owns Lycos these days?
[01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:15.320]   No.
[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:15.660]   So good.
[01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:17.580]   Everybody on Geo City's moved to Tripod.
[01:34:17.580 --> 01:34:20.020]   You won't have to do this again for those six months.
[01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:21.380]   No, that's six months.
[01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:21.900]   Yeah.
[01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:24.100]   Who-- Lycos?
[01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:26.140]   Who-- Lycos?
[01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:28.300]   They're still in business?
[01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:30.060]   Apparently, their public relations department's
[01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:33.260]   not doing a very good job.
[01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:35.540]   Yeah, they have the ads with the dog, right?
[01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:36.460]   Whether the dog would--
[01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:37.660]   That's the information.
[01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:39.340]   Go get it.
[01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:39.620]   Right.
[01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:40.380]   That was dog pile.
[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:41.460]   The dog's still there.
[01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:42.860]   The dog's still there.
[01:34:42.860 --> 01:34:45.180]   Lycos is one of the original and most widely known
[01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:48.060]   internet net brands in the world.
[01:34:48.060 --> 01:34:49.900]   Altavista is still there, too.
[01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:53.220]   In fact, I still use the translation thing sometimes.
[01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:56.700]   Lycos is owned by a Korean search and internet portal
[01:34:56.700 --> 01:35:01.420]   called Dialm, D-A-U-M.
[01:35:01.420 --> 01:35:04.340]   OK, well, this trip back in time brought to you
[01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:10.780]   by the letters A and Z. Well, goodbye, Geo City's.
[01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:12.660]   We hardly knew he--
[01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:13.500]   It's been real.
[01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:14.420]   It's been real.
[01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:18.380]   1995 to 2009.
[01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:21.940]   1995 and internet years is like infinity.
[01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:22.860]   That's forever.
[01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:23.860]   Yeah.
[01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:26.660]   It's not that long ago.
[01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:29.260]   Most of the sites look like they were designed in 1999.
[01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:31.300]   They do exactly.
[01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:35.500]   Upgrade your geek, says Dwight Silverman.
[01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:35.980]   Netbooks.
[01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:36.900]   From 1995.
[01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:37.860]   Yeah.
[01:35:37.860 --> 01:35:41.140]   Netbooks are a scourge on the PC business.
[01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:43.780]   Do you think so?
[01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:47.940]   I was riffing off a Joe Wilcox post, where he was kind of talking
[01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:50.700]   about how Apple--
[01:35:50.700 --> 01:35:52.820]   with Apple's release of its hardware
[01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:55.100]   that they were thumbing their nose at the PC business
[01:35:55.100 --> 01:36:00.100]   and showing why the margins are so great for Apple and so bad
[01:36:00.100 --> 01:36:01.620]   for the rest of the industry.
[01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:05.220]   And I was basically saying that things like netbooks
[01:36:05.220 --> 01:36:10.060]   and kind of this price war spiral essentially
[01:36:10.060 --> 01:36:13.300]   are cutting margins in the business enough
[01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:16.660]   that it makes it more difficult for them to innovate
[01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:19.180]   and to do things that make their costs better.
[01:36:19.180 --> 01:36:20.820]   And yet people want netbooks.
[01:36:20.820 --> 01:36:22.740]   They really do.
[01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:24.660]   Well, they want them until they have them.
[01:36:24.660 --> 01:36:28.660]   I think people buy them and go, oh, great.
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:30.740]   A $250 computer.
[01:36:30.740 --> 01:36:32.260]   And then when they get them and try
[01:36:32.260 --> 01:36:34.220]   to do anything more than just check their email,
[01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:35.900]   they get really frustrated with them.
[01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:38.740]   I think if you buy them and you know what you're getting
[01:36:38.740 --> 01:36:41.180]   and that's what you're going to do is just check your email
[01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:44.460]   and check your GeoCities site.
[01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:46.340]   I think you'll be happy with it.
[01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:48.300]   But the problem is people want to do more
[01:36:48.300 --> 01:36:50.140]   with their computers than that.
[01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:54.660]   And if that's all you buy that machine for, you'll be fine.
[01:36:54.660 --> 01:36:58.380]   But chances are you're going to want to do more with it later.
[01:36:58.380 --> 01:36:59.260]   Dwight's a great read.
[01:36:59.260 --> 01:37:01.740]   You've got to go to his website, his blog.
[01:37:01.740 --> 01:37:06.220]   It's blogs.cron.com/techblog.
[01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:09.460]   And he does the tech links as well every day.
[01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:14.100]   And I have to confess I steal those every week for Twit.
[01:37:14.100 --> 01:37:16.380]   That's why I put them up there for theft.
[01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:18.300]   They're a great resource.
[01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:19.460]   I steal them, so.
[01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:21.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:21.340 --> 01:37:22.100]   You may as well.
[01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:23.540]   You're just helping the link economy.
[01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:24.820]   It's always great to have you on, Dwight.
[01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:25.660]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:26.420]   I really appreciate it.
[01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:27.140]   Thanks for having us.
[01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:29.460]   Go enjoy your lasagna in peace.
[01:37:29.460 --> 01:37:30.460]   You can forget all this.
[01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:31.420]   John C. de Vorac is at--
[01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:32.340]   John C. de Vorac.
[01:37:32.340 --> 01:37:33.900]   --nomjealous.
[01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:36.540]   John C. de Vorac is at channeldevorac.com.
[01:37:36.540 --> 01:37:38.540]   And of course, de Vorac.org/blog.
[01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:40.100]   If it's not censored at your company.
[01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:41.020]   Well, it is censored.
[01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:41.940]   This is the problem.
[01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:43.860]   It's because it has the word uncensored.
[01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:45.780]   Idiotic.
[01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:47.380]   As soon as they see uncensored, they go into--
[01:37:47.380 --> 01:37:49.180]   Yeah, this is how deep they go into these.
[01:37:49.180 --> 01:37:50.500]   People do a lot of research.
[01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:51.020]   They don't have time.
[01:37:51.020 --> 01:37:52.460]   Oh, it's got a funny name for it.
[01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:52.900]   It's a big internet.
[01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:53.900]   It's a big internet.
[01:37:53.900 --> 01:37:54.740]   It's a big internet.
[01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:56.260]   Anyway, de Vorac.org/blog.
[01:37:56.260 --> 01:38:00.180]   de Vorac.org/-- I'm sorry, channeldevorac.com
[01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:01.780]   has links to everything else I do,
[01:38:01.780 --> 01:38:02.820]   and that's kind of what it is.
[01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:03.900]   It's a nexus.
[01:38:03.900 --> 01:38:06.140]   Although the tech grudge isn't on there.
[01:38:06.140 --> 01:38:06.940]   What?
[01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:07.660]   He shouldn't be on there.
[01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:09.540]   The tech grudge is not really me.
[01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:11.140]   Oh, of course.
[01:38:11.140 --> 01:38:14.100]   So yes, you need a friends and family link role.
[01:38:14.100 --> 01:38:15.340]   Yeah, maybe.
[01:38:15.340 --> 01:38:16.580]   Something where you could say.
[01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:18.700]   I am not the tech grudge, but if I were,
[01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:21.300]   I would say watch it or something like that.
[01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:21.980]   Recommended.
[01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:22.700]   Recommended.
[01:38:22.700 --> 01:38:23.940]   There you go.
[01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:24.780]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:26.220]   I recommend-- now, people are asking me
[01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:28.060]   because we mentioned that we were going to have a video,
[01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:29.700]   and we are working on it.
[01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:31.900]   As usual, rollouts take a little longer than I thought,
[01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:35.340]   but the new Roku's are on the way.
[01:38:35.340 --> 01:38:37.860]   The Media Flies platform is up and running.
[01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:40.900]   We are recording video of every show and editing it.
[01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:44.220]   You will find video in the next week or so of all our show--
[01:38:44.220 --> 01:38:47.700]   or at least at the top five to start.
[01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:48.580]   Twig, Twiff.
[01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:54.380]   Twit.
[01:38:54.380 --> 01:38:57.740]   Windows Weekly, Mac Break Weekly.
[01:38:57.740 --> 01:38:59.060]   I don't know what happened with those last two.
[01:38:59.060 --> 01:39:01.140]   I guess we got tired of Twizz.
[01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:03.580]   We'll be up on a video, and then most of the rest of the shows
[01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:06.140]   assume thereafter on iTunes, but also on your Roku,
[01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:10.300]   your popcorn hour, your Yahoo TV, your iPhone, your pre,
[01:39:10.300 --> 01:39:12.700]   your Android, everything, everywhere you want to be,
[01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:13.580]   that's where we'll be.
[01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:16.500]   And you'll look, oh, god, I can't get rid of these guys.
[01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:18.740]   Meanwhile, though, keep listening to the audio version
[01:39:18.740 --> 01:39:23.380]   at iTunes or the Zoom Store and join us live as we broadcast.
[01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:24.620]   You're looking at me funny.
[01:39:24.620 --> 01:39:26.260]   I was going to say there's this new show you're going to do.
[01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:28.140]   I understand this week in role playing.
[01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:29.180]   Torp.
[01:39:29.180 --> 01:39:31.020]   I like it.
[01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:32.380]   I like it.
[01:39:32.380 --> 01:39:33.140]   Damn, let me write that down.
[01:39:33.140 --> 01:39:34.380]   I want to be a guest.
[01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:35.660]   Yeah, but you can't be yourself.
[01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:37.180]   You'll have to be the Tech Gratcher somebody.
[01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:38.140]   I don't know.
[01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:39.500]   All right, I'll be funny.
[01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:43.260]   We do the whole show as somebody else.
[01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:44.140]   It'll be funny.
[01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:44.500]   I like that.
[01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:45.780]   I'm sure I can book the Tech Gratcher.
[01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:49.020]   Maybe on April Fool's we'll do Torp instead of Twit.
[01:39:49.020 --> 01:39:50.660]   That would be a lot of fun.
[01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:55.340]   We do this show alive every Sunday afternoon or evening,
[01:39:55.340 --> 01:39:58.540]   6 p.m., Eastern 3 p.m., Pacific.
[01:39:58.540 --> 01:40:02.420]   And now they've changed summertime in Europe.
[01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:03.860]   I guess UTC never changes.
[01:40:03.860 --> 01:40:07.060]   So it's still 2,200 UTC.
[01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:08.180]   I don't have to worry about it.
[01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:11.340]   But in a couple of weeks when we changed to wintertime,
[01:40:11.340 --> 01:40:11.620]   we're going to--
[01:40:11.620 --> 01:40:12.420]   I hate that change.
[01:40:12.420 --> 01:40:13.900]   I hate that change.
[01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:15.340]   Hate it.
[01:40:15.340 --> 01:40:17.060]   That's something we could--
[01:40:17.060 --> 01:40:20.420]   Have you and Adam talked about that on Noah Gen.
[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:23.380]   It seems like some conspiracy there.
[01:40:23.380 --> 01:40:24.780]   It seems like there's--
[01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:25.460]   It might be.
[01:40:25.460 --> 01:40:26.300]   It's Ben Franklin's--
[01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:26.940]   Aliens.
[01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:27.580]   Yeah, aliens.
[01:40:27.580 --> 01:40:28.220]   --introduced it.
[01:40:28.220 --> 01:40:28.740]   Yeah.
[01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:31.060]   Ben Franklin was definitely an alien.
[01:40:31.060 --> 01:40:32.260]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:33.580]   We'll see you next time on The Trits.
[01:40:33.580 --> 01:40:34.580]   It's amazing.
[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:35.300]   He's in the can.
