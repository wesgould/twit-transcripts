[00:01:51.520 --> 00:02:02.560]   It's time for Twit. This weekend tech the last show of 2018. And lo and behold it's a
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.560]   Christmas miracle. We have an amazing panel for you. I'm going to start with the guy who's
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.680]   not here. But boy we wish he was in his Philadelphia Flyers triumph shirt and his Superman mug
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.280]   Owen green beard. Is that your actual beard? Owen JJ Stone?
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.320]   I'm the Grinch this stole Twitmas. And yes, this is green.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:31.200]   You're tired green for the holiday? I got a green for the show. And I tried to do red the
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.120]   other day came out pink. So green works. You look like a shoe pick gone wrong. You look like a
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.320]   smurf that got turned upside down. I don't know. Oh, I do have a blue beard. I did look like a
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.080]   smurf. I told people to pop a sperm as my uncle and people don't understand my race.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.760]   We check out my Instagram. You can see a picture of me at the sixth game. I was dancing with the
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.680]   cheerleaders and stuff. Everybody loved in the building. I got on TV. Everybody loved a blue
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.360]   beard. So hopefully this green beard works out for Owen has a mug. We don't know what's in the
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.280]   mug, but we will be pouring something a little later on that you could put in your mug.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.400]   If I could just get it to you fast enough. Also with me in studio Alex Lindsey of the pixel. Oh,
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.880]   my you are looking dapper. I'm in the mood. I'm always wearing a velvet smoking jacket.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.560]   Little what is that? I know it is. It's velvet. It's quite nice. It's it's I. So this is our
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.600]   holiday show. I know I know I'm going to do the, you know, the big stories of the year and kind of
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.840]   celebrate and we're getting a little festive. And my God, I can't believe it really is a Christmas
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.120]   miracle in studio with us for the first time. I think in almost three years, John C. D. Warack.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.520]   Is it? How long has it been? This is bad. Yes. Freeway is big still being worked on.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.560]   Yes. It hasn't changed one bit.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.480]   The studio has moved. We did move. Did somebody tell you?
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:57.440]   Festa boot. This is a bold season. It's a bold team. The Appalachian national champions.
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.560]   Here's the thing. I remember you wore that before. This is not the first time I've seen this.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.320]   Yeah. This is where they're back to back. The reason I had to come back on the show,
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.280]   yes, where's the camera looking at me, is that we're telling you that from a
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.760]   story about this show that was important to me was I could do call outs to these various
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.960]   colleges that won win bold right and somebody from the school sent you that would send me one of
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:27.120]   the jerseys. So what do you need? What do you need this year? Valdosta state. Valdosta state,
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.440]   ladies and gentlemen. They won as a division two championship. Nobody, you know, the West Coast
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.360]   News where they are. I wear these things at the Brown like I go to the grocery store, somebody
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.200]   says, "What are you from there?" You go to this, "No, I went to Berkeley, but I like to wear a
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.840]   thing that some winner instead of the Berkeley calist that they can't win anything."
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.720]   Well, they say, "Go armadillos. What is the Valdosta state?" It looks like it looks like the Valdosta
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:05:00.320]   state from what I can tell appears to be a building. It's the Valdosta state gymnasium.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.240]   Yes. Yeah. Something like that.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.160]   Anyway, it's John, we missed you so much. I'm glad to have you here. And the reason I think we were
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.000]   able to get John and I know is the reason we got Alex in studio is this. I brought my suitcase
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.520]   full of booze. I thought it'd be kind of fun for this episode. We usually have Jaeger, myster,
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.320]   and I didn't think Jaeger would really bring out. Jaeger's a good product. I would definitely
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.720]   not go for Jaeger. Jaeger's a good product. Yeah, it is.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.440]   If you like it with the first liquors? Well, it has to be half frozen. Yeah, we have frozen
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.560]   Jaeger. I think it's been in the freezer since the last time. I remember it. I've never had a
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.160]   significant amount of Jaeger without having a stern conversation with a police officer.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.680]   So I prefer to... I stopped drinking. I don't know what this stuff is going to do to you. This is
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.720]   Louis the Apple presentation of Blicker. Oh my god, is this crazy women? I think I have to take it.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.720]   Do I have to take it out of here to get it open? It's actually got instructions.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.680]   I knew you were going to push it off the back. You need two hands. Yeah, like we got to brace it.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.680]   It's going to come off the back.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:05.520]   Whoa! Yo, you're freaking me out. I'm 2,000 miles away. If you're listening, you're missing a lot of...
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:12.160]   John says... Oh, I did it. Open up my kayak. John says... I only close it again.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.200]   John says the bottle is more expensive than the liquor. It's a bacara crystal or something.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.240]   Whoa. And it just comes open on its own. It's how to get it out of it.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.680]   You're just making a mess. There you go. There we go.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:32.720]   That should be okay. How do you get it out of here? Pull it up straight up. Just yank it. Pull it.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:38.320]   It's only worth 3,000 dollars. It's got a necklace. Yeah, pull it. Who lets children play with liquor?
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:44.080]   What is going on? And it's got a special crystal plapper. I don't think it's an idiot.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.400]   A plastic plapper because... Yeah, there's a... Because we're going to drink it all.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.360]   So what you've had this before, John, what's the story here? It's one of... There's a mirror in the box.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.440]   It's there... See yourself drinking it. Makes it look like there's more of it there.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.400]   It's the version... I would say the equivalent... The equivalent originally was something like
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.000]   along the lines of... I can't... No, when was it bought? Of Paradis from Hennessey. But then
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.200]   Pare... Hennessey upped the ante with this thing called Richard, which is like five grand.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:19.520]   Oh, this is not that expensive. So the idea is that this... The reason I was intrigued by this is they
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:26.400]   said that the people who started this cognac are dead. They will never taste it. It's 100 years of
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:34.160]   cognac makers contributing their little part to it. Is that right? Well, I'm thinking this was
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.120]   probably averaging 40 years. Maybe there's some older stuff in there. They throw it in there.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.960]   Maybe they were very old when they start. If you get blended of a bunch of
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:48.240]   barrels of cognac, maybe they say, "Hey, we're about to release it, so I'm afraid you're gonna have to go."
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.680]   Oh my god, look at that. No, they shoot him. So John, anyone...
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:58.720]   He's like, "Get that out of Leo's hand." This is actually... We throw this out. This is nice.
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.200]   Keep it. You've got something better. So they'll get a glass thing. Give him the glass thing. He
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:08.960]   might need it. So I actually went out, Owen and Bought. I was going to use the Superman mugs for
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:17.280]   all of us. Time for whiskey, everybody. Whiskey, here! I was going to go out and get Superman mugs for
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:24.960]   everybody, but then I realized I can't pour this fine cognac into whiskey, into mugs. So we got
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.200]   some tulip classes. And John, you want a tulip or a sniffer? You get your... Nobody wants a sniffer.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:35.440]   I thought Alex might want a sniffer. I like the sniffer. Well, you want... John, point your finger, too.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:42.000]   It's about right. That's about $300. It's actually not even that much. These glasses don't hold that much.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.480]   Oh good. Thank god. We are going to look at the weak stories. You know what's funny?
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.960]   He's a professional poet. Those are equally... Look at him. He's on point with that. Okay.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:58.000]   Look at... This is... Uncle John. Uncle John's an expert. John's an expert. How's that say?
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:04.800]   I jinxed you. I jinxed you. He's a whiz. Can I say something before we get started? Yes, please.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:11.600]   To all the people as me being the champion of people, it's a great holiday season. JCD's back.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:16.080]   It's the time for family and friends. We came back and brought it back at the 18th century.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.920]   And we got good liquor. I'm not having none of them, but they're going to have some. And you're
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:25.120]   going to see baby Jesus, oh, doctor, and three wise men on this episode today on Twitter.
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.480]   It's going to be amazing. It's not right. I know. It's not great. I know. It's going to be good.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.360]   I would have flown you out. I would have flown you out if I could.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.040]   But don't drop it. It's been all the money on the booze.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:40.960]   So cheers, though, doctor. This is to you. Cheers, John. It's great to have you.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.640]   Really, seriously, great to have you back. I know we're never getting you again,
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.600]   so I'm going to really enjoy this episode of "Twit." We are going to look at the... Everybody,
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:54.240]   should we try it? Yes. Oh yeah. Good. I want to see your funky face when you drink it.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:59.920]   It tastes just like Hennessy. Wow, that tastes kind of good.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:06.480]   It's good, right? Yeah, it's good. It's smooth. It's very... It's very good. It's
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:12.080]   alcoholic. It's $120 an ounce. Let's make my ears stand on end. It's $120 an ounce,
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.960]   but the bottle is included in that break. Yeah, it comes with a bottle, right?
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:20.000]   Yeah. So what you're telling me is... The bottles are openly traded. It's a $1000
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.640]   cognac is what it really is. But you can get this bottle on eBay for a couple of grand
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.720]   and put something else in it. Or you can sell it on eBay and get some of your money back.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.600]   Oh, that's a good idea. Yeah. I was going to say, I was going to say,
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.960]   "Finish the bottle, send it to me, and I'll put something there in a purple trick."
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.200]   When the ladies come over, I'll be like, "Hey, girl, you know what I mean?"
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.320]   He never do it for you. You want to sit? It's a beautiful bottle.
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:45.920]   No, I'm going to keep it at home. You put some 1738 in. That's what you're saying. Get some Hennessy...
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:51.840]   Remy. Remy 1738. This is Remy. Pasco. Remy 1738, a Costco. Yeah. Okay.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.080]   It's a winner. Do they sell it in six packs? Yeah. Nice leader. It's a whole leader.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:01.120]   It's a winner. 55 bucks. I'd have to get more bottles. No, no. You'd pour it in there and then
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:06.800]   you'd drink the rest of it. And leave it in the bottle. Show that off. I am glad you hear, John,
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:12.320]   because we've had a couple of years of tech news without, and almost not a show goes by,
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.240]   where people say, "I wish John..." I'd like to know what John... What's going on in my hair?
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:21.840]   I'd like to know what John's friendship is. I like to know. I'm sorry. Make up. I look like a
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.560]   Christmas goose. What does John think of that? Yeah. I have a lot of stories. Specifically.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:33.920]   Let's see. Where should we begin? This was at the beginning of the year, Mark Zuckerberg's
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:39.760]   personal challenge. It was his new year resolution for 2018. Fixing Facebook.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:45.760]   Yeah. What was there? Fix. It was not broken. He says Facebook has a lot of work to do when it
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:50.160]   comes to harassment, election, interference, and making sure it's a meaningful platform
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:55.200]   to be on. So he made it his personal challenge for the year to focus on fixing these important
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.920]   issues. This was about the worst year Facebook's ever had. Yeah. This is 2017. This really broke.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:04.160]   2017 was the worst year that Facebook had ever had. And then it was followed by 2018.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:10.720]   Last a couple of days ago, Wired published this 21 and counting biggest Facebook scandals of 2018.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:16.560]   Do you want me to list them? Mark actually had a testify in front of Congress. Although that was
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:23.040]   a success for him. Congress maybe looked stupid. Congress always looked stupid. He looked like
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:29.360]   data. He looked like data from the start track. Yes, he did. He had this strange greasy,
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:35.920]   pasty, he always does. He looks like he's a good. I was going to say that's just his face. I think
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:43.520]   it's a shift. Shift. Shifter. Shifter. Shift. Shift. Yeah. Yeah. Stock price. Shifter. There he is.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:49.520]   There's test data testifying. Let's get the word in Congress. Exactly what he looked like.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:55.440]   Shape shifter. That's a shape shifter. Facebook. You think, well, wait a minute, John, you said
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.920]   something provocative. You don't look greasy enough, Mark. Let me spray some water. Actually,
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.840]   let's spray some Crisco on your face. What he looks like is he's wearing grease paint. Remember the
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:08.160]   old makeup that they used to wear grease paint? I just said, just spray him. Yeah. He looks like
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:17.120]   he's wearing grease paint. Does anybody have any Pam? You said Facebook doesn't need fixing.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.840]   His Facebook is far as I am concerned. Has it should be? Well, every time he starts to fix it,
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:26.880]   it makes it worse. I mean, I've always thought that Facebook serves a function for certain
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:31.280]   people that need Facebook. And I think it does the job. I mean, I don't know how many people
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:35.040]   really bitch it in a moment about Facebook that much. So people that hate Facebook,
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:39.920]   I don't particularly like Facebook. I would complain about it, but... Are you on Facebook?
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:44.800]   No, I've never had an account. You've been on Facebook and you quit Facebook and then you came
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.960]   back again. And I quit it again and I come back. I do that irregularly. You know why? I love it
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:53.920]   because every time I deactivate my Facebook account, every one of my hundreds of thousands of friends
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:59.840]   get a notice saying, Leo, it's just unfriended you. Facebook is so awful. That's not true.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.200]   No, I mean, it's not true that you unfriended them. So that's a lie.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:09.040]   So Facebook is dishonest. Oh, what a surprise. You don't say...
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:14.000]   Just want to say that. It's too bad because when you create a Facebook account and then you
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.320]   deactivate it, they put eight of your best friends up there. I've seen you. I haven't seen you, John.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:25.360]   But I've seen Alex. I've seen O'Dr. and they say, "Your friends are sad that you're leaving."
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.080]   Do they do a little more for that? Would you like to tell them why?
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:32.960]   Yeah, it practically is. It's like they actually algorithmically choose the saddest picture.
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:38.880]   And then it says, "Tell them why you're leaving, Leo." Well, leaving is like the mob. You don't
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:44.160]   really ever leave. John's never been on there. So he's okay. But I've had so many people tell me
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.560]   that they're quitting Facebook and then I just bet them $20 that they'll be back in eight weeks
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:53.120]   and everybody comes back. So again, same thing you, John, say like you're going to complain about it,
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:57.440]   but you're still using it. I use it, but I manipulate it to my advantage. And so it doesn't
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.440]   bother me as much because I'm lying all over Facebook. That's all it matters. I'm getting
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:07.920]   Viagra and... You fuzz your Facebook. Join time. It's our time now, 60s dating and older.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.080]   So they think I'm an old guy living in New York City. I don't really care about Facebook.
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:16.240]   It is really the case. And Scooter X in our chat room, who's for the holiday season,
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:22.880]   is a side of calm self-crampus X. It says, "I use Facebook every day to get a lot out of it.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.000]   There are a lot of people, of course, that's how they stay in touch with family and friends."
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.080]   I do get the feeling though a lot of people use it and hate themselves for using it or kind of not
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:34.400]   like you watch it, you look at the news feed and it makes you a little dis unsettled and
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.960]   dissatisfied. You ever get that feeling? I never see you ever look at it. You don't know. I know.
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.840]   I'm doing the regular video. I don't think the Jedi mind tricks don't work on me.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.920]   I don't think regular people... They work on me. I always felt bad when I was... That's one of the
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.360]   reasons I quit. I didn't make it. I don't think regular people do you on it now or not.
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:55.680]   This is why I deactivated it. But if you just look at it, it reactivates it.
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:59.600]   Well, if you just look at it... Yeah. Oh, so for me... Oh, that's funny.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.960]   Here's what I did. I took it off my phone. Okay, I'm currently in at it.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:07.120]   I didn't drop out of Facebook. I just took it off my phone. And I check in every once in a while
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.520]   and take a look at it. But I don't... Taking it off my phone, I did decide. I looked at
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:17.280]   the screen time thing. The phone is the worst use you should ever use Facebook on your phone.
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:22.000]   There's been studies. Well, it was the screen time that Apple put on when I looked at it that
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.240]   I was spending six hours in screen time. I was like, "Oh, I need to stop that." So I drop... I'm
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:33.920]   down about two and a half hours. A day? A day on screen time. All screen time across all...
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:38.960]   Okay. Not just on... And I'm going down to... I'm going to keep on going.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.560]   What are the other apps that you use a lot of? I use Flipboard a lot.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.760]   I use Flipboard is probably the thing I use the most because...
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:51.120]   On your phone. On my phone. I really don't like these algorithmic news things. I really feel like
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:56.080]   they're watching what I read and then they give me the stuff they think I want. Yeah.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.840]   And I don't feel like it actually... How does this differ from... If you remember the early days
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:05.120]   from the '70s and '80s, especially in the early '80s, this was like the dream come true. Everybody
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:09.680]   was going to have this, "Oh, the news feeds are going to be customized for you. You're only going
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:15.200]   to read what you want to read about." And they made that big deal and Facebook executes it and
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:22.560]   now everyone's complaining. This reminds me... Dog the show. This reminds me of Google. Everybody
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:27.280]   in the '80s, especially. Oh, all the world's libraries are all going to be combined. They're
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:33.760]   all going to be all downloaded and downloadable and scanned in. Nobody does it. Google starts to do
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:39.280]   it and they all complain. This is a world of complainers. Wait a minute, John. I think this is...
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.800]   You're right. You nailed something. We all fought in the '70s and the '80s and '90s,
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:46.880]   especially when the internet started taking off. The internet was going to be a great democratizing
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:51.440]   force. The gatekeepers would fall. It would be friction-free commerce. The world would be in a
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:57.200]   better place. It hasn't turned out. And I think that's what's happened is we thought algorithmic news
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:02.720]   would be the panacea, but it turns out it's not because you get a filter bubble. You only get stories
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.720]   you want to read. I honestly get stories. I don't even know why they're putting them in my feet.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.720]   Obviously, I must have clicked on something from People magazine. I don't care what Megan
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:16.560]   Markle is up to, but I keep getting those stories. Some things are advertising. They need to get
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.320]   money too. So yeah, they're going to put things in front of you that you want, but they also put
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.600]   things in front of you that they need to make money on. I think the internet is a disappointment
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.360]   is what I'm saying. I think we're disappointed. I think we did have high hopes, John, and it failed
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:33.120]   us. Isn't that life, bro? Oh yeah. There's good things. There's bad things about life.
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:38.080]   I mean, John, for your benefit. For your benefit, I reactivated by accident because I logged in the
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:45.280]   Facebook. First, help me get off of Facebook. What do you think I click here? General security and
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:53.040]   login, privacy, timeline. You click your Facebook information. And there here it is. Delete your
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.720]   account and information. I don't want to delete it. I just want to deactivate.
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:02.240]   Oh, wait a minute. This is like being, you know, I'm an alcoholic, but I think I can maybe have
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:06.320]   more than drink a week. I can deactivate it. Keep in mind when you delete your Facebook account,
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:10.000]   Messenger will also be deleted, including your messages. By the way, this is a backhanded way
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.040]   of saying when you deactivate, Messenger stays active. You actually aren't leaving Facebook
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:19.120]   Messenger. You're just leaving Facebook. But let's show you what happens when you click deactivate.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:24.400]   Oh, Clayton Morris, Tim Pose, our Jeff Jarvis, Johnny, look how sad Jeff looks.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:29.440]   Jeff is like, you're leaving? Are you sure you want to deactivate? Clayton's like,
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.040]   Hey, man. Hey, man. Don't don't. You'll no longer be able to keep in touch with your
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:39.920]   344 friends on Facebook, including my own daughter. So one of the choices. This is temporary. I'll be
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:45.280]   back. By the way, my daughter, I talked to her minutes ago. So I think she's not sad about it.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:50.000]   She's not said, I have a privacy concern. Yeah, I'll do that. Wait a minute. Please remember,
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.240]   you can always control the information you share and who can see it. You know, this reminds me of
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:59.120]   these scam companies. And I would name a few of them that you sign up for their services and then
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:04.000]   you quit. They got a guy on the phone immediately saying, you know, you don't want to quit. You want
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.560]   to stick around. We'll give you a deal. We'll give you too much for the price. We'll give you
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:12.800]   this all month free. So I'm now deactivating. And everybody, all 344 friends will now get a message.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:18.400]   Leo has unfriended you. Finally, somebody I said, why do you keep unfriending me? I said, well,
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:23.280]   I had to, I have, you know, that's why. What was that? What was the company used to get CDs from
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:31.280]   a CD for a dollar? Oh, come on, be a record. Yeah. That's what that was like. You buy
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:37.680]   little CDs, you'd quit and then like you send you bills. I felt for them. I was a member of that
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.560]   for years. I couldn't get out of it. The best thing we were at a dorm, you know, we were at a
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:45.360]   boarding school in a dorm and, you know, they can never follow up with you. So you sign up for those
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.120]   those CDs. And then my cousin, I think he did the
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:54.080]   bedida cronin. And it was funny as what you really realized was that you realize how much they
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:58.640]   sell that list. And that list was way more important than you see a lot. Because it was
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.680]   the best part was it would be like, you, yes, you, bedida.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:09.920]   That's no great. Not that many people pick up on that. I was, I took a seminar on direct
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:14.000]   marketing back in the late 70s. And the one of the guy I was teaching, it was in New York,
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.880]   was had some business with Columbia. And he says they don't expect you to ever pay the bill.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:28.880]   Well, the discs were 44 cents. I mean, when I worked for Sony, it was 44 cents a disc for
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.160]   manufacturing. So it caught, you know, 10, 10,000 dollars. Oh, yeah, custom nothing.
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.880]   For some dollars and then they would sell it. Don't do they pay the artist anything or is it
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:40.160]   like Spotify? Your artists get paid a percentage of what they made on it. Three cents. You know,
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:44.080]   so it's except for Michael Jackson. He got, I think he got a bucket, no matter what.
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:49.600]   Like it was Michael Jackson was by the time he got to the 90s when I was at Sony. That's because
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:54.320]   he had Colonel Parker negotiating for him. Yeah, yeah, it was. It was Elvis, hard number.
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:59.040]   It's waiting to see. Nobody was listening. I just said, yeah, you were. You proved it.
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:04.320]   One of the things I am. I T M. This guy said I T M. Yeah.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:12.720]   Oh, is that a no agenda reference? He said it. I just said it back. Oh, what does it mean?
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:18.080]   I've never understood in the morning. It means it's in the morning. It's what DJ said. So long story.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:23.760]   It's one of the this is what it's great about no agenda. Episode 200. Yeah, exactly. It's
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:29.200]   it's it's the same thing with PewDiePie. You can't pick up PewDiePie today because you won't get any
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:34.560]   of the jokes. We took we took the idea from people like Jim Rome. Same thing. Yeah, if you don't know
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:40.160]   what to or the ditto heads, your but once you're in the group, you know, you never leave because
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:45.360]   you understand all the jokes. Hell yeah. I stuff. Yeah. You don't have that, do we? Yeah, you do.
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:49.840]   I have the 80s. We have the 80s. All of random reference. I'll never forget the 80s.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:54.080]   I mean, you know, there's a certain like, you know, there's an in group of everybody that knows
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:58.080]   Princess Bride. You're just drinking it. And so you can always, you know, you know that they're in or
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:04.320]   out by you say, you know, do you think they're on our our our our our USs and they go,
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.600]   wrote in some unusual size. And if they if they don't say that, if they just look at you blindly,
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.920]   they're out of the way. That's from the Princess Bride. Yeah, exactly. But
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:15.440]   wrote in some unusual sizes is an important separator between the so and the out.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:21.200]   Facebook is perfect. It had a wonderful year, except it lost more money in the stock market than
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:25.600]   any company in history. One more than a hundred billion dollars in one day.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:30.400]   The biggest one day loss for any company in. It's bounced back.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.680]   Still running. Has it has it has it bounced back?
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:42.000]   It plummeted by 119 billion dollars to 510 billion. What's the market cap today for Facebook?
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.360]   I wonder. Yeah, look it up. I'll check. I mean, this is a bad time because all the tech stocks
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.920]   tanked at the end of the year. Apple's had a rough month. All these companies have a little rough
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:24:02.400]   month. But so what? Market cap. What would I say? 510 now? 359 billion. Oh, no, just 359 billion.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:06.880]   When you started 900, that's not so good. 900 was inflated. Okay.
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:11.520]   There were a couple of companies that made it to a trillion this year. Yeah, that's pretty wild.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:16.800]   They're back down. But Apple was there. Was it Amazon? Amazon. Yeah. I think Microsoft hit it too.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:21.120]   Oh, yeah. Microsoft for a brief period of time actually beat Apple. I don't think it made a
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:26.160]   trillion, but it was that it would beat Amazon. Yeah, no, I think it just a ding. Just a little
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:34.080]   for a second for a coffee. Don't you think? I don't know. It's not irrelevant if you're doing an M&A.
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:39.120]   You know about all this stuff. I do. You do a stock market show? Yes, I do. If you're doing an M&A,
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:43.200]   it's hugely relevant. And if you're trying to get a lot of mergers and acquisitions. And if you're
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:49.200]   doing a lot of bank work, you got to take out loans and you got to base it on the value of the company.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:55.920]   It's valuable. But to the public? I mean, not really. One of the things that the stock value is
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:01.360]   important for is employee retention because everybody's real money. Oh, but that's. This is
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:06.880]   exactly right. And these companies have exploited this. Microsoft showed the way years ago by saying,
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.240]   look, we're not going to pay a lot of money. And Microsoft would actually have, I've heard this
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:15.920]   story from a number of people that worked there. They would hire top guys. And then they would say,
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:21.120]   I'm going to hire you to do something, but you have to take less money than you were making before.
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:26.880]   Just some sort of crazy Bill Gates ego thing. So, okay, I will. But the advantage is you're going
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:30.560]   to be able to. It's an upside. Yeah, you're going to be able to make money on the come because of the
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:34.240]   stock doubling and tripling and quadrupling in the early days and stop doing that, of course,
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:38.320]   and so you couldn't do that anymore. And that gimmick is the same one that Amazon's played.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:44.720]   Apple not so much. Paul Allen played it. It's like TV, but Google Facebook and Apple. I don't
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:48.800]   think that they're really playing that game. They are just that is what you have to do because
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.880]   as you even if you pay people really well as Google does and Apple does, you still have to have
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:58.080]   a stock and a really good stock program. And you have to and the thing is that has to keep on growing.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.720]   That's why they're doing stock buybacks. That's why they're doing all these things because
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:05.120]   yeah, that doesn't keep that doesn't keep inching its way forward. You have people starting to
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:09.120]   think about, well, where else should I go? You know, and the problem is is that these companies
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.880]   are the reason they're all these coding programs and everything else. They're out. They're out of
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.840]   good coders. They're, you know, it takes years to develop. You know, it's like one of those things
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:20.240]   like it's a it's like this bottle. It's like this bottle of Louis the 13th. There is a limit. It
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:25.200]   takes 10 or 15 years to become a good coder. And the problem is is that that was, you know,
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:31.040]   those guys started in 2000. So so the problem is is they don't have them. And it's not just
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.480]   that they went to school for code. It's that they understand how to work in a large team,
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:38.960]   how to check their code in, how to, you know, how to work with architecture, how to under how to not
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:43.200]   write bad code, how to comment their code. All these things are important. And it takes a long
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:47.360]   time to get good at it. Actually, most of the boot camps emphasize exactly what you say.
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:52.080]   You have to because that the boot camps, my son went to one. And then he became a part owner or
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.800]   something. He worked there for a while. And now the boot camp is, but he said the main things they do
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:01.360]   is they do exactly what Alex said, plus one other thing. They teach you how to go out and sell
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:06.320]   yourself and get a job. And there's a lot of time spent on it. Most like how to do an interview,
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:10.960]   how to answer the questions about interviews, the ones you call you can't say that you can't do
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:15.040]   this, you can't do that. What is what is Andrew Horr would say about Facebook's stock? Should I
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:21.040]   buy? Should I sell? We had a we have a competition between on Facebook. I'm long and he went short
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:28.320]   and lost is lost. He lost? Yeah. Wow. So you're still long on Facebook? Yeah. I thought it hit by
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:32.320]   when it went at 135 or something. So you bought when it was at the bottom? That was smart.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:36.160]   Well, I bounced it. I thought it was a bouncer. You know, I was going to hit it. Everybody else
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:41.280]   thought it was just going to keep. He thought it was a cat bounce. I think, right? Well, no,
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:45.840]   a dead camp. Well, yeah, right. Exactly. It would be a dead cat bounce, which means it's just a dead cat.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.880]   I'm going to pay an attention. You're paying attention. I know what's going on. It's also called
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:56.080]   dead cow. That's a worse. That's worse than a dead cat. So, okay, we're not going to pay attention
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:01.920]   to stock. Let's I think Mark might care that he lost $15 billion more than any of the 500
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:05.840]   richest. I just point out, you don't think he cares? No. And I think that I think that
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:11.760]   Bill Gates once said once you have more than it was like more than a billion or more than 500
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.760]   million. You don't think about it anymore. Yeah. Like you just don't have that bad thought process.
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:20.080]   You have more money than you can spend. If it went to 125 on Friday, then I got bounced off the game.
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:27.120]   Anyway, so it doesn't mark the penny stock. Didn't Mark say he was giving away half of his
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:32.400]   income or whatever anyway? Like you don't need his money. Yeah. So, I mean, what's the difference?
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:36.720]   Either he gets a tax break on it or he loses it. He's just giving away money anyway. So,
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:42.640]   obviously, it doesn't hurt him. Do we care that Cambridge Analytica harvested data of,
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:47.520]   and the number keeps changing originally, it was 87 million, then Facebook downgraded it.
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:51.680]   It's only 50 million. Oh, no, wait a minute. Now it's 87 again. I don't know what the number is,
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:56.240]   but it's a lot of people. Do we care about that? Well, why are we care? Well, we'd be care.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.440]   You wouldn't carry it on on Facebook. Well, even if I was on Facebook, why would I care?
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:04.240]   Well, because it's your, I guess you figure it's your personal information. You gave it to
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:08.000]   Facebook. They can do anything they want with it. I am not going to give all my personal
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.440]   information to Facebook. Who does that? The people do that every day. Well, people do that
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.320]   every day. I know, but I maybe they don't care. Here's the thing. I don't put anything on it. I
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:19.440]   think a lot of people don't carry. He's right. I don't put anything on the internet that I don't
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:27.680]   want published. That's the bottom line is that I don't, when I tweet, when I'm talking on Facebook,
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:33.520]   privately or publicly, I look at everything that I do as a public. That's why almost all my posts
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:39.120]   are all public. I don't do two friends. I don't do all those things because I just, it is the
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:43.200]   thought process. I don't want to think about the fact that, oh, this might be private. It's when we
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:47.520]   started with path. Remember path? I loved path. I loved path. I started putting on pictures of my
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:51.920]   kids. I started doing other things. And then I was like, nope. And I just quit. I don't want to
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:56.240]   think about that. I forgot the path is kind of private. And I mentioned something that Kevin Rose
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:01.520]   had said on path. He was mad at me. Exactly. And I just was like, I, so for me, I just forgot. But
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:05.920]   that was the moment when I consciously went. Anything I do online is going to be, it's always going
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:10.000]   to be public. And I think about it as public. There's nothing hidden that someone can steal
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.240]   from me. It is just that's if I'm not willing to make it public, I shouldn't be putting on. I don't
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:18.240]   think I think most people should think of it that way. So the thing I always harp on when I'm on this
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:23.520]   show is that we know better. But the average people, you have no idea. Once or twice a month,
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:28.560]   I'm telling some some mom, hey, don't put a picture of your kid in the bathtub on public.
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:33.200]   Like, you mean it's public. Only my family can see it. I'm like, no, you don't understand when it's
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:38.800]   there. I put it real simple. If it says like and comment, then it's private. If it has that share
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:43.040]   check next to it, that means the whole world to see your neck of baby in 30 seconds. So don't do it.
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:46.400]   And regular people don't understand. You shouldn't put it on grass.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.840]   >> You shouldn't put it on grass. >> The concept.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:53.600]   >> No, no, you should do whatever you want to do. But you should understand the ramifications of
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:57.600]   how the operations work. If you want to put your neck of baby out there, that's the one you.
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:03.680]   But if you don't, if you think you're yourself, I'm only showing my family these pictures or whatever,
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.840]   you got to understand that it's bigger than that.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:10.480]   >> I just feel like I'm talking to a guy with a chia beard. I'm sorry. It's hard to take you.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:14.960]   [Singing]
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:20.320]   >> Facebook overhauled its newsfeed to focus not on news, but what your friends and family share.
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.280]   That's why you joined Facebook, right? Well, they killed the news companies.
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:28.800]   Mike, MIC, the company that was based on Facebook traffic had to go out of business.
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.880]   >> It was a -- >> They didn't have to.
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.400]   >> Well, they weren't making it.
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:36.640]   [Laughter]
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.680]   >> It was a bloodbath.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.800]   >> It was a bloodbath.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:39.520]   >> It was a bloodbath.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.040]   >> And they didn't tell anyone they were going to do it.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.520]   >> But that's part of fixing it, right?
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:48.560]   >> Yeah, the problem is that the whole move fast and break things sets up a situation where you've
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:52.720]   got a lot of code that isn't architected in a way that makes it easy to fix.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:58.160]   >> You know, so changing these things is like pulling a knife out of somebody.
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:01.680]   You don't know how much damage it's going to do when they start to do it.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.800]   And so I think that, you know, that's why Facebook has been so slow,
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:08.000]   is that it is not trivial to do what they're doing.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.440]   And it affects a lot of people.
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:15.520]   >> John, do you think that social media is used to swing people's votes or to persuade people or
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:19.440]   to create dysfunction in our political discourse?
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:22.480]   >> Well, I think the discourse has always been dysfunctional.
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.440]   >> It's getting worse, though.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.640]   >> I don't think so.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:25.440]   >> I think it's more polarized.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.080]   >> But I do say -- well, the polarization is a different story.
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:28.800]   But I think that --
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:31.120]   >> But that's one of the things supposedly they're trying to do, right?
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.000]   >> Who's they?
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.280]   >> The Internet Research Agency, the Russians.
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:35.280]   >> The Russians.
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.360]   >> You don't buy that?
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:41.040]   >> Well, I think the Russians -- I don't think -- I would assume,
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:47.520]   knowing that we're the kings of -- and the inventors of public relations,
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.680]   and we have most of the companies in the world,
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:53.200]   and we have most of the good ideas, and the Pentagon's got something like
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:58.000]   5,000 PR specialists that -- I would think that we,
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.680]   as a nation, do much more than that one --
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:02.560]   >> I'm sure that's true.
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.080]   >> -- sleazy operation in Russia.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.040]   >> That's true.
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:07.120]   >> Same thing with spying, same thing with --
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.800]   >> Yeah, we're the kings.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:09.440]   >> Yeah.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.320]   >> So whatever they're doing --
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.240]   >> But does that make it okay for them to do that?
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.840]   I mean, shouldn't we defend against it?
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.160]   Or should we just say, "Well, we're doing it so well, yeah."
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.920]   >> No, no, we should defend against it, but we have to --
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:22.560]   again, I think it really goes back to what O'Dock just said,
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:26.800]   which is that he finds a woman who's doing something stupid on Facebook,
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:30.800]   and he has to lecture her, and probably a half a dozen other people constantly,
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.360]   because the public is just left stupid,
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:38.240]   because the news media does such a poor job of informing people
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.240]   about how to do stuff like this.
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.200]   Oh, they do a shake there.
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.680]   They -- oh, the Russians, the Russians, the Russians.
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.080]   >> That's true.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.120]   >> Okay, the Russians.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:48.000]   They don't tell anybody how to look at things properly,
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.360]   how to analyze.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.840]   It's like getting a lousy education at a junior college.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.560]   >> It's not in their interest, because honestly,
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.240]   they want people to be spun up.
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:56.800]   They want people --
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:57.840]   >> Oh, yeah, because then you'll buy more.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.520]   >> And not for nothing.
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:00.400]   >> That's true, I agree with that.
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.040]   >> That's the whole basis of politics.
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:06.960]   In the '50s and '60s, they go grab guys out of the union and say,
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.200]   "Okay, you're in this union, you're voting this way."
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.840]   They give you five bucks, and they say, "You elect this guy,
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.520]   and he's going to take care of the unions."
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.040]   That's how politics works.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:18.480]   The bottom line is, who's doing the manipulating better than the other person?
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.320]   And Russia actually did a good job.
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.520]   They found a new way in.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:24.240]   And you think that regular politicians are going to take that data
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:27.200]   and try and manipulate and mold things to their nature?
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.640]   That's the way the world works.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:29.280]   >> What's that best?
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.400]   >> Use the new medium to do it.
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:31.280]   >> So, agree.
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.400]   So what's the best defense?
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:36.480]   >> The best defense is to actually get good at using the medium to communicate.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.840]   In other words, don't try to protect the American public from themselves.
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.440]   Educate them.
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.920]   >> You definitely should look at how to close this.
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.960]   I mean, I think that how to close some of those loops,
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.720]   how to keep on closing some of the loops.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:50.480]   But that's going to be a whack-a-mole,
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.080]   and you're going to keep on going down that path.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.720]   But the other side of that though is that the Honest Ads Act,
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.720]   which actually never did pass Congress.
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:57.520]   >> Honest.
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.920]   >> But the attempt was to say, well, whoever bought it.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:02.720]   >> No American corporation could possibly adhere to it.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.000]   >> It wasn't about making ads honest.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.800]   It was about attributing the ad, whoever bought the ad.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:09.120]   If it was bought by the Internet Research Agency.
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.240]   >> It's too easy to get--
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:12.000]   >> It's brought to you by a Russian troll farm.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.680]   >> It's like a VPN.
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:17.120]   You just yell, "Okay, this guy bought it, but he's going to do this."
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.040]   >> It'll never be traceable back.
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.080]   That's the problem with the Internet.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.160]   You can't trace it back.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.280]   >> Everybody's getting back.
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.160]   >> Everybody's getting back that way.
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.440]   >> How are you supposed to figure out?
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.760]   >> I think the approach is just let everything go nuts.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.320]   >> And then what?
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.080]   >> And then just have fun looking at it.
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.240]   It's great. It's unbelievable.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.520]   >> It is amusing.
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:34.960]   >> Have you seen some of those ads
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.440]   supposedly that ran on Facebook I never saw when they ran?
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:37.520]   >> I did.
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.840]   >> But they're crazy. They're hilarious.
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:42.000]   >> Well, I think that one of the things--
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.480]   >> But some of them were, and I'll address this to--
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:48.240]   Oh, doc, to some of them were designed to create
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.480]   racial strife in the United States, right?
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.720]   >> Oh, wait. Here's the key thing.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.560]   You want to fix it? I can totally fix it.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:58.320]   How about we cut the defense deficit and put it into education
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:01.120]   so that people actually know how to read and do their own research
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.640]   and understand how things work?
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:03.120]   >> That's not bad idea.
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:06.080]   >> We're really low in educational bars for the world.
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.480]   >> What I have to say is, we just read a book.
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.080]   >> Hey, you're talking to us in California.
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.600]   We're like second to the bottom now.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:12.880]   >> No, it's depressing.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.840]   >> This is bad.
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.280]   >> This is predicated though, on a first- >> It's bad.
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:18.160]   >> Right. >> The people use reason to vote.
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:19.600]   They don't. They use emotions to vote.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.160]   >> Sure.
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.760]   >> So you don't ever really--
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.880]   You don't ever-- if you're going to change somebody's vote,
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.720]   you don't ever appeal to their reason.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:31.120]   I can't convince somebody through reason to change their opinion.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:32.400]   You do it with a motion like this.
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:36.720]   Satan, if I win, Clinton wins.
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:37.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.400]   Jesus, not if I can help it.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.480]   Press like to help Jesus win.
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:45.280]   Now nobody looks at that.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.120]   This is one of the Russian ads, by the way.
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:48.320]   >> It's a beauty. It's a beauty.
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.000]   >> Nobody looks at that and says, "Yeah, that's right.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.160]   I'm going to press like." Or do they?
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.000]   >> Do you think it would really make some changes?
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.120]   Do you think Clinton--
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:55.760]   >> It doesn't change anybody.
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.120]   >> Do you think Clinton voters going to--
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.360]   "Oh my God, I better vote for the other guy."
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.040]   Or Trump voters going to--
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.000]   >> But all of them--
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:02.720]   >> No, it changes nothing.
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:03.520]   >> How about this one?
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:04.160]   >> It's just funny.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.160]   >> This is a fake group called Black Divest
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.560]   that was created again by the Russian pro-fiber.
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.600]   >> This was one of their better bits.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:10.960]   >> Never forget that the Black Panthers,
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.360]   a group formed to protect Black people from the KKK,
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:15.360]   was dismantled by the US government.
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.880]   But the KKK exists today.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:17.840]   >> That was a good word.
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.880]   >> They were in a form to protect the--
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:23.120]   people from the KKK, the Black Panthers,
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.040]   the California operation,
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.240]   they probably didn't have them,
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:28.240]   didn't know what the KKK was or knew it existed.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:29.520]   It was a whole different reason.
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.920]   It was a liberation movement.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:32.400]   >> Right.
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.120]   >> I don't think you'll write, my brother.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:35.600]   >> We're not.
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:36.640]   >> Because the Pharisees,
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:38.800]   but a Klan and the government had told me--
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:39.360]   >> We're not--
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:39.920]   >> Wait, though.
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.720]   >> I'm not debating the veracity of this ad.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.080]   That's not the point.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.160]   >> No, no, we all debated the veracity of this ad.
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:49.520]   I believe that the government has succeeded
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.640]   to try to pontificate my mind and give me.
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.960]   And you understand what the KKK was?
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.560]   How the government let him do it, brother?
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.000]   >> Yeah, thank you, Jesse.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.840]   >> DJ Khaled, I think is who he is.
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:00.960]   I don't know, I'm confused.
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.680]   You just looked a little with a green beard,
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.120]   you could be DJ Khaled.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:06.000]   >> It's a good ad.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:06.960]   It's a good ad.
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:07.440]   >> Just saying.
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.560]   >> But that's the question.
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:09.360]   >> Yeah, this is fun.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.800]   >> This is persuasive to be.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.960]   I agree, it's amusing if you look very amusing.
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:13.680]   >> It's very amusing.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:15.360]   >> And again, my point of not being educated,
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.120]   if you don't know about the history of--
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.960]   >> Yeah, if you're an idiot, I agree.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:22.320]   Americans have got a lot of idiots right now, so--
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.280]   >> How about this one?
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.640]   This is a Confederate flag.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.720]   This is during the controversy over the
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:28.240]   flying the Confederate flag.
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:29.360]   It's heritage, not hate.
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.600]   The South will rise again.
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.080]   Oh, boy.
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.760]   Save your Confederate dollars, boys.
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.680]   >> This has been saying it for a long time.
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.520]   Ever since somebody told me it's rising again,
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:38.720]   because of air conditioning.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.360]   I believe it's probably the reason.
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:42.320]   >> You know, the problem of this--
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.280]   it was too hot.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.720]   But now that we have air conditioning,
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.000]   the South will rise again.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.560]   >> Well, you know, Clinton, Bill Clinton had
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:52.480]   Southern Confederate flags on many of his badges and--
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.280]   >> Who do you?
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:53.760]   >> Give a whirl.
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:54.640]   >> Yeah, I'll just say, you can look it up.
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:55.120]   >> Well, it's always mark and saw.
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:55.840]   >> You can look it up.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.040]   >> Is it full?
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.080]   >> There's a lot of--
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:58.560]   >> Oh, oh.
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.520]   >> There's a good old boy.
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.440]   Well, there's a lot of coded stuff that was going on.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:02.240]   >> Save your dicks.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:04.000]   >> When the woman who was in the runoff,
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   you know, shows up and she wears a Confederate hat,
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:08.560]   and goes to Jefferson David and says,
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.080]   "Well, it's just history."
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:10.960]   I mean, that's not history.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.480]   She's-- that's a coded.
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:12.960]   >> It's coded.
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.000]   >> You know, it's racist in that way.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:14.960]   >> It's a dog.
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.400]   >> No, it's just what it is.
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.360]   >> Who cares?
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:18.960]   >> Well, some people might.
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:19.840]   If you're black, you might.
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.440]   >> Oh, we care.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.880]   >> Oh, oh, we care.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:23.600]   >> Yeah, vote.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:24.720]   >> Don't get out the vote.
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:25.200]   >> Vote her out.
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:25.760]   >> Oh, oh, oh.
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.360]   >> Oh, by the way, I think vote.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.000]   I mean, but I'm saying--
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.480]   >> I think we had the biggest turnout in the mid-term
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:31.440]   election ever, didn't we?
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.840]   On November, I think it was a very big--
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:34.720]   >> It's big, yeah.
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.400]   We have more people here, too.
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.360]   It's something to do with it.
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.520]   >> Yeah, but the percentage of eligible voters who voted.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.680]   >> Yeah, they all wanted to vote on this for something.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.960]   >> And let's just say this, and then we can--
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:46.400]   >> And so the Russian thing didn't work.
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:47.440]   >> It seems to me.
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.040]   >> Let me say this.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:50.560]   Half the country didn't want to vote at all
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:53.600]   for either two of the dummies that were running for president.
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:54.960]   So half the country's like, look,
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:59.120]   I'm not getting involved in this snake oil salesman, Russia,
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:39:59.760]   whatever.
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.760]   So half the country just wasn't swayed at all.
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.360]   They didn't even go out to vote.
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.360]   One previously, they had record numbers of voters.
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.440]   So all that's taken with a grain of salt.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:08.080]   >> This was not--
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:09.200]   >> I don't want to get a politics.
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.520]   >> Al Gore and Bush was very similar kind of--
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:12.960]   >> I don't want to get too much into politics
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.800]   as mostly really about social media--
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.080]   >> We're talking about social media.
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:16.880]   >> We're talking about--
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:17.440]   >> Not politics.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:22.160]   >> Well, the impact of social media on the national discourse.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.120]   How about that?
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.360]   It does boil down the--
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:26.160]   >> And we're done.
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:27.280]   >> And we're done.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.400]   We're done with Facebook, too.
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:29.360]   We're going to move on.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:32.960]   That was just one of many stories this year that bored everybody.
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:34.000]   We're going to--
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.680]   >> I wonder how many people really cared to the extent
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.280]   that the tech community cared.
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:43.040]   >> Oh, look, almost every single story today.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.240]   >> Nobody cares.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:44.800]   >> Nobody cares.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:45.280]   >> Nobody cares.
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:45.760]   >> The only--
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.400]   I mean, I am sincere.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:52.080]   When I say, "Oh my God, they're copying the iPhone X notch
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.760]   at Mobile World Congress,"
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:56.560]   I don't think my mom's up in arms over that.
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:57.920]   >> Nobody cares.
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:59.760]   >> Nobody cares.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.160]   The only thing I'll say about Facebook is that they're--
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:06.080]   that what they have to manage is the fact that people don't feel
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:06.640]   that connected.
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.640]   Like, they're not seen as the cool company anymore.
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.000]   There's just a lot of tarnish on them.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.600]   And the problem is, is that the brands--
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.440]   >> The other problem is the kids especially.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.640]   >> Well, the kids don't think they're cool.
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:15.280]   >> The kids don't think they're cool.
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.080]   >> And there's two problems here.
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:16.640]   >> No, they don't.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.080]   >> The kids don't think that they're cool.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:19.280]   >> Well, that's the franchise.
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:20.800]   >> And the brands hate them.
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.280]   >> If you choose the brands--
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.480]   >> No, the brands hate them.
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.680]   >> The brands hate the Facebook.
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:24.960]   >> The brands don't want to advertise in Facebook.
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:25.600]   >> No, no, wait a minute.
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:26.080]   I take it--
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:28.400]   >> I think they advertise in Facebook because they have to.
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.160]   >> Give us the revenue on Facebook.
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:30.640]   >> What?
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.000]   >> Revenue on Facebook.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.080]   >> As I remember, it's very good.
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.280]   >> It's $40 billion or something.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.000]   >> And mobile.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.360]   >> Mobile was up to 80%.
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:38.720]   >> I mean, it's done very well.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.080]   >> But the brands feel trapped.
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:40.480]   >> They have to.
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:44.560]   >> They hate the fact that they don't have access to their own followers.
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:45.200]   >> You know what brands hate?
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.400]   >> They hate the fact that they can't--
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.840]   >> They can't hate that they have to advertise at all.
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:49.840]   People should just buy their freaking widgets.
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.480]   >> But the thing is, is that they don't hate Google AdWords.
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.400]   They hate Facebook.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:55.040]   >> But I'll tell you.
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.160]   >> People go in Facebook.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.800]   If you're a brand and you're not buying Google and Facebook,
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:59.280]   you're nuts.
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.360]   >> Well, and not only that as someone who--
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:02.880]   >> Because they can target like crazy.
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.640]   >> And it makes it so much easier.
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:06.400]   Like the thing is, but the point is,
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.000]   is that there's all of these other--
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.160]   the brands don't like them, the kids don't like them.
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.680]   That's a dangerous place.
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:12.240]   >> That's a dangerous place.
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:12.880]   >> There's a sense of dislike.
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.720]   >> There's a dangerous place for Facebook to be
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:16.160]   that they have to get over.
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.520]   >> Half this panel is not unfaithful.
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:20.480]   >> I think a lot of this has to do with the propaganda
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.560]   that the news media's finally gotten to clue and said,
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:25.360]   hey, this Facebook operation is eating our lunch.
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.880]   Look at the sales that they've got.
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.640]   That's out of our pockets.
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:29.760]   Let's go after them.
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:30.560]   >> Yep.
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.360]   Let's--
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.360]   Darren, they're stupid to find out all the goodies.
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:36.240]   Oh, Facebook is selling your messenger stuff to Netflix
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.680]   and everybody.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:38.800]   So you're right about that.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.920]   The murder report, they keep dinking at Facebook's armor
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:44.640]   and hopefully making a way for themselves
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.640]   to get some traction and get some control back.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:47.840]   >> Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:50.640]   >> Speaking of all that, if you wanted to get a hold of me,
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.880]   Uncle Leo, you have a contact solution.
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:53.520]   You can find my address.
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:54.960]   You said you were going to mail me something.
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.600]   >> I'm going to send you a Tupperware of some fine Hennessy.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:58.400]   >> Okay.
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:58.960]   >> Coniac.
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:02.240]   >> It's RemiTime.
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.120]   Everybody take a break.
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:06.320]   You can sip whatever's in that fine Superman mug of yours.
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:09.600]   We're going to talk about our new sponsor, Simple Contacts.
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.360]   I am thrilled.
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.360]   I did an eye exam on my phone.
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:14.080]   It was so fun.
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:15.200]   You put the phone here.
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.400]   You step back.
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.440]   It gives you an eye exam.
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.400]   You record a video.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.960]   They give it to a doctor, an eye doctor.
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.840]   He writes a prescription and you get your contacts by mail.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.360]   The other thing that thrilled me is,
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.040]   I got my years worth of contacts.
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:27.520]   They're right here.
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:30.240]   I just got them for 100 bucks less than I was paying
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.560]   from those other online contact lens merchants.
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.040]   This is exactly the same brand, same prescription.
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.520]   I love this.
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:40.480]   I don't have-- it's all about convenience these days, right?
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:42.640]   This is the most convenient, the easiest way
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.400]   to renew your contact lens prescription
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.120]   to reorder contacts from anywhere on your phone
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.960]   with the Simple Contacts app.
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:52.400]   I was thrilled to try this.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:53.600]   The app did my prescription.
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:54.720]   It let me renew it.
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.320]   I reordered my brand of lenses.
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:59.040]   It actually said scan the barcode on the box.
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.600]   So I got exactly the same brand.
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.760]   It basically brings the eye doctor to your house.
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:06.080]   The vision test is designed by doctors.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:08.000]   Every test is carefully reviewed by doctors.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.160]   It's actually a video of you taking the test.
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.320]   So it's essentially the same as you'd be doing
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.640]   at the eye doctors, but you don't have to leave your house.
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.960]   And Simple Contacts has every one of them.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:20.480]   Every brand of lens, the best prices I've seen anywhere.
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:22.800]   The eye exam is 20 bucks they offer free shipping.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.960]   Now, you should still go,
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:26.560]   and I want to make the point of this
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.400]   for your periodic full eye health exam,
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.560]   you know, the Puff Test and all the stuff, the Glaucoma.
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.720]   They got to do all of that.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:35.440]   But if what you're doing is trying to renew your prescription
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.800]   for your contact lenses,
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:38.720]   this is the easiest, fastest way to do it.
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.880]   And don't worry,
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.320]   we're going to give you your 20 bucks back
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:43.680]   on your first Simple Contacts order.
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:46.160]   Just go to simplecontacts.com/twit,
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:48.160]   enter the promo code TWIT at checkout.
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.560]   Simple, this was so easy,
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:54.240]   and I'm set for a year, simplecontacts.com/twit,
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:56.880]   $20 off your first Simple Contacts order
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:59.040]   when you use a code TWIT at checkout.
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:01.840]   I'll have to say,
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:03.360]   there's one thing the internet does have down.
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:07.440]   It is made e-commerce so much easier.
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:08.960]   Did you shop,
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:12.560]   how much of what you did for Christmas was online,
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:13.040]   oh, doctor,
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:14.800]   did you shop online or did you go to a store?
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:18.400]   So I'm going to sound like a grumpy old man.
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.160]   You know,
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:21.920]   we got the grumpy and stole man right here.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:22.640]   You can not.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.000]   Yeah, yeah, I'm rich.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.360]   I'm channeling my JCD on this.
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:29.040]   So you know, my family businesses,
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.560]   we own UPS stores,
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:34.880]   and it is an absolute killer that Amazon has done.
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:35.840]   So what happened?
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:36.480]   Let's just say,
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:37.440]   I'm just going to say,
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.440]   our volume of shipping and packing and stuff
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:40.800]   is dropped dramatically,
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:42.560]   which is our feast or famine season,
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:46.560]   because people shop directly and get gift-grap shopping
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:47.760]   or they send it to their family
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:49.200]   and have them wrap it when they get there.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:53.840]   The volume that we've lost out on is crushing us.
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:56.480]   So you're saying people aren't sending their own gifts.
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:57.600]   They're using Amazon.
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:02.240]   Not only Amazon, because of the fight now,
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.080]   everybody gets to free today shipping.
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:06.960]   So it's Amazon, Target, Walmart.
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:09.120]   So instead of them buying all their presents,
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:09.600]   coming to us,
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:10.880]   we ship them to their family.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.880]   They buy them and have them sent directly to them
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:14.080]   and then have their kids or whatever,
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:15.200]   wrap them for their grandkids,
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:15.920]   don't like that.
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.240]   So we're getting cut out as the middleman for shippers,
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.000]   which was our peak season,
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   is now failing miserably.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.360]   Like I've been talking to my uncle about it.
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:26.960]   He doesn't understand internet
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:27.520]   or how things work.
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:28.240]   And I've been telling them
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:29.920]   that we need to do things differently.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:30.800]   He doesn't understand it,
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:34.960]   but it is soul crushing with this online shopping
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:36.080]   and free shipping is doing.
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:36.960]   Not only that,
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.040]   but just to get into our tangent,
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:42.800]   drivers and UPS people worry about them striking and things like that.
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.680]   Amazon is crippling the shipping market
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.840]   because everyone else is trying to compete
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:49.440]   and they're doing a poor job at it.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.520]   If you ordered four things from Target,
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.240]   Target will send you a small one ounce item
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:56.800]   and a huge 18 by 18 box.
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:57.680]   One thing at a time,
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:00.880]   because they don't know the logistics of packing and shipping.
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:02.560]   And it is ruining everything.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:03.120]   It's insane.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:03.600]   - It's true.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:07.520]   - It's true because Jason Hall got a package of Oreos
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:09.600]   for all about Android Oreos.
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:10.160]   - Yeah.
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.040]   It was one package.
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.200]   The box was like six feet by four feet.
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:14.960]   - I've gotten big boxes from Amazon.
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:16.320]   - But there's, I've been told there's a reason.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.320]   It's for packing the truck.
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:20.800]   Amazon is so smart in their algorithms
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:21.920]   that they choose the boxes
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:23.440]   not merely for the thing that's in it,
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:26.320]   but also so how they will all fit into the truck
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.320]   so that they don't slide around in the truck.
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:29.760]   - That sounds like bull crap.
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:32.000]   - I sound like Jeff Bezos to me.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.280]   I mean, it's Alkra.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:37.280]   - Amazon has a better track record of doing that.
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:37.840]   If they do it,
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:38.800]   I believe it is for a reason
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.240]   because they don't do it in every shipment.
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:41.680]   If you turn on a waste money
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:43.040]   and then you're sending something in a giant box
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:45.200]   for no reason, there's a reason they're doing it.
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:47.280]   - Just go order four things from Target Uncle Leo
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:49.040]   and then watch the boxes that they come in.
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:51.040]   You'll laugh because it's just laughable.
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:52.720]   Everything they ship is like that.
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.080]   You can order four things at one time
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:55.440]   to send you four different shipments.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.040]   - Well, there are different warehouses maybe.
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:59.760]   - I have the mom principal.
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:01.840]   My mother still has a flip phone,
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:04.000]   but we get all the, we get all our gifts
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.280]   delivered straight from Amazon.
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:06.880]   - She's like on a flip phone?
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:07.200]   - No, no, no.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.320]   I'm just saying that she doesn't,
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:09.760]   she's not a technological--
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:10.560]   - She doesn't have to do it this far.
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:11.720]   - She's not a technologically-
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:13.600]   - I'm so confused.
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.440]   - No, she's not technologically driven.
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:17.520]   I can't get her to get a smartphone.
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.920]   And she's still--
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:21.600]   - But she gets on the computer and goes next.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.520]   - No, no, no. She orders, she orders,
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:26.560]   all her grandkids get everything from Amazon directly
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:27.120]   because she doesn't want,
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:29.360]   she did that one year a couple years ago.
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:30.160]   - How is she doing?
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:30.960]   - How is she ordering?
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:31.760]   - She goes on a computer.
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:34.320]   - Wow, Amazon, I like computers.
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:35.760]   - She has what we said.
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:38.160]   - She's not, and the thing that I think
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:42.720]   is more frightening for UPS and FedEx
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:44.720]   are all these planes that Amazon's buying
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:47.440]   because Amazon's not gonna take the work away
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:50.960]   from FedEx and UPS, not just their own work.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:51.920]   They're gonna take everybody's work
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:54.960]   because Amazon, their mode of operation,
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:56.600]   their, you know, the modus operandas
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:59.640]   is that they are going to do exactly what they did
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:00.640]   with servers.
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:02.360]   The way that they're gonna reduce their cost
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:05.240]   is they're gonna start doing fulfillment for Target.
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:06.400]   They're gonna start doing, hey, they're like,
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.240]   let us do that for you.
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:08.440]   - Why should Target do that?
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:09.800]   - Yeah, like you don't know how to do this.
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:10.640]   We know how to do this.
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:12.160]   - So, it always has trucks and planes driving around.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.960]   Let's just, well, there's a lot of companies
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:14.800]   that says that.
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:15.640]   - That's what this whole process is.
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:17.040]   This trucks, the planes, everything else is gonna be providing
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:18.600]   a service for these companies.
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:19.880]   - I'd be much more worried if I was UPS
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:21.440]   and FedEx terrified of it.
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:24.480]   - Oh, they are because UPS itself,
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:25.600]   same thing you're talking about the planes,
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:26.960]   that's what they did.
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:28.280]   They got their infrastructure down
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:30.280]   and they carry all the US mail.
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:32.000]   So they fly the mail across the country,
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.040]   they take it on their trucks for the government
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:36.400]   and Amazon's gonna come in and eat their lunch.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.760]   - Oh yeah. - Same thing you're talking about,
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:38.760]   that's what they're doing.
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:39.880]   It's a massive takeover.
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:41.160]   We're all gonna be wearing Amazon socks
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:43.200]   'cause I'm gonna have an Amazon brain in about six years.
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:44.680]   So, boo-hoo, America.
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:47.560]   - Jeff Bezos, richest man in the world.
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:48.760]   - Well, and what's amazing is his Amazon's
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:50.320]   able to do this without being monopoly
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:51.680]   in any given market.
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:53.000]   So they always have a minority,
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.400]   if they just have it on all of them.
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.240]   - Except for what? - What?
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:56.080]   - Putin.
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:57.960]   I think Putin's richer than Bezos, but we don't know.
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:58.800]   - And we don't know.
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:49:59.640]   - There's a lot of different--
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:00.480]   - There's a lot of different--
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:01.800]   - The boot you have, but we don't know that either.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.600]   - Okay, but I think Putin's got more 'cause he's got Rosnost.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.400]   - Why does he even bother working then?
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:07.240]   Makes no sense.
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:09.080]   - 'Cause he likes the job.
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:09.920]   Good job.
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:10.960]   Why does Jeff Bezos work?
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:13.840]   He's got $150 billion.
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:14.840]   There's nothing he can't buy.
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:16.680]   - He's still trying to take over the world.
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:17.760]   - That's because he is.
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:20.320]   - He's not the bald head, he's got the one big eyeball.
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:21.520]   He's got everything going on.
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:23.520]   He's probably blow-failed if you like--
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:25.040]   - You can't buy-- - Because he's a mask offer.
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:28.840]   - You know he can't buy with $150 billion in normal laugh.
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.160]   It's the one thing he can't get.
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.600]   - Well, if he had no money, he wouldn't have.
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:32.440]   - He's still having that.
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:33.760]   - He's laughing at more of that man.
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:34.600]   - He's like, "What's that man?
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:35.440]   "He's in the interview?
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:36.600]   "He was like, "I heard that laugh and I was in love."
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:37.440]   - She's a wife's guy?
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:38.280]   - Oh, she said that?
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:39.800]   - Yeah, she loves his laugh.
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:41.640]   - I mean, now I have to play--
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:42.640]   - They're meant for each other.
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:45.640]   - A compilation of Jeff Bezos--
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:46.480]   - Maybe Jeff's laughing.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:47.320]   - Maybe you wanna be a dancer.
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:48.400]   I don't know what you wanna do.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:49.880]   - I don't show my boss who's gonna like that.
[00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.480]   (laughing)
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:52.640]   - That was pretty normal.
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:53.480]   - Not.
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:55.000]   - But you do need to follow your passions.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:55.840]   - Right.
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:57.480]   - I would love for it to be after I'm dead.
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:01.640]   (laughing)
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:02.480]   - It's kinda scary.
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:03.320]   - I would wanna--
[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:04.520]   - We're gonna use everyone.
[00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:05.680]   - I'm totally, you know, he's willing
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:07.160]   to use a white person cat.
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:08.320]   - I said, "No, he really is."
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.120]   - That's coming up too, but it's actually not supposed
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:10.960]   to be that funny.
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:12.280]   - It's a stop-o-brel fish.
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:13.800]   - You are an investor in business society.
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:14.640]   - Yes.
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:15.480]   - Just one important investor.
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:16.320]   Thank you.
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:18.000]   - All right, enough Jeff Bezos laugh.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.320]   I just had to, just so people know
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:20.320]   what we're talking about here.
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:21.160]   - Yeah, it wasn't that good.
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:24.240]   - You still never saw sorry to bother you, did you?
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:27.240]   No, with the white voice, the guy talks in the white voice?
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:28.840]   Yes, he talks in white voice.
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:31.640]   It is a direct assault against Jeff Bezos.
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:33.320]   I just remembered that you never saw that.
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:34.320]   So in that movie--
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:35.480]   - I have been to my, it's on,
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:37.360]   I get it on iTunes now, so I'm gonna watch it.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:38.880]   - I'm gonna spoil it for you now,
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:39.880]   because it's end of year and I don't care
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:42.160]   you took too long, you should've watched it.
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.840]   A spoiler for anybody listening,
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:47.080]   if you don't wanna hear it, then sorry to bother you.
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:47.920]   Black guy--
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:48.760]   - Put it on.
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:53.040]   - Uses white voice and basically he gets promoted
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:54.680]   to be the top guy.
[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:55.520]   - Yeah.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:57.240]   - The top guy ends up being a Jeff Bezos type.
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:52:00.000]   And his whole thing was he wants to control
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.320]   the world with the workforce,
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:03.680]   and the way he gets his workers to work harder
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:06.600]   is he gives them this drug that turns them into horsemen
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:08.240]   and he has them working 24/7.
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:10.080]   - Wait a minute, that's not the trailers.
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:10.920]   - It's not the trailers.
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:11.760]   - And they come, that's the weird--
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:12.600]   - Are you making this up?
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:13.720]   - No, no, it's the weird third act.
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:16.360]   The weird third act was like, we have a whole plan
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:17.280]   and then we get to the third act
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:18.280]   and we're gonna take some drugs
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:19.200]   and then we're gonna write something.
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:20.040]   - This is the part--
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:21.440]   - It is the part that I was talking about.
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:22.440]   - Cash is crazy.
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:23.920]   - Sorry to bother.
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.360]   - So he keeps getting hung up on 'cause--
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:26.200]   - We're gonna make some money here.
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:27.440]   - Use your way, boys.
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:28.280]   - My wife, boys.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:30.240]   - I'm never talking about Will Smith's wife.
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:32.200]   - Like this young blood.
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:35.320]   - Hey, Mr. Kramer, this is Langston from Real View.
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:42.440]   - As always, we'll be getting that out to you right away.
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:43.920]   - You're doing so good with the voice thing.
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:45.640]   - Hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah.
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:48.000]   - Can you do that voice, O doctor?
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.600]   - Uh, I can't.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:51.280]   - Can you sound--
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:52.120]   - Can you do the way--
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:52.960]   - Have you--
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:55.880]   - A horseman train, I don't know if I really wanna see this now.
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:58.120]   - You have to absolutely watch it.
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:02.640]   It is directly reflected on Bezos' control of the world.
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:05.000]   You have to watch it and about slave labor.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.680]   And people not getting paid for their jobs
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:07.840]   working in these warehouses.
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:10.520]   - Well, that actually was one of the big Amazon stories
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:15.520]   this year, a big breaking story from a UK undercover reporter
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:18.880]   hired six months undercover in low-wage Britain,
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:22.600]   talking about warehouse workers being forced to pee in bottles
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:27.040]   because they couldn't leave the floor for a bathroom break.
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:30.280]   Now this is in the UK, but a number of people say
[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:32.760]   this also happens in the United States.
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:34.600]   Of course, we've also seen articles that say
[00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:36.800]   executives at Amazon cry at their desks.
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:37.640]   I wonder--
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:38.440]   - Sometimes I wonder--
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:39.920]   (both laughing)
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:41.800]   - How much of this stuff is real and made up?
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:43.800]   Is this the media doing the same thing you were talking about?
[00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:44.960]   Just kinda stirring the box.
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:46.280]   - I hope so.
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:49.920]   - Workers describe breaks as one 30-minute unpaid break
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:51.800]   and two 15-minute paid breaks.
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:55.280]   But despite having legally compliant break times,
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:57.360]   workers noted they had to walk quite a distance
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:59.400]   from the main work area to the brick area.
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:00.240]   - Oh.
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.360]   - Oh poor babies.
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:02.680]   - They had to walk.
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:07.680]   - Amazon did actually raise the hourly rage to $15 an hour,
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:10.680]   but then they cut all the bonuses.
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:14.600]   So I don't know, you don't, I don't know.
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:17.000]   I'm of mixed opinions on this.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.240]   - I've been to the warehouse and I'm not really gonna
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:21.320]   even joke about someone having to walk
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:22.720]   because it's because those things already
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:25.760]   just build a new facility that's the size of two football fields.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:27.440]   So depending on where you're working at,
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:29.960]   it might take you six minutes to get to your area
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:31.200]   to quote unquote break.
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:33.080]   So if you don't get the break time to start
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:35.360]   until you get there, that's what people are talking about.
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:36.800]   I'm not gonna make a joke about somebody
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:38.680]   being on their feet for eight to nine hours a day.
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:41.240]   Again, they chose that job, that's the job they chose,
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:42.960]   but their concerns are real because they're the ones
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:45.400]   working every day, getting out my package
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:46.520]   that I need to have in two days
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:47.760]   and God forbid I don't get in two days,
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:49.400]   I cry like an infant child.
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:50.920]   - This has to be a horrible time of year
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:52.680]   to be an Amazon warehouse worker, right?
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:54.000]   I mean, this is, this is--
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.160]   - Load out bonuses.
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:59.560]   - I don't know, I worked, my first job was shipping
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:02.120]   and receiving for a electronics company
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:04.480]   and we worked our butts off.
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:05.480]   - Like, you know, it was--
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:07.960]   - Hey, you saw there are jobs in the world
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:09.280]   that you actually really, really hard.
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:11.840]   - Physical labor and work your asses off.
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:13.360]   - Like I said, they chose that job.
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:14.680]   - I mean, if I didn't like it--
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:16.360]   - I worked at Ford, I worked at International,
[00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:18.880]   the-- - Did you work on the assembly line?
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:21.320]   - Yeah, I worked in the assembly line at Ford,
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:23.040]   I also worked on-- - That's gotta be
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:24.400]   horrible, tough work.
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:25.760]   - It's not as bad as you think,
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:27.080]   'cause they pay you a lot.
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:28.400]   - Right, I got that.
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:31.520]   - If you're a UAW guy, you make a lot of money.
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:33.760]   - What's the worst job you ever had, Alex?
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:35.920]   I know you've had some bad ones.
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:39.720]   - I only had one, I delivered pizza for Domino's one day.
[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:40.640]   (laughing)
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:41.480]   - One day?
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:43.680]   - I'd early finished, I finished,
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:46.280]   I walked away, I didn't even try to get my check
[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:47.120]   and I didn't come back.
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:48.600]   I was like, I'm never doing that again.
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:49.720]   - What's your worst job, Owen?
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:51.480]   What's the worst job you ever did?
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:53.920]   - I've never had a bad job,
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:56.280]   I've never worked any kind of fast food or food.
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:58.280]   I'm already big, I've chosen myself,
[00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:01.680]   I'm not gonna go put myself in another diabetic situation.
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:03.320]   Every job I've ever had has been good.
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.960]   I worked at Kmart, I did film developing
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:08.440]   and I was awesome, then I went with the family,
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:11.040]   the UPS thing, then my dad opened his own computer business,
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:12.520]   I worked for my bad-- - This is a generational thing
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:14.200]   that the kids, I mean, like JC,
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:17.240]   do you think he doesn't, and my kids have the same attitude
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:18.880]   towards where I worked at McDonald's,
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:20.160]   which would, I think some people would say,
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:21.840]   "Oh, that's a horrible job, I loved it."
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:23.720]   Because I was busy, I had to work really hard,
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:25.320]   they went by fast 'cause you're working hard,
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:26.800]   I liked waiting tables, same reason,
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.000]   you're feet are killing you at the end of the day,
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.840]   but it goes fast 'cause you're working hard
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:31.760]   and you make money in tips.
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:33.160]   Do you think that millennials are--
[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:35.640]   - Yeah, I think millennials have a totally different attitude
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:36.480]   about everything.
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:38.760]   - I shoveled horse manure for four years.
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:41.440]   - And you said that was better than the other one,
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:42.520]   you can win. - It was better than Domino's.
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:44.200]   - It was a domino for wow.
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:46.120]   - Okay, I thought it was a good manure man.
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:49.080]   - Yeah, it was, I was like, it was, like for one day,
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:50.400]   but it was like, but the thing is,
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:52.000]   is that it makes you work harder
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.200]   because you know that no matter how bad it is,
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:56.280]   you could be shoveling horse manure.
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:57.120]   - Yeah, like you're like,
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:59.560]   you keep that in mind in the back of your head all the time.
[00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:00.960]   - I did have one bad job.
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:03.360]   First job I ever got a real paycheck from.
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:06.440]   I worked at my school and I was painting lockers
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:08.640]   and peeling gum off of desks.
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.160]   And all the cleaning stuff.
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:12.520]   And let me tell you, for the rest of my high school experience,
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:13.960]   when I saw people chewing gum,
[00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:15.200]   put that gum in a trash can.
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:16.880]   You don't know somebody's got to clean that up.
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:18.560]   I was on people left to right.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:20.160]   Don't write on lockers, someone's got to clean that up.
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:22.320]   Like I was militant about it
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:23.960]   for the rest of my high school career.
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:25.240]   - What's funny about that is that, you know,
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:26.960]   Rwanda, we have a school in Rwanda,
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:27.800]   so I think about it a little,
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:29.640]   but they have this thing called Uma Ganda.
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:31.280]   Rwanda, not Uganda, Rwanda.
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:32.360]   - It's Wakanda.
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:33.200]   - No, not Wakanda.
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:34.040]   - It is close to Wakanda.
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:34.880]   - It is close to Wakanda.
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:36.040]   - It is where Wakanda is.
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:38.040]   - You can't see it, Alex, but it's there.
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:40.160]   - It is, it's probably in the northern part of Rwanda.
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:41.000]   Anyway, so they--
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:41.840]   - The gorilla's in the mist.
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:44.360]   - Exactly, so they have this thing called Uma Ganda
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:47.040]   at the end of the last Saturday of every month,
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:49.040]   where everybody has to go, legally,
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:51.800]   everybody has to go out and clean their area.
[00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:52.640]   - I think that's really good.
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:53.600]   - And work on schools and ditches,
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:54.720]   and I mean like the president goes out
[00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:56.200]   and is digging into schools.
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:57.440]   - Japanese school kids, there's no janitors
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:58.280]   in the schools in Japan,
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:57:59.840]   'cause the kids have to clean up.
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:01.200]   - And the kids are very tight.
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.800]   - Rwanda is the cleanest country in Africa,
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:05.000]   and one of the cleanest countries in the world,
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   because no one throws anything on the ground,
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:10.120]   and the only people who do it are like the Zungus,
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:11.480]   you know that throws something on the ground
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:12.840]   and the wandens will give them like this thing guy,
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:14.120]   like really, did you just do that?
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:15.120]   - This is what I said when I said that.
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:15.960]   - Did you just throw that on the ground?
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:17.120]   - Just delicious konya konya.
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:18.120]   - Oh my ganda.
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:19.040]   - Oh my ganda.
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:22.640]   - So John, do you wanna continue slandering millennials,
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:23.920]   or would you like to--
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:26.040]   - The millennials love to be talked about.
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:26.960]   - They do.
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:28.960]   - In any way, positive names and man games.
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:31.160]   - Oh, people are the ones talking about millennials.
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:33.080]   They're not writing posts about themselves.
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:35.480]   Oh, oh, people complain about what they didn't do.
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:36.560]   - You were a band-aid-sombiners.
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:38.880]   It was ours to lose.
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:40.680]   - You ruined the country,
[00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:42.200]   and now we're sitting here trying to fix it
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:44.320]   with hipster mustaches and beards and records
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:45.160]   trying to bring back up.
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:46.680]   - Says this guy when the chia beards.
[00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:48.120]   - Yeah, and I guess you got a chia beard.
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:49.320]   He's lecturing us.
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:51.720]   - Oh, because of this picture.
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:55.360]   - The war, the famine, is all done by old quote unquote,
[00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:56.200]   white men.
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:57.520]   So don't tell me about millennials,
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:58.360]   things are doing better.
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:58:59.200]   - No, the things are doing better.
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:00.320]   - I'm an old white man,
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:02.720]   and I have not created a single famine.
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:03.560]   - Although I fast--
[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:04.400]   - I haven't either.
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:05.240]   - Once in a while.
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:06.080]   - Now that you mention it.
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:07.760]   - You sure about that?
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:09.080]   Let's check the records.
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:12.040]   (laughing)
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:14.520]   - I think it's Gen Xers, that's a problem.
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:15.720]   - Okay, let's blame Gen Xers.
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:16.560]   That's a different take-
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:17.400]   - I think that would be you.
[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:18.240]   - I'll roll with that.
[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:19.080]   It would be me.
[00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:20.440]   It would be me.
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:23.160]   - All right, we got two Xers and two boomers,
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:24.240]   and we are gonna continue.
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:27.360]   John, I am thrilled to have you back here.
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:30.000]   Is it dvorak.com/blog?
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:30.840]   Is that the site?
[00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:34.440]   - dvorak.org, it's always dvorak.org/blog.
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:35.360]   - Do you still have that?
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:39.880]   - I do, but dvorak.org/naz, where I recommend people go.
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:40.960]   - Narcotics Anonymous?
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:41.800]   - Yes.
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:42.640]   (laughing)
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:43.480]   - There's no more than that.
[00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:44.320]   - There's nothing good to get a brand.
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:45.160]   - I know.
[00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:47.520]   And your Twitter feed, I hear, I'm not on Twitter either,
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:49.280]   but I hear your Twitter feed is very much like
[00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:51.200]   the old blog was with lots of images.
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:53.400]   - You know, my Twitter feed is a big disappointment.
[00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:54.480]   I wanna ask people out there,
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:56.280]   one of the reasons they came to this show
[00:59:56.280 --> 01:00:00.120]   is that at the real Devorak on Twitter,
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:02.960]   I've lost 1,000 or 2,000 people.
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:04.520]   - Those are bots.
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:05.360]   - I don't care.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.200]   They're bots.
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.280]   - I lost 100,000 before I quit.
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.760]   - I need more people to subscribe to my feed.
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:11.600]   - All right.
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:12.440]   - From this show.
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:13.280]   - How would people do that, John?
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:16.240]   - Now come back to this show if people go to Twitter
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:19.240]   and knock my numbers up a couple of grand.
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:20.440]   - How many do we have to bring you up by
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:21.520]   to get you back on this show?
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:22.360]   - Three.
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:23.200]   - 3,000.
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.120]   - Yeah, it's all, it's low.
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:24.960]   - Okay.
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:25.800]   - Where are you now?
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:27.000]   - I mean 102.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.360]   - If you get to 105,000, you'll come back on Twitter.
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.200]   - Yes.
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.040]   - Folks, I beg of you, I plead with you.
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:32.880]   - Spread the word.
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.640]   Spread the word. Tell your friends.
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:37.080]   Create sock puppet accounts if you have to.
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:37.920]   - I don't care.
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:41.200]   - He doesn't care at the real Devorak.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.040]   - Nope, there it is.
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:43.720]   - Let's get him to 105,000 right now.
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:44.720]   - Yeah, here we go.
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:45.560]   - And John, if you're out.
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:46.560]   - And she was a, she was a,
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:47.400]   - You get me to 4,000.
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:49.840]   - If there's any, any oomph left in this operation.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.400]   - It's like, let me do this for you.
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:52.560]   Look how good this feed is.
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:54.480]   - You get silent movie gifts.
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:58.400]   You get, I mean, it is full of jam-packed with goodness.
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.040]   John does everything that you used to do
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:01.120]   that was so fun on the blog.
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:02.120]   Look at that.
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.180]   Charlie Chaplin, what an amazing guy.
[01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:05.480]   - Yeah, there's the scam.
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:06.520]   - It was all fake.
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:07.520]   - Oh. - Fake.
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:08.800]   Like everything else.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.060]   - I think that clip is fake.
[01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:13.980]   That's CGI. There's no thing that's real.
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:15.620]   - Okay, anyway, it's a great feed.
[01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:17.220]   You can debate. You can argue.
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:20.560]   You can DM John. He loves the DMs.
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:21.820]   - No, I don't.
[01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:25.400]   - I'm trying to help you, John.
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:26.240]   - I have spiders.
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.400]   - At the real Devorak, you wanna get up to 40,000?
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:30.580]   You'll come back. - 40,000.
[01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:31.420]   - 40,000, I'll come back.
[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:32.260]   - All right.
[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:33.080]   - I'll come back.
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:35.100]   - Alex Lindsay with an S.A.Y.
[01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:36.920]   Oh, doctor, do you wanna plug your Twitter?
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:39.180]   - There's already gotten three more followers.
[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:40.680]   - John, you've already gotten three.
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:41.520]   - Yeah.
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:42.800]   - Let's power him. - Let's quit.
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:45.100]   There's a follower and there's a follower.
[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:45.940]   - There's a guy there.
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:47.740]   There's a follower. - There's a follower.
[01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:49.180]   - We've got followers, Galore.
[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:51.300]   Before this show is over, I wanna see John Z to work
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:54.900]   at 105,000 followers and he will be back when?
[01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:57.700]   Don't tell me when your vinegar book is done.
[01:01:57.700 --> 01:01:59.420]   - I need to come back to plug the vinegar book
[01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:00.260]   and then I have another book.
[01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:02.460]   - I never got to publish a vinegar book.
[01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:03.460]   - And then I've got--
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:06.140]   - I still have, since the last time you were here,
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:09.940]   in my cupboard in my pantry, three wine bottles
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:11.940]   with paper towels shoved in.
[01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:13.580]   It's been three years, John.
[01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:14.420]   - Perfect.
[01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:15.420]   - Okay.
[01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:16.260]   A good start.
[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:19.780]   - He's gonna put it in a bottle of stuff for 3000.
[01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:21.260]   Don't worry about it.
[01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:22.740]   - Oh, yes, that's all we ask.
[01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:23.580]   What's your doctor?
[01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:25.060]   What's your Twitter handle?
[01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:26.620]   - Oh, doctor, I'm a doctor on everything
[01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:28.020]   and if I'm not there, it's not relevant.
[01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:30.860]   - O-H-T, O-C-T-A-H.
[01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:35.580]   When I quit Twitter, I was at 611,000 followers.
[01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:37.060]   I'm now down to 500,000.
[01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:39.540]   So I think a lot of those are bots
[01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:41.100]   'cause the truth is the less you tweet,
[01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:43.860]   the more followers you get in my experience.
[01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:47.220]   Oh, and JJ, who's that lady on your picture?
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:48.340]   - Oh, I do photography.
[01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:51.060]   It's from my secret Instagram that I have.
[01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:52.940]   So when people follow me and they get to see stuff,
[01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:53.940]   I post up every once in a while.
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:54.780]   - Secret the secret.
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:55.780]   - But I do stuff.
[01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:57.620]   - Yeah, I do stuff every once in a while.
[01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:02.180]   Secrets are show today brought to you by a better way
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:04.220]   to invest.
[01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:06.780]   You see what, you see the trouble John's gotten into
[01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:09.540]   by buying individual stocks on his own.
[01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:12.620]   You see the trouble he's gotten into
[01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:14.220]   if he'd only gone to betterment,
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:19.220]   the investing tool for people who refuse to settle for average.

[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:29.140]   A very important word for you.
[01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:32.100]   A fiduciary means they work on your behalf.
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:34.220]   They make recommendations in your best interest.
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:36.740]   They're not incentivized to sell funds.
[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:38.980]   They don't have their own investment products to sell.
[01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:43.020]   They are advisors helping you get the most for your money
[01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:45.660]   and they do it for a lot less
[01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:47.220]   than that guy with a shingle down the street,
[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:48.460]   by the way, they're a lot smarter.
[01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:51.220]   And they use modern technology to make it easy.
[01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:53.060]   The betterment app is stunning.

[01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:57.740]   talk to an investment advisor,
[01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:00.460]   you just want to get text messages and get information,
[01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:03.260]   the app is fantastic and it costs you even less.
[01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:05.140]   It's a flat fee.
[01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:07.100]   There are no hidden costs anywhere
[01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:09.100]   no matter how much money you invest,

[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:15.180]   And yes, they may transact a lot,
[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:16.860]   sometimes many times a day,
[01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:18.820]   doing things like tax loss harvesting,
[01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:21.060]   but you never pay a transaction fee.
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:24.020]   It's just one low management fee.
[01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:26.140]   Betterment gives you constant access
[01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:29.860]   to the key information and tools that the pros have.

[01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:38.180]   Investment involves risk.

[01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:08.820]   Okay, I will let you, we could talk about Google,
[01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:10.740]   we could talk about Microsoft, we could talk about,
[01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.700]   oh, let's talk about Elon Musk.
[01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:15.180]   Everybody's-- - Everybody's here.
[01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:16.340]   - Everybody's pal.
[01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:17.420]   - What a gift.
[01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:18.740]   It's the gift to keep some giving.
[01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:19.580]   Elon Musk.
[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:22.380]   Now he started the year on a high note.
[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:24.500]   In February, they launched that Falcon Heavy
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:29.300]   with his Tesla Roadster in it and the Starman.
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:32.540]   And they did the most amazing thing we've ever seen.
[01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:34.860]   I remember we watched this live onto it.
[01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:38.780]   They landed those two boosters in tandem.
[01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:40.220]   Remember seeing that?
[01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:43.420]   That was the most mind-boggling thing I've ever seen.
[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:48.020]   Let me reload this page so you can see the animated GIF.
[01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:49.220]   It's like ballet.
[01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:50.060]   - GIF.
[01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:51.740]   - Really?
[01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:52.740]   You got to go there?
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:54.980]   (laughing)
[01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:57.540]   - Really? - Oh, bring out the laser cast.
[01:05:57.540 --> 01:05:58.380]   - Really?
[01:05:58.380 --> 01:05:59.540]   - It's the guy who invented it,
[01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:01.820]   it's what he calls it, so I felt it.
[01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:03.420]   - Okay, GIF, should I say GIF?
[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:04.260]   - You should.
[01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:05.260]   - I'll do whatever you tell me to do.
[01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:06.100]   - Oh really?
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:06.940]   - Yeah.
[01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:07.780]   - It's a GIF?
[01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:08.620]   - Graphic.
[01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:09.460]   - Graphic and a change format.
[01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:10.300]   - Yeah.
[01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:11.140]   - Call whatever you want.
[01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:11.980]   - Is it a gift?
[01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:14.580]   Do you want a gift or a gift for the holidays?
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:15.420]   - A gift.
[01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:16.740]   (laughing)
[01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:17.580]   - A gift.
[01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:18.420]   - Not getting anything.
[01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:21.020]   - I don't care about the debate, I'll call it a GIF.
[01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:21.860]   - I didn't call it a GIF.
[01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:25.060]   - It's pretty, so okay, so Elon's doing some amazing things,
[01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:26.860]   even Tesla's doing some amazing things,
[01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:29.860]   but then he's also doing some incredibly stupid things
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:32.340]   mostly around his Twitter account.
[01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:33.180]   Like the 20s--
[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:34.340]   - Just like the president?
[01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:35.500]   - Just like the president.
[01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:40.500]   - Yeah, I think some people should just not tweet.
[01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:42.660]   - I don't know what he's thinking,
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:43.900]   'cause Elon, when he tweets,
[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:47.620]   it affects the SEC relationships.
[01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:50.300]   - Yeah, so Elon, as you may remember
[01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:51.700]   about the middle of the year,
[01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:54.700]   reasons no one knows,
[01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:58.660]   said I'm thinking about taking Tesla private
[01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:00.860]   for 420 a share,
[01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:02.740]   wink, wink, nudge, nudge, right?
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:03.580]   - Or some believable.
[01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:05.500]   - Apparently, I'm surprised he's not in jail for that.
[01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.220]   - He was trying to impress Grimes,
[01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:10.260]   his hipster girlfriend with the pot reference.
[01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:11.100]   - Right.
[01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:12.500]   - 420 a share. - Oh, you know,
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:14.260]   I somehow missed that reference.
[01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:15.380]   - It was for Grimes.
[01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:16.380]   - I didn't know that.
[01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:19.820]   - Of course, 420 a share.
[01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:20.980]   And that's for--
[01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:23.900]   - That's why he smoked pot on the Logan show.
[01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:27.860]   - Yeah, so then people said,
[01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:28.700]   well, wait a minute,
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:29.540]   how are you gonna do that?
[01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:32.180]   And he says, "Funding secured."
[01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:34.260]   - Yes. - "Funding secured."
[01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:35.740]   Which implies that he actually had the money,
[01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:36.900]   which he didn't.
[01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:38.740]   He thought he had the Saudi government.
[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:39.940]   By the way, it's probably a good thing
[01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:42.140]   he didn't take the money from the Saudi government.
[01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:43.900]   There's a few companies in Silicon Valley
[01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:45.780]   who wish they hadn't.
[01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:47.660]   It turned out he didn't have the funding secured.
[01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:48.500]   And the SEC said,
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:52.140]   that's kind of a material misstatement of the facts.
[01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:55.300]   That's what we call a forward looking statement.
[01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:57.540]   And they find him $20 million.
[01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:58.860]   He says-- - Am I right?
[01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:00.060]   - It was worth it.
[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:01.700]   - He just all had to do with it.
[01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:02.860]   - He needed to put a little link
[01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:04.740]   that said safe harbor statement.
[01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:05.900]   He needed to be like linked to very--
[01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:08.220]   - It is not a forward looking statement.
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:10.620]   - This is not a prospectus or an offering of funds.
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:11.460]   - I hate the drug, William.
[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:12.900]   (laughing)
[01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:14.020]   - I'd like to say two things.
[01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:15.300]   - He was pumping dump.
[01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:18.340]   - One, we're not going to Mars.
[01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:20.020]   And two-- - Yes, he says
[01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:21.220]   we're gonna live in Mars.
[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:23.060]   So you and me-- - Just one, we're not going--
[01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:24.220]   - And you're not going-- - We're not going beard.
[01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:25.780]   We're moving to Mars, dude.
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:27.380]   - No one's going to Mars.
[01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:28.220]   - You're gonna be my second grade.
[01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:30.260]   - And she a lover on Mars.
[01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:33.340]   It's gonna be you and the green beard on the red planet.
[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:34.180]   - I'm trying to focus you,
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:35.020]   not gonna bring my focus in.
[01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:38.020]   And secondly, that man needs to shut up
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:39.060]   with his self-help tips,
[01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:40.620]   because obviously he needs a nap.
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:43.780]   He's a cranky child who only gets four hours of sleep
[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:45.980]   and thinks that he can still run the world to be Ironman.
[01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:47.380]   He needs sleep.
[01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:48.780]   Somebody stank him on his butt,
[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:51.220]   give him his 420, give him a blanket,
[01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:52.420]   and put him to bed.
[01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:53.860]   - That time for Elon. - And that's his problem.
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:55.060]   He needs to sleep.
[01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:56.860]   - ♪ Naptown for Elon ♪
[01:08:56.860 --> 01:08:58.700]   - It's most of us. - And Germany.
[01:08:58.700 --> 01:08:59.980]   (laughing)
[01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:02.740]   - My land was my land once more.
[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:04.460]   (laughing)
[01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:05.700]   - He got going to Mars.
[01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:06.740]   - Joe Rogan, do you know Joe?
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:07.580]   You probably know Joe,
[01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:09.180]   you're a famous podcaster, John C. de Vorak.
[01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:10.020]   You probably know Joe Rogan.
[01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:14.700]   - I know of him, I know him kind of,
[01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:15.780]   but I've never been on a show
[01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:18.260]   'cause he doesn't have people like me on a show.
[01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:20.300]   - Who does he have on a show?
[01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:22.420]   - I don't know, whoever, you have to ask the Booker.
[01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:24.220]   - I gotta get on Joe Rogan. - I need a little bit.
[01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:27.180]   - 'Cause my son doesn't think I'm anything
[01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:28.260]   until I get on Joe Rogan.
[01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:30.140]   He says, "You ought to be on Joe Rogan."
[01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:32.060]   - So you could be on the Jimmy Fallon show
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:32.900]   and you wouldn't be anything.
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:33.900]   - What matter?
[01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:35.100]   - Son's 26.
[01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:35.940]   I bet Jason's the same.
[01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:37.100]   - Joe Rogan needs to be on Twitter.
[01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:38.420]   How about that?
[01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:40.420]   - No, I don't think that would impress him.
[01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:42.940]   I said, "You know what, you wanna impress him?
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:44.340]   "You bring the man to you.
[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:45.580]   "You bring the mountain to you."
[01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:48.900]   - Joe, I got a bottle of something that looks like
[01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:51.620]   a hundred year old Remy Konyak waiting for you.
[01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:55.420]   Waiting for you and a tulip last to boot.
[01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:59.580]   So he goes on, Elon does, goes on Joe Rogan.
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:04.300]   And Joe, actually in a very wise move,
[01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:06.820]   says, "Would you like to smoke a joint with me?"
[01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:08.740]   - It's legal in California.
[01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:10.820]   - I think that's a brilliant podcaster move.
[01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:13.020]   - I thought it was dynamite.
[01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:13.860]   - And then-- - There I am
[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:15.820]   with legal alcohol.
[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:17.420]   - Yeah, this is, come on.
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:18.580]   - Come on, this is child's.
[01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:22.460]   - Some crappy LA weed, I mean, it can't be that good.
[01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:27.020]   - The Navy immediately says,
[01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:29.860]   "We're gonna have to look at our contracts with SpaceX."
[01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:32.300]   'Cause you're not supposed to smoke pot if you're
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:34.940]   doing defense contracting.
[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:36.860]   - Well, I don't know, is that true?
[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:37.980]   - Well, it turned out it didn't affect him.
[01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:38.940]   No, the Navy didn't pull out.
[01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:40.100]   They said, "Yeah, it's okay."
[01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:41.340]   - Donded it again.
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:42.500]   - No, NASA.
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:45.300]   - Because it's just because nobody in the Navy
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:46.980]   ever smokes pot.
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:48.660]   - Uh-huh, what are those ropes made out of?
[01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:49.500]   Oh, hemp.
[01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:50.340]   - Yeah.
[01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:55.020]   - Anyway, immediately the CAO,
[01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:58.940]   the chief accounting officer of Tesla left
[01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:02.540]   after a month on the job, apparently not a fan.
[01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:05.500]   - He may have seen something in the books
[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:06.580]   that he didn't like.
[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:10.860]   - Maybe he just didn't want to work for Elon.
[01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:13.980]   There was a very strong article
[01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:17.020]   about how hard it is to work for Elon Musk.
[01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:18.620]   That came out this week.
[01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:19.940]   - I think it's hard to work for a lot of people.
[01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:21.620]   - He's like hard to work for the same way
[01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:22.940]   as Steve Jobs was hard to work for.
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:25.500]   - Yeah, I mean, people work for him and gladly.
[01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:27.420]   - But the thing is, is I think that they see,
[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:29.180]   you know, when you're at that,
[01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:30.780]   when you're a founder especially, I think,
[01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:34.180]   you see this gap between where the world is
[01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:35.740]   and where you could see it could be,
[01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:37.180]   and it makes you angry all the time,
[01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:38.300]   and you just keep on, you know,
[01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:40.980]   you're just kind of trying to push it that direction.
[01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:42.820]   And I think that that's part of what,
[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:45.820]   a lot of these founders, you know, get caught up in,
[01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:48.220]   is they can see a long way down the road,
[01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:50.220]   and they're just frustrated they can't go any faster,
[01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:51.820]   and they have to do it through all these people
[01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:53.380]   that aren't moving as fast as they'd like.
[01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:54.500]   - That's a good way to put it.
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:55.340]   - You know, and so there's--
[01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:56.460]   - And so there's some truth to that.
[01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:57.620]   - That's a good way to put it.
[01:11:57.620 --> 01:11:59.500]   - So they're frustrated and angry at people.
[01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:01.060]   - 'Cause you got, I mean, you look at somebody who's doing
[01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:02.220]   what he's doing with SpaceX,
[01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:03.940]   what he's done with electric vehicles.
[01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:05.020]   - Right, now you got a tunnel.
[01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:06.020]   - I promise you, you don't have, okay,
[01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:08.900]   the tunnel is something he had a little something
[01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:10.140]   before he designed that thing.
[01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:12.660]   It's basically, he reinvented the subway.
[01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:15.300]   Only, it has no exits.
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:17.540]   You go, you have to own a Tesla to go in it,
[01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:18.860]   and it has to be especially equipped Tesla
[01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:21.620]   with sideways wheels, and it only goes 49 miles an hour,
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:22.460]   and it's bumpy.
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:24.980]   - No, it goes 125 according to him.
[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:26.900]   - It will, but it doesn't yet.
[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:28.500]   And they put you in a little tractor,
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:29.780]   a little thing. - There's an elevator,
[01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:30.620]   the two two two two two two.
[01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:31.460]   - Yeah, it drops you into a--
[01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:32.300]   - One person at a time, of course.
[01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:34.860]   - 'Cause Elon doesn't like mixing with the little people.
[01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:36.300]   - In a subway train.
[01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:40.380]   - What Elon should do is go and embrace his full on Iron Man
[01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:43.100]   and make more blow torches for the government
[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:45.340]   and guns or something, 'cause that thing was cool.
[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:46.340]   That thing was badass.
[01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:49.500]   - All that is, all that is, it's a finishing torch
[01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:52.980]   for roofs that they just put a bunch of stuff
[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:53.820]   on the front of it.
[01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:55.820]   - It's not anything like a flamethrower.
[01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:56.900]   - No, it'd be awesome.
[01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:58.780]   - It just was $500.
[01:12:58.780 --> 01:12:59.620]   How much would that cost?
[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:00.940]   - And they sold it out.
[01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:02.660]   - It would cost $500.
[01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:03.500]   - The roofing-- - They'd make it yourself.
[01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:04.340]   - They'd make it yourself.
[01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:05.180]   - They sold out 30 seconds.
[01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:07.220]   - The roofing torch itself is not very expensive.
[01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:09.420]   I think it's probably like $120 or something.
[01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:13.420]   But to build your own exterior,
[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:14.420]   they make it look like a gun
[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:16.220]   and to make it all like all those things,
[01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:17.860]   that would cost more.
[01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:19.980]   - Somebody in the chat said,
[01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:21.180]   "He should make a chainsaw gun."
[01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:22.100]   I'm down for that too.
[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:23.420]   I buy one of those. - There you go.
[01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:25.660]   - 500 bucks, but the-- - But a rail gun.
[01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:26.700]   - Hey, wait a minute now.
[01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:28.900]   Here's a Magnum L100 field torch kit
[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:31.340]   with a standard nozzle, 142.75.
[01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:32.620]   - Right, get that. - Get a plastic
[01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:33.460]   button around it.
[01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:34.300]   - I know, but once you got done with that--
[01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:36.140]   - Get that Nerf pistol, put that on there.
[01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:38.500]   - If you take the time that it takes to do it
[01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:41.540]   and put all that in and you account for all those things,
[01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:42.700]   $500 is not a bad thing.
[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:44.420]   - It'd be kind of cool to have it in New York City.
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.700]   - Yeah, really.
[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:47.660]   I wonder how many people who bought this,
[01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:49.100]   like is it on the wall?
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:49.940]   Is it what I would like?
[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:51.740]   - No, no, no, no, this is a party trick.
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:53.380]   This is a party trick out by the pool.
[01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:56.380]   Hey guys, let's, we finished Suveen.
[01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:58.060]   We finished Suveen or our steak
[01:13:58.060 --> 01:13:59.460]   and you pull out the gun and like--
[01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:00.300]   (loud whirring)
[01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:01.140]   - It's not good for that.
[01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:01.980]   - It's not, it's said too.
[01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:03.540]   - But you'd still do it.
[01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:04.380]   - Doesn't mean anything for a car.
[01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:05.980]   - I don't know if I think the meat would be ruined
[01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:06.820]   by whatever that is.
[01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:09.020]   - The gun doesn't have to be good for it.
[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:11.980]   - My favorite thing is a rapper bought one of these
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:14.980]   and had no idea who Elon Musk was.
[01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:16.780]   And as he's playing around with it,
[01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:17.580]   he's just talking about,
[01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:19.060]   "Man, whoever made this thing is a genius."
[01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:20.380]   And the person next to him is like,
[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:22.620]   "Yeah, the guy who made Tesla, the space guy,
[01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:23.540]   "I don't know who that guy is,
[01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:25.500]   "who ever made this thing is a genius."
[01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:27.380]   And he's just throwing flames in air.
[01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:29.220]   So it's definitely a party trick type of deal.
[01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:30.220]   - He sold two million.
[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:32.380]   - He's got four and a half million dollars
[01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:33.380]   worth of roofing torches.
[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:34.700]   - I thought it was 20 million.
[01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:35.540]   - 20 million.
[01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:37.860]   - Yeah, I think he sold 20 million dollars.
[01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:39.140]   - The register said,
[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:40.420]   "This guy could sell pork pies
[01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:42.380]   "at a rabbinical convention."
[01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:45.740]   - What did he sell hats or something boring hats
[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:48.300]   or something stupid to that he sold out of?
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:49.780]   Like I said, he's good at selling stuff.
[01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:50.700]   Everything with cars.
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:51.860]   - He sells stuff.
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:53.140]   - He sells plenty of cars.
[01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:54.580]   - He's a good sales guy.
[01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:55.900]   - He sells me at the videos.
[01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:57.580]   - He sells every car he can make.
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:59.980]   - He sells a lot of them buried in the desert too.
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:01.340]   If you look a little rough.
[01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:02.420]   - Next to the ET cartridges.
[01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:05.180]   - There's a whole bunch of cars in the desert.
[01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:06.500]   Yes, you can look at--
[01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:07.660]   - He sell years like flops?
[01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:09.220]   - They don't know why they're there.
[01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:12.220]   It could be dogs, it could be lemons, who knows?
[01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:14.220]   - He sells three order of cigars, I know that.
[01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:19.020]   - He sells, I'm gonna find the Tesla cars buried
[01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:19.860]   in the desert.
[01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:21.780]   - They're not buried, they're above ground.
[01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:23.100]   They're not, they don't take a hole
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:24.420]   and put them in there.
[01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:26.180]   - They're parked in the desert.
[01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:28.060]   - He put them in the tunnel.
[01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:29.740]   He's made, that's what he's making the subway.
[01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:30.580]   - The tunnel's four.
[01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:31.900]   - Hide all the cars.
[01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:35.420]   - Fill them up with Teslas and then hit that
[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:36.460]   flamethrower and burn them all.
[01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:37.580]   - I think they're all piled right on top
[01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:40.140]   of the power computing computers.
[01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:42.700]   - Or the ET cartridges.
[01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:43.500]   - Yeah, there you go.
[01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:44.340]   - Next.
[01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:46.060]   - Next, we're done with Elon.
[01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:47.260]   - I think so.
[01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:48.340]   - Just before-- - Question.
[01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:50.620]   - A verdict, verdict on Mr. Musk.
[01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:52.900]   Brilliant genius, needs a nap.
[01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:53.740]   Is it, do we--
[01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:56.020]   - I think needs a nap.
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:56.860]   - Both.
[01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:57.700]   - Okay.
[01:15:57.700 --> 01:15:58.540]   - Both.
[01:15:58.540 --> 01:15:59.380]   - Okay, both.
[01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:00.220]   - Well, give them both.
[01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:01.220]   He's a genius at something.
[01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:02.060]   - Yeah, he needs a nap.
[01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:03.140]   - And he needs a nap.
[01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:07.220]   Acquisitions this year.
[01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:08.860]   AT&T bought Time Warner.
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:11.020]   A judge said no problem.
[01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:12.020]   Go right ahead.
[01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:16.180]   Own Time Warner, AT&T promised we will not raise prices.
[01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:17.780]   First thing they did.
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:19.420]   - I raised prices.
[01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:20.420]   Yeah, we can promise all you.
[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:21.260]   - They're all screwed.
[01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:22.620]   - A prize, you could promise anything you want.
[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:23.460]   If the judge says it's okay.
[01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:25.700]   - They're not doing any of that.
[01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:26.980]   - Bottom line, is they're all screwed.
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:27.820]   - T-Mobile.
[01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:30.260]   By Sprint.
[01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:32.980]   26 and a half billion dollars, or maybe not.
[01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:34.100]   - They've been trying to do that one forever.
[01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:35.060]   - That hasn't closed yet.
[01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:38.060]   They got regulatory approval from CFIUS.
[01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:39.140]   - It actually makes sense though,
[01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:41.780]   because there's no way that T-Mobile or Sprint can--
[01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:42.620]   - On their own.
[01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:43.820]   - Go head to head with Verizon and AT&T
[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:46.780]   without being together, so it makes sense.
[01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:48.820]   - The biggest software acquisition ever,
[01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:50.260]   this must have stunned you, John.
[01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:51.700]   You probably choked on your licorice.
[01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:54.940]   IBM to buy Red Hat for $34 billion.
[01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:56.660]   - Yeah, well they've always been,
[01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:58.900]   IBM's been huge, Linux supporters since
[01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:00.180]   to get go literally.
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:01.020]   - Yep.
[01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:02.380]   - And so they saw this and said,
[01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:06.340]   well, Red Hat is a pretty commercial place.
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:08.860]   I mean, they do the high-end stuff for people
[01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:11.820]   that they put a Red Hat installation in.
[01:17:11.820 --> 01:17:13.780]   - It was a service company, basically.
[01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:14.620]   - Yeah.
[01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:15.460]   - For a free product.
[01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:16.300]   - And that's what--
[01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:17.140]   - It's pretty amazing.
[01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:17.980]   - It's actually brilliant.
[01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:19.220]   They made a very, I don't think they're,
[01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:20.660]   I mean their sales aren't $34 billion,
[01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:21.620]   there was a few billion a year,
[01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:23.180]   but they made a very successful--
[01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:24.340]   - They paid too much.
[01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:25.180]   - Yeah, they paid too much.
[01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:26.740]   But they made a very successful service company
[01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:30.140]   on a free product, which was an innovative thing at the time.
[01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:32.340]   It's actually the business model for open source software.
[01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:33.900]   - Right.
[01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:34.940]   - Well--
[01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:38.620]   - Isn't that a local garage that services Lexuses
[01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:39.460]   or Toyotas, they're not--
[01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:40.380]   - It's a profitable business?
[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:41.700]   - They're not selling cars.
[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:42.540]   - Right.
[01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:43.740]   They're selling service.
[01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:46.100]   - No, you were saying what?
[01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:48.100]   - You John always thought highly of IBM
[01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:50.580]   because you said they got the patents.
[01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:52.500]   - Yeah, they still do, although it turns out
[01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:55.500]   that the Chinese now, especially Huawei,
[01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:58.020]   is now the patent kickassers.
[01:17:58.020 --> 01:17:59.900]   - Oh, we're getting a Huawei.
[01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:00.740]   - Huawei, Huawei.
[01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:01.580]   - We're getting a Huawei.
[01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:03.540]   I wanna do a whole thing on China,
[01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:05.660]   but let's finish the acquisitions.
[01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:08.780]   Finally, oh no, let's see.
[01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:09.620]   This is a minor one.
[01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:11.900]   Flickr was bought by SmugMuck.
[01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:13.060]   - What's Flickr?
[01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:14.060]   - Yeah, who cares?
[01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:15.060]   (laughs)
[01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:17.100]   - That's a Yahoo photo site, right?
[01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:20.460]   But Yahoo, which was bought by Verizon,
[01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:21.980]   turned out to be not such a good acquisition.
[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:23.380]   - What was the point?
[01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:25.740]   - They've written down the cost of it.
[01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:27.180]   They've written down, I can't remember,
[01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:28.820]   a huge amount, 100 billion, 400 billion,
[01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:30.820]   some amount of money.
[01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:32.460]   - It's still-- - And they were gonna call it OHS.
[01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:33.300]   - It's still, I think John--
[01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:34.460]   - Oh, it does drive, I forgot that already.
[01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:36.220]   - It got rid of the OHS name, that didn't work.
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:37.660]   - But I think that-- - 4.6 billion.
[01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:39.420]   - Isn't Yahoo still like the third,
[01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:42.100]   the third most visited or second most visited website?
[01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:43.940]   - Really?
[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:45.980]   - When's the last time you went to Yahoo?
[01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:46.980]   - 2012?
[01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:47.820]   - I think it is.
[01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:49.020]   - But I'm just saying, I'm not saying,
[01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:51.380]   I went to do it, but I--
[01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:53.460]   - They're gonna rebrand both--
[01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:54.700]   - I'm just saying they killed Tumblr.
[01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:56.140]   Tumblr's gonna be on this way out.
[01:18:56.140 --> 01:18:57.820]   I wanna go see their traffic.
[01:18:57.820 --> 01:19:00.260]   - Wait a minute, they killed it by taking the porn out?
[01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:01.500]   - Oh yeah.
[01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:02.340]   - I agree.
[01:19:02.340 --> 01:19:06.180]   It was just a porn storage facility.
[01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:09.140]   - I tell you what, I always give out
[01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:11.060]   little secret gems and stuff like that.
[01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:14.660]   I would use Tumblr and explicit content
[01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:16.260]   to direct traffic, free traffic,
[01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:18.180]   because you put the right ad word in there,
[01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:19.180]   you put the right click in there,
[01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:21.260]   people see a boob and they'd click on anything.
[01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:22.860]   You could send some free traffic
[01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:25.100]   and boost up some numbers real quick on Tumblr,
[01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:26.260]   but they don't wanna shut that down.
[01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:28.580]   So I gotta go find the new avenue to eat my lunch at
[01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:29.660]   on my sneak tip.
[01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:32.060]   But, you know, it's on its way down.
[01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:33.020]   Now I don't know who's going to tell them.
[01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:35.900]   My daughter's websites on Tomatoes there.
[01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:37.500]   So there's a bunch of SpongeBob videos all day.
[01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:38.340]   - That's what I was trying to say about it,
[01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:40.500]   because Tumblr was a really nice, easy place
[01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:42.940]   for young people to make, not a porn site,
[01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:45.860]   but just a little blog, pictures, stuff like that.
[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:47.860]   - So million places you can do that.
[01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:48.860]   - That is simple.
[01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:50.460]   - That is not as easy.
[01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:52.780]   - Tumblr had a look and feel that I thought really was easy.
[01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:54.620]   - I have to admit, when they said that they were
[01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:56.900]   down and braiding, they were getting rid of all the porn.
[01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:58.700]   I was like, Tumblr is still around?
[01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:01.820]   Like I was kind of surprised that it was still there.
[01:20:01.820 --> 01:20:03.380]   - Well you don't get porn off.
[01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:05.260]   - Yeah, and it's really weird,
[01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:07.500]   'cause Tumblr was like a storage depot for porn.
[01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:09.060]   - Facility, yes, it was over.
[01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:10.140]   - Yeah, it's just-- - It's just,
[01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:12.220]   I have porn silo.
[01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:17.220]   - Tumblr's so insane, like it's like a daytime kid show,
[01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:18.860]   but it is a nighttime after party.
[01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:21.540]   It's really weird how many cartoons and gifts
[01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:23.300]   and fun stuff that goes on,
[01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:24.780]   and then there's like this dark road.
[01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:26.940]   I thought they kept it pretty separated,
[01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:29.380]   but again, it's like they shut that part of it down.
[01:20:29.380 --> 01:20:31.580]   I'm like, well you just cut out half of your traffic.
[01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:32.420]   - So-- - And you know why
[01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:33.780]   they shut it down, Sosta Festa.
[01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:34.780]   - I fully understand.
[01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:36.460]   - Sosta Festa.
[01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:37.660]   - Sosta Festa.
[01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:39.180]   - Explain Apple.
[01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:40.020]   - No.
[01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:40.860]   - No, well it was--
[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:42.340]   - It was, Apple was the approximate cause,
[01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:44.180]   'cause Apple banned the Tumblr app from the iPhone.
[01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:45.540]   - They turned it off. - They turned it off.
[01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:46.540]   - And the Tumblr had to do something really fast.
[01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:47.740]   - They killed the porn applet, said,
[01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:49.180]   okay fine, you can come back.
[01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:51.660]   But Apple said it was 'cause of child Kitty porn.
[01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:53.060]   They said it was 'cause Kitty porn.
[01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:54.580]   - I'm sure there's tons of it on there.
[01:20:54.580 --> 01:20:55.940]   - Yeah, because they-- - Why isn't the government
[01:20:55.940 --> 01:20:58.340]   going there and cracked down and arrest people?
[01:20:58.340 --> 01:21:00.420]   - That's what they should do, but--
[01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:01.900]   - I mean, Kitty porn, you can't keep it,
[01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:03.940]   you can't look at it, you can't do anything with it.
[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:05.220]   Somebody's storing it.
[01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:06.060]   - Too bad someone-- - Some is like
[01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:08.900]   a giant silo of porn to keep it in.
[01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:10.140]   - Yes, don't you think the government
[01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:11.260]   should go crack down on it?
[01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:13.620]   They should have arrested Marissa Meyer.
[01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:16.260]   - Sosta Festa. - Sosta, Sosta Festa.
[01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:17.300]   - Or is it Sosta?
[01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:18.900]   - Sosta, Fosta.
[01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:19.780]   - Fosta, pasta.
[01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:21.820]   - These were the two bills-- - Fosta?
[01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:25.180]   - That were passed by Congress to,
[01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:27.140]   ostensibly to ban sex trafficking.
[01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:29.860]   What they really did is they eliminated Section 230
[01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:31.780]   of the Communications Decency Act,
[01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:34.740]   which said internet platforms were not liable
[01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:36.220]   for the acts their users commit.
[01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:39.220]   They were publishers, or not even publishers,
[01:21:39.220 --> 01:21:40.460]   they were platforms, not public.
[01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:41.980]   - Yeah, this is an excuse for storing porn
[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:43.340]   in illegal images.
[01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:45.660]   That's what you'd use it.
[01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:48.860]   - There's a blue pole, and you could drive a truck through it.
[01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:51.340]   - But as a result, certainly sex trafficking sites
[01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:54.100]   went away, and Craigslist stopped having adult listings,
[01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:58.460]   but it also made it hard for adult content anywhere.
[01:21:58.460 --> 01:22:00.140]   In fact, Facebook-- - Facebook, Facebook,
[01:22:00.140 --> 01:22:02.060]   they didn't go away, they just changed.
[01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:04.220]   - Yeah, that's right. - They went under a rock.
[01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:07.900]   - They didn't go away, they just changed the .ch.
[01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:10.500]   They're all still there, they just had to adapt,
[01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:11.500]   like everything else does.
[01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:13.380]   The same way porn's always the first
[01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:15.700]   to definitely acknowledge your first one's used to 4K video.
[01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:17.660]   - I wanna hear that. - HTML5, all that stuff.
[01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:20.740]   - It's also, though, porn is not the first in technology.
[01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:22.900]   - I'm talking about from video.
[01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:24.500]   - I'm talking about from video.
[01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:26.820]   - Yeah, VHS took over from Betamax,
[01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:28.860]   because VHS you can record a whole football game
[01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:29.940]   in a complete movie.
[01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:31.780]   It had to do with the amount of time you could store it,
[01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:33.380]   had nothing to do with porn.
[01:22:33.380 --> 01:22:35.620]   - Well, you couldn't get porn on beta, though.
[01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:37.020]   (laughing)
[01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:38.020]   - You would know.
[01:22:38.020 --> 01:22:39.220]   - No, I wouldn't, but that.
[01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:40.700]   (laughing)
[01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:42.660]   See, this is why you can't have these.
[01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:44.020]   Now my wife's leaving.
[01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:45.940]   You can't have these conversations.
[01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:47.300]   - You're a good lawyer.
[01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:50.260]   (laughing)
[01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:51.100]   - All right.
[01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:52.660]   - Oth 79, I don't know any better.
[01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:53.660]   - I don't know anything about it.
[01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:54.660]   - I don't know.
[01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:55.980]   What's porn, I don't know.
[01:22:55.980 --> 01:23:00.980]   Oth, which was the merged Verizon merged AOL Yahoo,
[01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:04.340]   is no longer Oth, it's the Verizon media group
[01:23:04.340 --> 01:23:05.860]   starting in the next year.
[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:07.580]   - It goes to my crazy thing, like,
[01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:09.580]   Oth is something so mundane.
[01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:10.580]   - You can't even remember the name.
[01:23:10.580 --> 01:23:11.860]   - But every time you heard Oth, you were like,
[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:13.460]   "I really, this is 20."
[01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:15.900]   - Did you probably did a lot of meetings to keep with Oth.
[01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:17.220]   - Some stuff in there is valuable.
[01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:19.340]   - Huff post, no, not so much.
[01:23:19.340 --> 01:23:21.180]   10 crunch. - That's kind of worth something.
[01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:22.020]   - That crunch is worth it.
[01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:23.940]   - Engage it, and tumblr.
[01:23:23.940 --> 01:23:27.500]   - People read Huff post on Facebook.
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:30.060]   - Huff post probably still drives a lot of traffic.
[01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:31.900]   - I don't know what it was about Huff post that I just stopped.
[01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:34.620]   I just was like, "Yeah, okay."
[01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:37.380]   - I'll tell you what, it was a paid content.
[01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:38.540]   - Yeah, that's what it was.
[01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:39.380]   - That's what it was.
[01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:41.460]   - You couldn't tell if you were reading an article
[01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:43.900]   by a real person or John C. Dvorak.
[01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:45.860]   It was just, it was undistent.
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:47.020]   You couldn't.
[01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:48.540]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:50.140]   - You couldn't get paid for that fake content.
[01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:51.620]   - See, they would steal, but that's what they would do.
[01:23:51.620 --> 01:23:52.940]   They would just take your stuff
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:54.620]   and put it on an Huff post.
[01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:56.100]   We're linking, we're just linking.
[01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:57.820]   Finally, the last financial story
[01:23:57.820 --> 01:23:58.660]   then we'll take a break.
[01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:01.380]   Theranos finally shut down.
[01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:02.420]   - Did not get bought.
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:03.260]   Did not buy anyone.
[01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:04.820]   - No one was gonna buy him.
[01:24:04.820 --> 01:24:05.660]   - That was a mess.
[01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:08.300]   - And I wonder, investigations now, of course,
[01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:10.660]   into Elizabeth Holmes, the founder,
[01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:13.940]   as to whether she kind of was acting fraudulently or--
[01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:16.100]   - It's gonna be a hard decade for her.
[01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:18.340]   - It's, ooh, she was the media loved her
[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:20.100]   'cause she was a female Steve Jobs.
[01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:21.460]   She wore black turtleneck shoes.
[01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:23.940]   - Yes, she had a big, deep voice.
[01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:25.020]   - Turned like this.
[01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:27.820]   - I'm a girl with a deep voice.
[01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:30.060]   And I have a guy a couple of things to show you
[01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:32.020]   and the deck, they show you my,
[01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:34.860]   I can take your blood and tell you everything.
[01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:36.700]   - I only need to drop.
[01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:38.700]   - We need to get video of her and then have you do ADR
[01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:39.540]   over top of her.
[01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:41.020]   - That would be, that would work.
[01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:41.860]   - Yeah, it'd be great.
[01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:43.100]   Bad lip reading.
[01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:45.860]   - Elizabeth Holmes Theranos.
[01:24:45.860 --> 01:24:47.060]   All right, time for a little time.
[01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:47.900]   I'm having fun.
[01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:49.260]   Are you enjoying, is this okay?
[01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:51.100]   Would you like, Alex have some more--
[01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:52.100]   - Lap to.
[01:24:52.100 --> 01:24:52.940]   - Have some more.
[01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:53.780]   - Okay.
[01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:54.620]   - Let me pour it for you.
[01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:55.460]   - All right.
[01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:56.900]   - He knows how to handle a spare the row.
[01:24:56.900 --> 01:24:57.740]   - That correct.
[01:24:57.740 --> 01:24:59.500]   - All right, so Crystal.
[01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:00.340]   - It is quite good.
[01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:01.180]   - It's good.
[01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:03.020]   - It is, I mean, we're not doing that.
[01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:04.020]   - I'm not saying.
[01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:05.740]   - We're not getting paid for this.
[01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:07.460]   And the poor studio audience is sitting there
[01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:08.780]   with their tongues hanging out.
[01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:11.380]   - Not to mention Mr. Greenbeard over here.
[01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:13.140]   - Don't you have an eyedropper?
[01:25:13.140 --> 01:25:15.660]   Just go ahead and give them all like baby bird drops
[01:25:15.660 --> 01:25:18.180]   with eyedroppers so they can all get a taste in the audience.
[01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:20.740]   - I am not a brown, no, no, I've had enough.
[01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:21.740]   I am not a brown.
[01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:23.380]   (laughing)
[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:24.220]   - I'm all right.
[01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:26.140]   - I just want to say one thing.
[01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:29.620]   I am not a typically a brandy guy, but this is really,
[01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:31.220]   I would drink this.
[01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:32.060]   - All the time.
[01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:32.900]   - All the time.
[01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:34.180]   - All right.
[01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:35.100]   Really seriously.
[01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:35.940]   - As I was done is up.
[01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:38.460]   - You think that the 1803 or whatever this is as good as it.
[01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:39.700]   - 1837.
[01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:40.860]   - Oh, that's a better year.
[01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:42.260]   - Is it as good as this?
[01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:44.140]   - No, but if you put it in this bottle.
[01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:45.340]   - It becomes better.
[01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:46.860]   It's the bottle, it's magic bottle.
[01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:48.740]   - It will become better, he's right.
[01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:50.940]   - Actually, and the more you drink it, the better it becomes.
[01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:52.380]   - Before, hey, before we finish it.
[01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:53.460]   - You've been drinking that stuff.
[01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:54.300]   - Some other time.
[01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:55.860]   - You should do it like a, you get a bunch of different.
[01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:58.380]   - That stuff is so good.
[01:25:58.380 --> 01:25:59.700]   - We'll do the 1837.
[01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:00.780]   We'll do, John, you will come back for that.
[01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:02.300]   We could do it 1837.
[01:26:02.300 --> 01:26:03.140]   We'll do a taste test.
[01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:03.980]   We'll do this.
[01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:04.820]   - Was he gonna get a bottle?
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:06.140]   - No, no, they'll be in that one.
[01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:08.460]   - You have to do a little thing.
[01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:10.300]   - You're going.
[01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:11.820]   - I'm gonna send you some white honey for your free.
[01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:12.660]   - Wait, we're going.
[01:26:12.660 --> 01:26:14.100]   - You know, and you'll have to do a blindfold.
[01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:15.220]   - I sent a free birthday.
[01:26:15.220 --> 01:26:16.060]   - We'll do a little one.
[01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:17.620]   - Sonja, honey, where we're at.
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:18.980]   - Sonja, honey.
[01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:21.340]   John, do you think anybody,
[01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:24.460]   anybody under 60.
[01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:25.300]   - I don't care.
[01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:27.740]   - There's been two guys that listen to this podcast
[01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:30.540]   that will get that guy and you're gonna love me.
[01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:32.580]   - That's the hidden gem right there.
[01:26:32.580 --> 01:26:35.140]   - I go for the small market.
[01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:36.580]   - I think it's true.
[01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:39.340]   - And can I tell you how many people listen to you,
[01:26:39.340 --> 01:26:41.340]   Uncle Leo, so I'm out of bar,
[01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:42.660]   I'm having dinner with my friend
[01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:45.260]   and there's a guy across the bar and he's staring at me.
[01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:47.020]   And my friend's like, do you know that guy?
[01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:48.220]   And I'm like, no, she says,
[01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:49.940]   he's been staring at you for the last half an hour.
[01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:51.140]   I'm like, he's not looking at me.
[01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:51.980]   He's probably looking at you.
[01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:53.020]   You know, you're gonna look just like,
[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:54.260]   no, he's definitely looking at you.
[01:26:54.260 --> 01:26:55.300]   I go up to go to bathroom.
[01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:57.100]   - It doesn't have anything to do with your green hair.
[01:26:57.100 --> 01:26:58.460]   - And did he go to the bathroom?
[01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:00.140]   I'd be very suspicious.
[01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:01.740]   - He didn't follow me to the bathroom.
[01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:03.580]   But he watched me when I went to the bathroom.
[01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:05.980]   When I came back out, he was standing outside
[01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:08.180]   of the door to the bathroom and he goes,
[01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:09.220]   are you a doctor?
[01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:11.380]   And I'm like, oh God, I know who I am.
[01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:14.140]   And he's like, yeah, he was like 85, 90 years old.
[01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:16.420]   He's like, I've been a fan of Leo the port
[01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:18.980]   since Leo was Leo and I know he was not
[01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:20.020]   telling me endorsements.
[01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:21.660]   Thank you very much.
[01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:23.620]   - He was telling me everything about Uncle Leo.
[01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:25.220]   And I'm like, oh, you know me.
[01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:29.260]   You got fans from like my age all the way up to like dead.
[01:27:29.260 --> 01:27:31.180]   Like you just got them all lined up.
[01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:32.580]   They know you know, they know.
[01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:33.580]   - Leo the port. - Leo the doctor.
[01:27:33.580 --> 01:27:34.740]   - So Dr. Sonia Henny, look at that.
[01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:36.380]   She's looking right at you, Dr.
[01:27:36.380 --> 01:27:37.220]   - There she is.
[01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:38.380]   - Hey, that's a doll right there.
[01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:39.220]   She's a doll.
[01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:42.420]   - She's a famous, but she's Swedish skater.
[01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:43.580]   - All I know is her name.
[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:45.860]   (laughing)
[01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:47.620]   - You know what I like to throw in everyone so well?
[01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:48.940]   Ischka Bibble.
[01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:50.300]   - Ah, Ischka Bibble.
[01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:51.300]   - Ischka Bibble.
[01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:52.980]   And not her sister, Ischka Bibble.
[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:54.540]   - I don't know about that.
[01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:55.380]   - Or show--
[01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:57.180]   - Ischka Bibble.
[01:27:57.180 --> 01:27:58.860]   It's just looking like, you could look at us.
[01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:01.020]   - It's like Park your carcass.
[01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:02.540]   - Is there a person named Park your carcass?
[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:03.620]   - Yes, and that was his name,
[01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:06.220]   who's Albert Brooks's dad.
[01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:07.260]   - It's real name?
[01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:08.620]   - Yeah, Park your carcass.
[01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:10.900]   - I don't think so.
[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:12.500]   - Yeah, look it up.
[01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:13.580]   - I don't believe you.
[01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:14.420]   - Okay.
[01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:15.780]   - You don't have to, everybody else.
[01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:19.060]   - He wins, you understand folks, if I Google it.
[01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:19.900]   He wins.
[01:28:19.900 --> 01:28:20.900]   - Yeah.
[01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:21.740]   - This is the problem,
[01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:24.100]   you always have a credibility, you're incredulous.
[01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:26.820]   It's like you have to look up Park your carcass
[01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:28.260]   and Albert Brooks, and you'll find this--
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:30.300]   - Harry Einstein, known professionally
[01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:34.060]   by a multitude of names including yes.
[01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:38.580]   Park your carcass, he looks just like his son.
[01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:40.060]   It looks just like Albert Brooks, doesn't he?
[01:28:40.060 --> 01:28:41.300]   - Yeah, he does.
[01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:42.420]   - He's got that look.
[01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:45.340]   - He died on stage doing his act.
[01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:46.880]   - Probably the same as me.
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:49.660]   I think I died on stage.
[01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:50.980]   - You already died, years ago.
[01:28:50.980 --> 01:28:52.300]   - Many times, yes.
[01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:55.700]   - Nick Park your carcass, he created the name for a skit,
[01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:59.220]   obviously, but it became a character that he did
[01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:01.140]   on the radio on, oh you remember this,
[01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:03.420]   Eddie Cantor's radio show.
[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:04.900]   Remember that?
[01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:05.900]   - I have copies.
[01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:07.540]   - I have copies.
[01:29:07.540 --> 01:29:09.980]   How's no agenda doing, it's doing good.
[01:29:09.980 --> 01:29:11.100]   - We're doing well.
[01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:14.300]   - Oh, grammar police.
[01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:16.260]   - Grammar police ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:19.380]   - No agenda show which is on twice a week at nine o'clock lie.
[01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:22.460]   - Now twice a week which is I think a very good thing.
[01:29:22.460 --> 01:29:23.780]   - Gag never goes bad.
[01:29:23.780 --> 01:29:25.060]   (laughing)
[01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:28.180]   - Three years later, it still works.
[01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:29.380]   - Still does the same thing.
[01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:32.700]   - You do live Sunday and Thursday, yeah.
[01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:34.340]   - And it's fun to listen to 'cause
[01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:35.940]   you never know what could happen.
[01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:38.060]   - Well we don't rehearse the show.
[01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:41.540]   And we both developed material and then we--
[01:29:41.540 --> 01:29:43.580]   - It's Craig Cray and Buzzkill, it's so much fun.
[01:29:43.580 --> 01:29:44.940]   - Yeah, Craig Cray.
[01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:46.140]   And Buzzkill.
[01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:48.300]   - Didn't, did he just get married?
[01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:50.180]   - No, he's engaged.
[01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:51.220]   - Engaged, beautiful woman.
[01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:52.620]   - And I think she's very pretty.
[01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:54.900]   And I think he's going to get married.
[01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:55.700]   - Where did he move now?
[01:29:55.700 --> 01:29:56.660]   He's not in Texas, I'm trying to help him.
[01:29:56.660 --> 01:29:57.500]   - No, he's in Austin.
[01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:59.260]   - He's been in Austin for quite a while.
[01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:00.260]   - All right.
[01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:03.580]   'Cause the gun laws are lenient there, he likes that.
[01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:04.420]   (laughing)
[01:30:04.420 --> 01:30:05.820]   The last time he's on the show.
[01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:08.940]   - He flashed some bizarre shotgun pistol.
[01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:11.900]   - Shotgun pistol, the sheriff I think it's called
[01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:13.140]   or something like that.
[01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:18.140]   And Austin is a very liberal--
[01:30:18.140 --> 01:30:19.740]   - I like Austin.
[01:30:19.740 --> 01:30:21.140]   It's the People's Republic of Austin.
[01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:23.340]   - Yeah, very much like Santa Monica.
[01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:24.180]   - Yeah.
[01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:25.340]   - Without the peer of course.
[01:30:25.340 --> 01:30:26.660]   - With better food too.
[01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:27.740]   - Great barbecue.
[01:30:27.740 --> 01:30:29.340]   - We're going Austin in the spring I think.
[01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:30.180]   - No, you should go.
[01:30:30.180 --> 01:30:31.180]   - You're going to go to Southby.
[01:30:31.180 --> 01:30:32.020]   - Yeah, you want to help me?
[01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:32.940]   - You're going to give a speech no.
[01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:33.780]   Do you want--
[01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:34.860]   - Will your panel please come with us?
[01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:36.020]   - Oh, I love to go.
[01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:36.860]   - I'll pay your way.
[01:30:36.860 --> 01:30:37.700]   - You would now.
[01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:39.060]   - You could do a special no-admission.
[01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:41.300]   - You got to get me back to Spain, that was fun.
[01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:44.060]   - Oh man, so I don't know him.
[01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:47.540]   - The problem with the, we don't do the show face-to-face.
[01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:48.380]   We've already made this.
[01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:49.740]   - Would it be weird if you did?
[01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:51.300]   - Yeah, because the promise is like,
[01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:52.540]   we've talked about this.
[01:30:52.540 --> 01:30:55.460]   Doing the show apart, we can't cue each other.
[01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:57.300]   So when I like work with you,
[01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:59.820]   we've been in both the radio and I can cue you,
[01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:02.740]   you can cue me and it changes the dynamic of the show.
[01:31:02.740 --> 01:31:05.260]   - Yeah, it makes it smoother, more fluid.
[01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:06.100]   - No.
[01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:08.500]   (laughing)
[01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:11.340]   So you don't want it in any way, no way--
[01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:14.180]   - We've decided, no, we've decided we have our formula,
[01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:15.020]   we're sticking with it.
[01:31:15.020 --> 01:31:16.100]   - I like it.
[01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:16.940]   I like it.
[01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:19.980]   Noagendishow.com.
[01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:21.500]   - That's right, yes.
[01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:23.300]   It's also we can go and Google us
[01:31:23.300 --> 01:31:26.140]   and knowagendishow.com's great podcast.
[01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:27.500]   We, you know--
[01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:28.340]   - You know what I find--
[01:31:28.340 --> 01:31:30.900]   - It's all, it's completely supported by the listeners.
[01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:33.340]   We don't have any chance of getting new platformed.
[01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:36.300]   - No ads, no YouTube could kick you off for--
[01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:38.820]   - We're not on YouTube, we have our own infrastructure.
[01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:41.660]   - And you told me that when you go,
[01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:43.820]   you know, to do shows and bars and stuff,
[01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:45.780]   you bring like a silk pouch,
[01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:47.940]   and people just come up and put envelopes in there.
[01:31:47.940 --> 01:31:49.140]   - If possible, yeah.
[01:31:49.140 --> 01:31:50.740]   Envelopes, always on envelopes.
[01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:52.460]   (laughing)
[01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:53.900]   - That's true, I can't.
[01:31:53.900 --> 01:31:56.020]   - God, Father's wedding, I'm not kidding.
[01:31:56.020 --> 01:31:59.020]   He told me this, I know, it's great.
[01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:00.180]   Did the Niners lose?
[01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:01.020]   I think they must have,
[01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:03.060]   'cause we see Bob Spurgers now on the show.
[01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:05.900]   - They barely lost on the TV, it's close.
[01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:07.260]   You know what, it's Richard Sherman's fault,
[01:32:07.260 --> 01:32:08.700]   I'm gonna blame him.
[01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:11.740]   He's actually a double agent from the Seahawks.
[01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:14.740]   - Well, he didn't do a very good job then last week.
[01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:15.620]   - Well, you know, he has to,
[01:32:15.620 --> 01:32:18.620]   everyone wants to want us to do well, to fool them.
[01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:20.060]   That's what double agents do.
[01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:21.300]   Our show today brought to you by,
[01:32:21.300 --> 01:32:23.420]   and I mean literally, I'll ask you about something
[01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:24.740]   that you're up to, Alex, next.
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:27.660]   I don't wanna feel like I've given John all the airtime.
[01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:29.420]   - I need airtime.
[01:32:29.420 --> 01:32:30.260]   We're trying to help.
[01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:32.220]   - 'Cause I'm down, my numbers on Twitter are down,
[01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:33.060]   they're down.
[01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:35.260]   - If only John could get to 105,000 followers.
[01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:37.580]   Wait a minute, we've just been handed a note.
[01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:41.020]   - Three thousand. - No, no, no, no.
[01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:41.940]   That's not three.
[01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:45.940]   - How many followers, John, let's go to the board.
[01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:48.220]   Let's go to the top board, Carsten.
[01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:50.740]   Twitter.com/TheRealDivorac.
[01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:52.020]   Let's see what those numbers are.
[01:32:52.020 --> 01:32:53.780]   - And like to remind people, I'm trying to get to 40.
[01:32:53.780 --> 01:32:55.140]   John's trying to get to 105.
[01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:56.540]   I'm just trying to get to 40.
[01:32:56.540 --> 01:32:57.820]   - I'm trying to get home.
[01:32:57.820 --> 01:33:00.340]   I mean, I've got just 13 new since the show started,
[01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:04.500]   so I'm going to suck at 38,000 for like five years.
[01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:05.540]   It's like a flat line.
[01:33:05.540 --> 01:33:06.900]   - The numbers, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:07.740]   take your finger off it.
[01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:08.580]   - I had a typo in loss, 150.
[01:33:08.580 --> 01:33:09.900]   - Take your finger off it or click it.
[01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:10.980]   - It's still 102, it's what it was.
[01:33:10.980 --> 01:33:13.020]   - It's nothing, it hasn't moved at all.
[01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:14.500]   Folks are letting me down.
[01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:17.300]   It's Christmas, nobody listens live.
[01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:18.380]   They're gonna catch it all tomorrow.
[01:33:18.380 --> 01:33:19.820]   The wave, nobody listens live.
[01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:21.900]   - The wave will come.
[01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:22.820]   - Okay, we'll see.
[01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:26.500]   It used to, I remember this years ago,
[01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:28.060]   when this show was hot.
[01:33:28.060 --> 01:33:32.340]   You would say something and people,
[01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:34.940]   the number would fly with skyrocket in real time.
[01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:36.580]   - It's kind of what it really is.
[01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:37.580]   - Two more.
[01:33:37.580 --> 01:33:40.100]   (laughing)
[01:33:40.100 --> 01:33:43.500]   - Yes, someone buy JCD 10,000.
[01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:44.340]   That was nice.
[01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:45.180]   - Oh, that's good.
[01:33:45.180 --> 01:33:46.420]   - That works, that's good.
[01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:48.860]   Ladies and gentlemen, I show today
[01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:53.860]   literally brought to you by CashFly, our CDN.
[01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:55.820]   That sounds like, you know, what's that Leo?
[01:33:55.820 --> 01:33:57.660]   It's a content distribution network.
[01:33:57.660 --> 01:34:01.260]   And if you deliver content to your customers,
[01:34:01.260 --> 01:34:03.420]   whether it's a podcast, software,
[01:34:03.420 --> 01:34:07.740]   software as a service, you need a CDN.
[01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:10.020]   The CDN brings you closer to your customers.
[01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:12.720]   So they're getting a server local to them.
[01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:13.980]   So it's faster.
[01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:15.820]   CDN does something really great too.
[01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:18.620]   And we're really grateful to CashFly for this.
[01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:20.900]   They're 100% availability guarantee
[01:34:20.900 --> 01:34:23.900]   with a 100% SLA, it's bulletproof.
[01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:26.780]   100%, I'm not gonna have four nines, five nines.
[01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:27.700]   I'm not gonna have a million nines.
[01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:29.340]   I'm talking 100%.
[01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:30.820]   No more calls at three in the morning
[01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:32.380]   that the CDN's down, Leo.
[01:34:32.380 --> 01:34:33.980]   I never got that call.
[01:34:33.980 --> 01:34:36.780]   For 10 years now, this show has been brought to you
[01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:37.620]   by CashFly.
[01:34:37.620 --> 01:34:38.520]   I'm mighty proud of that.
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:39.940]   And I'm very grateful to CashFly.
[01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:42.820]   They, not only that, they save us a lot of money.
[01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:44.700]   Ours Technica, if you don't trust me,
[01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:48.500]   they've been doing CashFly since 2002.
[01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:50.420]   Ours Technica's director of technology says,
[01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:52.260]   sometimes we have spike events generating
[01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:55.420]   15 to 16 million page views.
[01:34:55.420 --> 01:34:58.260]   Imagine that with CashFly, you don't see an issue.
[01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:00.300]   The CDN just absorbs it.
[01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:01.780]   Our customers commend us on that.
[01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:02.540]   And you know that's true.
[01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:06.020]   When you open your podcast app and Twitch's there,
[01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:08.300]   no, no, hiccups, no waiting.
[01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:10.300]   It's just there, that's CashFly.

[01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:14.020]   easy to talk to an agile techs
[01:35:14.020 --> 01:35:16.120]   that will answer all your questions the first time.
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:17.980]   You don't get on a corporate phone tree.
[01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:18.820]   They handle it.
[01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:22.300]   And most importantly, no more waking up at 3 a.m.
[01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:24.500]   No more checking the bill every day to see,
[01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:25.340]   oh, do we spike?
[01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:27.140]   Do we exceed our quota?
[01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:29.980]   No, CashFly will set up a custom plan tailored
[01:35:29.980 --> 01:35:34.220]   to your needs based on yearly usage trends.
[01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:36.180]   On average, customers who switch to CashFly

[01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:41.100]   But we've been hosting our podcast.
[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:43.060]   Audio and video on CashFly for nearly a decade.
[01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:47.100]   I'm giving you my absolute, absolute endorsement.
[01:35:47.100 --> 01:35:48.140]   This is the way to go.

[01:35:55.060 --> 01:35:57.660]   So I hope you listen in live or close to live
[01:35:57.660 --> 01:36:01.380]   because if you go to twit.cashfly.com,

[01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:06.500]   but you have to sign up by December 31st
[01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:08.500]   and migrate in 2019.
[01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:09.780]   That gives you a little time to migrate,
[01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:13.820]   but do sign up right now at twit.cashfly.com.
[01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:15.940]   We thank CashFly for their support
[01:36:15.940 --> 01:36:18.660]   for bringing you Twit for 10 years.
[01:36:18.660 --> 01:36:21.060]   Practically, since John C. de Vork was here last.
[01:36:21.060 --> 01:36:22.300]   We've been using CashFly
[01:36:22.300 --> 01:36:23.660]   throughout the same amount of time
[01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:25.460]   because you were using it and amazing.
[01:36:25.460 --> 01:36:27.540]   Like how many times have you heard the podcast?
[01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:30.980]   You know, bandwidth for Twit has brought to you by
[01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:34.100]   CashFly, C-A-C-A-G-F-L-Y.com.
[01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:35.580]   Yep.
[01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:37.340]   Can I ask you a question on Kaleo for you to get started?
[01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:39.180]   Yes, one question. Yes, nephew.
[01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:42.220]   You weren't here when I did the episode of Becky.
[01:36:42.220 --> 01:36:45.260]   Did you like my emoji episode?
[01:36:45.260 --> 01:36:46.260]   Did you?
[01:36:46.260 --> 01:36:47.740]   Were you annoyed?
[01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:48.740]   No.
[01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:49.740]   Okay.
[01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:50.740]   Good.
[01:36:50.740 --> 01:36:51.740]   You didn't know Greenbeard, dude.
[01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:52.740]   No, I loved it.
[01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:53.740]   Okay.
[01:36:53.740 --> 01:36:55.660]   So, oh, Dr. De the whole episode as an emoji.
[01:36:55.660 --> 01:36:56.660]   Okay.
[01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:57.660]   I mean emoji.
[01:36:57.660 --> 01:36:58.660]   One of those.
[01:36:58.660 --> 01:36:59.660]   Yeah.
[01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:00.660]   Do you have a beard?
[01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:01.660]   No.
[01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:02.660]   I'm an emoji beard.
[01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:03.660]   Yeah, that's what I said.
[01:37:03.660 --> 01:37:04.660]   Yeah.
[01:37:04.660 --> 01:37:05.660]   Yeah.
[01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:06.660]   Do we have?
[01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:07.660]   Do we have?
[01:37:07.660 --> 01:37:08.660]   Do we have?
[01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:09.660]   Do we have?
[01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:10.660]   Do we have?
[01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:11.660]   Can we show a clip of that?
[01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:12.660]   Show it.
[01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:13.660]   Bring it up.
[01:37:13.660 --> 01:37:14.660]   Hit the button and bring it up.
[01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:15.660]   Emoji?
[01:37:15.660 --> 01:37:17.020]   The whole song is in emoji.
[01:37:17.020 --> 01:37:19.220]   No, they did just a minute, but it's pretty funny.
[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:20.220]   Like, you have to see it.
[01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:21.220]   You have to see Nickelback.
[01:37:21.220 --> 01:37:22.220]   Okay.
[01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:23.220]   If you see, oh, Dr. First.
[01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:25.460]   I'm going to do, oh, Dr. because he's here with us.
[01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:26.620]   Nickelback doesn't really kill you.
[01:37:26.620 --> 01:37:27.620]   You should show it.
[01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:28.620]   I just haven't talked to you since then.
[01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:29.620]   I wonder if you like this.
[01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:30.620]   No, I loved it.
[01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:31.620]   No, wait a minute.
[01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:32.620]   This is--
[01:37:32.620 --> 01:37:33.620]   I think Nickelback's quick news today.
[01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:34.620]   He's getting like a--
[01:37:34.620 --> 01:37:37.620]   Rick Roll-like level moment.
[01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:38.620]   Oh, look.
[01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:40.980]   What I search for that I find a Reddit post.
[01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:43.300]   Anyone else feel like Twits really been going downhill?
[01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:45.740]   That was 2017.
[01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:46.740]   That was over a year ago.
[01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:47.740]   That was over a year ago.
[01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:48.740]   I've done so much better since then.
[01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:49.740]   My numbers do.
[01:37:49.740 --> 01:37:51.740]   We've got great going.
[01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:52.740]   Yeah.
[01:37:52.740 --> 01:37:58.300]   Yes, and who cares if you can get some Louie as they like to refer to it?
[01:37:58.300 --> 01:37:59.740]   Oh, is that what I should be calling it?
[01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:00.740]   The Louie?
[01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:02.740]   No, not the Louie.
[01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:03.740]   Some Louie.
[01:38:03.740 --> 01:38:04.740]   Louie, Louie.
[01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:05.740]   Louis Tres.
[01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:06.740]   That's what my people call it.
[01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:07.740]   Louie.
[01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:08.740]   Louie.
[01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:09.740]   Louie Tres.
[01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:10.740]   I can't-- here we go.
[01:38:10.740 --> 01:38:11.740]   There we go.
[01:38:11.740 --> 01:38:12.740]   Go ahead.
[01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:13.740]   There he is.
[01:38:13.740 --> 01:38:14.740]   That's him.
[01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:16.180]   The whole show he did that is Micah Sargent.
[01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:18.020]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:38:18.020 --> 01:38:19.460]   There's Becky Worley hosting the show.
[01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:21.260]   I don't even know if anybody would do it that way.
[01:38:21.260 --> 01:38:22.260]   Yeah, I think that'd be a better show.
[01:38:22.260 --> 01:38:23.260]   I thought that was very innovative.
[01:38:23.260 --> 01:38:26.740]   But I think that was before you could do it over top of the video, because that would
[01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:28.060]   have been funnier.
[01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:29.580]   How did he do it?
[01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:30.820]   You can do that?
[01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:37.860]   It was a lot of-- at a capture card, the adapter from my iPhone was hot boy.
[01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:38.860]   It was on fire.
[01:38:38.860 --> 01:38:40.500]   I apologize for running the video.
[01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:45.620]   And I should have done this, sent you a note card saying, "I really appreciated what you
[01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:46.620]   did."
[01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:47.620]   It was fun.
[01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:48.860]   It was fun.
[01:38:48.860 --> 01:38:52.300]   I can make handwritten note cards on the internet now.
[01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:53.300]   That's cool.
[01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:54.300]   You can have a machine doing it.
[01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:55.700]   And Amazon ships them for you.
[01:38:55.700 --> 01:38:57.500]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:38:57.500 --> 01:38:58.500]   Federer--
[01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:00.500]   You know, he's got the beard.
[01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:01.500]   Yeah, no, he looks good.
[01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:02.500]   It wasn't green.
[01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:03.500]   It wasn't green.
[01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:04.500]   It's not green.
[01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:05.500]   I look-- man, I'll tell you one thing.
[01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:06.980]   I look really young and sexy and that thing.
[01:39:06.980 --> 01:39:12.220]   I got to start putting my emoji mask on about to order one and just wear it and bring myself
[01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:13.220]   back like 10 years.
[01:39:13.220 --> 01:39:15.300]   Oh, if you just got a rubber mask, yeah.
[01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:16.300]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:18.300]   Have my heavy all-sue with me.
[01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:20.300]   I think it'll fit right in.
[01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:21.300]   I would definitely--
[01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:23.900]   That thing has bigger eyeballs than you do.
[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:24.900]   No doubt.
[01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:27.100]   That's not perfect.
[01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:28.100]   These aren't-- they do a little--
[01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:29.100]   The props you try to be mean.
[01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:31.460]   That's the problem when you try to be mean.
[01:39:31.460 --> 01:39:32.940]   You can't be mean with big eyes like you.
[01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:33.940]   You can't be mean.
[01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:34.940]   No, they got all the two and so--
[01:39:34.940 --> 01:39:35.940]   The doughy eyes.
[01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:36.940]   Yeah.
[01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:37.940]   Yeah.
[01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:38.940]   I'm trying to growl and stuff.
[01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:39.940]   It doesn't do anger.
[01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:40.940]   Expressions very agree.
[01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:41.940]   It doesn't want to see like I'm trying.
[01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:43.940]   I hear my face to do that.
[01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:44.940]   Just to get your expression.
[01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:46.540]   Yeah, you're hamming it up.
[01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:47.540]   That's why.
[01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:50.860]   I'm going to have a shout out to Virginia Mount Union.
[01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:52.940]   Are you going to get a T-shirt from them or something like that?
[01:39:52.940 --> 01:39:54.940]   No, it's a hoodie.
[01:39:54.940 --> 01:39:59.180]   The Division III champions for something like the 13th year in a row.
[01:39:59.180 --> 01:40:02.900]   And people send John-- what do you want?
[01:40:02.900 --> 01:40:04.660]   You want to Valdosta State?
[01:40:04.660 --> 01:40:07.900]   Valdosta State and Virginia Mount Union.
[01:40:07.900 --> 01:40:08.900]   I think I saw--
[01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:09.900]   Send me some email.
[01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:11.540]   Johnativork.org and I'll work it out.
[01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:12.540]   All right.
[01:40:12.540 --> 01:40:13.540]   But we'll see.
[01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:14.540]   I am wondering.
[01:40:14.540 --> 01:40:16.380]   But he's got to get 105,000 followers on Twitter.
[01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:18.100]   Otherwise you'll never see your shirt on the air.
[01:40:18.100 --> 01:40:19.100]   There you go.
[01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:20.100]   Well, somebody can buy me 5,000.
[01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:21.940]   That's pretty easy.
[01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:22.940]   They're cheap.
[01:40:22.940 --> 01:40:24.020]   They're cheap.
[01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:25.980]   This is the year net neutrality was repealed.
[01:40:25.980 --> 01:40:26.980]   Do we care?
[01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:28.780]   Well, it's in California.
[01:40:28.780 --> 01:40:30.980]   So what dares does it make to us?
[01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:31.980]   We made a law.
[01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:32.980]   Yeah.
[01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:36.740]   So in a way, I think the state has said, all right, we're not going to enforce it until
[01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:40.300]   we hear from the Supreme Court because there's some discussion about whether a state can
[01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:43.940]   make a law overriding federal law, although it's ironic because--
[01:40:43.940 --> 01:40:45.380]   This is 10th Amendment says we can.
[01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:46.940]   It's the state's rights.
[01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:48.580]   Isn't that what the--
[01:40:48.580 --> 01:40:51.380]   Now, states rights don't work with weed, the internet.
[01:40:51.380 --> 01:40:53.180]   They only work with the slavery.
[01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:56.580]   That's the only thing the states rights work with.
[01:40:56.580 --> 01:41:00.180]   So I've seen articles already saying two things.
[01:41:00.180 --> 01:41:02.660]   And it's been a year since net neutrality is repealed.
[01:41:02.660 --> 01:41:03.660]   No, it hasn't.
[01:41:03.660 --> 01:41:05.780]   It's been six months, barely.
[01:41:05.780 --> 01:41:08.580]   And see, nothing bad happened.
[01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:09.580]   Both wrong.
[01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:10.580]   Both wrong.
[01:41:10.580 --> 01:41:11.580]   It's only been six months.
[01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:23.020]   And immediately, Netflix and YouTube were immediately throttled by Verizon and T-Mobile.
[01:41:23.020 --> 01:41:26.580]   There's a app that actually surprisingly Apple approved.
[01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:29.980]   There was some question about whether Apple would approve it called Wehe, I think it
[01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:33.100]   is, or Mihi, that tests your Wi-Fi speed.
[01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:36.380]   And so this data comes from Mihi, or Wehe, or Wehe, or Wehe.
[01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:40.180]   Well, I think it's in Apple's best interest to have that app exist because Apple's going
[01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:41.180]   to be the next one.
[01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:42.580]   It's already paying for those things.
[01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:46.300]   I mean, so the other thing to think about here is that net neutrality, before net neutrality
[01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:52.300]   was repealed, YouTube and Netflix and Apple were already getting shaken down for peering
[01:41:52.300 --> 01:41:54.180]   within the ISPs.
[01:41:54.180 --> 01:41:55.180]   So they were--
[01:41:55.180 --> 01:41:58.780]   Again, they were volunteering putting those appliances in.
[01:41:58.780 --> 01:41:59.780]   No, not Netflix.
[01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:00.780]   Netflix was holding back.
[01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:01.780]   And Netflix was like, we're not going to do this.
[01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:05.620]   Apple was like, hey, only with Comcast because Comcast had some issues because they were
[01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:06.620]   competing.
[01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:07.620]   Direct competitors.
[01:42:07.620 --> 01:42:11.140]   But the thing with Comcast wants to sell you TV services.
[01:42:11.140 --> 01:42:14.380]   What we're going to see, I mean, the big word in two or three years from now is going
[01:42:14.380 --> 01:42:16.380]   to be called zero rating.
[01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:17.540]   That is what these guys want to do.
[01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:18.540]   They want to--
[01:42:18.540 --> 01:42:22.220]   And the reason I want to do it, it's very hard to explain to consumers why that's bad
[01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:23.220]   for them.
[01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:24.220]   Right.
[01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:27.980]   Well, and the issue is that the 5G rollout will be the most expensive rollout in the history
[01:42:27.980 --> 01:42:29.380]   of telecommunications.
[01:42:29.380 --> 01:42:35.340]   And they want to pay for it on the backs of Apple and YouTube and Facebook and Netflix.
[01:42:35.340 --> 01:42:36.340]   That's their home business model.
[01:42:36.340 --> 01:42:39.500]   And the reason they needed to get rid of Netflix is because, I mean, it's going to cost them--
[01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:43.180]   I mean, they're going to talk in hundreds of billions, but it's really going to be trillion
[01:42:43.180 --> 01:42:46.060]   or more to do the 5G rollout.
[01:42:46.060 --> 01:42:48.900]   And it's just a really expensive process.
[01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:51.500]   But they're going to try to replace your home Wi-Fi.
[01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:53.620]   I mean, you're not going to have a Comcast connection.
[01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:55.420]   You're just going to have T-Mobile.
[01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:57.940]   And your T-Mobile phone is going to be your T-Mobile connection at home.
[01:42:57.940 --> 01:43:00.180]   So fast, you won't even bother with anything else, right?
[01:43:00.180 --> 01:43:01.500]   No, you're not-- that's the whole model.
[01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:02.940]   It's so fast and so expensive.
[01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:05.900]   At least it costs them a lot to roll it out because they've got to put a transceiver every
[01:43:05.900 --> 01:43:06.900]   250 feet.
[01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:07.900]   And so--
[01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:08.900]   Yeah, you guys are--
[01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:10.900]   --living in a dream world if you think this is going anywhere.
[01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:11.900]   I got to say.
[01:43:11.900 --> 01:43:12.900]   Yeah.
[01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:13.900]   5G is going to take a long time.
[01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:14.900]   Because it's going to be--
[01:43:14.900 --> 01:43:15.900]   So here's what you're going to see.
[01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:16.900]   It's hard to implement.
[01:43:16.900 --> 01:43:17.900]   It's micro wave, millimeter wave signals.
[01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:18.900]   Yeah.
[01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:19.900]   You're going to see signals.
[01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:20.900]   You have to be--
[01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:21.900]   This is the same--
[01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:25.820]   --exact same frequencies that the government uses for those rays that, you know, the ones that
[01:43:25.820 --> 01:43:29.300]   burn you, that make you feel like you're burning and you got to get out of the way.
[01:43:29.300 --> 01:43:30.300]   You mean the chemtrails?
[01:43:30.300 --> 01:43:31.300]   No, no, no.
[01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:32.300]   You know what I'm talking about.
[01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:33.300]   These are the--
[01:43:33.300 --> 01:43:34.300]   What are you talking about?
[01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:36.300]   The government's burning us with rays.
[01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:37.300]   Yeah, thermal exciters.
[01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:38.300]   Yeah, thermal exciters.
[01:43:38.300 --> 01:43:39.300]   So the--
[01:43:39.300 --> 01:43:40.300]   Do you have-- what is it?
[01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:41.300]   Dermal exciters.
[01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:44.780]   It's those big giant things that they've taken-- you find out some bunch of people rioting
[01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:48.780]   and they throw this switch and everyone feels like their faces on fire and they run away.
[01:43:48.780 --> 01:43:50.700]   We're not going to Mars.
[01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:52.140]   We're not getting 5G.
[01:43:52.140 --> 01:43:53.380]   And get off my lawn.
[01:43:53.380 --> 01:43:56.580]   So the thing is, is that you're going to see it-- the first place you're going to see
[01:43:56.580 --> 01:43:57.580]   5G is--
[01:43:57.580 --> 01:43:58.580]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:43:58.580 --> 01:44:00.460]   I'm surprised you don't know about this.
[01:44:00.460 --> 01:44:01.460]   Is this made up?
[01:44:01.460 --> 01:44:02.460]   Dermal exciters?
[01:44:02.460 --> 01:44:03.460]   Look, search--
[01:44:03.460 --> 01:44:05.700]   Well, you have searched Google for Dermal exciters.
[01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:08.700]   Military crowd dispersion.
[01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:09.700]   Ground dispersion.
[01:44:09.700 --> 01:44:10.700]   Heat.
[01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:11.700]   Have you not seen?
[01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:12.700]   I'll do it.
[01:44:12.700 --> 01:44:13.700]   You'll find--
[01:44:13.700 --> 01:44:14.700]   Uncle Leo.
[01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:15.700]   Yes.
[01:44:15.700 --> 01:44:16.700]   The crowd--
[01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:18.900]   The government has dangerous weapons afoot, OK?
[01:44:18.900 --> 01:44:20.460]   It's an active denial system.
[01:44:20.460 --> 01:44:21.900]   Well, there's a lot of active rise systems.
[01:44:21.900 --> 01:44:23.060]   This will burn you alive.
[01:44:23.060 --> 01:44:24.540]   The US military active denial--
[01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:25.540]   It doesn't burn you alive.
[01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:27.540]   It just makes you feel like there's a lot.
[01:44:27.540 --> 01:44:28.540]   Yes, I'm a YouTube.
[01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:29.540]   No, it's not.
[01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:30.540]   No, he's--
[01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:31.540]   You don't want to--
[01:44:31.540 --> 01:44:32.540]   Apparently, it doesn't know about this.
[01:44:32.540 --> 01:44:33.700]   So anyway, so the--
[01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:37.140]   Oh, they unveiled this six years ago.
[01:44:37.140 --> 01:44:38.140]   Have they used it?
[01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:39.140]   Yeah.
[01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:40.140]   Yeah.
[01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:41.140]   Yeah.
[01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:42.140]   Sensation?
[01:44:42.140 --> 01:44:43.140]   Six years ago, Leo.
[01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:44.140]   But have they used it?
[01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:45.140]   Six years ago.
[01:44:45.140 --> 01:44:46.140]   And can I tell you something?
[01:44:46.140 --> 01:44:47.140]   Here's the problem.
[01:44:47.140 --> 01:44:48.140]   This goes four feet.
[01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:49.140]   It goes more--
[01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:50.140]   No, no, no.
[01:44:50.140 --> 01:44:51.140]   It'll take a minute.
[01:44:51.140 --> 01:44:53.020]   This is the same weapon they used in an incredible hulk to shut the incredible hole.
[01:44:53.020 --> 01:44:54.020]   And I know it's real.
[01:44:54.020 --> 01:44:59.860]   Actually, I see in a movie it's already been created and used by the man.
[01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:00.860]   This is non-lethal.
[01:45:00.860 --> 01:45:02.580]   They say it could go 1,000 meters.
[01:45:02.580 --> 01:45:05.420]   This is a 2012 article from physics.org.
[01:45:05.420 --> 01:45:08.060]   And I don't-- if it's non-lethal, it disperses the crowd.
[01:45:08.060 --> 01:45:09.060]   What's wrong with that?
[01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:10.060]   What could possibly be wrong with that?
[01:45:10.060 --> 01:45:11.060]   I don't think it's anywhere on dispersing a crowd.
[01:45:11.060 --> 01:45:12.300]   And you get a nice tan.
[01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:14.660]   You don't get a tan.
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:15.660]   So but the--
[01:45:15.660 --> 01:45:20.900]   It was briefly deployed in Afghanistan in 2010, but not never since.
[01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:21.900]   Never deployed in an operation.
[01:45:21.900 --> 01:45:22.900]   Because it's horrifying.
[01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:25.500]   Because it's a good effect on people.
[01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:27.300]   And again, what if we got a heart condition?
[01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:28.300]   It's 95 kilos.
[01:45:28.300 --> 01:45:29.300]   It's like--
[01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:31.300]   Yeah, it has issues.
[01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:32.300]   A pacemaker.
[01:45:32.300 --> 01:45:33.300]   Yeah.
[01:45:33.300 --> 01:45:34.300]   You kill people.
[01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:35.300]   It's a killer.
[01:45:35.300 --> 01:45:36.300]   Yeah.
[01:45:36.300 --> 01:45:43.300]   According to a military spokesman, Stephanie Miller, she doesn't talk like that, but I'm
[01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:45.700]   going to make her talk like she's got a deep voice.
[01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:49.980]   We have done over 11,000 exposures on people.
[01:45:49.980 --> 01:45:55.620]   In that time, we've only had two injuries that require medical attention.
[01:45:55.620 --> 01:45:56.780]   Sounds good.
[01:45:56.780 --> 01:46:03.900]   A sensation of unbearable sudden heat that seems to come out of nowhere as far as half
[01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:04.900]   a mile away.
[01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:05.900]   There you go.
[01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:06.900]   Anyway, so it's not--
[01:46:06.900 --> 01:46:07.900]   Can I get one of those?
[01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:08.900]   You can't.
[01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:09.900]   Yeah, you can, actually.
[01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:10.900]   Because when's Elon Musk going to sell them?
[01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:11.900]   No, get him a surplus.
[01:46:11.900 --> 01:46:12.900]   Get him a surplus.
[01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:13.900]   Get him a surplus.
[01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:14.900]   Exactly.
[01:46:14.900 --> 01:46:15.900]   Get him for nothing.
[01:46:15.900 --> 01:46:16.900]   Okay, how do we get off on that?
[01:46:16.900 --> 01:46:17.900]   This is the 5G technology.
[01:46:17.900 --> 01:46:18.900]   So here's the deal.
[01:46:18.900 --> 01:46:19.900]   Yeah.
[01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:23.740]   The thing is, is that where you're going to see 5G versus venues, because it makes a lot
[01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:24.740]   of sense for the--
[01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:25.740]   Get really hot and fast in the movies.
[01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:26.740]   That's exactly exactly.
[01:46:26.740 --> 01:46:27.740]   And you poop.
[01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:28.740]   That's the real problem.
[01:46:28.740 --> 01:46:30.300]   No, that's the sonic.
[01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:31.300]   That's the last thing.
[01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:32.300]   Makes you poop.
[01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:33.300]   Makes you poop.
[01:46:33.300 --> 01:46:36.300]   But if you're in the rural area, you probably won't see 5G in your life.
[01:46:36.300 --> 01:46:37.300]   Ever.
[01:46:37.300 --> 01:46:41.420]   But I think that you'll see it in the venues first, then you'll see it in city centers,
[01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:43.060]   and then it'll slowly edge out.
[01:46:43.060 --> 01:46:46.860]   But like, for instance, San Francisco probably won't see it all over San Francisco until,
[01:46:46.860 --> 01:46:48.940]   you know, 20, 30.
[01:46:48.940 --> 01:46:51.260]   And there already poop in there.
[01:46:51.260 --> 01:46:52.260]   But it's a lot of--
[01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:53.260]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:46:53.260 --> 01:46:54.260]   Only downtown San Francisco.
[01:46:54.260 --> 01:46:55.260]   Like around city hall.
[01:46:55.260 --> 01:46:56.260]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:46:56.260 --> 01:46:57.260]   It's so disgusting.
[01:46:57.260 --> 01:46:58.260]   You really think so?
[01:46:58.260 --> 01:46:59.260]   It's disgusting.
[01:46:59.260 --> 01:47:00.260]   It's so awful.
[01:47:00.260 --> 01:47:01.260]   I blame Kevin Rose.
[01:47:01.260 --> 01:47:02.820]   I had to teach my kids.
[01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:03.820]   We were walking downstairs.
[01:47:03.820 --> 01:47:05.660]   They saw a quarter, and I was like, do not pick that quarter up.
[01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:06.660]   They're like, it's a quarter.
[01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:08.460]   I'm like, no idea where that quarter's been.
[01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:09.460]   Like, it's on the ground.
[01:47:09.460 --> 01:47:11.260]   And the quarter's could have been pooped out.
[01:47:11.260 --> 01:47:12.260]   I know.
[01:47:12.260 --> 01:47:13.260]   I was like, do not touch that quarter.
[01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:14.260]   You're not typing there.
[01:47:14.260 --> 01:47:15.260]   All right.
[01:47:15.260 --> 01:47:16.260]   100 dollar bill.
[01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:17.260]   Let's talk Huawei.
[01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:18.260]   China.
[01:47:18.260 --> 01:47:20.580]   This is a big year for China.
[01:47:20.580 --> 01:47:22.820]   A couple of things China did.
[01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:26.700]   They started using that social credit system first in Shenzhen.
[01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:33.380]   In fact, at one point, they were putting pictures of Jaywalkers up on the billboard.
[01:47:33.380 --> 01:47:38.660]   Because if you cross the street, they actually knew who you were from face recognition,
[01:47:38.660 --> 01:47:40.660]   and they didn't try to embarrass you.
[01:47:40.660 --> 01:47:46.100]   Then they started using social credit system to keep you from getting home loans, from
[01:47:46.100 --> 01:47:47.100]   buying train tickets.
[01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:48.100]   Yeah.
[01:47:48.100 --> 01:47:53.460]   So, if you were not good, if you were not a nice person, if you were a bad boy in China.
[01:47:53.460 --> 01:47:56.980]   And now Beijing says by 2020, they're going to do it all over Beijing.
[01:47:56.980 --> 01:48:02.340]   Oh, the whole country is going to be under the system.
[01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:03.500]   You think it'll come here at some point?
[01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:05.420]   Talking too loud in the subway.
[01:48:05.420 --> 01:48:07.020]   Is that a uniquely calculated China?
[01:48:07.020 --> 01:48:08.980]   It's like a black mirror episode.
[01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:09.980]   It's like a black mirror.
[01:48:09.980 --> 01:48:11.980]   It's a black mirror episode.
[01:48:11.980 --> 01:48:14.980]   China is a pretty unstable country.
[01:48:14.980 --> 01:48:18.180]   They have a lot of people that are upset.
[01:48:18.180 --> 01:48:19.180]   They have to keep growing.
[01:48:19.180 --> 01:48:21.020]   And the problem is it's going to be hard to keep growing.
[01:48:21.020 --> 01:48:22.020]   It's hard to manage.
[01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:23.020]   It's hard to keep growing.
[01:48:23.020 --> 01:48:24.020]   You've got a lot of people.
[01:48:24.020 --> 01:48:25.020]   And the problem is they have a...
[01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:29.060]   I think that the male to female ratio is something like one...
[01:48:29.060 --> 01:48:30.060]   I want to say 113 or 13.
[01:48:30.060 --> 01:48:31.860]   Well, there's an example of a mistake.
[01:48:31.860 --> 01:48:32.860]   Massive.
[01:48:32.860 --> 01:48:34.860]   It's been one child per couple of days.
[01:48:34.860 --> 01:48:39.580]   And so, they have this instability that is built into the country, and they're just
[01:48:39.580 --> 01:48:41.740]   trying to hang on to it.
[01:48:41.740 --> 01:48:45.900]   They've got a tiger by the tail, and they're going to use every piece of what they can.
[01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:46.900]   And they have to keep growing.
[01:48:46.900 --> 01:48:51.020]   They have to grow at 5%, 6%, 7%.
[01:48:51.020 --> 01:48:53.100]   Every year, they're going to go into revolution.
[01:48:53.100 --> 01:48:57.780]   But John, do you think the people in China like this think it's a good thing?
[01:48:57.780 --> 01:48:58.780]   It brings order.
[01:48:58.780 --> 01:48:59.780]   What do you think?
[01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:00.780]   It brings order.
[01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:01.780]   Well, maybe they...
[01:49:01.780 --> 01:49:02.780]   Most people want to order.
[01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:03.780]   The people running the country like this.
[01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:06.860]   But isn't that what government really does is brings order.
[01:49:06.860 --> 01:49:07.860]   That's really what it's job is.
[01:49:07.860 --> 01:49:10.660]   It just keeps things preserved as status quo.
[01:49:10.660 --> 01:49:13.020]   The problem is, there's a lot of words missing in China.
[01:49:13.020 --> 01:49:15.020]   There's an incredible amount of options.
[01:49:15.020 --> 01:49:16.260]   That's what people are really upset about.
[01:49:16.260 --> 01:49:19.580]   You're at Jacques Berlin or whatever the hell his name was.
[01:49:19.580 --> 01:49:20.740]   I got that book still.
[01:49:20.740 --> 01:49:21.740]   Barzoon.
[01:49:21.740 --> 01:49:22.740]   Barzoon.
[01:49:22.740 --> 01:49:23.740]   Yeah.
[01:49:23.740 --> 01:49:27.540]   So why did oh Dr. Gleeve and they came back with this hat?
[01:49:27.540 --> 01:49:29.180]   It's getting cold in there.
[01:49:29.180 --> 01:49:32.500]   Oh, I'm protecting myself because we talk about China.
[01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:33.500]   So I know...
[01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:35.420]   There's tin foil under that hat.
[01:49:35.420 --> 01:49:37.220]   Oh, there's definitely tin foil under that hat.
[01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:42.340]   Because I know the China's listening and if I was China, all the stuff they send here,
[01:49:42.340 --> 01:49:43.660]   I'd have a kill switch.
[01:49:43.660 --> 01:49:45.940]   They could turn off everything in 13 seconds.
[01:49:45.940 --> 01:49:46.940]   So just trying to know that I love you.
[01:49:46.940 --> 01:49:47.940]   That's the other story.
[01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:49.300]   I think you're doing a good job.
[01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:52.380]   I think you and your people have made a choice for your people.
[01:49:52.380 --> 01:49:53.380]   And guess what?
[01:49:53.380 --> 01:49:56.180]   If the people didn't like it, there's enough of them to do a revolt and just take over
[01:49:56.180 --> 01:49:57.900]   it and go anarchy, go crazy.
[01:49:57.900 --> 01:49:58.900]   I just think bung us.
[01:49:58.900 --> 01:49:59.900]   But they don't do that.
[01:49:59.900 --> 01:50:00.900]   So average person on the street.
[01:50:00.900 --> 01:50:01.900]   And they might like it maybe.
[01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:03.060]   Doesn't mind it.
[01:50:03.060 --> 01:50:04.060]   Because it keeps order.
[01:50:04.060 --> 01:50:05.060]   Makes it an order more orderly.
[01:50:05.060 --> 01:50:07.060]   I think the average person in a city, you're probably going to be a good person.
[01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:08.060]   Probably right.
[01:50:08.060 --> 01:50:09.060]   I think you get a little bit clearer here too.
[01:50:09.060 --> 01:50:10.060]   Isn't that so much?
[01:50:10.060 --> 01:50:11.060]   Yeah.
[01:50:11.060 --> 01:50:12.060]   He's actually 100% right.
[01:50:12.060 --> 01:50:15.940]   When I was in China, which was a long time ago, that's the general sentiment.
[01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:21.900]   When you were in Shanghai or Hong Kong or anywhere like that, everybody loved how everything
[01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:23.980]   was because they had all the luxuries of life.
[01:50:23.980 --> 01:50:24.980]   Look at, you know what the example?
[01:50:24.980 --> 01:50:28.420]   The country, people just were poor.
[01:50:28.420 --> 01:50:30.140]   They didn't have anything.
[01:50:30.140 --> 01:50:31.980]   Their infrastructure was terrible.
[01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:33.700]   The air quality was terrible.
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:34.700]   So it's a very--
[01:50:34.700 --> 01:50:35.700]   Oh my God, that's awesome.
[01:50:35.700 --> 01:50:36.700]   Disconnect.
[01:50:36.700 --> 01:50:38.820]   I'm just surprised it hasn't been a revolt.
[01:50:38.820 --> 01:50:40.900]   But obviously they're moving down into Africa now.
[01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:41.900]   They're building all those highways.
[01:50:41.900 --> 01:50:45.580]   So maybe we're thinking about moving everybody on down to another land after the last--
[01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:48.100]   They are actively exporting people.
[01:50:48.100 --> 01:50:49.100]   Oh, yes.
[01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:50.100]   You know, like it is.
[01:50:50.100 --> 01:50:54.260]   When they go into Africa, you know that you have something Chinese.
[01:50:54.260 --> 01:50:57.780]   I was in Tanzania and there's this huge highway being built.
[01:50:57.780 --> 01:50:58.780]   And it's all Chinese workers.
[01:50:58.780 --> 01:51:02.020]   You think it's like, oh, it's not African workers.
[01:51:02.020 --> 01:51:03.780]   It's all Chinese workers.
[01:51:03.780 --> 01:51:04.780]   And they plan to leave them there.
[01:51:04.780 --> 01:51:06.740]   They're not planning to have them go out there and stay there.
[01:51:06.740 --> 01:51:08.740]   They want them to stay there forever.
[01:51:08.740 --> 01:51:10.580]   You know that's why they have too many people.
[01:51:10.580 --> 01:51:11.580]   Let's put them everywhere.
[01:51:11.580 --> 01:51:15.100]   And President Shubbin calls it the project of the century.
[01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:16.780]   This is one thing the Chinese do better than us.
[01:51:16.780 --> 01:51:17.780]   They think long term.
[01:51:17.780 --> 01:51:18.540]   Well, they also--
[01:51:18.540 --> 01:51:21.900]   They can manage huge projects.
[01:51:21.900 --> 01:51:22.900]   That's why also--
[01:51:22.900 --> 01:51:24.300]   And the Chinese are running around here.
[01:51:24.300 --> 01:51:27.940]   They would fix that freeway, which for the last three years they've been building and
[01:51:27.940 --> 01:51:28.940]   they haven't done it.
[01:51:28.940 --> 01:51:30.300]   See, that's why we need my--
[01:51:30.300 --> 01:51:31.300]   This is--
[01:51:31.300 --> 01:51:34.740]   This is a real issue of soft power.
[01:51:34.740 --> 01:51:36.060]   And doing it the right way.
[01:51:36.060 --> 01:51:41.900]   Because Africa, the way they look at quote unquote colonizers coming in, destroying their land
[01:51:41.900 --> 01:51:43.500]   and their infrastructure not doing anything.
[01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:46.060]   China's like, oh, we'll come build stuff for free.
[01:51:46.060 --> 01:51:47.460]   We'll come educate your people.
[01:51:47.460 --> 01:51:48.660]   We'll come teach your people.
[01:51:48.660 --> 01:51:51.380]   And then we're going to leave our people here just to help you out.
[01:51:51.380 --> 01:51:54.700]   And they don't understand that, again, soft power.
[01:51:54.700 --> 01:51:57.260]   They're building up their roads so they can move right on in.
[01:51:57.260 --> 01:51:58.420]   And that's just going to happen.
[01:51:58.420 --> 01:52:04.060]   And we're going to hold your port as the collateral for the highway.
[01:52:04.060 --> 01:52:06.420]   And you have to sign a contract that says that--
[01:52:06.420 --> 01:52:07.420]   Yeah, that's a lot of this.
[01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:09.620]   Superseeds, you're soven rights.
[01:52:09.620 --> 01:52:10.620]   Because that's so--
[01:52:10.620 --> 01:52:11.620]   That's what China's doing.
[01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:12.620]   You know, like--
[01:52:12.620 --> 01:52:13.620]   Yes, China and I--
[01:52:13.620 --> 01:52:14.620]   They'll take your country.
[01:52:14.620 --> 01:52:17.060]   John, you were talking about the confessions of an economic hit, man.
[01:52:17.060 --> 01:52:18.980]   The same exact kind of strategy--
[01:52:18.980 --> 01:52:20.220]   The Chinese do it differently.
[01:52:20.220 --> 01:52:21.740]   But they do it-- well, what's interesting?
[01:52:21.740 --> 01:52:23.940]   There's a-- here's my proposition.
[01:52:23.940 --> 01:52:25.380]   There's a vacuum right now.
[01:52:25.380 --> 01:52:29.380]   Used to be-- you could turn to the Soviet Union and get aid and support.
[01:52:29.380 --> 01:52:35.300]   And by the way, the communist doctrine kind of fit because it was empowering, giving
[01:52:35.300 --> 01:52:37.140]   workers political power.
[01:52:37.140 --> 01:52:39.740]   So there was a lot of countries in embrace that.
[01:52:39.740 --> 01:52:43.220]   We had to fight that, try to convince some of the power of capitalism.
[01:52:43.220 --> 01:52:45.380]   But the Soviet Union is gone.
[01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:48.900]   The United States has clearly turned its back on the outside world.
[01:52:48.900 --> 01:52:49.900]   We want to--
[01:52:49.900 --> 01:52:54.260]   Although we just decide we're going to spend $60 billion in Africa because we're terrified.
[01:52:54.260 --> 01:52:55.260]   Well, like--
[01:52:55.260 --> 01:52:56.260]   Like, you know what?
[01:52:56.260 --> 01:52:57.260]   Because here's the thing that the China gets--
[01:52:57.260 --> 01:52:58.260]   Wait, see.
[01:52:58.260 --> 01:52:59.260]   But here's what China gets.
[01:52:59.260 --> 01:53:01.260]   Here's what China gets out of this beyond all of the--
[01:53:01.260 --> 01:53:04.260]   I'm saying there's a real opportunity because there's a vacuum right now.
[01:53:04.260 --> 01:53:05.580]   There's no Soviet Union.
[01:53:05.580 --> 01:53:07.380]   There's no US superpower.
[01:53:07.380 --> 01:53:11.060]   Here's a chance with the Belt-- this is called the Belt and Road Initiative to go out and
[01:53:11.060 --> 01:53:12.060]   really asserts--
[01:53:12.060 --> 01:53:13.060]   And what?
[01:53:13.060 --> 01:53:14.060]   Soft power.
[01:53:14.060 --> 01:53:15.540]   And what China wants is also votes.
[01:53:15.540 --> 01:53:16.540]   76 times the US.
[01:53:16.540 --> 01:53:17.540]   Votes in the UN.
[01:53:17.540 --> 01:53:19.860]   Let's be clear that there's a lot of countries in Africa.
[01:53:19.860 --> 01:53:22.420]   And what China gets out of a lot of this is, hey, we're going to give you a whole lot
[01:53:22.420 --> 01:53:23.420]   of stuff.
[01:53:23.420 --> 01:53:28.860]   And we're going to call you and expect you to vote a certain way when we eat it.
[01:53:28.860 --> 01:53:29.860]   And the way the leaders in Africa have already started--
[01:53:29.860 --> 01:53:30.860]   And you're going to give us your minerals.
[01:53:30.860 --> 01:53:31.860]   Minerals are important too.
[01:53:31.860 --> 01:53:32.860]   Minerals are important too.
[01:53:32.860 --> 01:53:34.780]   But the votes are important as well.
[01:53:34.780 --> 01:53:38.060]   The votes are hugely important because that's the biggest thing when you hear these African
[01:53:38.060 --> 01:53:42.100]   leaders talk about all the infrastructure and everything, the way they talk about China.
[01:53:42.100 --> 01:53:45.860]   It's like, OK, are you paid off or do you really believe the value or did you not read
[01:53:45.860 --> 01:53:47.060]   the contract?
[01:53:47.060 --> 01:53:49.780]   Because I is now sider and I'm not the brightest person on this panel.
[01:53:49.780 --> 01:53:51.340]   I'm not the brightest person in tech.
[01:53:51.340 --> 01:53:53.260]   I fully understand what they're doing.
[01:53:53.260 --> 01:53:58.420]   So the fact that they are up hoding and touting China in the UN and on the world stage is so
[01:53:58.420 --> 01:53:59.420]   insane to me.
[01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:01.340]   But how much watching to go by?
[01:54:01.340 --> 01:54:04.460]   But part of that is also that they are egging on the rest of the world that is ignoring
[01:54:04.460 --> 01:54:05.460]   them.
[01:54:05.460 --> 01:54:07.260]   So they're saying, hey, these guys are great.
[01:54:07.260 --> 01:54:09.540]   We would be happy to work with anybody.
[01:54:09.540 --> 01:54:12.140]   But the people that are working with us right now are China.
[01:54:12.140 --> 01:54:20.860]   And $80 billion in Africa pales to $345 billion in China state, finance bodies, $233 billion
[01:54:20.860 --> 01:54:26.100]   from commercial state banks, $40 billion from the Silk Road Fund, $100 billion from the
[01:54:26.100 --> 01:54:30.860]   Asia infrastructure investment back at $59 billion from the world bank.
[01:54:30.860 --> 01:54:32.900]   All the war banks kind of us.
[01:54:32.900 --> 01:54:35.620]   So that's versus $59 from the world bank.
[01:54:35.620 --> 01:54:36.620]   Right.
[01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:37.620]   Meanwhile, we're pulling back.
[01:54:37.620 --> 01:54:39.220]   Now, here's the other side of that.
[01:54:39.220 --> 01:54:40.980]   We were talking about the Marriott breach.
[01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:43.220]   This was the year of breaches.
[01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:46.100]   But the breach of all breaches happened a few weeks ago.
[01:54:46.100 --> 01:54:51.700]   Half a billion, not million, half a billion, a guest data was stolen from the Marriott
[01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:54.780]   SPG reservation system names.
[01:54:54.780 --> 01:54:56.340]   I'm sure that was mine.
[01:54:56.340 --> 01:54:57.580]   I was in there for sure.
[01:54:57.580 --> 01:55:00.900]   Passport numbers, not credit cards, perhaps so much.
[01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:04.940]   But that's not what they wanted because it turns out, according to the US government,
[01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:06.340]   this was a Chinese run.
[01:55:06.340 --> 01:55:11.060]   And I think it's credible, a Chinese run hack, part of something that had been going on since
[01:55:11.060 --> 01:55:14.700]   2014, including the hack of the office personnel management.
[01:55:14.700 --> 01:55:17.380]   We know none of this data was ever sold on the dark web.
[01:55:17.380 --> 01:55:19.060]   So it wasn't hackers probably.
[01:55:19.060 --> 01:55:20.860]   It probably was a nation state.
[01:55:20.860 --> 01:55:25.900]   And the theory is they were trying to get information about US diplomats, US military,
[01:55:25.900 --> 01:55:27.540]   travel and whereabouts.
[01:55:27.540 --> 01:55:29.740]   Passport numbers are very useful in that kind of thing.
[01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:32.420]   So it wasn't about hacking or stealing credit card information.
[01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:33.420]   Tracking people.
[01:55:33.420 --> 01:55:34.660]   It was about tracking people.
[01:55:34.660 --> 01:55:36.340]   Probably mostly Chinese.
[01:55:36.340 --> 01:55:39.100]   And also dissidents and other Chinese out of the country, absolutely.
[01:55:39.100 --> 01:55:42.460]   You have the tag.
[01:55:42.460 --> 01:55:43.460]   Well I debated this.
[01:55:43.460 --> 01:55:44.460]   At least I talked about it.
[01:55:44.460 --> 01:55:46.380]   Are you going to take it back?
[01:55:46.380 --> 01:55:49.300]   Oh, I see.
[01:55:49.300 --> 01:55:52.020]   You would notice that.
[01:55:52.020 --> 01:55:54.980]   We thought about Hank, but no, it's, but it's, I don't know.
[01:55:54.980 --> 01:55:57.100]   I feel like it also helps me.
[01:55:57.100 --> 01:56:00.220]   People say, Hey man, where did you get that suit this week on?
[01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:01.740]   I did just go.
[01:56:01.740 --> 01:56:02.740]   Oppo.
[01:56:02.740 --> 01:56:04.940]   No, that's, that's not why you keep the tag on there.
[01:56:04.940 --> 01:56:05.940]   Why?
[01:56:05.940 --> 01:56:08.100]   Because it's all you keep, you keep the tag on her because you're turning it.
[01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:09.900]   There's no other excuse or resume.
[01:56:09.900 --> 01:56:14.420]   Because the suit will fall apart if I got even once did anywhere on this thing.
[01:56:14.420 --> 01:56:16.180]   It was only $99.
[01:56:16.180 --> 01:56:17.740]   I'm just saying pay too much.
[01:56:17.740 --> 01:56:18.740]   I probably did.
[01:56:18.740 --> 01:56:21.460]   I thought you're going to say 99 cents at the dollar store.
[01:56:21.460 --> 01:56:23.900]   I swear to God, I thought that's a good sense.
[01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:25.540]   Hey, it's not matching tie.
[01:56:25.540 --> 01:56:26.540]   That's not cheap.
[01:56:26.540 --> 01:56:28.500]   No, no, no, that's two dollars.
[01:56:28.500 --> 01:56:32.260]   But I do think, I think that, I do think to bring it back to the normal conversation is
[01:56:32.260 --> 01:56:35.380]   that, is that, I think Huawei's in big trouble.
[01:56:35.380 --> 01:56:40.420]   So Huawei is, and Z for ZTE practically went out of business because of the US Commerce
[01:56:40.420 --> 01:56:43.660]   Department, the Congress and the US government.
[01:56:43.660 --> 01:56:45.420]   You think Huawei's in big trouble?
[01:56:45.420 --> 01:56:51.180]   Huawei's the number one 5G manufacturing they had at USA John, all the patents.
[01:56:51.180 --> 01:56:54.660]   They're number two smartphone manufacturer after Samsung.
[01:56:54.660 --> 01:56:56.220]   But it's not really why, why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why?
[01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:58.460]   But they're phones in the US because of the US government.
[01:56:58.460 --> 01:57:00.020]   What you can buy from Amazon?
[01:57:00.020 --> 01:57:01.340]   You have to buy from Amazon.
[01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:02.340]   Well I talked to Huawei.
[01:57:02.340 --> 01:57:06.080]   They said they're a director of mobile, US mobile devices.
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:07.540]   They're nice phones too.
[01:57:07.540 --> 01:57:09.100]   They're the P20 and the new mate.
[01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:11.340]   There's fantastic, they're state of the art.
[01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:14.900]   I'm not crazy about the software, but the hardware is incredible.
[01:57:14.900 --> 01:57:16.860]   It's way beyond what we're doing.
[01:57:16.860 --> 01:57:19.820]   They want to make the best cheapest phone to keep it in your hands and take a spy on
[01:57:19.820 --> 01:57:20.820]   you.
[01:57:20.820 --> 01:57:21.820]   Continue.
[01:57:21.820 --> 01:57:24.940]   I do have to admit that when I logged into my P20, the first thing it says is, do you
[01:57:24.940 --> 01:57:30.260]   mind if we get all your information sent back to our servers?
[01:57:30.260 --> 01:57:31.860]   They were very open about it.
[01:57:31.860 --> 01:57:35.300]   Someone asked me just the other day, they were asking me, so why do you use an Apple
[01:57:35.300 --> 01:57:36.980]   TV instead of just using the smart TV?
[01:57:36.980 --> 01:57:41.420]   I'm like, I do not allow my TV to talk to the internet, period.
[01:57:41.420 --> 01:57:43.300]   Like my Apple TV gets to talk to the internet.
[01:57:43.300 --> 01:57:44.740]   My TV does not get to talk to the internet.
[01:57:44.740 --> 01:57:45.740]   I do not trust the TV.
[01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:46.740]   Alex.
[01:57:46.740 --> 01:57:47.740]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:57:47.740 --> 01:57:48.740]   Alex C.
[01:57:48.740 --> 01:57:49.740]   See, you with me, brother.
[01:57:49.740 --> 01:57:50.740]   I tell people the same thing, brother.
[01:57:50.740 --> 01:57:51.740]   Where's my foil hat?
[01:57:51.740 --> 01:57:52.740]   Where's my foil hat?
[01:57:52.740 --> 01:57:53.740]   Exactly.
[01:57:53.740 --> 01:57:54.740]   No, no.
[01:57:54.740 --> 01:57:56.460]   I have everything I need.
[01:57:56.460 --> 01:58:02.660]   I have everything I need with my Apple TV and I trust Apple to do a good job.
[01:58:02.660 --> 01:58:05.260]   I link my new prices all the time.
[01:58:05.260 --> 01:58:07.740]   Where is that Apple TV made out of curiosity?
[01:58:07.740 --> 01:58:10.260]   It is made there, but I trust curiosity.
[01:58:10.260 --> 01:58:12.660]   I had a bitch in like he is.
[01:58:12.660 --> 01:58:15.460]   But the thing is, you got to keep them separated, brother.
[01:58:15.460 --> 01:58:19.220]   And the thing that's different is when you have your TV on, the camera can be hacked
[01:58:19.220 --> 01:58:24.300]   and turned on when you got the cameras in your TV and apps and your TV or they can just
[01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:25.780]   turn it on with the Apple device.
[01:58:25.780 --> 01:58:27.820]   You got to turn on the Apple device and make it smart.
[01:58:27.820 --> 01:58:29.740]   You know when you're using it, brother.
[01:58:29.740 --> 01:58:31.540]   There's a difference in church and state separation.
[01:58:31.540 --> 01:58:33.540]   There's no company working on privacy.
[01:58:33.540 --> 01:58:34.540]   He likes to see more than Apple.
[01:58:34.540 --> 01:58:37.340]   Like I'm not saying that it's, I'm not saying that Apple is going to be, they're not going
[01:58:37.340 --> 01:58:40.380]   to be a hack with Apple, but I can say that there's nobody that cares more about it right
[01:58:40.380 --> 01:58:44.820]   now as far as a large manufacturer than Apple, as far as holding it because that's their
[01:58:44.820 --> 01:58:45.820]   business model.
[01:58:45.820 --> 01:58:49.420]   Yeah, unless you're in China, in which case Apple says, "Hey, here, take these servers
[01:58:49.420 --> 01:58:51.420]   and run them there."
[01:58:51.420 --> 01:58:54.300]   Whoa, when we, Apple's not standing up for the privacy.
[01:58:54.300 --> 01:58:55.300]   On the servers.
[01:58:55.300 --> 01:58:56.460]   No, on the servers.
[01:58:56.460 --> 01:58:58.060]   But they're not standing up here either.
[01:58:58.060 --> 01:59:01.940]   If the FBI, subpoenas, your server-
[01:59:01.940 --> 01:59:02.940]   Let's be honest.
[01:59:02.940 --> 01:59:05.020]   They won't let you have your phone, but they haven't let China have the phone.
[01:59:05.020 --> 01:59:07.500]   They haven't let the United States have the phone.
[01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:08.740]   You know, they hold on to the device.
[01:59:08.740 --> 01:59:10.500]   Is Huawei a threat or not?
[01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:11.500]   Oh yeah.
[01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:12.500]   What do you think, Johnny?
[01:59:12.500 --> 01:59:13.500]   You don't seem to think so.
[01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:15.660]   No, I don't think so.
[01:59:15.660 --> 01:59:17.540]   Because it would be economic suicide for them.
[01:59:17.540 --> 01:59:22.860]   Well, I would be that and they, there's already a kind of a microscope on them and so they're
[01:59:22.860 --> 01:59:23.860]   not going to do anything.
[01:59:23.860 --> 01:59:25.740]   I must feel like this is a political thing.
[01:59:25.740 --> 01:59:27.180]   It's about the trade war.
[01:59:27.180 --> 01:59:31.180]   The drum beat against Chinese companies is more about trade war than it is about actual
[01:59:31.180 --> 01:59:32.180]   security.
[01:59:32.180 --> 01:59:33.980]   I don't think they care to follow the individual.
[01:59:33.980 --> 01:59:37.060]   I think for the Chinese, yeah, they got issues.
[01:59:37.060 --> 01:59:38.060]   The Chinese people are not being-
[01:59:38.060 --> 01:59:39.060]   They're not being spy on us.
[01:59:39.060 --> 01:59:40.060]   I don't think- Why would they bother?
[01:59:40.060 --> 01:59:41.060]   What was the point?
[01:59:41.060 --> 01:59:42.060]   Who cares?
[01:59:42.060 --> 01:59:44.940]   Nothing did their spying on us, but the idea of law in China to have a critical infrastructure
[01:59:44.940 --> 01:59:45.940]   is crazy.
[01:59:45.940 --> 01:59:46.940]   Well, that is bad.
[01:59:46.940 --> 01:59:47.940]   I'm not going to argue with that because-
[01:59:47.940 --> 01:59:49.860]   Like, that is like the 5G infrastructure?
[01:59:49.860 --> 01:59:52.420]   Nobody should be outside of China should be letting China have 5G.
[01:59:52.420 --> 01:59:56.780]   If we made 5G hardware in the United States, that would be a good, you'd say-
[01:59:56.780 --> 01:59:58.700]   No, we'll get it from Erickson or Nokia.
[01:59:58.700 --> 02:00:00.660]   No, you know, like, you know, the 2 and 3.
[02:00:00.660 --> 02:00:01.660]   2 expense.
[02:00:01.660 --> 02:00:04.960]   I think the United States should say you can't connect to our networks if you're using
[02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:05.960]   the home all-way.
[02:00:05.960 --> 02:00:06.960]   Well, they're kind of saying that now is Huawei.
[02:00:06.960 --> 02:00:07.960]   Well, they're getting there.
[02:00:07.960 --> 02:00:08.960]   They're going to say that I think that's what's coming.
[02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:11.620]   Is it the United States saying you can't even connect to the network?
[02:00:11.620 --> 02:00:14.500]   I trust Huawei as much as I trust Facebook.
[02:00:14.500 --> 02:00:16.860]   He says.
[02:00:16.860 --> 02:00:17.860]   Do you worry- I give you that.
[02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:19.560]   Oh, Dr. Hone of called you OJ.
[02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:20.560]   I'm not going to do that.
[02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:22.560]   Do you worry, oh, Dr. OJ?
[02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:31.520]   Oh, D, do you worry that we will have, as a result, a trifurcated or more internet where
[02:00:31.520 --> 02:00:35.320]   there's the Chinese internet, the American internet, and never the twain shall meet.
[02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:36.320]   There's no-
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:39.120]   I always going to meet.
[02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:40.120]   I agree.
[02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:41.120]   It's going to be divided up.
[02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:42.120]   You get through.
[02:00:42.120 --> 02:00:43.120]   Just say.
[02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:44.120]   I was going to say it's the internet.
[02:00:44.120 --> 02:00:45.320]   So it's going to work out that way.
[02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:46.320]   It's like water.
[02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:50.640]   But, you know, the separation is only where it can be and the things it could be in.
[02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:55.200]   But you can get caught and get caught and they string up maybe in China.
[02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:56.200]   That's what I got.
[02:00:56.200 --> 02:00:57.600]   So I got a VPN for a brother.
[02:00:57.600 --> 02:00:58.600]   Yeah.
[02:00:58.600 --> 02:00:59.600]   Well, I'm an estate people right now.
[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:00.600]   I'm an estate people right now.
[02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:01.600]   I have a VPN in China.
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:02.600]   It is.
[02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:03.600]   It is.
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:04.600]   Oh, it's very illegal.
[02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:07.320]   I know Americans who go to China all the time and use VPNs.
[02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:11.720]   Yeah, but it's I'm not sure I would really do that.
[02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:13.240]   One of our salespeople asked me.
[02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:15.320]   You can't get no agenda in China.
[02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:16.320]   Really?
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:17.320]   Yeah.
[02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:19.320]   You don't even put the CDs on the newspaper kiosk.
[02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:20.320]   That's what I was thinking of.
[02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:21.320]   Yeah.
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:23.320]   That's how the reons that are more into that.
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:25.400]   That's how they keep China from the revolution.
[02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:26.400]   They don't let no agenda in.
[02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:27.400]   That's how they keep the-
[02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:28.400]   That's right.
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:29.400]   That's exactly it.
[02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:30.400]   They had no agenda.
[02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:31.400]   It'd be over.
[02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:33.600]   If the people heard no agenda, they'd know.
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:34.600]   They would know.
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:36.160]   What would they know, John?
[02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:38.160]   They would know that they're being scammed.
[02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:39.400]   They're being scammed.
[02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:40.400]   Right?
[02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:42.680]   They'd all get really cranky and start a revolt.
[02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:46.640]   Hey, Cotton Buzzkill say, "You're being scammed in the morning."
[02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:47.640]   Yeah.
[02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:48.640]   Just like that.
[02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:51.520]   That would be it only would be produced.
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:53.640]   In the morning, he turns on that big bottom.
[02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:57.920]   I know he flips that big bottom switch and all of a sudden he's talking like that.
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:03.560]   In the morning, our show today, I want to talk a bit about Super Micro Bloomberg and
[02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:07.600]   then we're going to lift everybody up with all the people who died this year.
[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:08.600]   What?
[02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:11.480]   You're so cheery.
[02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:12.480]   I thought about it.
[02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:13.480]   We can have a roll?
[02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:14.480]   Yeah.
[02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:15.480]   We're going to have a roll.
[02:02:15.480 --> 02:02:16.480]   We're going to have music.
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:17.480]   I'm going to sing.
[02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:20.440]   I'm going to sing you with a wind beneath my wings.
[02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:22.800]   It's going to be a tearful moment.
[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:25.920]   I think it's going to be good.
[02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:31.240]   You never knew you were my hero.
[02:02:31.240 --> 02:02:32.240]   Let me put my hand.
[02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:33.240]   I'm singing lessons now.
[02:02:33.240 --> 02:02:35.240]   You put the hat back on.
[02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:36.240]   Show today.
[02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:38.040]   Brought to you, and boy, are they sorry.
[02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:40.880]   By Brex, this is the credit card for startups.
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:42.600]   This is what we use and it's awesome.
[02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:43.600]   Let's see.
[02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:45.480]   A corporate credit card for a startup.
[02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:48.680]   It's a little tough because you don't have a minimum operating history.
[02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:50.400]   Brex never requires it.
[02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:52.280]   There's no painful paper application.
[02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:53.600]   You're a startup.
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:55.000]   You're working fast.
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:59.680]   Five minutes online, you're going to get approved for your Brex card in minutes.
[02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:03.520]   Everything is not based on your personal liability, your personal credit.
[02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:06.240]   It's based on the cash in your bank account.
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:08.160]   That's how it should be.
[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:10.800]   Brex uses the cash raised by your business to extend credit.
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:11.800]   There's no credit score.
[02:03:11.800 --> 02:03:12.920]   There's no Social Security number.
[02:03:12.920 --> 02:03:14.320]   There's no security deposit.
[02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:15.560]   No, it's a real card.
[02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:16.560]   It's a Visa card.
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:18.360]   In fact, it's the best Visa card you can get.
[02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:24.280]   10 to 20 time higher limits than other corporate credit cards with no personal liability.
[02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:28.440]   Because they know you're a business and you're spending money on some particularly business-like
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:33.560]   things, they're going to give you great points, double points on software, triple points on
[02:03:33.560 --> 02:03:36.840]   restaurants and travel, seven times, what is that?
[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:39.840]   Sceptuple points on ride sharing.
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:40.840]   Here's the best part.
[02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:45.440]   There's no limit on how many points you can earn and points can be redeemed for.
[02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:46.440]   What do you think?
[02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:48.160]   How about statement credit on transactions?
[02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:50.360]   It's cash in your pocket.
[02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:51.440]   They got great offers too.
[02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:54.600]   They'll save you money with some of the best technology brands and services, Amazon Web
[02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:58.720]   Services, Google Ads, Salesforce.
[02:03:58.720 --> 02:04:00.400]   We work.
[02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:03.440]   If you're a sole proprietor, if you're a small business, if you're a startup, this is a
[02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:05.920]   great card and I want to tell you what I love about it.
[02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:08.000]   The first time I used the Brexit blew me away.
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:12.920]   I'm used to it now, but the first time I used it was a restaurant, business meal.
[02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:15.680]   I charged it and I got a text immediately on my phone.
[02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:18.640]   In fact, before the card came back, before the server brought the card back, I got a
[02:04:18.640 --> 02:04:22.200]   text that said, "Oh, take a picture of the receipt."
[02:04:22.200 --> 02:04:23.280]   So the card comes back.
[02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:24.960]   I signed the receipt, take a picture of it.
[02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:26.440]   They say, "We got it.
[02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:28.960]   We've applied that receipt to your most recent purchase.
[02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:29.960]   It's matched.
[02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:32.760]   We're going to put all the descriptions in.
[02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:33.800]   You'd throw away the receipt.
[02:04:33.800 --> 02:04:35.320]   You don't need it."
[02:04:35.320 --> 02:04:39.240]   They've immediately integrated into our QuickBooks, which is really awesome, not just QuickBooks,
[02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:41.200]   but all the major accounting software programs.
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:42.200]   It's in there.
[02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:43.200]   I don't have to save receipts.
[02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:44.560]   I love that.
[02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:48.360]   Of course, because you can give your employees credit cards, they give you great control
[02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:51.600]   on who can use the cards with their limits are.
[02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:56.880]   You can change limits in real time, control spend via virtual cards.
[02:04:56.880 --> 02:05:01.800]   In fact, right now, if you apply, your employees will get virtual cards right away.
[02:05:01.800 --> 02:05:07.120]   Then they quickly mail out the credit, the plastic, within a day or two, you'll get that.
[02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:09.200]   I think this is a great credit card for startups.
[02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:14.200]   Join the thousands of startups and tech companies who use BrexBREX to manage their growing business
[02:05:14.200 --> 02:05:16.440]   needs and earn valuable rewards while doing so.
[02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:22.560]   Get the card free and Twitter listeners get BrexCardFeesWavedInperpetuity.
[02:05:22.560 --> 02:05:24.760]   burex.com/twit.
[02:05:24.760 --> 02:05:32.640]   I think, okay, I have two candidates for the biggest story of the year.
[02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:39.520]   One is, and it may not even be true, Chinese doctor says, "We used CRISPR.
[02:05:39.520 --> 02:05:41.480]   We edited the genes of twins.
[02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:42.640]   They were born.
[02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:45.040]   They are missing a gene that will give them better.
[02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:49.440]   Now they have better resistance against HIV, smallpox, and cholera."
[02:05:49.440 --> 02:05:53.000]   Now Dr. Hu has since disappeared.
[02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:56.920]   I think the Chinese government, which hadn't really been clear that this was against the
[02:05:56.920 --> 02:05:57.920]   law.
[02:05:57.920 --> 02:05:59.440]   It's against law and everywhere else in the world.
[02:05:59.440 --> 02:06:03.160]   But the Chinese government had an administrative regulation.
[02:06:03.160 --> 02:06:05.840]   I'm wondering maybe they thought this is embarrassing.
[02:06:05.840 --> 02:06:06.840]   Do you think Hu did it?
[02:06:06.840 --> 02:06:09.520]   I think his bullcrap story is made up.
[02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:12.840]   It's only a matter of time though before CRISPR is used on humans.
[02:06:12.840 --> 02:06:16.320]   What I thought was interesting was the people were talking about what will happen to these
[02:06:16.320 --> 02:06:20.200]   kids without talking about the fact that if you start messing with a DNA, it's not what
[02:06:20.200 --> 02:06:21.200]   will happen with kids.
[02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:25.200]   What will happen with three generations, four generations down the ground stream.
[02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:27.800]   This isn't just the kids that are growing up.
[02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:28.800]   It's all their offspring.
[02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:32.800]   But people say the same thing about GMOs, genetically modified food.
[02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:36.240]   You want to let those giant salmon loose in the ocean?
[02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:40.160]   GMOs are, as far as I can tell, no scientific hazard.
[02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:43.840]   The problem with GMOs is not the edited corn.
[02:06:43.840 --> 02:06:45.640]   It's the roundup that it allows for.
[02:06:45.640 --> 02:06:46.640]   No, I agree.
[02:06:46.640 --> 02:06:47.640]   And Monsanto's that's the issue.
[02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:49.880]   And the fact that you, you know, it's not the patenting.
[02:06:49.880 --> 02:06:50.880]   It's the fact that the-
[02:06:50.880 --> 02:06:51.880]   No, yeah, I know what he's saying.
[02:06:51.880 --> 02:06:53.880]   He's talking about the patents making it difficult for farmers.
[02:06:53.880 --> 02:06:54.880]   No, no, no.
[02:06:54.880 --> 02:06:55.880]   They can't talk about the fact that-
[02:06:55.880 --> 02:06:56.880]   I see it every year.
[02:06:56.880 --> 02:06:57.880]   They can't reuse it.
[02:06:57.880 --> 02:06:58.880]   I can't afford it.
[02:06:58.880 --> 02:07:01.560]   I'm talking about the fact that Roundup is showing up in our food supply and in our blood.
[02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:02.560]   That's not so good.
[02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:03.560]   No, it's not good.
[02:07:03.560 --> 02:07:06.560]   And that, but that's the problem with the GMO is not editing the-
[02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:09.160]   If you do GMO, then you don't need Roundup.
[02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:10.160]   No, that's what you have to-
[02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:11.880]   Oh, you have the roundup in the gene?
[02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:15.600]   No, the GMO makes the corn resistant to the-
[02:07:15.600 --> 02:07:17.840]   So the corn isn't killed by the Roundup.
[02:07:17.840 --> 02:07:18.840]   Roundup.
[02:07:18.840 --> 02:07:20.040]   And so that's the GMO.
[02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:25.000]   That's why GMO is so effective is because it means that you can crush all the weeds.
[02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:26.000]   That's a different objection.
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:27.000]   I just-
[02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000]   I don't think we're worried about children being resistant to Roundup.
[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:30.000]   Well, actually that'd be pretty good.
[02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:31.000]   No, it's-
[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:32.000]   That's pretty good genetic and modification.
[02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:33.000]   It's bad news.
[02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:34.000]   Roundup is bad.
[02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:35.000]   Now you're just being silly.
[02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:36.000]   Oh, my God.
[02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:39.000]   You think genetic modification of children is bad.
[02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:40.000]   Children is a bad idea.
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:41.000]   Yes.
[02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:42.720]   I think it's a bad idea.
[02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:43.880]   I think somebody's doing it.
[02:07:43.880 --> 02:07:44.880]   It's gonna happen.
[02:07:44.880 --> 02:07:45.880]   Oh, it's gonna happen.
[02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:46.880]   I didn't do it.
[02:07:46.880 --> 02:07:47.880]   Somebody's gonna do it.
[02:07:47.880 --> 02:07:48.880]   Somebody's gonna do it.
[02:07:48.880 --> 02:07:49.880]   And that's my thing.
[02:07:49.880 --> 02:07:50.880]   Maybe go.
[02:07:50.880 --> 02:07:53.480]   I feel like he might have done it and that's why they took him out because that's what
[02:07:53.480 --> 02:07:54.480]   you do in the movies, right?
[02:07:54.480 --> 02:07:55.480]   Right.
[02:07:55.480 --> 02:07:56.480]   The guy goes and sneaks out something.
[02:07:56.480 --> 02:07:59.160]   He made some alien mongoid babies and then they took him out.
[02:07:59.160 --> 02:08:02.520]   So I know that this is being done somewhere in a secret lab no matter what country says
[02:08:02.520 --> 02:08:03.520]   that they don't do it.
[02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:05.480]   They don't buy it, buy it, discuss the rules.
[02:08:05.480 --> 02:08:08.960]   People are doing it and it's scary and it's freaky and I still got my hat on.
[02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:13.360]   I think that this is the only the first time someone publicly talked about it.
[02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:17.400]   I think I completely agree that it's been happening.
[02:08:17.400 --> 02:08:20.280]   Probably in China and probably in a lot of places.
[02:08:20.280 --> 02:08:21.280]   Yeah.
[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:23.080]   Probably in a secret lab in Washington, DC.
[02:08:23.080 --> 02:08:24.640]   I wouldn't be surprised.
[02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:25.640]   Under a piece of.
[02:08:25.640 --> 02:08:26.640]   It's a D trick.
[02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:27.640]   Definitely under a piece of paper.
[02:08:27.640 --> 02:08:28.640]   It's a D trick.
[02:08:28.640 --> 02:08:29.640]   That's where it all happens.
[02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:30.640]   It's where the alien is.
[02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:32.640]   That's where the spaceship area 51.
[02:08:32.640 --> 02:08:33.640]   That's where it's where it's going.
[02:08:33.640 --> 02:08:36.640]   Well, I was a totally different kind of arm.
[02:08:36.640 --> 02:08:41.960]   You're just going to mock the whole idea that anybody's doing anything kind of creepy.
[02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:43.360]   No, I don't mock that.
[02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:44.360]   I think it's true.
[02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:46.600]   What are they doing in Fort Detrick?
[02:08:46.600 --> 02:08:50.240]   I'm just saying just mention Fort Detrick because of the cognizantie out there listening
[02:08:50.240 --> 02:08:51.240]   to the show.
[02:08:51.240 --> 02:08:52.240]   You know, we'll know when I'm talking about it.
[02:08:52.240 --> 02:08:54.640]   The QAnon people will know what we're talking about.
[02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:56.120]   No such thing as QAnon.
[02:08:56.120 --> 02:08:57.120]   Okay.
[02:08:57.120 --> 02:08:58.120]   Some guy.
[02:08:58.120 --> 02:08:59.120]   I that I agree with.
[02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:00.520]   What's what's what's the other story?
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:01.520]   What'd you got?
[02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:02.520]   Okay.
[02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:03.920]   So that's possibly the big story of the year.
[02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:06.440]   I mean, if it's true, this will be true.
[02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:10.040]   And this is going to be our future is genetically modified children.
[02:09:10.040 --> 02:09:11.040]   Okay.
[02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:12.040]   It's true that they're trying to do it.
[02:09:12.040 --> 02:09:13.360]   Let's put the can we agree on that?
[02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:14.360]   Okay.
[02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:15.360]   Somebody's work on it.
[02:09:15.360 --> 02:09:16.360]   You know what?
[02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:17.360]   You guys, it's not the big story.
[02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:22.120]   Then the other big story of the year is Bloomberg's Super Micro Story where Bloomberg
[02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:28.280]   asserted with 17 anonymous sources that Super Micro Motherboards have been modified by Chinese
[02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:32.600]   bad actors with a rice size component.
[02:09:32.600 --> 02:09:35.640]   The boards were used in elementals that were sent to the Department of Defense.
[02:09:35.640 --> 02:09:36.640]   I have the elementals.
[02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:37.640]   It's a good to us.
[02:09:37.640 --> 02:09:38.640]   It's a good story.
[02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:41.280]   I actually own an element.
[02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:42.880]   Have that candy that was sold.
[02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:46.680]   Thanks for giving me the worst possible candy for a show host.
[02:09:46.680 --> 02:09:47.680]   This thing.
[02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:50.080]   Well, I have to admit, John brought him in and I looked at one.
[02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:51.400]   I was like, I'm not going to eat that one.
[02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:52.640]   And I just grabbed the other one.
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:53.640]   What is this?
[02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:55.440]   A thousand two coming.
[02:09:55.440 --> 02:10:01.160]   Did you did you did you did you write for the real person church or something?
[02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:02.160]   Where'd you get that from?
[02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:03.160]   I didn't tell you.
[02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:04.160]   I'm not dying tonight.
[02:10:04.160 --> 02:10:05.160]   So it's good with Konya.
[02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:06.520]   I need to dissolve it.
[02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:08.520]   Would you give me some alcohol, please?
[02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:09.520]   Yeah.
[02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:12.520]   So we bought in the spring of 2015.
[02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:14.880]   We brought a daddy's juice.
[02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:15.880]   We brought some elementals.
[02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:16.880]   Yeah.
[02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:20.960]   And so we turned them back to get the Amazon ones, right?
[02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:26.440]   But I have the elementals that were in that in that in that back to they talked about.
[02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:30.320]   So so we tore one apart.
[02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:31.320]   We had an X-rayed.
[02:10:31.320 --> 02:10:32.320]   We had people look at it.
[02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:33.320]   We had bits.
[02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:34.320]   You have the skill needed to really.
[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:35.320]   Not me.
[02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:36.320]   Not me.
[02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:37.320]   People do.
[02:10:37.320 --> 02:10:39.240]   I'm not going to I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say who it is, but someone who really
[02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:41.200]   knows what he's doing and has the.
[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:42.200]   Scott Warren.
[02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:43.200]   No, not Scott Warren.
[02:10:43.200 --> 02:10:44.200]   No.
[02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:45.200]   Chip designer.
[02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:46.200]   Chip designer.
[02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:47.200]   So so you know like like people they can do it.
[02:10:47.200 --> 02:10:48.200]   People who can do it.
[02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:49.200]   Like we had experts look at it.
[02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:50.200]   They tore it apart.
[02:10:50.200 --> 02:10:51.440]   They and you know what they found?
[02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:52.440]   What nothing?
[02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:53.440]   Nothing.
[02:10:53.440 --> 02:10:54.440]   No, it was a it was a rice chip.
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:55.920]   It is so it's interesting.
[02:10:55.920 --> 02:10:56.920]   It's a super.
[02:10:56.920 --> 02:10:59.320]   A piece of brown rice did the same thing.
[02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:04.040]   Super micro hired a firm that specializes in this Nardello and company.
[02:11:04.040 --> 02:11:06.840]   They also they went through motherboards current motherboards and motherboards from
[02:11:06.840 --> 02:11:12.280]   that era found nothing and super micro put out a press release saying we're considering
[02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:13.280]   legal action.
[02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:14.280]   They should.
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:18.040]   They should and how did Bloomberg get this so wrong?
[02:11:18.040 --> 02:11:22.680]   Anonymous tips all anonymous tips with no with no with no proof set up by the 40 trick
[02:11:22.680 --> 02:11:23.680]   types.
[02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:28.360]   Some no they would be set up by somebody who hates super micro or play the real play is
[02:11:28.360 --> 02:11:29.880]   the stock stock market.
[02:11:29.880 --> 02:11:35.080]   You send a bunch of phony things and if these guys bite which they did and you're short
[02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:39.520]   or you've got to put out there and you just this thing sink down and you well and then
[02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:44.120]   you buy low and you're back in it you know and you'll never get caught if you do it
[02:11:44.120 --> 02:11:45.280]   right.
[02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:46.960]   I think I think it was a stock play.
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:47.960]   Yeah.
[02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:48.960]   Smack.
[02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:49.960]   And they got a.
[02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:54.280]   Bloomberg reporters are constantly bombarded with these kinds of I'm surprised they haven't
[02:11:54.280 --> 02:11:55.280]   got better filters.
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:56.280]   How do they feel for that?
[02:11:56.280 --> 02:11:57.280]   They had good editors.
[02:11:57.280 --> 02:12:00.040]   They worked on the story for a year.
[02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:03.160]   There's a lot of lousy reporters out there.
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:05.640]   And I think that also you get caught up in the story.
[02:12:05.640 --> 02:12:07.480]   It's very embarrassing for Bloomberg if it's true.
[02:12:07.480 --> 02:12:08.480]   Yeah.
[02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:11.400]   Well it just could happen to any of these big operations.
[02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:12.400]   So okay.
[02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:13.400]   So it's not a story.
[02:12:13.400 --> 02:12:14.400]   It's a non story.
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:16.640]   It's not a story without the big story of the year by any means.
[02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:20.040]   Well it's a big story because it ruins Bloomberg's credibility.
[02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:21.040]   Yeah.
[02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:23.200]   I mean it just in the fact that they just keep on hanging on to it and just hoping this
[02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:24.720]   is going to fade away.
[02:12:24.720 --> 02:12:27.880]   You know and you know sometime in the next couple of weeks I'm going to post a bunch
[02:12:27.880 --> 02:12:30.800]   of pictures of all the X-rays and all the other stuff and we're going to you know just
[02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:32.440]   show that but we're going to talk about it again.
[02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:34.000]   You know they're not going to get to walk away from this.
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.800]   You know they need to actually back away.
[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:40.920]   You said that day one on Mac break weekly you were you were absolutely adamant so was
[02:12:40.920 --> 02:12:41.920]   Andy.
[02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:43.080]   I was a little less.
[02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:45.280]   I thought but I can't believe Bloomberg would get this wrong.
[02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:47.120]   They must have some reason for thinking that's true.
[02:12:47.120 --> 02:12:48.840]   He never worked in the media.
[02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:50.080]   I never worked in the media.
[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:51.080]   Yeah.
[02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:52.080]   That's why Andy and I knew.
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:53.080]   Really.
[02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:56.280]   It's like when you saw the reactions from Apple and you saw the reactions from everyone
[02:12:56.280 --> 02:12:58.280]   else like no one does that.
[02:12:58.280 --> 02:13:02.760]   A publicly traded company can't say what those companies said unless they're apples
[02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:03.760]   are meant to be sure.
[02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:09.040]   Like like you can't because if Apple had any hint of not being sure they would have never
[02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:12.920]   had those releases because they'd be accountable for that's it.
[02:13:12.920 --> 02:13:17.800]   That's a that's a that's a bigger problem than Elon Musk you know and so they can't they
[02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:21.360]   can't say that the fact that they were so sure you knew that that they had stepped into
[02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:23.360]   something that they shouldn't have stepped into.
[02:13:23.360 --> 02:13:25.360]   Yeah I agree.
[02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:26.360]   Alright next.
[02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:27.360]   Next.
[02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:28.360]   Clop.
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:29.360]   People dead.
[02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:30.360]   Oh no we're going to do people dead.
[02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:31.360]   So you're actually going to do this.
[02:13:31.360 --> 02:13:34.520]   You never knew you were my hero.
[02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:36.080]   John Perry Barlow passed away.
[02:13:36.080 --> 02:13:37.080]   Yes.
[02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:40.540]   His grandad Pioneer like founder of the electronic frontier foundation.
[02:13:40.540 --> 02:13:42.060]   I considered him a friend.
[02:13:42.060 --> 02:13:43.460]   Really great guy.
[02:13:43.460 --> 02:13:47.200]   Us a lyric writer for the Grateful Dead among other things.
[02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:53.600]   I went to a benefit for him with the Grateful with remaining members of the Grateful Dead
[02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:54.600]   and some great people.
[02:13:54.600 --> 02:13:56.600]   It was really anyway we're sorry to lose it.
[02:13:56.600 --> 02:13:58.280]   John he was a great guy.
[02:13:58.280 --> 02:13:59.640]   Stanley passed away.
[02:13:59.640 --> 02:14:00.640]   He was 95.
[02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:03.080]   No we met him when he was at Tech TV.
[02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:04.080]   Really?
[02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:05.440]   You didn't know he was a Tech TV.
[02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:06.440]   Was he?
[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:07.880]   Yeah he did the big thinker show.
[02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:08.880]   With you.
[02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:09.880]   Yeah.
[02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:12.280]   Well no he didn't do it with me I was on the show but he was he was one of the guys
[02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:13.280]   interview.
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:14.280]   Oh he was Mark Hetto.
[02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:15.280]   You interviewed him.
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:16.280]   Yeah.
[02:14:16.280 --> 02:14:17.280]   You interviewed him.
[02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:18.280]   Mark Hetto.
[02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:20.720]   Anthony Bourdain said to lose him.
[02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:23.520]   Not really a tech story but said it all.
[02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:24.520]   No not at all.
[02:14:24.520 --> 02:14:29.520]   Art Bell weird radio pioneer and forefather of no agenda passed away.
[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:30.800]   Not really but okay.
[02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:33.240]   I like the jade the jibe.
[02:14:33.240 --> 02:14:34.240]   That was it.
[02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:35.240]   You were waiting for the jibe.
[02:14:35.240 --> 02:14:37.640]   You know you're supposed to be able to get me on that show.
[02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:38.960]   Art Bell coast to coast.
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:40.040]   You've been on coast to coast.
[02:14:40.040 --> 02:14:41.040]   Never.
[02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:42.600]   Oh I've been on coast to coast.
[02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:43.600]   They call you up.
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:47.360]   They call you up for a sound bite in the news like a thirty sound.
[02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:49.040]   I want to be on the show as a guest.
[02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:50.040]   Well he's dead now.
[02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:52.280]   No they still have coast to coast with the nori.
[02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:53.280]   Yeah George Nori.
[02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:54.280]   Yeah.
[02:14:54.280 --> 02:14:55.280]   Yeah with George.
[02:14:55.280 --> 02:14:56.760]   Yeah you know George he's like a friend of yours.
[02:14:56.760 --> 02:14:57.760]   I know people.
[02:14:57.760 --> 02:14:58.760]   Make it happen Uncle Leo.
[02:14:58.760 --> 02:14:59.760]   You work on the same.
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:00.960]   Yeah we'll put it down in a list of things.
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:01.960]   From your radio networks.
[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:02.960]   Oh is that right?
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:03.960]   Yeah.
[02:15:03.960 --> 02:15:04.960]   No are you going to make it then.
[02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:07.520]   In fact unfortunately he keeps stealing my engineers.
[02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:10.720]   They all go to coast to coast.
[02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:12.720]   Like that's a promotion.
[02:15:12.720 --> 02:15:14.720]   Apparently it is.
[02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:17.160]   You'll do so.
[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:19.120]   Who else passed away.
[02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:21.080]   Somebody you'll know John Bill Godbout.
[02:15:21.080 --> 02:15:22.080]   Oh yes.
[02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:23.080]   Yeah.
[02:15:23.080 --> 02:15:26.400]   Most of most people in computing don't remember that name but he was locally they do.
[02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:27.760]   Founder of the S100 bus sadly.
[02:15:27.760 --> 02:15:29.520]   No no he was not founder of S100 bus.
[02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:30.760]   But a promoter I should say.
[02:15:30.760 --> 02:15:32.560]   Big promoter of the S100 bus.
[02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:33.560]   And Godbout computing.
[02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:34.880]   He probably had a Godbout.
[02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:35.880]   No I never did.
[02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:37.720]   He had a blimp license.
[02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:38.720]   Really?
[02:15:38.720 --> 02:15:39.720]   Yeah.
[02:15:39.720 --> 02:15:40.720]   He's one of the few people in the Bay Area.
[02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:42.200]   Sadly passed away in the paradise fire.
[02:15:42.200 --> 02:15:43.200]   He was one of the people.
[02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:44.400]   Yeah he had a place up there.
[02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:45.400]   Yeah.
[02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:47.120]   Anybody else die?
[02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:48.120]   Anybody?
[02:15:48.120 --> 02:15:49.120]   That's it.
[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:50.120]   You get the short list.
[02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:51.120]   There's going to be two or three more people.
[02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:52.120]   I should have put this slow motion.
[02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:53.120]   Technology.
[02:15:53.120 --> 02:15:54.120]   I usually get through the whole song.
[02:15:54.120 --> 02:15:55.120]   The owner of the vehicle.
[02:15:55.120 --> 02:15:56.120]   The owner of the ship designers at bay.
[02:15:56.120 --> 02:15:57.440]   Oh of course Paul Allen.
[02:15:57.440 --> 02:15:58.440]   I knew there was somebody.
[02:15:58.440 --> 02:15:59.960]   Ah Paul Allen yes.
[02:15:59.960 --> 02:16:01.320]   You and I both knew Paul Allen.
[02:16:01.320 --> 02:16:02.920]   We both worked for Paul Allen.
[02:16:02.920 --> 02:16:05.560]   Yeah technically we did.
[02:16:05.560 --> 02:16:06.560]   Do you have any Paul?
[02:16:06.560 --> 02:16:08.160]   Did you ever get to get to go the yacht?
[02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:09.160]   The yachts.
[02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:11.080]   There's three of them you had.
[02:16:11.080 --> 02:16:13.440]   Yeah but the one with the submarine in it in this recording studio.
[02:16:13.440 --> 02:16:14.440]   No did you?
[02:16:14.440 --> 02:16:15.440]   No.
[02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:16.440]   Greg Dribbon got to our program director.
[02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:17.440]   He told me.
[02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:18.840]   He was what's the useless guy to take there.
[02:16:18.840 --> 02:16:19.840]   I know.
[02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:20.840]   He'd take the hosts.
[02:16:20.840 --> 02:16:21.840]   Take the stars and everything.
[02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:24.720]   He would do you know is one of those things where you're the guy.
[02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:27.160]   Hey we'd like to bring some of the hosts on the boat.
[02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:28.720]   No you don't want them.
[02:16:28.720 --> 02:16:29.720]   You want me.
[02:16:29.720 --> 02:16:30.720]   That's crazy.
[02:16:30.720 --> 02:16:32.160]   That's the way it always works in TV.
[02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:33.160]   I know.
[02:16:33.160 --> 02:16:36.280]   We had a program director, a successor to Greg Dribbon.
[02:16:36.280 --> 02:16:37.640]   Paul Allen.
[02:16:37.640 --> 02:16:39.040]   The owner of the channel I might add.
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:40.040]   Have I mentioned that?
[02:16:40.040 --> 02:16:43.880]   Says to him, why don't you ever do shows for people like me?
[02:16:43.880 --> 02:16:48.800]   And Greg Brannon, the program director of the time, who's also I think passed away, said
[02:16:48.800 --> 02:16:53.280]   oh Paul we're never going to do shows for people like you.
[02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:56.080]   Somebody had to explain to him you have an audience of one person.
[02:16:56.080 --> 02:16:57.560]   Paul freaking Allen.
[02:16:57.560 --> 02:16:58.560]   It's always him.
[02:16:58.560 --> 02:16:59.560]   Yeah.
[02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:03.200]   That's the way he took internet tonight off the air.
[02:17:03.200 --> 02:17:05.040]   Paul for some reason he would.
[02:17:05.040 --> 02:17:07.640]   It was probably the best produced show.
[02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:09.360]   No offense to your shows and all the rest.
[02:17:09.360 --> 02:17:11.000]   No that was the show that they thought.
[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.400]   Tech TV thought was going to be the hit because it was the most produced.
[02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:14.400]   It had a script.
[02:17:14.400 --> 02:17:15.400]   It was super produced.
[02:17:15.400 --> 02:17:17.400]   It was super propolish.
[02:17:17.400 --> 02:17:20.880]   It was a great show for high-end TV.
[02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:21.880]   Slick.
[02:17:21.880 --> 02:17:22.880]   Nobody watched it.
[02:17:22.880 --> 02:17:25.600]   Well whether they watched it or not it was still a good show.
[02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:27.040]   They could have done more with it.
[02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:28.040]   They didn't promote it.
[02:17:28.040 --> 02:17:29.040]   He didn't like it.
[02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:30.040]   Paul didn't like it.
[02:17:30.040 --> 02:17:32.520]   He took a dislike that I think probably the hosts.
[02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:33.520]   Sasquatch.
[02:17:33.520 --> 02:17:34.520]   Sasquatch.
[02:17:34.520 --> 02:17:38.600]   And then he just killed it out of the blue.
[02:17:38.600 --> 02:17:39.600]   Everyone was stunned.
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:40.600]   Stunned.
[02:17:40.600 --> 02:17:43.400]   These are stories of your.
[02:17:43.400 --> 02:17:45.960]   Stories of the old days of Tech TV.
[02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:47.920]   Okay, enough of that.
[02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:49.160]   I think we can go home.
[02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:51.080]   We can take our connyak and go home.
[02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:52.080]   Do you agree?
[02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:54.120]   Have we satisfied the live studio audience?
[02:17:54.120 --> 02:17:55.120]   I hope so.
[02:17:55.120 --> 02:17:56.120]   Okay.
[02:17:56.120 --> 02:17:58.920]   Have you all followed John C. de Vorac on Twitter?
[02:17:58.920 --> 02:18:02.640]   Everybody at home, if you all followed John C. de Vorac on Twitter, I'm not leaving this
[02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:04.720]   microphone until John gets 105,000.
[02:18:04.720 --> 02:18:08.040]   You don't need to hear for all the week.
[02:18:08.040 --> 02:18:09.040]   Oh, no.
[02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:11.640]   I just want John to come back.
[02:18:11.640 --> 02:18:12.640]   All right.
[02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:13.640]   What are we at now?
[02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:14.640]   102.
[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:16.640]   Pretty much stuck at 102.
[02:18:16.640 --> 02:18:19.360]   Let's go to the tote board.
[02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:20.360]   How many is he?
[02:18:20.360 --> 02:18:22.320]   He has almost up to now.
[02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:24.120]   Almost 300.
[02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:25.680]   Almost 300.
[02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:26.680]   That's good.
[02:18:26.680 --> 02:18:28.000]   It's better than nothing.
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.600]   It's not the Twitter army of your.
[02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:30.760]   No, the Twitter army used to be some.
[02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:33.160]   It's kind of more like a, I don't know, a twit battalion.
[02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:36.960]   Thanks to the chat room for giving me kudos.
[02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:38.320]   We were really thrilled to have you back.
[02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:41.240]   John C. de Vorac, noagendiceshow.com.
[02:18:41.240 --> 02:18:45.560]   And the real de Vorac on Twitter, make sure you follow him.
[02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:48.680]   And if you've got a Valdez Valdosta state t-shirt.
[02:18:48.680 --> 02:18:49.680]   Hoodie.
[02:18:49.680 --> 02:18:50.680]   Hoodie.
[02:18:50.680 --> 02:18:51.680]   Oh, it's got to be a hoodie.
[02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:52.680]   Well, I don't know.
[02:18:52.680 --> 02:18:53.680]   I could be a sweatshirt.
[02:18:53.680 --> 02:18:54.680]   I just don't want a t-shirt.
[02:18:54.680 --> 02:18:57.400]   It's got to be something with some substance, something thick, something with a nice fine
[02:18:57.400 --> 02:18:59.560]   cotton, maybe a 300 thread count.
[02:18:59.560 --> 02:19:00.560]   Yeah, there you go.
[02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:05.200]   That's what he concerns himself with nowadays, the thread count, believe me.
[02:19:05.200 --> 02:19:06.760]   300 thread count.
[02:19:06.760 --> 02:19:09.720]   You won't even check in at a hotel if it doesn't have 450.
[02:19:09.720 --> 02:19:10.720]   Oh, three.
[02:19:10.720 --> 02:19:11.720]   Yeah.
[02:19:11.720 --> 02:19:12.720]   Not even.
[02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:13.720]   Yeah.
[02:19:13.720 --> 02:19:14.720]   No, I don't want sheets.
[02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:16.160]   I want the skins of young children on my bed.
[02:19:16.160 --> 02:19:17.760]   No, you're not going to get that.
[02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:19.560]   You might get that in Afghanistan.
[02:19:19.560 --> 02:19:22.640]   That was too soon.
[02:19:22.640 --> 02:19:23.640]   Mr. John C.
[02:19:23.640 --> 02:19:24.640]   Thank you for coming.
[02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:26.840]   Come back, please.
[02:19:26.840 --> 02:19:29.440]   That's the problem is everybody is watching already follows you.
[02:19:29.440 --> 02:19:30.760]   That's really the problem.
[02:19:30.760 --> 02:19:31.760]   That's all.
[02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:32.760]   That's a problem.
[02:19:32.760 --> 02:19:33.760]   That's a problem.
[02:19:33.760 --> 02:19:34.760]   All right.
[02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:36.880]   Mr. Alex Lindsey, he's at the Pixel core.
[02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:38.120]   You should follow him on Twitter.
[02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:39.480]   We want to get him up to what?
[02:19:39.480 --> 02:19:40.480]   45,000?
[02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:41.480]   Just 40.
[02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:43.400]   I've been stuck in 38 for a long time.
[02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:44.400]   At a LEX, L-I-E-S-A.
[02:19:44.400 --> 02:19:47.400]   Even if it's going to be 39.
[02:19:47.400 --> 02:19:49.240]   Alex, somebody buy him some followers.
[02:19:49.240 --> 02:19:50.240]   We don't need this.
[02:19:50.240 --> 02:19:51.240]   Buy him some followers.
[02:19:51.240 --> 02:19:52.240]   Come on.
[02:19:52.240 --> 02:19:55.640]   You know, followers you buy are just as good as real followers.
[02:19:55.640 --> 02:19:57.720]   For the purposes of groucing, yeah.
[02:19:57.720 --> 02:19:58.720]   Yeah.
[02:19:58.720 --> 02:19:59.880]   There's my spider.
[02:19:59.880 --> 02:20:00.880]   That was the...
[02:20:00.880 --> 02:20:02.680]   Oh, this is like, this is on Reddit.
[02:20:02.680 --> 02:20:03.880]   This is like all over the world.
[02:20:03.880 --> 02:20:04.880]   This is huge.
[02:20:04.880 --> 02:20:05.880]   So this was a scorpion.
[02:20:05.880 --> 02:20:06.880]   That's a scorpion.
[02:20:06.880 --> 02:20:07.880]   It's gross.
[02:20:07.880 --> 02:20:11.240]   There's a scorpion in Northern California and Marin County.
[02:20:11.240 --> 02:20:13.040]   And then Black Widow Spider is...
[02:20:13.040 --> 02:20:14.880]   We have scorpions now.
[02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:15.880]   No, it's a...
[02:20:15.880 --> 02:20:16.880]   We didn't have...
[02:20:16.880 --> 02:20:17.880]   Is this a wrap-up thing?
[02:20:17.880 --> 02:20:18.880]   Look at this guy.
[02:20:18.880 --> 02:20:19.880]   Oh, wow.
[02:20:19.880 --> 02:20:26.040]   And so it's a live scorpion being slowly wrapped up by a Black Widow Spider in my kid's bathroom.
[02:20:26.040 --> 02:20:27.720]   And you posted this, why?
[02:20:27.720 --> 02:20:32.880]   Because I was like, as soon as I started shooting it, Malick, I was like, you should post this
[02:20:32.880 --> 02:20:33.880]   on Twitter.
[02:20:33.880 --> 02:20:35.240]   I was like, oh, I'm going to post this on Twitter.
[02:20:35.240 --> 02:20:38.120]   I had to take the audio out because you hear I was talking about it.
[02:20:38.120 --> 02:20:39.120]   But it's a...
[02:20:39.120 --> 02:20:40.120]   And an actual...
[02:20:40.120 --> 02:20:41.480]   But the hair comes, watch this, watch this.
[02:20:41.480 --> 02:20:42.480]   This is the best part.
[02:20:42.480 --> 02:20:43.480]   I know.
[02:20:43.480 --> 02:20:44.480]   You know, we didn't watch any of it.
[02:20:44.480 --> 02:20:45.480]   See that little leg over there?
[02:20:45.480 --> 02:20:46.480]   That's one of the spider legs.
[02:20:46.480 --> 02:20:47.480]   Oh my God.
[02:20:47.480 --> 02:20:48.480]   Like he lost it.
[02:20:48.480 --> 02:20:49.480]   Why does this scorpion just sting him?
[02:20:49.480 --> 02:20:50.480]   He's trying.
[02:20:50.480 --> 02:20:51.480]   He's trying.
[02:20:51.480 --> 02:20:52.480]   But this spider is wily.
[02:20:52.480 --> 02:20:53.480]   There's a way they love it on Reddit.
[02:20:53.480 --> 02:20:54.480]   There's spiders been...
[02:20:54.480 --> 02:20:55.480]   Oh man.
[02:20:55.480 --> 02:20:56.480]   He's got some venom that just...
[02:20:56.480 --> 02:20:57.480]   Look at this.
[02:20:57.480 --> 02:20:58.480]   Look at this.
[02:20:58.480 --> 02:20:59.480]   The big fight.
[02:20:59.480 --> 02:21:00.480]   Here comes the big fight.
[02:21:00.480 --> 02:21:02.480]   Ah, come on.
[02:21:02.480 --> 02:21:03.480]   This is horrific.
[02:21:03.480 --> 02:21:04.480]   Children stop watching.
[02:21:04.480 --> 02:21:05.480]   Yes.
[02:21:05.480 --> 02:21:06.480]   This is amazing.
[02:21:06.480 --> 02:21:07.480]   This is amazing.
[02:21:07.480 --> 02:21:08.480]   I was so frustrated that it was too...
[02:21:08.480 --> 02:21:09.480]   When they shot gun...
[02:21:09.480 --> 02:21:12.040]   No, we left him there.
[02:21:12.040 --> 02:21:13.040]   Thank you, faux pas.
[02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:14.720]   Well, of course, I put it up there.
[02:21:14.720 --> 02:21:15.720]   I was like a spider.
[02:21:15.720 --> 02:21:17.000]   This is why we don't kill spiders.
[02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:18.000]   And then someone posted...
[02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:19.000]   An Etymology...
[02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:20.000]   Etymology.
[02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:21.000]   Etymology.
[02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:22.000]   And Tymond was just...
[02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:23.000]   An Etymology.
[02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:24.000]   Posted.
[02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:27.360]   He's like, by the way, that's a burrowing scorpion.
[02:21:27.360 --> 02:21:29.760]   They're nothing but the black widow that's tying him up.
[02:21:29.760 --> 02:21:30.760]   You should probably kill that.
[02:21:30.760 --> 02:21:32.800]   You should have seen when the brown recluse came in.
[02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:33.800]   That was something...
[02:21:33.800 --> 02:21:35.680]   Yeah, those things are nasty.
[02:21:35.680 --> 02:21:38.800]   Ladies and gentlemen, we also thank Mr. Doctor...
[02:21:38.800 --> 02:21:39.800]   Oh, Doctor.
[02:21:39.800 --> 02:21:42.960]   Oh, and JJ Stone, IQMZ.com.
[02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:46.480]   He's on the Twitter, O-H-T-O-H-T-O-C-T-A-H, and he wants to say something.
[02:21:46.480 --> 02:21:47.480]   Yeah.
[02:21:47.480 --> 02:21:48.480]   Yeah.
[02:21:48.480 --> 02:21:49.480]   Don't worry about my Twitter.
[02:21:49.480 --> 02:21:51.520]   The 11,000 of y'all, I'm grateful for you to be there.
[02:21:51.520 --> 02:21:55.280]   If I can get some of the 100,000 JCD got, then that's useful.
[02:21:55.280 --> 02:21:59.600]   But otherwise, if you go to iQMsZ.com up there, I have...
[02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:01.400]   I'm doing a tech show now.
[02:22:01.400 --> 02:22:02.400]   It doesn't suck right now.
[02:22:02.400 --> 02:22:03.920]   I actually got 13 episodes in.
[02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:04.920]   It's pretty good.
[02:22:04.920 --> 02:22:07.800]   And then I do a podcast with my daughter because people always ask for that.
[02:22:07.800 --> 02:22:08.800]   Oh, she's great.
[02:22:08.800 --> 02:22:11.480]   It's called Raising a Ninja.
[02:22:11.480 --> 02:22:12.480]   I got one episode up.
[02:22:12.480 --> 02:22:13.480]   I got four episodes in the cancer.
[02:22:13.480 --> 02:22:16.560]   Actually, how they see you get to hear me and her talk about living the dream of balling
[02:22:16.560 --> 02:22:17.920]   out these streets.
[02:22:17.920 --> 02:22:22.480]   And also, Doc Tales, Megamoroni, to its own, is on a new episode of that.
[02:22:22.480 --> 02:22:23.720]   You got heard to do it?
[02:22:23.720 --> 02:22:24.720]   Yeah.
[02:22:24.720 --> 02:22:25.720]   So go subscribe to these things.
[02:22:25.720 --> 02:22:26.720]   Yes.
[02:22:26.720 --> 02:22:29.440]   And you will have good content coming your way.
[02:22:29.440 --> 02:22:30.440]   Yes.
[02:22:30.440 --> 02:22:32.720]   The reason the thing is when I'm most proud of, because me and my daughter, we talk about
[02:22:32.720 --> 02:22:35.640]   this gangster stuff, how we be doing it in these streets.
[02:22:35.640 --> 02:22:37.760]   She's doing wrestling right now this season.
[02:22:37.760 --> 02:22:38.760]   It's good.
[02:22:38.760 --> 02:22:40.760]   Did Megan say anything about me?
[02:22:40.760 --> 02:22:41.760]   Whoooooo!
[02:22:41.760 --> 02:22:42.760]   Whoooooo!
[02:22:42.760 --> 02:22:43.760]   You have to listen.
[02:22:43.760 --> 02:22:44.760]   You have to listen.
[02:22:44.760 --> 02:22:45.760]   I didn't edit it.
[02:22:45.760 --> 02:22:46.760]   So, you know, I didn't edit it.
[02:22:46.760 --> 02:22:55.280]   Owen, have a great Christmas with your lovely daughter.
[02:22:55.280 --> 02:22:57.760]   And all the best to you for the new year.
[02:22:57.760 --> 02:22:59.760]   It's always a pleasure to have you on.
[02:22:59.760 --> 02:23:01.240]   Merry Christmas, guys.
[02:23:01.240 --> 02:23:02.840]   It's great to have JCD back.
[02:23:02.840 --> 02:23:05.600]   Get him his flowers so you can come back more.
[02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:06.600]   Please.
[02:23:06.600 --> 02:23:08.320]   And make sure you send me my plastic baggie that liquor.
