[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   This is TWiT, This Week in Tech, the show that covers all things technological.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Joining us right away, the soon to be proud papa, Mr. Jason Calacanis.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Hello, Jason.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Yes, yes.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Congratulations.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Now, this is unusual because I don't even, and I've known you for some time.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   I don't know your wife's name. I've never seen a picture of her.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   You're very private about your personal life.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   I am very public about my personal life. I am very private about her personal life.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   I get it.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   And other people around me.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   So, I like to live transparently and sort of put myself out there.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   But I always sort of give my wife the ability to do it when she's ready and how she wants to.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Well, yeah, that's your choice.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   I mean, it should be her choice too if she wants to do that or not.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Right. And she's just starting to get warmed up to Facebook and Twitter and stuff like that.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   So, she'll probably decloak at some moment in time.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Certainly, when the baby arrives on December 10th.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   So, when's the baby due? December 10th. Okay.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   December 10th with my little girl.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   And a girl? Do you know a name yet? Or are you, I'm sure not.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Well, you know, my wife does the naming in the family.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   She came up with the Bulldogs names, which were Taurus and Fondue.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Did a very good, well, Taurus is good. Fondue is a little weird.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Yeah, Fondue is definitely weird.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   That's the Fondue. Don't take your personal girl.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   It's funny because I know a lot more about your Bulldogs than I do about your wife.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   I don't know what that means either.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Yeah. Well, they like to live in public, the Bulldogs.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   The Bulldogs have Twitter accounts, twitter.com/tauruskalakanas and FondueKalakans.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   But she, my wife has a name and it's, I'm warming up to it now.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   She likes the name London. London Kalakanas.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Wow, that's interesting. I hope you reserved the domain name.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   I never heard. Oh, Jesus Christ. Thanks for doing that on the air.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Oh, you haven't done that? Oh, gosh.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Where's my 40 second dump? I can't delay it.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Oh, forget you heard that kids. Stop, stop, stop.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   We have a wonderful bunch of people who would not dream of squatting on that.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   I'll be on Go Daddy in about 10 minutes.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   In fact, if you want, I'll give you five minutes to go get it.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   No, no, no. It's totally okay. You can choose Peter and I'll get it.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   But no. Yeah. So we're seeing maybe London Kalakanas is it.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Maybe it's Sundance Kalakanas. Maybe it's something else.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   I let her come up with the names and then I sort of.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   I like London. I like London.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   It's definitely. It's a little like Paris though.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Well, that is the one thing in Brooklyn, right?
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Because one of the soccer players kid is named after a city.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   But, you know, yeah, Beckham, Becks, Becks, call him Beckham, Beckham,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Callicannis, Becks. Oh, my.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   That is hysterical. London, Callicannis is already taken.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Oh, no. There you go.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   No. Well, I guess you better change the name.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Yeah, you got to. Well, London's out. Sorry, baby.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Sorry. Couldn't get the domain.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   I kind of feel sorry for who wasted the like eight dollars on that.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   No, no, I don't. I think somebody got it before.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Don't you think I have Callicannis dot com so I can do.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   You think somebody got Callicannis between now and the time you mentioned it.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   I can tell you right now who got it.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   It was registered on July 31st. Oh, you sons of.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Wait a minute. That's three days ago.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   That's three days ago by somebody named John Humphrey.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Wait a minute. You told somebody else. Oh, you know what?
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   I did say it on my show that we're thinking London. Oh, look at this guy.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   He's from L.A.F.N. dot org.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   I wonder if he did this as a favor to me or I'm going to have to go beat the living hostage.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   You know what they do. They do that.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   And then when you complain, they said, oh, I did it as a favor.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Yeah. Well, this person will have done it as a favor.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Yes. They'll be run over by an orange electric car.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Also in the studio. Another proud pop.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   I'm really glad to have Peter Rojas in studio with us. Thanks for having me.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Great to have you. It's really good to be actually here in the studio.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Is it different somehow than you thought? It's everything I imagined.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   How about the smell? What do you think of that? No, no, no, don't say that.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Well, Peter's got a one year old. I do. He actually will be one next week.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   That's congratulations on that. So it's there is something in the water.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   I was somebody on Twitter just the other day said it was a Scobel.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   All these people are having babies and there are a lot of babies in the Web 2.0 world.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Well, and then in the 1.0 world.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And really in the rest of the world. Oh, the other world.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   You mean with real people. IRL. Peter is the founder of a new site called GDGT.com.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   He's been doing the GDGT podcast with Ryan Block for over a year now.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Actually almost a year. It's been about 11 months. Oh, I didn't realize. All right.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   And of course with this fellow here was the founder of Engadget.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Yep. This was Jason in at the beginning? Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   It was something that we did together. And before that I started Gizmodo also.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Hey, Jason, go to Londoncalicanus.com.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   It says congratulations Jason. This domain is a present for you and your wife.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   This guy's a mensch. Oh, domain noob.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Oh, this is the guy out of the chocolate covered grasshoppers.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Is it real? Oh, no, no, no. He says like the guy.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Oh, that's cool. That's really nice. That's kind of a cool thing.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Domain noob.com. John at domain noob.com. Thank you, John.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Oh, what a guy. See, that's sweet. That's sweet. You have a nice audience.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   That was on Twists this week in startups. It was on this week in startups.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Yeah. I did a live version of Twists at the Twist Up event in LA, which is some local event.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   But the show is going great. And of course, thank you again for letting me use the This Week In trademark.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Not that it's your trademark, but your, you know, whatever.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Yeah. We all thank Neil Allen for that, actually. Yeah.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   You're doing This Week in Google. Did I see that on Twitter with Jeff Jarbs?
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Just started that with Jeff and Gina Tripani. Wow. Those are two big heavy hitters.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Oh, it's a good show. We just did our first show yesterday and I'm really excited.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   I think it's, you know, it's going to be Google and the cloud.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   But This Week in the Google and the cloud was a little too much. So I just, we shortened that.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   It's a mouthful. Yeah. I mean, it's like This Week in Google and of course, anything related to Google.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   But it's good because people can really drill down into AdSense, Gmail, whatever that minutiae is,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   which you can't get into on This Week in Tech. Well, it's perfect because Gina is, you know, developer.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   She started Lifehacker. So she's certainly a productivity expert, but she's also written, you know, she wrote better Gmail.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   She's written a lot of plugins for Google. She's fantastic. Also super knowledgeable.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   And then Jeff wrote, What Would Google Do? So it's a kind of a good panel.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   And I'm really looking forward to, we'll always have a rotating fourth on there. Yeah.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   And I'm really looking forward to the people that we're going to be able to bring in like Clay Shirky and so forth.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   And of course, as many Google Mac cuts types as we can. Well, they both have great networks. So that's going to be great.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Oh, yeah. Hey, you know me. I'll use anybody's network. What am I doing here? I got Jason and Peter Rojas on.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   I mean, let's talk about networking. If you want to know where's This Week in Bing.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   TWIB. TWIB. Well, that's a good question. Actually, Jason, it launches us into our first story.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Jason, you wrote a kind of scathing column on your blog, which I guess every once in a while you'll blog if the occasion arises,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   saying that Yahoo just committed seppuku. Yeah, I sent it to my email newsletter.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   And also when I write a big one like that, that gets picked up, I put on my blog because too many people email me and say,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Can you send that to me? And it's just, you know, I subscribe to the list. Anybody's allowed to do that, right? You haven't.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Yeah, it's tinyurl.com/jasonslist with an S, Jason's List. But yeah, it's like 16,000 people on it.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   And probably about every three or four, I will post it to a blog just because I want to get it out there.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   And then, of course, my friends like Mike Arrington will post it without me giving permission and not take it down if I ask them.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   So you might as well just post it. Yeah, it's sort of becoming a problem if I don't post it.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Everybody else is like, it's newsworthy and it's fair use to use your content. I'm like, OK, whatever. But anyway, it's technically legal.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   But I mean, it's not very nice. Whatever, you know, with friends like these. Hey, you know, just do what I do.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Screw you, Arrington. Just say that. Best moment in Twitter. Yeah, I'm living off that. I'm getting T-shirts. I'm getting hats.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. But anyway, with the Yahoo deal, you know, for those of us who've been in the industry for over 10 years,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   we remember that the first time any of us really used Google was at Yahoo.com, right?
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Yahoo gave up their search business and put Google in there. And it was powered by Google.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   The little logo was up on the right hand top of the right hand corner. And that's how we learned what Google was.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   And that's how the world learned about this incredible new search engine.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   And of course, after a number of years of doing that, they switched over to, you know, the mothership Google.com and the rest is history.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   And it's my premise that search is the most important business, the first most important business of the 21st century.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Sure, there'll be other businesses as we get through this century, but this is the biggest one right now.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Highest profit margins, most upside, you know, and it's still very early. It's a global race for search, et cetera.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   And now you have Yahoo, which should have learned their lesson that the way you went in search is by innovating, right?
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Google innovated. And instead of innovating, they just gave it to Microsoft.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   And Microsoft, of course, is more than happy to take the second place position and put hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of dollars to work to innovate.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   And if you look, Yahoo has really done very little innovative in the last couple of years with search, with the exception of Yahoo Boss,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   which is a very interesting project to sort of open source search and make it a service.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   But if you if you look at my habits to boss, by the way, now that it's been I've actually been talking to my friends at Microsoft because I know the people who are involved in the deal.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   And I and they contacted me after I wrote my newsletter. And I was like, listen, I'm very serious about boss.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   This is a really big win for you guys. Keep it going. And they told me, you know, sort of off the record, you know, like we understand it's important.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Boss is an API into the what was the Yahoo search. Yes. So they have to somehow import that over to Bing.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Well, it's both searches will be consolidated. So they're going to take the best of Yahoo search and Bing.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   OK, so they don't just turn off the Yahoo spiders. I don't believe so. I think that they're going to look very deeply at what's the best of breed there for each one.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   So there may be some features of each that they may want to explain to me why then that Yahoo gets the sales side of it. Is that the best breed?
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Well, Yahoo has a lot of salespeople and Yahoo wants to be able to sell both things.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   They want to be able to sell display ads, which is going to be their big mission and also sell the search ads.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   If you can only sell one of those things, you're going to be at a tremendous disadvantage to Google because Google is going to be selling both.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   So Yahoo keeps the content side, yeah, sells display ads into that.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   And since they're already doing that, they can continue to sell this ads into the search. Yep.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Microsoft's gain out of this is they now are number two in search. There's no number three, really.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   And what does it give them? A 30 percent share, 20 percent share in the 20s, probably.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   I quoted you yesterday on this week in Google saying, you told me, I think I'm right, a billion dollar per percentage point, roughly.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Yeah. And that's what people believe in terms of the market cap of each company.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   And if you look at what Microsoft did, and we've been talking about it on this week in tech for a couple of weeks now.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   A couple of years, it seems.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Well, just in with Bing and since the launch, what did they do? They bought a promising young startup, PowerSet. They spent a couple of hundred million dollars or so on marketing.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   And you said, by the way, Yahoo should have done that. Yahoo missed a bet there.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Yeah, and they innovated. And so Microsoft proved very easily that if you put a little bit of resources towards something, you can have a big impact.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   And what does Yahoo do? While they're negotiating with Microsoft, they don't raise, right, to use the poker metaphor.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   They just sort of sit there and watch Microsoft develop their hand and get stronger and stronger and their position gets weaker and weaker.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   You have to innovate in this industry. That's the one thing we've learned over and over again, whether it's in consumer electronics, which Peter covers, or more of the web stuff, which I cover.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   If you're not innovating, you're dying. And Palm, you know, had that problem for a while. And Microsoft had that problem for a while.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Oracle, Nintendo, you look at the other competitors, Apple to Microsoft. Why are they beating them? Why is Nintendo have more wheeze than Xbox's?
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Why does the iPhone crushing it and the MP3 player, the iPod crushing it and Oracle's database is doing so well? It's because they innovate.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   And Yahoo stopped. It's just like the most basic lesson of our industry.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Is that what you tell startups and you tell entrepreneurs and businessmen who come to you, continue to innovate or you die? Is it like a shark? You have to keep swimming?
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Absolutely. 100%. I mean, you have to be scared to death. Really? All the time. Paranoia. Yeah.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   Wasn't that Andy Grove's book? Only the Paranoid Survives. It's true. I mean, you really have to be constantly worried and never become complacent.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   And I think it becomes very difficult at a big company because when you start off and you're an entrepreneur, you start something and, you know, Jason and I both started a few things now.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   You're very hungry, very motivated, and the stakes are very high. Right. Because you can, you know, a failure for you is a very personal thing.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   Once companies start to get really big and they start to have all these people that weren't really there at the beginning and don't have a lot at stake, you start screwing around, screwing around.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   They start to look at it as a job. And I think it's difficult. And I think one of the reasons why you look at like Apple, for example, being able to consistently innovate and drive the market is because, you know, Steve Jobs doesn't need any more money.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   It's a corporate culture that you call it a corporate culture. And partly because you have to have one person or a handful of people at the top who are relentless and who jobs is relentless.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   It's not about the money anymore. It's just about being right. It's about winning. It's about being right. Yeah. Exactly. That's interesting. Yeah.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   How do you create a corporate culture like that? It's all talent. I mean, if you, if you, that's the skill. Absolutely.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   I mean, I think, you know, if you look at Weblogs Inc., the key thing I did right was getting Brian Alvey, who was the tech side of the business, and Peter Ross, who was the editorial side of the business, and Sean Gold, who was our sales guy.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   You know, my job as a CEO is to find the most talented people and get every obstacle possible, every obstacle possible out of their way to let them do what they naturally do, which is be great.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   And if you look at Yahoo, you know, Josh, you know, from Delicious left Katrina, Katerina, and yeah, she left from Flickr.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   I mean, they couldn't keep any of the talent there. And the stories I heard from folks in that sort of genre, the entrepreneurship, were I have all these great ideas for Delicious 2.0.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   I have all these great ideas for Flickr 2.0. I don't want to say that these people said it. It was other people, but it might have been them.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   You know, but I'm banging my head against the wall. I cannot get any products released. They couldn't release product at Yahoo.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   And there was no person at the top saying, these are the 10 most important things.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   And you remember the peanut butter manifesto, which was, what the hell are we doing here? We're doing like 5% better on 100 things.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   What are the 10 things we really need to focus on? And Yahoo had, I think, two of the most important assets in the future of Search.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   One is Delicious, which is, by the way, human powered Search, exactly what I'm trying to do at Mahalo.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   And number two was Flickr, which is image based Search and video based Search, which could have been a really viable competitor to YouTube in my mind,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   if they didn't limit the video uploads and stuff like that.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   And the search, image search on Flickr is better than any other image search in the world, I think, in terms of high quality images.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   And there's more Creative Commons images on there. So they own image search. And they could have owned video search if they had executed better.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   And when have you ever seen either of these products promoted properly on the Yahoo homepage? Never. Never.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   So they did this really half hearted attempt to integrate Delicious and Flickr into Search and it wasn't done very well.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   And there was no sense that anyone at Yahoo really cared at all.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   Isn't some of this though Google doing some of this too? I mean, I think of Dodgeball and Jaiku and quite a few properties that Google acquired that have just died on the vine as well.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Yeah, I mean, that that that that's Google going to prey to the same problem that Yahoo is?
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Well, I think if you look at the life cycle of any business that I think, you know,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   Clay Christensen talks about this in the innovator's dilemma where it becomes very difficult on an institutional level for any big company to really be able to identify the thing that's going to kill it.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   Right. Right. It's like a dialectic. Right. You can't know. It's like your blind spot. You can't figure out the thing which is going to end up over toppling you.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   Right. Very difficult. Microsoft. I mean, we see the same thing at Microsoft, right?
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Well, that's the thing that I think is interesting about a Microsoft Yahoo deal is it's really two dinosaurs mating.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   Is there is there anything you could do to reinvent Yahoo at this point to make it revitalize it?
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Well, I mean, one of the things I thought was very interesting is how much how much dominance Yahoo has in financial stuff.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   Yahoo Finance, Mail. Look at that New York Times article. There was a great New York Times article. I probably put in our delicious things where they are.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   They are. I'll give you an example. OMG. You never hear of OMG. This has twice the traffic of TMZ.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Yeah, absolutely. I never even heard of it. Yeah. OMG is there like graphical, you know, celebrity gossip.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Looks like the National Enquirer doesn't have an RSS feed. Finance.Yahoo.com. Number one.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   Well, news. I think the number one at their email. Yahoo Mail is like three times the next biggest email system.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   It's huge. And it's well, that means they're a profitable company. It means you're a successful company, isn't it?
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   Well, on some level. But I think it's funny how AOL kind of figured out.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   I mean, they need to take the strategy which AOL has adopted, which is become a great content business and figure out how to create that.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   That's what they're doing. By the way, AOL not a good example at this point.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   Well, but that's the strategy AOL is adopting. And I think Yahoo has a chance. If they're going to survive, I mean, they have to figure out if they're doing finance.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   Great. If they're doing the news and sports stuff. Great. If they're doing mail. Great.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   They need to figure out how to be a great, you know, great at those things and better at those things.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   This is actually from Giga. Jordan Golson went through Yahoo News. Number one.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   Fifty million uniques compared to New York Times. Forty five. Yahoo Finance. Twenty million uniques. AOL money. Fourteen.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   Yahoo Sports. Twenty five million uniques. ESPN. Twenty one. OMG. Double the traffic of TMZ. Yahoo Games in a tie with EA Online.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   Yahoo Mail. Two thirds of the total Webmail market. I mean, that's a that's a company.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   Boy, if you said to me without any names, would you like this company? I'd say, yeah, baby, that's a that's a stunner.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Yeah. The problem is the is the Google envy when you put yourself up against Google, which is well, that's a mistake, isn't it?
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   Well, that was a mistake. They were chasing Google and when Peter, you know, spent a little time at AOL, I was a CEO.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   And we always say we're not AOL while not trying to beat Google.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Yahoo has anchored themselves because they're they're never going to catch up to Google.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   They don't have the same DNA. They don't have the AdSense Ad Network.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   And they're going to always be looked at as sort of an also ran when they should have been just great at what they're good at,
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   which is communications, content aggregation and just double down on those things.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   However, a little investment and integration of search. And this could be a much different story.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   And Yahoo had a ton of cash, a ton of equity, you know, in terms of a currency.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   They could have bought 20 companies over the last two years.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   You know, and if 18 of them don't work out, but two of them turn into Flickr or OMG or Facebook, you know, then they're in the money.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   You only need to get one out of 10 to hit. And they didn't do any of that stuff. It was a pure lack of leadership.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   And is it too late? Probably. If you will still exist and it's still going to make multiple billions of dollars a year.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   Will it break out? I don't know. Carol Bart's enough to know.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Obviously, she's a good dealmaker, which is why they brought her in, is to get this deal finally done,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   which you remember I predicted last year when John Dvorak and I were arguing over it not getting done.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   I said it has to get done. This isn't quite that same deal. That was an acquisition deal.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   Well, yeah, but even this is essentially acquiring the most important piece. So, you know, it is a bomb or said nothing was sold here.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   This isn't an acquisition. Yeah, it is. You say it is. Yeah.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   I mean, basically what they're saying is it's for its Borg.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   It's Borg. Invasion. They've colonized Yahoo. Yeah, exactly.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   You know, the Cylons have nuked, you know, the planet, but it's not really an acquisition.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   You know, they basically took everything they wanted. Balmer says, quote, nothing got bought, nothing got sold.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   But the partnership in and of itself creates economic value. It creates an immediate opportunity for synergy.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   I hate that word. It was synergy and Microsoft stock going up and Yahoo's going down.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Yeah, that's interesting. Exactly two billion dollars.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Really? Market cap from one company to the other. Isn't that interesting? Yeah. Right there. There you go.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   I guess that's the market saying who bought it. The market is generally right when people put big bets on things.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   But, you know, I've met the investors who own, you know, single to double to triple digits.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   I mean, it's, you know, one to like five percent, let's say, of Yahoo. And I've talked to them over the years.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   These are the big, you know, institutions that hold, you know, big positions in these companies.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   And they were tired and they were they were they've been hearing the story that they're going to, you know, they're going to reinvent itself and do something.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Terry Semmel and then Jerry Yang and then this. And if you look at the great companies, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison,
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   Larry and Sergey and Eric, you know, Steve Jobs, if I didn't mention him, Jeff Bezos, probably the most underrated CEO of that group.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   All of those guys are the founders who are still innovating and going to work every day.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   And when your founder is not there innovating and you lose the culture, you don't have the people and, you know, then it starts to end.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   And that's that's the death kneel. All right. We're going to give Peter a chance now to talk about gadgets because there's a there's a gadget story.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   Also in here, and that's the Apple iPhone rejecting Google Voice app.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   There were there was a there was a third party Google Voice application, which Apple kicked out.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   It had been in there. And then Google tried to put its own application in there.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   It had submitted it six weeks ago. Apple the other day says, no.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Now the FCC says, Google, Apple, AT&T, you got some splaining to do their real question.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   I think the fundamental question is how much did AT&T influence Apple?
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   Yeah, I think that it's a it's a very hot topic right now. A very big question.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   And it's it's a legitimate concern. I think that if it turns out that it's AT&T dictating what sort of applications and devices can be used on its network, that's kind of an issue.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   I mean, the FCC is sort of that's verboten. That's been an issue for the FCC. They really want to open up these.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   They do want to open up these things. But I think the thing is we have to separate out the issue between I think Apple is if it's I think Apple has the right to determine what services and applications run on its device.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   That's a separate issue than AT&T determining what services and app and devices run on its network, because the FCC, their job is to keep the networks open and to make sure that there's a I mean, we don't have true network neutrality.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   But there is because these are public airwaves, the FCC has a mandate to make sure that there's fairness there.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   But I think that's a different issue than a handset maker being required to install or disable certain features on a device.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   And so I think there's a that's I think what the FCC needs to investigate. I think Apple is well within its rights to determine whatever goes into the app store.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   I think they're wrong to reject something because I think from a business standpoint, I think it's wrong.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   I think again, like openness, you know, we were talking before the show earlier about our inherent bias.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   And I completely agree with you, Peter, that openness beats closed proprietary.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   That's why I use I use the and use an Android phone because I philosophically want to support something like that.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   That's a hard one. I have an Android phone and I'd sure like to have if an Android.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   I'd like to use an Android phone, but the iPhone has so much they're getting better.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   But, you know, using the iPhone is kind of like living in Mussolini's Italy. You know, the trains run on time.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   Yeah. There's some bad stuff going on. But you know what happened to Mussolini?
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   I know. They hung him upside down in a square and kicked him in the head.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   Yeah, well, I mean, it's got to hurt if this is true that open wins.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   And I agree with that to a certain extent, but I think it's got that sort of Cory Doctorow absoluteness to it.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   That baby isn't always going to happen because if that was true, why is iTunes still crushing it and there's no iPod competitor,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   even though there are better devices than the iPod? I don't think we're saying openness wins.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   I think philosophically, that's what I prefer.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   In fact, openness frequently doesn't, sad to say.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   But in the same way that fascists often beat democracies, it doesn't mean they're better.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   Yeah. But I think I mean, in this in this specific instance, there's a lot of people are angry at Apple.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   And I mean, look, Mike Arrington was very public in saying I'm going to stop using the iPhone because I disagree with this policy.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   I'm going to take my I'm going to vote with my pocketbook.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   And I think that is the appropriate response.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   I think if AT&T said you couldn't use an Android device on their network because of Google Voice, that would be a really serious problem.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   I think that that is something that FCC should should step in and take.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   Currently, you can. You can buy. Absolutely. You can buy an unlocking one and use it on AT&T.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   I know people that do it. Yeah. Why? Well, I guess T-Mobile is kind of not the strongest.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   It depends on where you live, also what service you get.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   But I think if you don't like what Apple has the right.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   I mean, there are lots of phones that that don't work with Google Voice at all.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   Right. Because they don't allow applications. They're done phones.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   So should the FCC mandate that all of those handset makers are required to enable applications on that?
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   That was my one qualm about this. I'm not sure I want the FCC to tell a business how it can run its business.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   On the other hand, AT&T is regulated by the FCC.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   Well, as I'm saying, there are two. You have to separate out the Apple versus AT&T.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   And that's what we need to get to the bottom of is was it AT&T mandating to Apple that you cannot allow this application?
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   It seems pretty clear from the letters TechCrunch published that the FCC's real interest was in AT&T.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   They want to get to the bottom of that.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   But there were two paragraphs at the end of the letter that they sent to Apple saying that had nothing to do with AT&T that said,
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   Well, how many applications have you kicked out? How many applications have you barred?
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   We want to know what the reasons are you barred them. There is more going on.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   I want the government determining what apps are available.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   I mean, you know, if you want a closed phone, look at the sidekick.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   Nobody complained that the sidekick had Google Voice on the sidekick.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   Yeah. And it's a smartphone.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   It's well, relatively, we're getting smarter than a razor.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   I have a question. I have Skype on my iPhone.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   Well, there's an example. And why is Skype allowed and not Google Voice?
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   Is there some because I don't use Google Voice.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   Is there some difference in the service that one would be allowed and not the other?
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   Well, I know that Google Voice, at least on the Android version of the app, obviously didn't test the iPhone version.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   It doesn't run over VoIP. It's not an IP connection for the call.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   You're actually using. They call you.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   They call you basically. They basically call you and use your cell phone minutes.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   You're calling over the voice network.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   I don't know. But my guess would be that the issue that AT&T had was free SMS.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   That might have been part of it.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   Because that's a big profit center. Well, that's true.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   There are there and they're on the iPhone. There are free SMS applications.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   That's why I have a feeling that it was a little bit AT&T and a little bit Apple in this decision.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   They both determined that Google was a strategic threat.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   Because, yeah, Skype works great with Wi-Fi on the iPhone. You can't use it on 3G.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   I'm sure that was AT&T's request. Yeah, probably.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Because that would be then bypassed using their data network to bypass their voice network.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   How does tethering play into this?
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   Because shouldn't tethering be my right or not?
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   It seems like it's a related issue.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   That's a good question. I know that the carrier solution has been to discharge you an extra $15, $20 a month.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   AT&T says it will be doing that, but hasn't yet done that on the iPhone.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   Sprint does that. Sprint does it. A lot of carriers do it.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   T-Mobile, by the way, allows tethering, says it's part of the deal.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   You get bandwidth, so you can use it any way you want.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Yeah, generally speaking.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   I mean, this is the sort of thing that we're really not talking about, but should be.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   Is the wireless industry competitive enough in this country?
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   We have only four major carriers, and it's really just two.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Four that act like four monopolies, by the way.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   But when you think about it, it's really AT&T and Verizon are the big heavyweights.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   Because it's CDMA versus GSM?
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   No, it's just that I'm not sure that that's part of it.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   I think that what it is is that it's just typical how industries go.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   They have a snowball effect.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   So Verizon and AT&T are dominant?
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   They're dominant, and Sprint and T-Mobile are smaller.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   They're just tiny.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   And there's probably not enough competition.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   But I mean, even to me, the bigger...
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   I think the problem is not competition, it's collusion.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   I think these guys know what the other guy does.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   You know, David Pogue, I talked to David earlier today,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   he's got a campaign going on the Times to...
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   It's kind of a silly, trivial thing,
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   but it isn't that trivial when he explains it to restore the beep.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   His problem is that all four carriers now have a 15-second announcement
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   after you say, "Hi, this is Leo. Please leave me a message,"
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   that goes on and on.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   And yeah, it's just 15 seconds,
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   but he estimates it could be as much as half a billion dollars in revenue for Verizon
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   because of the extra call time involved.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   You're burning up minutes.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   You're burning up minutes, and only Sprint allows you to turn it off.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   But the interesting thing is it started with Verizon.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   I remember it bugged the heck out of me because Verizon did this and nobody else did.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   And all the other guys go, "Oh, look, Verizon's making some money. Let's all do it."
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   So there's this kind of implicit collusion going on as well, right?
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   Well, absolutely, and I think that...
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   If Verizon charges 20 cents for SMS, okay, we all do.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Yeah, and there's really no reason to charge very much at all for SMS.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   You know, at 20 cents a message, it's $1,500 a megabyte.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   It's the most expensive bandwidth available anywhere.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   It's almost impossible for them to even really assign a dollar value to the usage of the network.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   Yeah, because it's also that the network is a fixed cost.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   They have a fixed cost.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Once they build the network, it doesn't matter how much.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   Yeah, so that's 100% profit on that $1,500, whatever it is, a megabit.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   Well, in that case, it should be free.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   It should be free, and I think that...
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   How much do you pay for email?
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   How much was the emails you sent today?
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   It was the same price you paid for your web browsing and everything else you get, a flat rate.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   I remember when I had Prodigy about 20 years ago, you got, I think, 25 free messages,
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   and then after that, it was 25 cents an email.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   Genius.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   I actually would like to bring that back due to some of the emails I'm getting.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   For spammers only.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   There was no Prodigy spam problem when it was 25 cents a message.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   They actually had it. There was a company called Good Mail who wanted to put economics on top of it.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   You remember AOL?
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   It's very controversial.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   Yeah, very controversial.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   But it was like a fraction of a penny, but I guess the nonprofits were like,
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   "Wait a second, we have a million people on this mailing list."
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   So looking at all these companies, if we had to rank the most anticompetitive, draconian,
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   evil companies in the technology space, is anybody even close to Apple at this point?
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   Well, you got to throw in the cable companies, you got to throw in the wireless companies.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   We have quite a large number of predatory companies out there.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   Let's put infrastructure on the side because we know they're evil.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   They're infrastructure companies.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   Oh, is that true? They have to be?
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   Well, if the AT&T are cable, they're not--
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   If they dig a ditch, they have to be bad guys.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   I've dug some ditches in my life. I've buried some bodies in the casino sense of the word.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   But putting aside those evil people, just technology companies, Google, Microsoft, Oracle,
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   is there anybody who is more anticompetitive and closed, forgetting how good they are with their products
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   and how sexist they are? Everybody would agree Apple is number one in terms of sex appeal.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   But in terms of just being closed and anticompetitive, is anybody more anticompetitive than Apple?
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   I've said this for years. I've said Apple has become the evil empire.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   Maybe they've always been, but as they get bigger and more powerful, it becomes more evident.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   Well, isn't it funny how no one is really scared of Microsoft anymore?
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Yeah, they used to be the evil empire.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   Everyone used to be terrified that Microsoft was going to get into your market.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   It's almost kind of like--
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   Nobody cares anymore.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   I almost feel sorry.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   I do. I totally feel sorry. But that's a business cycle. I think that's a standard business cycle.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   But it's just kind of funny how the rules reverse.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   I think what Apple is doing is--
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   When Apple was the underdog, they've always done this. But when they were the underdog, no big deal.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   Well, when you attain this sort of position of power or dominance in an industry,
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   and there are dominant in a handful of industries, let's say, you can sort of see them abusing their power.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   And again, you're right. It's not a big deal when they're the underdog and they're doing things.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   Because you're like, "Well, yes, they're closed and yes, they're doing these things,
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   but they have to do these things to fight against Microsoft or whatever."
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   But yeah, it's not encouraging.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   And I think that-- It's not clear to me whether all the issues,
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   like the complaints of iPhone app developers and the frustrations they're having is going to spill into a more general distaste amongst consumers,
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   more generally speaking.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   But you sort of see how these things go, right?
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   Where you start to see the early adopters and you start to see people getting a little bit frustrated.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   I think, again, Apple creates products that people love so much that they can get away with a lot.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   But I'm not sure.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   They do get away with murder.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   But if you think clearly about what the iTunes/iPod nexus is, it's absolutely monopolistic.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   And the EU and others have complained about this.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   I'm not sure how you break it up, though.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   Well-- I'm on tilt about it because I have my new iPhone 3GS, and I have all these audio books,
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   wonderful audio books I might add from Audible.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   And I have some on my home computer and some on my office computer.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   And then I buy some on my iPhone.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   How do you consolidate when you've purchased on three different things?
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   I can't figure it out.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   And now I'm like, shouldn't these all be in one locker somewhere?
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   And I have to basically erase my phone at the office, come home and put those audio books on.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   I want to erase it when I get to the office if I want to listen to those audio books.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   It's making me insane.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   I've looked up all this information.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   There's no way to consolidate your libraries without--
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   I don't know what it does with Audible, but when you buy a song on your iPhone,
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   the first time you connect it to iTunes, it says, "May I transfer these files over to iTunes?"
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   It becomes part of iTunes.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   I'm not sure what happens to the audio books.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   I don't think that happens.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   But Audible works differently because the authentication system is through Audible.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   So you can copy those files.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   I don't know how you'd get it off the iPhone.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   Don't buy books on the iPhone, I guess.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   No, it's not just Audible, but it's also when you buy songs,
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   if you're buying them on two different computers.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Then you could transfer them, right?
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   You just copy them.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Yeah, if they don't have copyright protection on them.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Well, I'm not to defend Apple here,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   but you can log into up to five different computers with that same iTunes account.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   So you could play that song on five computers.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   Fortunately, that's gone away for music, not for video, not for TV shows.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   People are seeing it with the Kindle, right?
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   Where people are complaining about they've synced their Kindle books to multiple devices.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   Maybe they have an iPhone and an iPod Touch and a Kindle 1 and 2.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   DRM has got to die.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   This stuff sucks.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   It's just sucks.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   It's creating really negative consumer experiences.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   And I think the thing, if you're Amazon, for example,
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   that the Kindle is so new, so nascent as a platform,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   that the last thing you want to do is to create all these frustrations with people.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   But do they have a choice?
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   Isn't it the publishers that are insisting?
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   I think the publishers are, but I think...
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   I mean, look what happened when they put on the reading book.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   The publishers complained that immediately Amazon had to flip that switch.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Oh, the audio.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   They can't do the text to speech.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   I mean, I think just as Apple was kind of beholden to the music companies
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   when iTunes first started, Amazon...
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Well, maybe not because Amazon sells a lot of books.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   Amazon has a lot of cloud, but I think that the public...
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   I mean, the book publishers are extremely conservative.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   We know this.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   We know this.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   So, Jason, your point.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   Yes, Apple is evil.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   The most evil, though.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   I think we should make it very...
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   The most evil.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   I did it two years ago.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   Two years ago, I will have to find this, but two years ago I warned...
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   I said, I went on the radio, I said to millions of people,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   Apple is about to switch places with Microsoft as the evil empire.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   Yeah, I remember.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   I remember you saying it.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   And I just think as an industry, we have to put pressure on Apple and just...
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   I think Mike Arrington's step...
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   I mean, screw Mike Arrington, but I mean his step to...
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   I already have.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Thank you.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   Hey, oh, hey.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   Hey.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   Hey, oh.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   Give me glasses.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   Give me glasses.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   I'll give you glasses, Diego.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   This weekend?
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   Like...
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   So, yeah.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:01.240]   It just as an industry, I think we have to start putting some pressure on them to change
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.440]   their behavior.
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:07.800]   And one thing I'm wondering, Steve, Peter, since you know the people at Apple pretty
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:11.800]   well, is this a Steve Jobs...
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:16.680]   Is his mind wired to close systems, ease of use through the whole process?
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:20.240]   And does the other guy, what's his name, Cook or whatever, who's going to take over...
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.240]   Tim Cook, the CFO, yeah.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:27.320]   You think when Steve retires that Tim Cook will maybe reevaluate some of these positions
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:32.680]   on draconian, heavily draconian positions on we have to lock this thing down and you
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:36.240]   can't get an application on this without get approval from the app store?
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.240]   I mean, I'm a grown up.
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.200]   I mean, I should be able to put anything I want on my phone.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.200]   You know, I think...
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.200]   Well, I think as long as...
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:47.080]   If you knew Steve retires, he's still going to be on the board and he's going to have
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.080]   a lot of influence over this.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:50.680]   I spent a weekend with Steve Jobs once.
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.880]   It was a 4th of July weekend.
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:53.160]   He was still at Next.
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:55.880]   He hadn't yet been...
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:59.280]   He wasn't yet re-crowned king of Apple.
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.640]   But it was very interesting.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:04.760]   The guy is brilliant and he knows that he's the smartest guy.
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:07.160]   He's one of those guys like Bill Gates, he comes into a room, "I'm the smartest guy in
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.160]   the room."
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.160]   It's just a fact.
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:12.280]   And he acts that way, which comes off fairly arrogant.
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.760]   He's also very aggressive.
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.520]   And I think that he has a killer instinct.
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:19.000]   I think he hit the nail on the head in the first place.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.800]   This guy, it's not about money for him.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:24.200]   This guy doesn't want to lose.
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:30.280]   And I think that he's very smart, smart enough to have figured out a really brilliant play
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:35.600]   with the iTunes store, the iPod, the closed system.
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:38.560]   You can put the layer of ease of use on top of it.
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.000]   And I know he does.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   I know that that's key.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.600]   He said, "Well, it's easier that way."
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:45.800]   Just as the trains ran on time in Italy.
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.000]   But ultimately, that's not what's going on for him.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   He wants to win at business.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.560]   Well, he has a very singular vision for how this stuff is supposed to be.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.640]   And he's a perfectionist, we all know that.
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.720]   But I think he also has a...
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:04.680]   I mean, he's someone who has a really specific approach to this stuff.
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:08.760]   And he's created a very strong culture of secrecy at Apple.
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:13.720]   I know people who work at Apple, and they tell me some pretty hilarious stories about
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.720]   what it's like to work there.
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:15.720]   I can only imagine.
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:22.680]   When you're in a room and you're working on something secret, you have to flip a flashing
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:27.480]   light so that people know not to look over your desk.
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:28.480]   Do not look.
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:31.520]   I've got the flashing light.
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:35.840]   And he's really built... it's almost kind of like a police state in a sense where you don't...
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:36.840]   Oh yeah.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.280]   You know your phone is tapped.
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:40.680]   Everything is very... it's very vertically oriented.
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:43.200]   I've talked to people who say, "We don't look at Steve in the elevator.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.200]   We don't talk to Steve.
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.320]   We don't want to attract his attention."
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.520]   He's like the eye of a mortar.
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.160]   He's like, "Don't let the..."
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:51.160]   Yeah.
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:57.960]   And I think that's why hoping that Tim Cook coming on as a CEO might change things.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:58.960]   It might not.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:02.920]   But I think the thing is whatever Tim Cook might really think about things, he has definitely
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:05.120]   not let any of us know that.
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:08.840]   And would it be as a successful company if Tim Cook says, "Let's go more open.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:09.840]   Let's be more relaxed.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:10.840]   Let's be more fuzzy."
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:13.840]   That's a tough question to answer.
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:17.480]   I think one of those things that we generally believe that open beats closed.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:22.320]   But I think that if you can offer closed and a really great experience, you can get away
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.360]   with things.
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.900]   Hold on a second.
[00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:29.440]   You're telling me the iPhone, if it was available on any network, would not be as successful
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:30.440]   as it is only on one?
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:31.440]   That's an interesting question.
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.440]   That's a different question.
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:35.720]   Or that the iPhone, the second one though, is or that the iPhone, if you could install
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:40.860]   any application on it, including porn and other stuff that maybe Steve Jobs isn't so
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:44.020]   big on, that wouldn't be more successful?
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.280]   Of course it would be.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:48.400]   Well, except that I think from...
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:53.160]   I'm not to defend because I obviously think that the iPhone should be completely open.
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:42:00.720]   But I think what Apple's perspective is that if you open it up and it's a phone and people
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.360]   suddenly install something and they can't make phone calls on it, they're going to be
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:04.360]   really pissed off.
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:07.420]   If your computer stops working, usually you can live.
[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:11.040]   But when you can't make phone calls, people get really unhappy really quickly.
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:14.720]   And so that's generally been the carrier's perspective about this stuff is we don't want
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:17.160]   the phones to be something that people can screw up too easily.
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:20.320]   I love this one.
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:27.600]   The Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a request to the Copyright Office to legalize
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:34.280]   or at least to say it's legal to jailbreak a phone, in particular the iPhone.
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:40.240]   Apple filed comments with the agency explaining that jailbreaking could allow hackers to alter
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:47.160]   the phone's baseband processor software and "a local or international hacker could potentially
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:52.800]   initiate commands such as a denial of service attack that could crash the tower software,
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:58.440]   rendering the tower entirely inoperable to process calls or transmit data."
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:00.480]   Jailbreaking is a terrorist act.
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.920]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:03.920]   Can you...
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:13.680]   By the way, the very next week, Charlie Miller demonstrates at DEFCON that every iPhone in
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:21.120]   the world can be easily hacked with a SMS message.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:24.880]   They're saying, "Oh, you can't change the iPhone software and make us insecure.
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.520]   Maybe you should change the iPhone software."
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:32.080]   Anyway, Apple did respond with a 3.01 update that apparently fixed it.
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:37.400]   The joke of all of this is like, one, we have denial of services attacks on the internet
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.400]   for what?
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.400]   Constantly.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.400]   Going on 20 years.
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:41.400]   Constantly, yeah.
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:44.040]   Nobody is concerned about the internet.
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:48.560]   Number two, did you see the story about DEFCON air traffic control hacking?
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:49.560]   That was scary.
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:50.800]   Oh, tell me about that.
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.760]   This was at DEFCON this week?
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:59.160]   Basically, they showed that you could shut down information going into an air traffic
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:02.120]   control tower, jam radar, submit fake aircraft flight plans.
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:04.000]   I'm reading from the dealer.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.620]   What you do is you could actually get certified as a student pilot and then get access to
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:12.720]   some FCC flight plan website.
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.040]   Do it through the website?
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:17.120]   Then you can flood that site with flight plans because there's no limit.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:20.360]   First off, they don't do much to authenticate who you are.
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.680]   There's no limit to how many flight plans you can submit.
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:24.280]   It was pretty interesting.
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:26.080]   It's an overflow, right?
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.640]   Basically, an every overflow.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:33.040]   Fred von Lohmann of the EFF said, "Apple's claims are preposterous."
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:38.180]   He says, "There are a million, as many as a million jailbroken iPhones.
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:40.360]   So far, no one's destroyed mobile towers."
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:46.160]   Also, in a related story, you can climb up a phone pole and cut the cables and also disable
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:47.160]   the network.
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:48.160]   Yes.
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:53.200]   We're going to have to get rid of phone clippers and any scissor capable of cutting any gauge
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:54.920]   wire above a certain strand.
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:57.520]   It's the weakest defense I've ever heard.
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:04.560]   Apple should be brought up on antitrust immediately for not letting other MP3 players into iTunes.
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:06.720]   It's the simplest, easiest thing they could do.
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:08.840]   It's totally anti-competitive and terrible for the industry.
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:15.080]   I'm a total Ayn Rand, less government, let people get rich guy.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:18.160]   They should stop Apple now because it's getting out of control.
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:21.760]   Before Apple gets any more market share in these things, they should be made to open
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:22.760]   them up.
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:23.760]   Period.
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:29.360]   Apple said, by the way, that jailbreaking could also pave the way for drug dealers to
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:34.880]   change the exclusive chip identification number, which would enable calls to be made anonymously.
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:40.160]   Did they mention what Al Qaeda could do?
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:43.760]   Or via burner, which would be a lot easier, frankly.
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:46.880]   Maybe the drug dealer really wants an iPhone because he wants that cannabis app.
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:47.880]   Yeah, they mentioned-
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.480]   Just via a prepaid phone.
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:54.240]   Did they mention what Osama Bin Laden could do with this jailbroken iPhone?
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.240]   That's next.
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:57.200]   I think that he could do something pretty bad with it.
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.200]   That's next.
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.240]   He could figure out how to use it in a cave.
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:01.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:04.080]   He could be recruiting people with a jailbroken iPhone.
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:10.120]   He could create an Al Qaeda recruiting network application, sneak it into the iPhone store,
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:12.080]   and this could be huge for him.
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:13.080]   Huge.
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:19.480]   So are you saying, Mr. Ayn Rand, open free market guy, that the Department of Justice
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:23.560]   should be shutting Apple down, should be suing?
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:24.560]   Shut it down.
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:25.560]   Close the-
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:26.560]   Shut it down.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:27.560]   Chain up the doors.
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:28.560]   Don't be so bad luck the doors.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.560]   Lock it up.
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:30.560]   It's raw.
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:31.560]   You know what?
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:32.560]   Sell it to Yahoo.
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:33.560]   That'll shut it down even faster.
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:34.560]   Shut it down.
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.320]   Let Carol Bartz run it.
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:44.280]   It's an absolute hypocritical disaster for them to be going after Google or Microsoft.
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:47.680]   I mean, Microsoft putting a browser in their operating system, like it's some big deal
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:48.920]   or browsers are free.
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:49.920]   That's crazy, yeah.
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:54.380]   And then going after Google because they have some market share that they earned in an industry
[00:46:54.380 --> 00:47:00.760]   where you can switch from providers as easily as typing five characters, and in Bing's case,
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:01.760]   four.
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:02.760]   Right.
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:06.720]   And then you get some monopoly when you can type in four fracking characters and then
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:11.000]   Apple releases a new update to every device you own and you can't use it unless you take
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.040]   this device and ram it up your butt and it's-
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:15.040]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.040]   But wait a minute.
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:17.040]   But wait a minute.
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.040]   I mean-
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.040]   When they get away with it.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.040]   Part of this is that this stuff moves so fast.
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:23.560]   So Microsoft was a threat and it took a long time for the EU to kind of go through this
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:25.360]   process of been doing it for seven years.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:26.360]   Maybe they're not a threat anymore.
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:29.440]   You know, it's like, you know, they grew out of the threat.
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.360]   Apple wasn't a threat because they were these little guys.
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:32.680]   They've grown into being a threat.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:40.160]   This stuff, you know, the pace of change in the tech business way outpaces the pace of
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.440]   government regulation.
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:42.440]   Yeah.
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:43.440]   I mean-
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:48.760]   I would say again, if you really don't like it, don't use an iPhone or don't use an iPod.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.200]   That's why I don't buy that stuff.
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:52.560]   I do because I like it.
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:53.720]   Well, there you go.
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:56.200]   I want the trains to run on time.
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:58.360]   But then it's not enough of an issue to bother you, I think.
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:47:59.360]   No, it bothers me.
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:00.960]   But not enough to not use the stuff.
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.800]   But I think it's getting to the tipping point, Peter.
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.880]   I think you're a canary in the coalmunt.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.560]   You see this stuff five years ago.
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:07.760]   You want to make a point about it.
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:09.200]   Mike Harrington sees it last week.
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:10.640]   Leo and I will be there next week.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:11.640]   Next year.
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:12.640]   Next year.
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:13.640]   Whatever.
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:14.640]   At some point on the countdown.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:15.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:16.640]   I have a G1.
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:17.640]   I really wanted to like the G1.
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:18.640]   I had a Pre.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:19.640]   I really wanted to like the Pre.
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:20.640]   I was ready to buy it, but they're just functionality.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:21.640]   They're just- no, it's true.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:23.120]   They're just not quite there yet.
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:24.120]   But they will be.
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:25.120]   And the rest of the industry-
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:28.200]   And I'm not willing to sacrifice for the political point because first of all, nobody knows what
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:29.200]   I use or cares.
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:32.600]   I mean, I could be like Mike and make a big announcement.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:33.600]   Except on GDGT.
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:34.600]   Oh yeah.
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:35.600]   That's true.
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:36.600]   That's the point of the site.
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:37.600]   Oh yeah.
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:38.600]   Yeah, you can vote with your dollar and put it on your profile.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:39.600]   That's how you can vote with your profile.
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:40.600]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.600]   You've created a new political tool.
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:45.800]   In fact, actually, maybe everyone could start removing some device in protest from their
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:48.080]   list or something like that.
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:52.400]   What about the battle between Palm, Pre, and Apple over the iTunes syncing?
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:54.000]   Who's going to win that one?
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.960]   This is pursuant to what Jason's just talking about.
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:00.560]   What Palm wants to be able to do is they want people to be able to sync their music and
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:04.280]   obviously not the copy protected stuff, but their music and photos and stuff like that
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:06.560]   from iTunes over to the Pre.
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:09.480]   You can sync the Pre without iTunes.
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:10.480]   But it's convenient to be able to-
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:11.480]   But it's very convenient.
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.280]   People manage their collections in iTunes.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:16.840]   It's an easy way to transition away, transition to a Pre.
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:18.380]   Is it Apple's right to do that?
[00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:20.040]   To disable the Pre?
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:24.320]   Well, you're starting to get into a real gray area there because it is their software.
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:26.960]   And what Palm is doing is they're doing some tricks.
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:30.640]   And remember, a lot of these guys who built the Pre are ex-Apple guys.
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:32.080]   And so they know how to do it.
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:35.920]   They basically trick iTunes into recognizing the Pre as an iPod.
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.440]   And what's interesting, initially they identified as a Pre.
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.960]   And as soon as Apple made that change to iTunes, they changed.
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:45.920]   Well, it has to do with the different layers of identification in the USB protocols.
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:48.720]   The hub is still a Pre hub, but the device is no longer a Pre.
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:51.660]   So they're doing this cat and mouse thing.
[00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:57.440]   There may be a point where they're able to outsmart the Pre.
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:00.520]   But on the other hand, they might have to do something that- they might have to actually
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:07.880]   start to build some hardware encryption or authentication into the iPods themselves.
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:12.080]   The equivalent of this, Leo, would be if because you're using Windows, you could only use a
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:13.080]   Seagate drive.
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:14.080]   Right.
[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:15.080]   No Western Digital.
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:16.080]   Right.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:17.080]   That thumb drive, not approved.
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:19.800]   You can only buy a Windows thumb drive to put your documents on.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.880]   That's what's happening.
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:22.880]   People just sit there like-
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:23.880]   Well, but it's a different world.
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:27.160]   The cell phone world has always been a little bit more closed than the PC world.
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:29.360]   But just MP3 players.
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:30.360]   It's a hard drive.
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:33.160]   Shouldn't you be able to put your- sync your stuff to anything?
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:34.160]   No, I'm with you.
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.160]   I'm with you.
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:36.160]   Absolutely.
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:37.160]   What would be really nice is if Apple said, "You know what?
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:40.320]   We're just really happy that you're using iTunes even if you're not going to use an iPod.
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:43.000]   So we'll let you use any USB mass storage device."
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.760]   I don't think that's the point of iTunes.
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:45.760]   But it would be-
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:47.360]   I don't think that's the point of iTunes.
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:54.760]   But you would want, I guess, that the company would think, "We just want people- that one
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:58.560]   step to converting a customer long term is to get them using your software or whatever."
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:50:59.560]   Sure.
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:00.560]   I agree.
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:02.360]   That's not our decision to make, I guess, is the point, right?
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:05.280]   Well, I don't run Apple or any hardware company.
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:06.280]   Right.
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:07.880]   Should the government say something about that?
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:12.320]   It's tough because you're starting to get into a gray area and next thing you know, Apple
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:15.600]   started invoking some DMCA nonsense.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:16.600]   Just a matter of time.
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:18.240]   They broke some encryption or something like that.
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:20.640]   Just a matter of time, baby.
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:25.240]   I can just prove what a hypocrite Steve Jobs is in two seconds.
[00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:32.440]   Remember, he did his first blog post or open letter, Thoughts on Music, February 6, 2007.
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:33.440]   Yeah.
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:38.400]   And he's telling the music industry how they need to get off of DRM and they need to be
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:43.280]   more open and they need to embrace new technology, make it easy for consumers.
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:47.240]   He is a hypocrite of hypocrites and he's full of...
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:48.240]   He's just a good businessman.
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:54.080]   No, but it's hypocrisy to say, "You sit there and preach to the music industry like you're
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.320]   some god.
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:58.080]   He's so high on his own supply, Steve Jobs, I'm sick of him."
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:51:59.520]   I mean, I really am.
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:03.640]   To sit there and preach to the music industry, get rid of DRM and then on the other hand,
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:05.640]   say, "But you can only use my MP3 player.
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:07.660]   You can't use anything else."
[00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:10.480]   It's really, it's just garbage and I'm just sick of him.
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:13.880]   I don't care how good the products are, but if anybody knows when the new MacBook Air
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:17.440]   is coming out, I would send you some information on that.
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:23.960]   And let's not forget that Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak got their start selling blue boxes
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:26.220]   to hack the phone system.
[00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:27.220]   Talk about irony.
[00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:31.640]   All right, when we come back, it's going to be the annals of the crazy lawsuit.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:36.600]   But before we do that, Hans Van Rock in our chat room needs a smoke and he wants me to
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:38.120]   go to a break right now.
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.760]   So Hans, you may smoke them if you got them.
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:45.040]   I'm going to mention our good friends at Citrix, the folks who do Go To My PC.
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:49.880]   Go To My PC is a fantastic product, which I've used for many, many years, that allows
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:54.800]   you to access your system from any other system, anywhere you can get online.
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:59.080]   And I mean anywhere, at an internet cafe, at a hotel, at an airport, all you have to
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:05.000]   do is log on to GoToMyPC.com with the username and password that you set up and there's your
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   PC.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.880]   There's your computer, PC or Mac.
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:13.520]   You can, well, I mean, the remote PC is a PC, but you could do this on a Mac.
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:17.480]   All that mail will be there, all the applications, all the software, all the network resources,
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:19.960]   it's running just as if you're there.
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:23.480]   Completely securely too, 128-bit SSL end-to-end.
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:25.760]   So it's just like a VPN.
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.120]   It's absolutely secure.
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:31.080]   Never been, by the way, an exploit taking advantage of Go To My PC, unlike any other
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:32.200]   remote access system.
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:33.640]   This stuff just works.
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:35.280]   And set up, so simple.
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:42.640]   In fact, you could do it right now free for the next 30 days, go to GoToMyPC.com, G-O-T-O-M-Y-PC.com/twit.
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:46.320]   You could try this, you can get an idea of how it works for yourself.
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:50.920]   You sign up for the account, take a second, and then press the download button.
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:52.840]   In two minutes, you'll have all the software you need.
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:53.840]   You're done.
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:57.240]   Now travel, now hit the road, now go home from work.
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:01.600]   Enjoy yourself, live life, and anytime you need that office computer, you can get there
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:04.200]   easily and quickly just by going to GoToMyPC.com.
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:06.680]   It couldn't be simpler to set up, and I want you to try it free.
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:14.360]   Go to GoToMyPC.com/twit for your free 30-day trial.
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:16.840]   I could tell you all the different ways we use it, and we do.
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:17.840]   We use it like crazy.
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:21.040]   But the best thing to do is install it and find the ways you can use it.
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:24.680]   There's always going to be ways that I haven't thought of that you can find to make this
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:27.760]   an absolutely indispensable tool.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:30.320]   G-O-T-O-M-Y-PC.com/twit.
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:31.760]   You're going to love it.
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:36.760]   And of course, as always, thanks Citrix, they've been a really great supporter for all of us.
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:38.080]   For a very long time, in fact.
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:39.400]   For a very long time.
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:43.400]   And as you guys know, the job of the audience right now is to-
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:45.240]   Jason, you really don't have to do this.
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:47.280]   This is my new advertising format.
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:48.280]   It's my new ad format, which is called-
[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:49.640]   Do you do this on Twist?
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:50.640]   I do it on Twist.
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:51.640]   It's incredible.
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:52.640]   It's a reason the sponsor is sponsoring now.
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:55.520]   I want everybody out there who can hear my voice, and it doesn't matter if you're listening
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:55:00.600]   to this in 2010 or 2012 or 2009, just to say on their Twitter account, it costs you nothing
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:01.600]   to do this.
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:02.600]   I'm here for Twitter.
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:03.600]   Peter Rojas is here.
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:04.600]   I'm here.
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:05.600]   It's free.
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:06.600]   On a Sunday, it's free.
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:07.600]   It's free.
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:09.840]   What does it cost you to just say, "You know what?
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:13.280]   Thank you @goto meeting.
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:14.280]   Go to MyPC."
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:15.280]   Right?
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:16.280]   Yeah.
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:17.280]   I don't know if they have an ad account.
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.280]   What is their ad account?
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:19.280]   Yeah.
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:20.280]   Even if they don't, just say, "Thank you.
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:21.840]   Go to MyPC on your Twitter account."
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:22.840]   Just say it.
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:24.360]   It will take you 10 seconds.
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:26.000]   Thank you for sponsoring Twitter.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.080]   Then whoever this marketing person is, you know that they're getting pitched on social
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:32.200]   media like crazy, and all these people are saying, "Give us a million dollars in this
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:33.200]   social media project."
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:34.600]   You know what they say now?
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:36.360]   Twitter is our social media project.
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:41.360]   We get 1,000 tweets every time we're on Twitter.
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:45.400]   That means something to that marketing manager, and that means you are contributing to the
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:46.400]   show.
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:47.400]   That's brilliant.
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:48.400]   I'm just saying.
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.400]   That's brilliant.
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:50.880]   We're not asking the audience for money.
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:51.880]   Just tweet about it.
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:56.360]   Except I don't want them to fill up Twitter with spam either, though.
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:59.600]   I mean, isn't that kind of spammy?
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:02.480]   Oh, we lost him.
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:03.960]   It's just one little tweet.
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:06.480]   It's one little tweet.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:07.480]   It's one little tweet.
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:10.960]   Just 175,000 people doing one little tweet.
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:15.240]   What do you think of the new Twitter front page, by the way?
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.660]   This is how far it's gone with Twitter.
[00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:19.680]   This was actually a news story in mainstream media.
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:20.960]   Twitter has a new homepage.
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:22.800]   Actually, I don't like it.
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:25.440]   How do you make that a news story anyway?
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:26.720]   What don't you like about it?
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:29.300]   I just think that...
[00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:30.300]   It's pretty sparse.
[00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:31.520]   I don't even mind the sparse.
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:35.960]   I like minimal design stuff in general, but I think that it's starting to emphasize Twitter
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:37.200]   as more of a search engine.
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:38.540]   Well, isn't that what it is?
[00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:41.240]   It is kind of, but I think that...
[00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:44.040]   On the front page, it has popular topics.
[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:45.040]   That's all you really see.
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:48.760]   You say, "Share and discover what's happening right now anywhere in the world," and then
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:53.520]   you have a search box and you have the popular topics, the trending topics, and then a signup
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:54.520]   now.
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:56.040]   It's in fact like a search engine.
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:58.960]   I'm not saying it shouldn't have search on the front page or search shouldn't be a component
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:03.560]   to it, but I think that what makes Twitter really valuable for me and what I really like
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:05.600]   about it is the fact that it's conversational.
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:06.600]   It's about people...
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:10.320]   They say join the conversation, but they're really trying to turn it...
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:11.880]   I can't remember who the point is.
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:12.880]   I wish I could credit them.
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:16.240]   It's saying Twitter's just turning us into cogs in their giant...
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:19.040]   Well, Twitter's the next evil empire, right?
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:20.040]   They all are.
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:21.040]   They'll make it obvious.
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:22.040]   They'll seduce us a little bit.
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:26.800]   This homepage is not intended for us because obviously we don't see it when we log in.
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:27.800]   We go to our replies.
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:28.800]   It's for new users.
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:30.960]   No, not for new users either.
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:31.960]   Who is it for?
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:32.960]   This is for investors.
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:33.960]   Oh, that's what it's for.
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:37.880]   This is for whoever is going to take Twitter public, whoever's doing it.
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:39.960]   They want the perception to be they're a search engine.
[00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:40.960]   Why?
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:41.960]   Because that's what's valuable.
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:43.640]   Search engines are a billion dollars per percentage point.
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:46.040]   Did you know that actually Twitter is a search engine?
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:47.040]   Twitter is.
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:48.040]   Absolutely.
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:49.040]   This we can take as a search engine, actually.
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:56.040]   If anybody would like to do a search, if Leo has a list of searches, do the search.
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:57.040]   I'm going to work that out.
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:58.040]   0.000001% in the market.
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:57:59.040]   I'll take it.
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:04.040]   Peter and I will give you search results live on Twitter.
[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:06.040]   Ask us anything.
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:08.040]   What do you want to know?
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:10.760]   Just no adult topics, please.
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:11.760]   So that's interesting.
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:12.760]   So that's really...
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:13.760]   I think you're right.
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:14.760]   I think you're exactly right, Jason.
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:15.760]   You're sending a signal.
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:16.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:17.760]   Well, that's what I said.
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:18.760]   I think Jason's right.
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:21.320]   If you're someone that doesn't really know what Twitter is and you hit this page for
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:22.320]   the front...
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:23.320]   That doesn't help.
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:26.760]   It doesn't help you understand what's going on.
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:30.260]   And it doesn't really give you a sense of the conversational nature of the site and
[00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:34.440]   how it's really about connecting with your friends and stuff like that.
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:36.440]   I mean, whatever.
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:40.160]   I mean, at this point, maybe there are very few people left who don't know what Twitter
[00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:41.160]   is.
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:42.160]   It might have reached sort of...
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:45.680]   There's sort of a sense that it may have reached its sort of saturation in the mainstream.
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:47.640]   Jason, are you still bullish on Twitter?
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:48.640]   Oh, very much so.
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:54.320]   I mean, if you type in Jay-Z or Sarah Palin, what you'll get in that search engine is going
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:59.840]   to be in some way as compelling as Google or StumbleUpon or Delicious Search.
[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:03.540]   And that's always been my premise with Mahalo and any human powered search engine is there's
[00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:07.640]   something cool about what we're recommending to each other.
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:10.660]   I make a distinction between search and discoverability though.
[00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:13.000]   It's more about discovery, isn't it, than search?
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   Of course.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.960]   And that's why it's not a Google replacement.
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:18.520]   There are multiple search files.
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:22.560]   Maybe, and I think Jeff Jarvis made this point on Twig yesterday, maybe discovery is the
[00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:24.040]   next search.
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:25.040]   No.
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:27.200]   No, why not?
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:28.200]   No.
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:32.080]   It is a nice thing to waste time with and to...
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:33.080]   No, it is.
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:34.760]   It's a time wasting kind of thing.
[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:38.280]   But if you want to have an actual accomplish a goal, which is what most people use search
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:42.520]   for, I'm looking to buy a car, I'm doing research, I'm trying to find a website, I'm trying to
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:43.520]   find a person.
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:44.520]   It's not good for that.
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:51.000]   If you type in Toyota Prius or you type in iced tea or salmon recipe, it's not going
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   to be good.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.960]   Well, it might be better, but if you typed Abraham Lincoln, it's not going to be useful.
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:55.960]   Yeah, of course.
[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:57.680]   Let me give you an example of what I use Twitter for.
[00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:59.040]   I used it for last night.
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:03.920]   I'm staying not too far from here and there are fireworks in the direction of Petaluma.
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:04.920]   So I just...
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:05.920]   What's going on?
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.040]   Obviously, Google is not the best place to find out what's going on.
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:09.040]   Real time.
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.760]   Real time, I just searched on Twitter for fireworks.
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:12.760]   Did you find anything?
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:17.000]   I actually found out a lot of fireworks going on in LA.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   It's not perfect yet.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   It's not perfect yet.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.320]   But I've used it before actually.
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:25.240]   It's funny actually, anytime I see fireworks and don't know what's going on, which has
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:26.440]   actually happened a few times.
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:29.760]   If you ever want to know when a celebrity is dead, Twitter is the greatest.
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.640]   Yeah, it's almost a little too much.
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.960]   It's the fastest way to find out who's dead.
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:36.360]   Yeah, 55,000 times.
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:37.360]   Like Michael Jackson's dead.
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:38.360]   Really?
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:39.360]   Is he still dead?
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:40.880]   Oh wait, I need 110,000 results for that.
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:41.880]   Okay, great.
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:42.880]   I'm going to go to my PC.
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:43.880]   It is 140 characters.
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:47.600]   You're not going to get that much out of it.
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:51.680]   Although I will say, I just typed in "twit" into the search and you should pull it up
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:52.680]   on your screen.
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:53.680]   I saw it.
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.160]   Go to my PC is going to be pretty happy on Monday.
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:58.240]   It's kind of a trending topic.
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:00:59.240]   Thank you everybody.
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:00.240]   How great would that be?
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.840]   Except for the one guy who said, "F, go to my PC.
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:03.840]   I hate them."
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:06.400]   That's the dark side of social media.
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:09.000]   There's always one.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.360]   So here's a story in the Annals of Law that I quite enjoy.
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:16.520]   I don't know if there's anything to say about this.
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:20.200]   The story comes from the Chicago Sun-Times.
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:31.680]   It's about a young woman, a woman named Amanda Bonin, who twittered in May of this year.
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:35.280]   She no longer has an account and this tweet is long gone, but she twittered, "You should
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:36.280]   just come anyway."
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:39.520]   She said, "Sleeping in a moldy apartment is bad for you.
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.360]   Horizon Realty thinks it's okay."
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:46.720]   Now, it turns out Horizon Realty is the apartment management firm that owns the apartment she
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:47.880]   was staying in.
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:56.480]   They saw the tweet and they have now sued her for libel for $50,000 for a tweet.
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:57.480]   That's it?
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.480]   That's all?
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:05.000]   Furthermore, and this is the part I really like, they said, I think Chicago sometimes
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.520]   interviewed the owner of the company.
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:11.520]   He said, "We're a Sue First, Ask Questions Later company."
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:12.760]   I want a t-shirt that says that.
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.360]   I'm a Sue First, Ask Questions Later kind of guy.
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:17.320]   Yeah, I mean it's the Streisand effect, right?
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:19.600]   I think Mike Masnick from TechDirt coined this.
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.000]   The Streisand effect, what does that mean?
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.720]   So the Streisand effect is something Barbara Streisand a few years ago sued somebody for
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:28.360]   posting an aerial photo of her home because she didn't want people to see where she lived.
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:32.640]   In the process, now everyone knows what she lives and what her house looks like from the
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:33.880]   air.
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:36.960]   And so I think what this company has done is I think this woman had maybe 20 people
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:40.520]   following her on Twitter.
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:42.440]   About 20 million people now know about this.
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:43.840]   Everybody knows.
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:46.960]   Now I will guarantee you there are going to be a lot of people who will not rent from
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:47.960]   this place.
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:50.880]   So I think legally maybe are they in the right, who knows?
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.880]   If they can demonstrate that there is a problem.
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:54.720]   It might legitimately be liable.
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:58.880]   It might be, but I think you have to have a sense of perspective and proportion about
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.440]   this sort of thing.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:04.480]   You might want to just let it slide because you're going to have this effect, this Streisand
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:10.880]   effect where a lot more people find out about the problem and the insult or the slander
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:11.880]   or libel.
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:12.880]   Her horizon is trying to fix it.
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:17.120]   They put out a press release saying the Sue First comment was tongue in cheek that no
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:20.400]   mold was ever found in the apartment and she had sued it first.
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:24.640]   Although that's legal filing doesn't mention a prior suit.
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:27.440]   I think it's kind of, it's out of control at this point.
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:28.800]   It would have just let it go.
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:29.800]   Yeah.
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:33.800]   It's too difficult to just say to her, you know, we understand that you are concerned
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:37.440]   about the mold in your apartment because she didn't make up there's mold in our apartment
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:39.360]   and what are the chances of that?
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.640]   So you understand you think you might have a mold problem.
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:45.320]   We'll put you in another apartment and by the way, we're going to send up some pastry.
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:46.320]   And say it on Twitter.
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:49.840]   I just say, Oh, hey, our bad, you know, mold happens.
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:52.080]   I have mold in one of my bathrooms in my house.
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:53.080]   It happens.
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:56.520]   We have to get the whole goddamn thing ripped out and that's a mold exists.
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:00.040]   Wait a minute, I'm going to write this down.
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.040]   Mold happens.
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.040]   This is a word of wisdom.
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.040]   Mold happens.
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:06.200]   You have three possible names for the show.
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:11.080]   Streisand effect from Wikipedia is defined as the effect is related to John Gilmore's
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:16.880]   observation that in quotes, the net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:17.880]   Oh, I like that.
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:18.880]   Wait a minute.
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:23.240]   The net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:24.240]   Correct.
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:25.240]   That's been around for a while.
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.360]   That's a great line.
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:27.360]   It's a great line.
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:28.360]   Yeah.
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:29.360]   It's very tweetable.
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:30.360]   Yeah.
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:35.240]   Well, and what's interesting is that some companies have done very well in this, in
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:40.000]   this kind of instance, Comcast cares is a very good example by responding online on
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.360]   Twitter publicly in a very caring fashion and established.
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:45.000]   I mean, that's the way to handle this.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.120]   I think generally speaking, you have to be a lot more transparent about this stuff and
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.920]   to recognize that.
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:53.520]   I mean, at least in my experience, if somebody's unhappy about something, it's best to just
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:54.520]   deal with them as a human being.
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:55.960]   Is that ice tea?
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:58.360]   What is that you're drinking?
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:01.160]   He's he's he's he's muted himself on mute.
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:02.160]   Oh, sorry about that.
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:04.440]   It was a little iced tea with a little mint in it.
[01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:05.440]   Yeah.
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:07.400]   It looks like your mint was muddled to my friend.
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:10.880]   All of my life muddled to my ninch, so to speak.
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:14.560]   That's nice of her to do that, especially considering she's pregnant.
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:16.920]   Maybe you want to muddle her mint for a change.
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:20.120]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:21.840]   I gotta get the bourbon out.
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:22.840]   I'm sorry.
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:23.840]   You're gonna drink that.
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:26.520]   You got a little bullet.
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:27.520]   This is good.
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:28.520]   Have you ever had bullet bourbon?
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:29.520]   No.
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:30.520]   Are they a sponsor?
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:31.520]   No.
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:32.520]   Oh, they're a sponsor.
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:37.120]   I tell you, bourbon bullet bullet bourbon is the finest bourbon I've had.
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:40.440]   No, Molly Molly Wood brought this the last time she was in and she's apparently a brown
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:41.820]   liquor drinker.
[01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:43.480]   And this is called Frontier Whisky.
[01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:45.360]   It's but it's good with lemonade.
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.360]   Would you like some?
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.360]   I'm sorry.
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:48.360]   Brown liquor drinker.
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:56.480]   And you know, Dane wrote because we used to do the wine, you know, on the show.
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:00.440]   I have a disclaimer that Dane wrote for me and anytime I pull out the booze, which I
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:03.880]   didn't drink kids and I'm putting back in the drawer, it's really more a prop than anything
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:04.880]   else.
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:05.880]   Right.
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:06.880]   It's iced tea in there.
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:07.880]   No, yeah.
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:11.600]   He says, while we here in the studio may choose to drink alcoholic beverages from time to time,
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:15.640]   this is in no way meant to be an endorsement of drinking in general or an encouragement
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:18.120]   to anyone in our audience who might be underage.
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:19.840]   Each person on our panel is over 21.
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:20.840]   Are you over 21?
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:21.840]   Yes, very much so.
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:26.840]   He looks like he's like 18 and is fully aware of the responsibilities that go along with
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:27.840]   drinking.
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:29.800]   If you're underage, please do not drink.
[01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:34.120]   And regardless, this is the best part, regardless of your age, never ever drive drunk.
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:38.080]   And if you've been drinking, I think Dane had a fugue state here or something.
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:41.240]   And if you've been drinking, even if you don't think you've had too much, hand the keys over
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.280]   to someone else.
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:44.280]   Call a taxi, call a parent, take a bus.
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:47.720]   We want everyone in the community to live long and healthy lives.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:48.720]   Correct.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:52.200]   I don't know why that's in my book.
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:54.720]   That being said, I want to create an inducement.
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:55.720]   There's been no inducement here.
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:57.000]   No inducement here.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.920]   If you are drinking, we encourage you to tweet to your Twitter account and update your Facebook
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:05.680]   status and by all means turn on Ustream.
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:06.680]   Hey, is it really?
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:08.560]   Because it's nothing funnier than a drunk person.
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:09.560]   Drunk video stream.
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:10.560]   We love that.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:14.920]   Did you see a Stefan Marbury on Ustream this week and Justin TV this week?
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:15.920]   No, what happened?
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:16.920]   Oh my God.
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:20.000]   I saw a video in the Twitter control deck there.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:26.240]   Pull up Stefan Marbury crying on Ustream or any of these Stefan Marbury live.
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:34.800]   He basically live casted for like two or three days, 24 hours a day, eating Vaseline, crying
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:40.840]   to gospel music and talking in tongues essentially.
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:43.360]   This is Stefan Marbury of the Boston Celtics?
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:49.680]   Stefan Marbury formerly of the New York Knicks, product of Coney Island and now unsigned and
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:53.240]   probably going to remain that way based on his performances, but he was like one of the
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:55.920]   top five highest paid players in the league last year.
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:57.720]   This is not just some guy.
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:00.320]   He was going crazy, literally.
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:01.320]   I'm looking at the guy.
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:02.320]   I'm sure.
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:03.320]   Oh my God.
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:04.320]   Okay.
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:05.320]   Here it is.
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:06.320]   You can see him.
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:07.320]   You trying to have these people hang me?
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:10.320]   This is some people, you know, put away the video camera.
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:13.960]   I already got the noose around my neck.
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:16.480]   Can't do that.
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:17.480]   Jodecy.
[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:20.080]   So he knows he's on, right?
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:21.080]   Yeah.
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:22.080]   He was talking to everyone in the camera.
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.360]   He's talking to people in the chat room.
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:27.560]   He was basically going insane for three or four days.
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:29.320]   I don't know if I like this.
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:36.320]   And people are speculating this person, it might be medicated either with illegal or
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:41.040]   legal medication because the behavior was nonstop for a couple of days.
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:44.920]   So people are like, this guy's on a Coke binge or something for three days, or he's on some
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:48.440]   kind of prescription medicine because he's not behaving normally.
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:50.960]   And then I just, the guy's a little bit out there.
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:54.760]   I mean, there's been a lot of instances of him being people thinking he's actually crazy.
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:56.320]   We're probably going to see more of this, aren't we?
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:58.360]   I mean, anybody now can do this.
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:00.000]   It's so easy to turn on a stream.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   Well, how soon?
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.200]   And a lot of people have very poor judgment.
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:05.200]   How soon?
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:06.200]   Very poor judgment.
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:10.280]   I'm just a disclaimer for using Ustream.
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:15.120]   Those of us in this room, we use streaming media because we're trained professionals
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:17.480]   in over 21, but you shouldn't try this at home.
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:22.120]   Actually, what they should do is they should have a breathalyzer test on your PC built
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:27.600]   in so you can't tweet or load Ustream unless you pass the breathalyzer test on your laptop.
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:28.600]   Yeah.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:31.400]   So they have that anti-drunk dialing application.
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:32.400]   On Google mail.
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:39.520]   Yeah, they have Gmail and I think Virgin Mobile had a phone that prevents you from drunk texting
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:40.520]   people.
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:41.520]   What does it do?
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:42.520]   It makes you do math or something?
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:45.520]   The Gmail labs one makes you do math.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:46.520]   It makes you do math.
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:51.360]   There's like a few different things out there to save you from yourself.
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:55.480]   How soon before the first live streaming sex tape?
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:57.560]   I'm shocked it hasn't happened yet.
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:58.560]   Somebody's going to do a live streaming.
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:09:59.560]   Oh, it's happening.
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:01.560]   It's just not happening where we hang out.
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:02.560]   Have a celebrity?
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:03.560]   A celebrity?
[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:08.560]   Shouldn't Paris Hilton or Lindsay Lohan accidentally turn on her laptop?
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:09.560]   Accidentally turned on her laptop during-
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:10.960]   It's just a matter of time.
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:14.800]   I assume they would do it for cash, like sell tickets or something.
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:16.280]   Pay per live stream.
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:17.280]   Pay per view.
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:20.320]   Yeah, I hate to focus on all that stuff because of course all this stuff is going to happen
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:21.320]   on the internet.
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:22.320]   Let's hope it's better.
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:26.440]   There's other better, more interesting stuff happening.
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:27.440]   I would hope.
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:32.760]   I mean, none of the stories this week, but how about this one?
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:42.440]   Our friend, Joel Tenenbaum, who admitted that he stole music has been found guilty.
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:46.000]   The judge even said the question wasn't an issue of whether he was guilty.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.240]   The only thing the jury had to do was figure out how much he owed.
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:57.680]   They awarded $22,500 per song to the RIAA, $675,000.
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:03.760]   I don't think the graduate student is going to have that kind of money.
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.920]   We've seen these cases a few times now, right?
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:12.400]   The RIA is obviously very aggressive in going after people for sharing stuff.
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:15.040]   I think he actually was not just downloading.
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.960]   I think he was actually also sharing back up.
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:17.960]   Yeah, and he admitted it.
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.720]   Now, he had a Harvard Law professor-
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:20.720]   He lied about it.
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:21.720]   At first.
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:22.720]   And then he admitted it, which I think is-
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:26.840]   Yeah, that's all a mess.
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:31.360]   His lawyer took some interesting strategic turns as well.
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:32.600]   The whole thing was kind of a mess.
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:37.920]   Maybe he can sue his lawyer for malpractice for $675,000.
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.000]   The whole thing's a mess.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   And mold.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000]   Yeah, it's a mess.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.040]   Well, the music industry is really, really screwed up.
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:49.720]   I thought they stopped suing people.
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:50.720]   Are they still suing people?
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:51.720]   What's the deal?
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:52.880]   They're still going after a few people here.
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:55.920]   I think they've mainly stopped.
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:56.920]   But I think-
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:57.920]   These are just leftover.
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:59.480]   I don't know when this case started.
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:00.920]   I assume it's been going on for a while, though.
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:02.880]   I'm sure it has, yeah.
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:03.880]   Yeah.
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:08.040]   I'm dealing with this on a weekly basis right now with ASCAP, who has been-
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:09.040]   Oh, that must be fun.
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:10.040]   Oh my God.
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:11.040]   They are...
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:14.040]   I don't even know if I should talk about it or not, but I mean-
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:15.040]   Yeah, no, no, no.
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.040]   We-
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:17.820]   Twittering about it, but there's a whole ASCAP thing going on.
[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:21.480]   People can search on the internet for it, but they're basically sending letters to a lot
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:23.360]   of site owners, including myself.
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:24.360]   Where do you...
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:25.960]   Do you have music on your site?
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:29.360]   We have YouTube videos in our search engine.
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:33.480]   And YouTube, apparently...
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:35.920]   YouTube is paying for an ASCAP license, from what I understand.
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:38.600]   However, if you syndicate a YouTube video-
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:39.600]   You're responsible.
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:41.680]   Well, they're claiming you are.
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:42.880]   I don't believe you are.
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:44.520]   I don't believe you are.
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:45.520]   Because when you-
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:46.520]   It's just embed.
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:47.520]   Yeah.
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:48.520]   It's just embedding.
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:49.520]   It's just embedding.
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:50.520]   It's just embedding.

[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:17.520]   It's just embedding.

[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:25.520]   I know you don't allow fried chicken in your Tesla, Jason, but--
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:26.520]   No.
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:27.520]   No fried chicken.
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:28.520]   In-and-out burgers?
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:29.520]   Yes.
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:30.520]   No, come on.
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:33.960]   Have you pulled up to an in-and-out in a Tesla?
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:34.960]   No comment.
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:35.960]   I love that.
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:41.320]   No, I almost got-- I was driving with my wife to a friend's house yesterday, and I'm going
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:47.260]   through the hills in Bel Air, and this woman is in my lane in the hills, and she's coming
[01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:48.260]   right for us.
[01:18:48.260 --> 01:18:49.260]   I slam on the brakes.
[01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:53.400]   I'm going sidewalking halfway up with the truck, and she was texting.
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:57.440]   And I'm honking the horn, and I felt like I was going to chase this woman down and absolutely
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:00.320]   murder her because I got my five-month pregnant wife here.
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:01.320]   Yeah.
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:06.080]   We're almost in a head-on collision so that she can text her friend, "OMG, get me a latte,"
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:07.800]   or whatever the eff she was doing.
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.760]   I mean, what is wrong with people?
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:11.520]   You drive in LA, and you look at people.
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:12.680]   They are doing their makeup.
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:13.680]   They're texting.
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:15.200]   Anything but driving.
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:16.620]   Enjoy the drive, people.
[01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:18.040]   It's OK.
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:22.720]   Put on an audiobook from somebody like Audible and listen to something.
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:25.800]   That's completely legal and highly appropriate, actually.
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:26.800]   That's what I would do.
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:29.840]   I would just listen to an Audible audiobook.
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:32.680]   Let me get the notebook out and just see what it says in here about Audible.
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:38.520]   No, I'm just saying, if you had a choice, texting and dying or driving and getting to
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:44.600]   your destination while listening to a business book, maybe some fiction, maybe a bestseller
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:48.120]   that you see when you go to the airport, you see in the New York Times, you say, "You know
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:49.120]   what?
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:50.120]   I wish I read more, but I don't.
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:55.120]   Why don't I just put a couple of things on my iPod, my iPhone, or even a DRM free player
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:20:02.120]   and just listen, get educated, get amused while not killing yourself and murdering other people
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:03.120]   and pregnant wives?"
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:04.120]   Why wouldn't you do that?
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.120]   Why wouldn't you do that?
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:10.480]   Virginia Tech's Transportation Institute did a study texting while driving increased truck
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:15.440]   drivers risk of crash 23 times.
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:16.440]   Only 23 times.
[01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:17.440]   Only 23 times.
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:23.480]   Chuck Schumer has introduced legislation that will force states to ban texting while operating
[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:29.520]   a moving vehicle or face cuts in federal highway funds.
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:33.440]   Interestingly, I think it's at this point that even the cell carriers aren't going to
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:34.440]   fight this one.
[01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:35.880]   It's just going to happen, right?
[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:37.960]   I don't think it ultimately really is going to hurt their business.
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:38.960]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:44.080]   John Taylor, Sprint Nextail's public affairs manager says, "The legislation is well intentioned,
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:47.960]   but it likely won't get to the root issue of changing driver behavior."
[01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:49.760]   They're starting to sound like the tobacco company.
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:52.480]   They really are.
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:53.480]   Texting doesn't kill.
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:54.960]   Phones don't kill people.
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:55.960]   Yeah.
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:21:00.440]   Actually, if you're using a jailbroken iPhone, your chances of getting an accident are 27
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:01.440]   percent, so times.
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:02.440]   That's right.
[01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:04.720]   It's much more dangerous if you jailbreak your phone.
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:06.120]   What was wrong with these PR people?
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:07.560]   Can somebody just drown them?
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:08.560]   Yeah.
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:10.400]   I think it was the other carrier who said, "Yeah, you're right.
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:11.400]   It's a problem."
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:12.960]   What was this guy's name again?
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:16.080]   The guy ... John Taylor, Sprint Nextail's public affairs manager.
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:17.080]   Okay.
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:20.720]   John Taylor, can somebody please let this idiot know that we're talking about him?
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:21.720]   Send him this clip.
[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:22.720]   Put it on YouTube.
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:25.600]   John Taylor, you fricking moron.
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:29.560]   You are risking people's lives.
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:33.920]   Your stupid PR speak is going to result in people dying.
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:34.920]   You idiot.
[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:35.920]   Look deeply at the life you've chosen.
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:36.920]   Now, in his defense ... In his defense ...
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:40.680]   Look deeply at the life you've chosen.
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:41.680]   You are supporting the murder of a fricking idiot.
[01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:43.680]   Everyone crash your car into his apartment.
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:44.680]   No, no, no.
[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:45.680]   Stop.
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:46.680]   Now, I know you're going to get me soon.
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:47.680]   Find this person.
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:50.120]   Somebody find this person and get them on Twit next week.
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:51.520]   I want them on Twit next week.
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:58.120]   Opinions of Twit panelists are those ... are theirs entirely ... are not in any way endorsed.
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:00.000]   I'm not encouraging anyone to break them.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.520]   We don't have anything to do with them.
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:03.240]   Who let these guys in the studio?
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:04.240]   No.
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:08.760]   I'm encouraging somebody who knows him to tell him what a donkey he is.
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:15.240]   He did say that my experience with law enforcement educators suggests the best way to tackle
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:18.520]   this problem is through better driver education.
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:20.360]   What you need is like a dog.
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:22.640]   The guy dresses up like a dog that goes to the high school.
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:23.640]   Yeah, McGruff the text dog.
[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:24.640]   Yeah, the text dog.
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:25.640]   Yeah.
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:26.640]   Don't text while driving.
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:27.640]   Take a bite out of texting.
[01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:30.640]   Hi, I'm Tony the Tuck Driver.
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:33.320]   I almost killed seven people and wound up in a swimming pool.
[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:35.360]   Be like Tony the Tuck Driver.
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:38.560]   Yeah, but I'm with him in one respect.
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:41.600]   There are so many other things people are doing.
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:45.240]   People bend over to tune the radio, then look up and they've run into four pedestrians.
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:48.560]   There's all sorts of things you could do that are stupid in a car.
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:50.160]   Here's what I want people to do.
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:53.940]   I would like everybody on the Twitter audience to take out their flip cameras when they're
[01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:57.760]   not driving, when they're in the passenger seat, and videotape people doing stupid stuff.
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:58.760]   That's a good idea.
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:22:59.760]   Let's make a website.
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:00.760]   Or YouTube.
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:01.760]   Yeah.
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:02.760]   Or YouTube.
