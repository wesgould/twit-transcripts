[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   It's time for Twit this week at Tech, the show where we cover the latest Tech News.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Wow, we've got a massive audience for our Labor Day weekend show.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Those of you outside the United States.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   It's a day we celebrate labor by not working.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   That makes sense.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   With us here who is the three people who are working.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Oh, and JJ Stone. Oh, Dr. Nice to see you again.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   I just realized it is Labor Day and I shouldn't be here laboring.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   So I'm going to take a relaxing chill.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   I might go get a drink or a beer or something.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Drink at a beer or something.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I should be upset right now.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   What can't we do though?
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   I think we can't wear white shoes after today.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   No, you can't wear white after Labor Day.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   You sure can.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   That's from the rules.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I'm going to move that from.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   It's from one of those.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.640]   I don't wear white shoes during any time of the year, but I guess this would be the bad
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.000]   time to wear white shoes.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Also, with us Christina Warren from her new gig.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Hi, Christina.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Great to see you.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Great to see you too, Leo.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Film Girl.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   She wasn't Mashable.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   She's now a senior writer at Gizmodo.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Big promotion.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Well, I moved 12 floors.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   So that's the funny thing.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   You're in the same building?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Same building.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Wow.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Yeah, I know that was sort of my joke.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I was like, "I was at Mashable for seven years and as far away as I could get was 12 floors."
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   But the easy...
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   So did you actually...
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I'm wondering.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   I'm seeing this vision of you with a box getting on the...
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Yeah, no.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Yeah, no.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.440]   I could have done that if I hadn't had a week off in between the two gigs, but I had a week
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.440]   off.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.440]   So that would have been a little weird.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.440]   What did you do with your week off?
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.440]   Did you go somewhere and do something fun?
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.960]   I went to Atlanta and I visited my parents and saw some friends and just...
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.960]   It took care of some things.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.960]   It was nice.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.960]   Well, congratulations on the new job.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.960]   Thank you.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.720]   Also here from our show this week in Google, an expert on IoT.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.480]   You may remember her from Gigah Home.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.040]   In fact, Gigah Stacey is still her handle on Twitter.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.040]   Stacey Hagenbotham.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.040]   Nice to see you.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.040]   Great to be here.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.080]   Host to the IoT podcast at IoTpodcast.com with Kevin Tofel.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.080]   What a great panel.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.440]   I just want to let you sit and talk.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.160]   We don't need to do news.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.800]   Nothing's going to happen anyway this week.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.440]   It's going to be very slow that a week after...
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.640]   Yeah, it's not like there are two major events happening on Wednesday.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.640]   There's nothing happening.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.640]   Wait a minute.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.640]   Two major events?
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.640]   I know there's an Apple event.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.760]   Yeah, Sony PlayStation 4, whatever the hell they're doing with it.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.760]   Wow.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.920]   Well, let's take them one by one.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:35.000]   The event that Apple's doing will be in San Francisco at the Bill Graham Memorial Auditorium,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.240]   where they've been having events lately.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.840]   It's a big, big venue.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.840]   It's a big venue.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.200]   Yeah, I think that this is like their third or fourth event that they've done there because
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.720]   they did the iPhone event last year.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.720]   They did WWDC.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:54.240]   I don't remember where they did the iPad Pro event, the smaller iPad Pro event in March.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.240]   It might have been at Bill Graham.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:01.840]   It's going to be one of the last events that's not at their new corporate headquarters because
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.120]   that should be open by early.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.840]   Yeah, that should be open soon.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.360]   I'm not sure if that will be big enough for them to bring in all the press that they
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.360]   want to bring in.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.720]   It's possible they could still do these in San Francisco, but it's interesting that
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:20.400]   they've basically gone away from using Moscone and just started using Bill Graham.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.160]   When do you, you're flying out, I presume?
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.160]   I am.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.320]   I have so I fly on Tuesday.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.320]   Wait a minute.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.440]   You work for Gizmodo.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.720]   I do.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.080]   But you got the Christina Warren invitation, not the Gizmodo invitation.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.680]   I mean, is Gizmodo still?
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.160]   No, Gizmodo's been going to these events, right?
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.400]   No, they haven't.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.400]   They haven't.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.960]   It went to the Apple Watch one.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.760]   So I guess two years ago was was one that they were invited to.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.400]   That's when the embargo, the banning was first broken.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.400]   Was first broken.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.400]   And then that was the last of it.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.400]   They've really.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.400]   So this is the first one.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.000]   Is Gizmodo's choice or does Apple not invite them?
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.520]   To my knowledge, it was not their choice.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.520]   So I mean, interesting.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:09.520]   So this goes back for people not paying exactly microscopic attention to everything that
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.960]   happens at Apple back to the iPhone 4S, right, where it was left in a bar.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.960]   It was the iPhone 4.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:16.960]   I don't know.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.720]   I mean, you know, look, that was six years before I joined the company.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.800]   I know you don't respond to that.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.240]   And it was left in a bar.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.240]   Somebody picked it up.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.800]   This was before its release and then eventually sold it to Gizmodo, which did stories on it.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.280]   Brian Lamb did stories on it.
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.600]   And then the police came and they broke in the house and they took all his computers
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:43.200]   and nothing came of it, but except Gizmodo stopped getting invited to Apple events.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.160]   So congratulations on breaking the embargo.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.160]   Is it?
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.960]   Did Apple know though, when you joined?
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.960]   Oh, yeah, they knew.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:52.960]   Or when they issued it.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.960]   Okay.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.560]   It went to your Gizmodo address, not to your personal address.
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.560]   Exactly.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.560]   Interesting.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.560]   Okay.
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.560]   See, see, it's a new Apple.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.560]   They invite everybody.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.000]   They're going to need all the press they can get when they take this headphone jack
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   out of time.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.600]   Come on with a headphone jack.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.600]   Let's talk about it.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.880]   So, actually, I'm seeing conflicting rumors now, which is good because otherwise it would
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.600]   be deathly dull since usually now by now we know everything that Apple's going to announce.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.640]   It's going to be some little thing like how many milliamp hours the battery has that will
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:28.440]   be a surprise except I saw a couple of people run stories saying, not Mark Gurman.
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.040]   Mark Gurman's been consistent.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.960]   He's the course, the kind of the leader on all of this.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.720]   He's formerly at nine to five Mac.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.240]   He's now at Bloomberg.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.000]   He seems to have very good sources.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.280]   He says, no, no, it's going to be an iPhone 7, 7 Plus.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.800]   The 7 Plus will have dual cameras.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.960]   The 7 Plus will not have a headphone jack.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.320]   But I've seen other stories from other people saying there were going to be three phones.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.520]   There was going to be an iPhone 7, 7 Plus and 7 Pro.
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.520]   The Pro is the dual camera model.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.520]   No.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.520]   No.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.520]   I mean, I've seen that story too.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.520]   That never made sense to me.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:03.600]   I think what it's more likely, and I love you guys as few about what I gather is they were
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.600]   probably at some point testing different devices.
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.480]   They probably were looking at maybe making an iPhone.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.680]   I don't even know if three devices, I think they've probably just iteratively designed
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.640]   the larger phone.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.760]   Three different chassis leaked and one of them was presumably the 7 Plus.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.960]   One of them, what they were calling the 7 Pro, which had the smart connector and the dual
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.760]   camera system.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:32.920]   Every leak that we've had from both Mingshau and from Mark Gurman has basically been pegging
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.800]   on this dual camera system for quite some time.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:40.240]   And so I saw this where I think four versus kind of like, oh, they decided not to release
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.240]   three models.
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.560]   There were never going to be three models.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.960]   I don't think there were ever going to be three models.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.520]   I think it was always small on the big.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.040]   This is, I mean, come on.
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.280]   This is normally Apple does TikTok.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.240]   This would be a new design.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.280]   We already know based on the leaked body pictures.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.440]   And I think those are probably accurate, right?
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.440]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.200]   It's not going to be much of a new design.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.960]   In fact, this might be a very dull event.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.520]   This might just be, hey, we kind of put a new processor in there.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.840]   We added a little lens.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.520]   At this point, what can they do?
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.360]   And you know, again, no matter what they do, they're going to tell you they're going
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.960]   to tell you they're experiencing on Earth.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.800]   And that you feel special about yourself and that you won't be whole unless you have
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.800]   the phone.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.320]   So, yeah, I think they're going to have trouble selling this one.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.000]   I'm going to go out on the limb here.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   What?
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   You don't do that.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.240]   First of all, why do you say stuff like that?
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.440]   You just thought that'd agitate me.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.640]   It's not against an iPad.
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.360]   They have problem selling iPads right now.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.280]   They don't have problems with these phones.
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.760]   People want it for nothing else.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:43.560]   No, no, no, the growth rate of the phone is dropped considerably when they launch, when
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.920]   a new phone launched in a series, they don't usually have a problem moving the units of
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:48.920]   the phone.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:53.480]   Now, by the time they get to the S versions, yes, there is an off of a cliff.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.480]   But this is an SS.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.680]   This is not much of a change.
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.680]   How do you know?
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.680]   We don't even see it yet.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:09:59.680]   Okay, you're right.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.680]   Oh, how much is the change?
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.680]   Okay.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:08.080]   Actually, isn't this right about when Apple would have released articles to, or, you know,
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.560]   sourced stories to the Wall Street Journal and other?
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:15.000]   This is typically what Apple would have done by now to kind of lower expectations to say,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.840]   you know, well, but we haven't seen that this year, have we?
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.600]   Have we seen those kind of?
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.920]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.480]   I mean, I think the big news here is obviously going to be that the camera on the larger phone
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.400]   and then the lock of the headphone jack, those are the two things that at least from what
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.320]   is leaked so far are going to be kind of the big moment.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.680]   So I think I'm really interested in seeing how they're going to sell and convince this
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.680]   whole headphone jack thing.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.160]   They're going to find a mink she quote, there is going to be a lightning ear pods bundled
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:49.520]   in and a connector, an adapter, a lightning, a 3.5 millimeter.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.880]   There was, there was a leak of a, it looks like a box that showed a couple of things.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.480]   They're going to be on 256 gigabyte size.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.680]   So at least on the larger phone, you can get a 256 gigabyte.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:05.120]   Some people have gone as far as to say in a, I've seen people say this in a couple of
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.320]   years, you'll wonder why they ever had a headphone jack.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:15.440]   I mean, I think if they can do wireless audio correctly and I don't know if now is actually
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.240]   the time, but I think that they can.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.640]   I think that that could be for most people.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.640]   I think that that might be accurate.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.280]   We've seen this big trend and honestly I do because I.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.280]   It's sloppy.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.280]   It's not.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.280]   I think that I do.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.280]   Sorry.
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:35.320]   Until we have, no, until we have good wireless charging for all these extra power sucking
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.120]   devices, I think it's a mistake.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.680]   I don't want to charge my headphones.
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:39.680]   I really don't.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:40.680]   Exactly.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.080]   And I have, I have all Bluetooth wireless stuff.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.920]   But first of all, think of children and one actually think of the children.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:46.920]   Think of the children.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:47.920]   Exactly.
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:48.920]   Think of the children.
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.600]   And then on, and then on top of that, I don't know if anybody's watching.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:57.160]   I've watched any kind of video, watch Netflix with a Bluetooth headset and tell me you're
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.480]   not watching a 1940s Chinese film.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.800]   Well, there's a newer Bluetooth spec.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:07.400]   I'm sure Stacey, you're up on this apt X that supposedly is even higher fidelity than
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.400]   a 2DP.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.920]   It's not the fidelity I worry so much about is the connectivity, which drops in.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.920]   And as you point out, battery life, battery life.
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:20.360]   Well, in addition to the newer Bluetooth spec, there's something called an FMI, which we're
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:25.560]   seeing from some other headphone makers, people like Dopler Labs who are making, you know,
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.080]   the here one wireless headphones, which will be out later this fall.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.080]   This is hearing aid technology and MFF.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.080]   Yeah, basically.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.720]   And that's though, they feel like they, because I talked to them, they basically said that
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.880]   they feel like they've completely nailed.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.920]   Near field magnetic induction.
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.560]   So that means it's a wireless charging wireless.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.480]   Well, I mean, that's for the sink issues.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.360]   For charging, I mean, that's that becomes a much more difficult kind of scenario.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.840]   Although if you can have, I mean, we've seen this with a lot of kind of the wireless buds
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.640]   that are out now where they have charging cases where you can pop them in a charging
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.000]   case for, you know, 15, 20 minutes.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   And if it happens, why is it?
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.800]   I have four charging cases right now.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:05.800]   And that's, that's not viable.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.720]   I have the Motorola hint.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.600]   So that's one way Motorola solved it.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.960]   So of course, a little thing in your ear doesn't going to have much battery life.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.880]   So they include a case that's a larger battery.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.440]   You charge the case.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.680]   And then that stays charged and gives you multiple charges on the little earpiece.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.720]   So you put your earbuds away in a case.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.720]   Right.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.720]   Let me ask you guys this though.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.720]   I mean, look, I agree.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.800]   I think that solving a problem that doesn't exist.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.880]   What's wrong with headphones?
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:29.880]   Yeah.
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:30.880]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.160]   But I guess to play devil's advocate because look, I came to terms with the fact that head
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.920]   bone jacket is going away like 10 months ago, like nine months ago, like as soon as the
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:42.160]   rumors really started kicking off like in January, I was like, okay, it's gone.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.320]   I've got to come to terms with this.
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.840]   Not because I'm okay with it, not because I feel like it's necessarily a good decision
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.520]   just because this is what the reality is going to be.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.720]   And I'm an iPhone user and my next phone will be an iPhone.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:55.360]   And so I need to get used to using dongles and deal with that.
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.360]   But let me ask you guys this.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:00.200]   I mean, they're going to be including these lightning ear pods in the box.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:04.480]   Since most people, most people do use the included headphones with their phone.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:09.720]   They don't use third party headphones even like I wonder if a lot of this is kind of
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:14.080]   overblown in terms of everybody freaking out about it when most people are just going
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.800]   to use the headphones that come with their phone to begin with.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.600]   And they're just going to continue to use the headphones that are there.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:25.720]   >> That sounds like a totally logical and reasonable explanation.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:30.640]   But then when you ask the real reality of life, how many times has a cable like this
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.680]   and a headphone set broken on you?
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.200]   And how long do these lightning crap cables from Apple?
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.120]   >> Because I'll tell you what, they don't last very long.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:43.520]   So now not only do I have to pay $30, $40 for new dongle within the earpiece that's already
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.200]   broken, I've got Apple headsets that I have for five years now that still work.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.200]   I've got dongles that don't last three months.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.440]   >> Stacey, did your kid, my kids came to me.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.240]   Do your kids, because your daughter come to you and say, I lost my headphones, can I
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.240]   have a new pair?
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:59.240]   And I have a drawer full of cheap normal headphones.
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.320]   >> Instead of my kid, it's me.
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.320]   >> It's you.
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.080]   >> I lose my headphones all the time.
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.080]   >> And it just worked.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:08.080]   >> But lightning headphones are not going to be cheap because you got to pay the Apple
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.680]   tax on it.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.440]   By the way, let's look at this NFMI.
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.960]   Is this your opinion, Christina, that this will also be part of this?
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.320]   >> I don't think it'll necessarily be part of this, but I do know that that's just a
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.640]   standard that people are using.
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.640]   >> Interesting.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:24.960]   >> Now the company that makes this free link has a totally patent encumbered, by the way.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.880]   You can only get it through free link.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:27.960]   >> I'm certainly not.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:31.600]   I'm not suggesting that's going to be something that Apple launches, but I know for a fact
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.360]   that other headphone makers are looking at it.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.760]   So I feel like Apple's making it a--
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.680]   >> So it's kind of a replacement for Bluetooth.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:43.240]   It's another form of pan, personal area network, that uses magnetic inductance, low power
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:49.040]   induct-- I just can see the-- there are already people who think Wi-Fi causes brain damage.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.120]   They're going to look at this and say, "You're going to shoot magnets through my head?"
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.880]   >> No, those people are wearing magnets.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:55.880]   It's okay.
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.360]   >> Oh, that's right.
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.920]   Just tell them it's good for their health.
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:08.400]   It's a secure wireless bubble around each user using a low power inductive antenna inside
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.920]   the bubble devices connect instantly outside.
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:12.920]   They're invisible.
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:17.800]   And FMI is the only technology that could be used where secure and reliable pan solutions
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.800]   are needed.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:23.000]   Apparently they use it in the armed forces on the battlefield, so your tactical headset
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.440]   can't be broken into.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.280]   >> What is the distance on that?
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.800]   >> It's fairly small from what I understand.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:38.320]   But it'd be enough for if you've got your head-- I think it's probably 10 or 11 feet.
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.320]   I'm not really sure.
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.160]   >> And the radio has to be in the headset and in the phone?
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.360]   >> No, it just has to be in the headset.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.000]   >> Wow.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   This is really interesting.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.680]   >> Because I know a company that's already working on a product that'll be out this fall
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.040]   that will use this.
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.640]   And I was talking to them the other day.
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:01.280]   And so I feel like whether Apple uses something like that or not, who knows?
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:07.000]   But I feel like what's at least exciting about this, even if you think that this is a worthless
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.680]   exercise, it's stupid for them to get rid of the jack.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.160]   And that's a valid thing to say.
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.600]   But I think even if you accept that, the fact that they are getting rid of the jack is going
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.800]   to force, I think, whether it's Bluetooth or Ren FMI or any of these other things, it's
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.640]   going to force people to start taking wireless seriously.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.400]   And we haven't had a lot of advancement in wireless technology when it comes to headphones
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.840]   in the last 10 years or so.
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.640]   It really hasn't improved.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:34.600]   >> Wouldn't that be interesting if Apple used this as an opportunity?
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:39.480]   Because I agree with you, the rhetoric that Apple uses on Wednesday will be fascinating
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.480]   to watch.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:45.960]   If they do remove the headphone jack, they're going to have to have a story, a compelling
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.960]   story.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:47.960]   Why?
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:53.400]   >> Well, the advancement of things, again, that sounds great because, again, when I use
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:57.360]   headphones, I can't watch video or the audio just isn't as clear.
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.640]   When you plug in the physical line, you can just feel and hear the difference.
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:06.080]   So if we're going to make great advancements at the push of Apple with their iron fist,
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.080]   then that's great.
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.600]   If that turns out to be the case, giving me one more thing to charge.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:15.520]   >> But we've always been at one more thing to charge.
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:19.960]   We've been steadily going, being conditioned to lower quality, lower resolution on all
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:20.960]   audio.
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.160]   I mean, think landline to cell phone, think about arm.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.880]   >> I hate streaming music.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.880]   >> Streaming, yeah.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.040]   >> It's unnecessary.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:34.960]   >> So this may just be another departure from not five nines because it's not reliability.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.440]   It's just quality.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.440]   >> Quality.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:42.800]   >> I mean, there are a lot of people, Neil Diamond.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.800]   Neil Young.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.560]   Maybe Neil Diamond, for that matter.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:50.320]   Neil Young, who thinks that it's a terrible thing that musicians are making music that
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:55.520]   there's a whole generation can't even hear because they're listening on crappy earbuds.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.520]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.000]   >> Apple might make the case.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.200]   Apple loves music, right?
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.200]   Maybe they'll make the case.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.200]   >> Well, those earbuds aren't good.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.760]   We're going to make you really good headphones and we can do it better.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:08.520]   >> Well, that's going to cost so much money.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.480]   And you lose those all the time.
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.320]   I mean, I can see why Apple hates wires.
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.320]   I totally can't.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.320]   I mean, they're clunk-y.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.320]   >> They hate buttons.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.320]   They hate wires.
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.320]   >> Yes.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:22.320]   >> They want, they would love it if they had a glass slab with no controls, nothing.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.560]   >> That would be the perfect thing, right?
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:25.560]   No interface, nothing.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:27.560]   >> Just a bar of soap.
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:28.560]   >> A bar of soap.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.560]   >> A helicopter.
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.560]   >> That's exactly it.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.360]   You get a chip in your head and you interact with your phone.
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:37.320]   >> Hey, where is, by the way, where is Johnny I these days?
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.440]   I have, you don't see him or hear him or anything.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.640]   Is he on vacation for the last three years?
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.080]   What's going on with Johnny Ives?
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.720]   >> He's doing the new MacBooks.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.560]   >> He's got to be doing something, right?
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.920]   >> Maybe he's in Ireland hanging out with that tax shelter.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:54.320]   >> He seems like he's just disappeared.
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.320]   Will we see?
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.600]   All right, here's your bingo card.
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.600]   You got to do a bingo card with an Apple event.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.120]   Will there be a Johnny Ives sighting on Wednesday?
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.560]   >> Yeah, I think so.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.560]   >> Will there be a Johnny Ives white room video on Wednesday?
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.200]   >> Say, will we hear aluminium?
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.200]   That's really the question.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.800]   >> That is the big question.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:15.440]   When I interviewed him last year, I actually made him say I didn't make him.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.840]   I requested- >> Johnny, what is this phone made of, Johnny?
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.840]   >> No, but I very politely said, I was like, can you just say aluminium for me once?
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:28.680]   And he did, but I think that was much the sugar in everyone else in the room.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.520]   I think they were like, you really just asked.
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.160]   >> Christina, you are so crass.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:36.280]   >> A bit of what I mean, but this is the only opportunity I'm ever going to have in my
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.720]   higher life, ask him.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.080]   >> Johnny, what are these phones made out of Johnny?
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:44.760]   >> Aluminium, Christina, I told you four times already.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:45.760]   >> Price of aluminium.
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.760]   >> You probably said it asleep at this point.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:49.760]   >> Aluminium.
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:54.920]   >> No, I bet we see him and I bet there is a video, especially if they're showing off
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.240]   the new camera system.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:02.200]   >> Yeah, is he the guy who tells the story of the missing headphone jack?
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.200]   >> I don't know.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.200]   >> It's not feel shiller.
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.200]   I don't trust feel shiller.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.200]   >> Not feel shiller.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.680]   >> They have to get some sort of audio expert, somebody on there.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.680]   I'm with you guys.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:14.440]   I almost wonder if they are going to, they're not going to be as crazy about it as no young,
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.680]   but maybe if they are going to make it.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:16.840]   >> I'm Todd Rungren.
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.240]   You may remember me.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.240]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.240]   >> Right?
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.720]   The thing is, no matter what they say, it's a lie.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.320]   It is not better to have wireless sound.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.320]   >> Right.
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.320]   >> It is to have wired sound.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:33.640]   So the spin move on that is something only Apple can do in a turtleneck, a white room environment
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:38.200]   to try and trick people and mesmerize them into thinking that something's real when it's
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.200]   not.
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.000]   >> They'll get Bono to tell the story.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   >> Bono.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   >> That's awesome.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   >> Great.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.600]   I can't hear anything, but if I could, I wouldn't use a headphone jack.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.080]   >> And then everybody will get a free album that didn't want again.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:56.400]   >> Touch me, Tim, touch me.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.400]   Taylor Swift.
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.400]   >> Taylor Swift.
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.400]   >> Taylor Swift.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.400]   She's still got good hearing.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.400]   Taylor Swift.
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.400]   Hi.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.400]   >> You got 30 things on here.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.000]   We got 30 things on here besides this.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   >> I know.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   It's boring.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   I'm going to drop it.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   We're going to move on.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   But I'm just saying, maybe it's me.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.680]   Maybe I've finally hit it because I've seen this happen with many of the tech journalists
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.120]   I've worked with over the years.
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:17.000]   You get to a point where you just stop caring.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.040]   And I just, I feel so, maybe I'm just jaded, but I just, this is not an, I'm not going
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.040]   to buy this iPhone.
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.680]   I don't, I think- >> Come on.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:27.120]   Of course you are.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.120]   You know you are.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.120]   >> I'm not saying.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.120]   >> That's such a lie.
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.120]   >> Why?
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.120]   >> That's a lie.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.120]   >> You're definitely going to buy one.
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.120]   >> I'm not saying.
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.240]   If you buy it and want to get rid of it, just send it to me and I'll take it.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.240]   But don't tell me you're not going to buy it.
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.600]   >> You know what I did get rid of.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:42.640]   >> My Galaxy Note 7 will tell that tale in a moment.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.840]   >> Before blew up.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:47.080]   Well- >> Would you plug it in after reading all that?
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.040]   >> I surely would.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:53.240]   Not only would I plug it in, I'd plug it in 24/7, 365 caratine.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.400]   >> Hoping it blew up.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.280]   >> And hope the jibberty Christmas, my pocket went a smolder.
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.280]   And I'll tell you what.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:02.160]   >> I did kind of admit, I kind of wanted flames to leap out of it.
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.960]   It'd be a stone song by the time I'm done with them.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.520]   >> Obscure tech journalist, podcaster, phone explodes.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.520]   No one cares.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:15.360]   >> Oh, so much Karen, I got a lawyer for that.
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.360]   It burns, it burns.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.720]   All right, we'll talk about that.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.280]   But first let's talk about Squarespace.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:22.080]   The place to make your next website.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.040]   I was talking to somebody the other day.
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.720]   Actually, it was on the radio show who has a different hosting company.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.720]   I won't name names.
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.720]   I don't want to shame anybody.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.720]   He said, "I don't understand.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.240]   I updated my Chrome and my site looks different.
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.120]   The menu instead of going this way goes sideways."
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.000]   I said, "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.560]   This is, I don't know why that happened, but let me tell you, it wouldn't happen with
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:42.720]   the Squarespace site.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:48.720]   You want to have, first of all, if you're going to have a website and you should, every company,
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:54.760]   every individual, it's your best way to control your image, your presence on the web is to
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:55.840]   have your own website.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:56.840]   And you've got something to say.
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.400]   You've got a unique point of view.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:03.440]   You need somewhere to put it and putting it on Facebook with all due respect or Twitter,
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.600]   that's not enough.
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.600]   That's not your page.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.600]   That's the AirPage.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:07.600]   That's Mark's page.
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:09.240]   Put it on your page.
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.920]   So you want a web host that's going to give you a great looking page that reflects your
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:19.880]   aesthetic, that lets you do your stuff, whatever it is, whether it's selling candles or writing
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:23.840]   about paint colors or whatever you love.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.720]   And it doesn't in a way that is, that you feel good about it.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.720]   And that's Squarespace.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.400]   By the way, extremely affordable.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.080]   Every site looks professionally designed.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.320]   You could do it yourself, by the way.
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:40.200]   If you are a CSS, JavaScript, HTML, Guru, a lot of people use Squarespace like that too,
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:44.360]   because you can start with a blank template that gives you all the under the covers engineering,
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.840]   but you get to design it exactly the way you want.
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:50.400]   They've got templates for everything, some brand new magazine style templates, including
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:54.160]   interactive features like grid style landing pages.
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:25:00.200]   You see these on all the big online magazines, infinite scroll, that's all the rage now,
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.200]   right?
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:05.280]   You got related posts so people can explore more author profiles.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:10.120]   And all this comes with a basic account on squarespace.com.
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.120]   You can try it free.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.240]   I want you to do that right now if you go to squarespace.com.
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.800]   Just press the get started button, pick a template.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:20.600]   Oh, one of the nice things is you're not, you know, your template and your content are
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.920]   completely separate as they ought to be.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:27.040]   So if you say, I don't know, let me try a different one.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.920]   Your template can change with your mood.
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:32.440]   Every one of them though, mobile responsive so you don't have a separate mobile site,
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.280]   your site looks great on every size screen.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:40.520]   When you upload images behind the scenes, the Squarespace software automatically creates
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:44.760]   nine different sizes so that they have an image to fit the screen.
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:47.200]   It's on.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:51.120]   They have e-commerce on every site so you can always sell something.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:56.000]   And by the way, it's the only e-commerce that where your store matches the rest of your
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   site.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   It matches your aesthetic.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.160]   That's really nice.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.240]   They now do domain names.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.040]   So you don't even have to go to a separate registrar.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.960]   That makes it very easy to get a custom domain.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.000]   In fact, you've always gotten a free one with an annual purchase, but now you can purchase
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.440]   directly from squarespace domains.
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.680]   Register your domain.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.440]   And unlike a lot of these other places, they'll give you a parking page that's clean, that's
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:19.680]   spam free, that's gorgeous so that you have time to start building.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.040]   It's never been easier to sell online.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.800]   Power your business with Squarespace Commerce.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.880]   They just introduced analytics for commerce, which is really helpful.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.720]   You can see the traffic in real time.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.680]   That's kind of fun to put that up on the wall at your office.
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:39.920]   You can see when people abandon your checkout, that's important to know.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.600]   Device filtering, how are they coming to your site?
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.880]   And there are people who do this for a living.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:50.600]   In fact, when Lisa wanted to create a site for her new agency, she said, "Would you do
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.600]   it?"
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.600]   I said, "No."
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:57.240]   But Squarespace has these great people who work independently, but use Squarespace as
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.240]   their platform.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:03.440]   And she found somebody did it for a very reasonable price, did a wonderful site for her.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:07.640]   That's Artisanallagency.com, if you want to take a look at it.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.640]   Well, that's another nice thing.
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.520]   You could all go there at once and it wouldn't bring it down.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.120]   Squarespace sites just never go down.
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:15.560]   Anybody who's built or contributes to three or more active websites gets access to something
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.560]   new.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.680]   This is the Squarespace Circle.
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:23.720]   It includes advanced guides, optimized support, and six-month trial periods for new projects.
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.080]   That's nice.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:29.840]   A million customers and growing and still going strong, and yes, they still can.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.240]   They never go down.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.240]   Squarespace.com.
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:37.320]   There's only one thing I'd ask if you decide to set up a Squarespace site for free, if
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:42.400]   you decide to buy after you play with it for a while, use our offer code TWIT.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:46.720]   That way they know you heard about it here, because I know Squarespace has ads everywhere
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.120]   now, right?
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:52.800]   Even the Super Bowl, but you'll also get 10% off as a thank you.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:53.800]   So there you go.
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:54.800]   Squarespace.com.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.600]   Don't forget the offer code.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:57.600]   TWIT.
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.600]   We're talking tech.
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:27:59.600]   Three fun people.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.680]   Stacey Higginbotham.
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.920]   Just love having her on this week in Google every week.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:07.680]   She does a podcast with Kevin Tofel on Internet of Things.
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:10.960]   She just came back from the Intel Developers Forum.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:15.360]   She really is keeping up on this very interesting space.
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:20.000]   Nice to have you, Stacey, from Austin, Texas.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.720]   And also with us from her brand new job at Gizmodo, senior writer at Gizmodo, Film Girls
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:26.720]   here, Christina Warren.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:27.720]   Hi, Christina.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.720]   Hello.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.720]   Always a pleasure.
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.480]   And oh, Dr. Owen, JJ Stone.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.160]   I was just on your podcast.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.160]   What's that?
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.720]   And I should be on a beach, but I'm stuck here with you.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.720]   Lave on away.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.200]   Hey, on my labor day, we did that.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:43.240]   Is that the sunscreen where you squirted on and it's purple?
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.760]   I love this stuff.
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:45.760]   This is for the kids.
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.040]   I don't know what happens when you squirt it.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.600]   And then you know, because you put it purple and then you rub it in it disappears, but
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.600]   you know, I don't.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.200]   I don't use sunscreen.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.360]   So I've never had the pleasure of doing that.
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:57.920]   Can I ask you a personal question?
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:59.520]   Sure you can.
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:03.920]   Do you need to people, African Americans need sunscreen?
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.960]   And sadly, I've never burned in my life.
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.720]   I've never had the pleasure of my skin flaking and peeling.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.720]   You're protected.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:13.120]   And so I got some built in natural stuff that works out pretty well.
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:16.840]   Like it I have to sit on the side for like 10 hours to get even get a tan.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:20.400]   It strikes me you should still wear sunscreen because of skin cancer.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.880]   People say that, but I just, a lot of my family members that when I was younger, they're like,
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:27.600]   I never wore it and people lived and died of other things, but nobody's dying of skin
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.600]   cancer.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.600]   Okay.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.600]   It's one less thing for me to do on the beach.
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:31.600]   That's awesome.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:32.600]   Nice.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.800]   What's the name of your podcast?
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:35.800]   And when am I going?
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.600]   When is my episode going to appear?
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.840]   Oh, it's doc tales.
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:39.840]   I put it up the other day.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:40.840]   I didn't tweet it out.
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:41.840]   I just tweeted it out.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:42.840]   Tweet it out, man.
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:43.840]   I got it.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:44.840]   I did.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.000]   The title is 500 pounds of cheese.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Mm hmm.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.640]   Because we randomly had a conversation about cheese.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:55.920]   We had what they euphemistically call a wide ranging conversation.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:59.720]   Oh, and I found an interview we did together from like 2010.
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.920]   I put that up as a bonus.
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.960]   Also the people go and listen to the lineage of this board.
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:05.960]   What's my voice?
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.360]   Hire back then.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.360]   You looked a little younger.
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:09.360]   You're a little bit more spry.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.040]   It was back when you're still in the cottage.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.040]   Spry.
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.400]   You were still in the cottage.
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:14.400]   Anybody seen me move?
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.440]   No, that's spry is not the word.
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.640]   Maybe whizzened.
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.200]   Uh, creaky.
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.560]   Creaky sounds good.
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:22.560]   Yeah.
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.560]   Doc tales.
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:24.560]   Where would we, where would we find that?
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:25.560]   Iqomz.com is sitting up there.
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.560]   I'm Twitter.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.560]   I saw my Facebook.
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:28.560]   MZ.com.
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.200]   Four letters.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:34.800]   I quit my zebra.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:35.800]   Zombie.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:36.800]   Zombie.
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:49.360]   So I got an email from T-Mobile saying stop charging your Samsung Note 7 because it could
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.360]   blow up.
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:54.120]   35 people have, phones have blown up.
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.160]   Now that's not a lot when you sell more than a million.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.880]   No, but it is.
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.200]   No, actually it is.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:04.000]   When you look at like whatever like Six Sigma or like whatever the things are for these
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.880]   things, I actually think that 35 reported cases is significant.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:11.480]   iPhones had a problem once, but they didn't have anywhere near that number, right?
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:16.720]   No, and in those cases it was, I think proven to be the unofficial cables.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:17.720]   Right.
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:22.480]   Uh, in this case, Samsung's taking a one and a half billion, what we think it'll be a one
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:26.960]   and a half billion dollar write off because they've sold more than a million of them.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.520]   How many do we know?
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:29.520]   A lot.
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.520]   I bought one.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.520]   A lot.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.200]   My parents both bought one.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.600]   I, and I feel bad.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:35.600]   Great phone.
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:36.760]   Yeah, I've been recommending it.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:37.760]   Right?
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:38.760]   I've been telling everybody this is the phone.
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:42.040]   If you're going to get an Android device, this is my current favorite.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:45.120]   Um, so you stop using it?
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:47.520]   Yeah, never had any problems with it.
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:49.200]   You know, I charge it fast charging.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.720]   I normally charge it on a wireless, slow wireless charger overnight.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:53.720]   So, can I borrow?
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.520]   I don't mind running on a dice.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:56.880]   No, it doesn't get hot.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:57.880]   Okay, that's good.
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:01.960]   Because we were getting, because after I wrote the initial story that they were like delaying
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:06.040]   production this before the recall, I got a number of emails from people saying that
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.880]   theirs was getting like very hot to the touch.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.440]   And so, and again, I mean, I think that is probably.
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.680]   That's a bad sign, right?
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.960]   And so I think, yeah, it is.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.040]   And so, you know, I don't know how widespread this is.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:21.720]   I think it could be probably, I think it's probably was maybe one, a couple of batches
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:26.600]   probably down to one supplier if they were to really go back and see is probably one supplier.
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:30.560]   Yeah, because they're not doing this in China and they say, well, it's a different battery.
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:35.360]   So, you know, we know what this is caused by lithium ion batteries are, you know, anything
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:40.120]   that contains a lot of energy is always, could be potentially dangerous, whether it's gasoline
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:41.360]   or batteries.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.840]   In the case of lithium ion batteries, if you overcharge them, and this is true, by the
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:50.320]   way, of other batteries to if you overcharge them, they can swell up, they can heat up,
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:54.240]   and in fact, they can get so hot, they can burn.
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:58.880]   And if they swell even more while they're burning, they can explode.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.920]   And really, it's like napalm.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:04.160]   I mean, apparently it could get on your skin and it costs severe burns.
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.600]   It's not a good thing.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:09.400]   I'm not trying to detract from 35 because I feel like 35 is a large number.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:12.800]   But at the same time, also, you know, people get a paranoia in their mind of when they
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:13.880]   think something's hot.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:18.440]   My iPhone sets a blaze when I talk on it for more than 20 minutes.
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.440]   Most modern.
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.440]   That's true.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.440]   That's true.
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.720]   I mean, when you think to yourself, like, is it hot to the touch?
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:27.880]   Like, every phone when you talk on it or do anything on it, for more than 10 minutes,
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:28.880]   it gets hot.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.040]   Like, literally, like, if you put it to your face, you can feel it.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.400]   Hot while it's working is a different kind of hot.
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:37.680]   That's the process of getting hot versus hot while it's not working, but simply charging.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.600]   That means the battery's getting hot.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:40.600]   True story.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.840]   Okay, well, my phone actually gets hot while charging.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:47.240]   It's the Nexus 5X, so it's got the rapid charging.
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:51.120]   And I noticed that when it charges, it does get hotter than my previous phones.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:54.520]   Rapid charging, I think, is widely agreed not to be a good idea.
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:55.520]   That's hard on batteries.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.640]   In fact, we had a battery expert here.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.160]   He talked a lot after the show last week.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.600]   He's a researcher.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:06.120]   He said, "He is the enemy for lithium ion.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.320]   It reduces the life."
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:10.320]   He told me, and I should tell you, Stacey, because you also drive a Tesla, "Don't park
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.360]   your Tesla in the sun, park it in the shade."
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.880]   Dude, I am so screwed.
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:14.880]   I live in Austin.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:15.880]   I know.
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:16.880]   I know.
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:19.040]   But he said, "The phone manufacturers know all this.
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.800]   They know quick charging heats up."
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.640]   Tesla says, "Don't use the supercharger too much.
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:24.640]   Same reason.
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:26.800]   It'll lower the life of your battery."
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:30.040]   But phone companies go, "You're only going to have that phone for a couple of years.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:34.200]   It's never intended to be owned for longer, so we don't really care for reducing battery
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:35.200]   life."
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:37.080]   It's far more important that we have quick charging.
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:40.440]   Do you know what I do with my phone in the car?
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:44.640]   I stick it in the air-conditioned event, face down so the sun's not beating on it, and it
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:45.640]   stays cool as a crisp.
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:47.040]   Because I'm usually streaming stuff.
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:50.160]   I got movie streaming and all kinds of stuff to download my music.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:51.160]   So it gets really hot.
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:54.480]   So I put it in an event, and it stays cool as a cucumber, and it stays happy.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.960]   I don't have to restart it as much, because I'm always...
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:02.680]   I use 30, 40 gigs a day that month, so I'm always killing this phone.
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.320]   Christina, did Samsung go far enough?
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:06.520]   Did they do the right thing?
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.000]   Yeah, I definitely think so.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.560]   Look, they sort of seen the problem is existing.
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:17.440]   They immediately stopped shipments, then they did an investigation and realized, "Okay,
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:21.520]   this is maybe more widespread than we thought," and are doing the full recall, working with
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.240]   the carriers, doing the exchanges.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:27.120]   Yeah, they're absolutely treating this the way that it needs to be treated, which is,
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.720]   look, at least so far, it hasn't been...
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.360]   No one's been seriously hurt or anything, and that's a very good thing.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.360]   Do we know how...
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:38.200]   I mean, I've seen some pictures, but do we know people who have had the phone burn?
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.700]   No, I...
[00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.440]   So far, I don't believe we've seen any of those.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:42.440]   We've just seen...
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:45.760]   And all the photos have been from Asia, at least that I've seen and haven't seen any
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.520]   reported cases in the United States.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.080]   But that doesn't mean that people haven't been hurt, but at least so far, it looks like
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:51.680]   no one has, which is a very good thing.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:56.080]   No, I think they've handled this the exact way they needed to handle it.
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:57.080]   And by basic...
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:03.080]   I mean, you can't force people to come in and do a one-to-one swap, but by making it
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.400]   as easy as possible.
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:08.040]   And by the fact that the carriers are sending out the emails, that's huge.
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:11.200]   Here's the email I got from T-Mobile.
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:15.840]   Samsung notified us today they were calling Galaxy Note 7 due to battery safety concern.
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:20.680]   I don't know who wrote this, but there have been 35 cases reported globally as of September
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:21.680]   1st.
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:22.680]   Samsung has communicated to us.
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:26.080]   They will have replacement Note 7 devices that should be available in the next two to
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:27.080]   four weeks.
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:28.880]   Okay, that's a problem right there.
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:31.960]   As a customer, your safety is a number one priority.
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:35.480]   We're making it easier for you to return an exchange of Galaxy Note 7 free of charge.
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.120]   Sign up, we'll let you know.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.120]   This is one option.
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:40.840]   By the way, Consumer Reports says this is a terrible option.
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:43.000]   Sign up and we'll let you know when the new phone's available.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.720]   In other words, keep using it.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:46.920]   Or switch to a new device.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:47.920]   Samsung and...
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.560]   Well, at least T-Mobile says, and I imagine all the carriers will have something you
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.200]   can use until the new phone comes.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.040]   Or return the phone for a full refund.
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.040]   That's what Samsung's saying is we will buy back every one of them.
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.880]   We don't care where you got it.
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:02.000]   If you don't want it, we will buy it back.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.400]   But the problem is if it's your only phone, no one wants to be without a phone for two
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.400]   to four weeks.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.400]   Right.
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.400]   Right.
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:13.480]   I mean, that puts them in a weird, quiet wire position, which I think is why a lot of the
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:16.840]   carriers are saying, "Look, you can swap it out for a different phone and then when we
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:20.160]   get them in stock, swap it back out again."
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:26.040]   Or some of the retailers are saying that they'll have new stock next week.
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:29.040]   I think it just depends on the person how comfortable you are keeping it and for how
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.040]   long.
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:35.760]   But I mean, if you're really concerned, there are going to be alternatives that you can
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:40.680]   do and you can always just swap it out with your carrier and say, "Hey, I need...
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:44.240]   Now that you have the Galaxy Note 7 in stock, I want to go back and get that again."
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:49.000]   Consumer Reports says Samsung hasn't gone far enough because this is not an official
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   recall.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:56.360]   For an official recall, they would go to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the CPSC,
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.760]   and declare an official recall.
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:04.120]   At that point, it would be illegal to sell the Note 7 in the United States.
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:09.560]   According to Consumer Reports, some retailers are still selling the phone as late as Friday.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:16.480]   So Samsung has not gone to the full length that they should, if at least according to
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:23.760]   Consumer Reports, they ought to.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:27.320]   They might have found out some information about where the batch that they came from
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:31.840]   and feel confident that it's not going to continue to happen and be a continued issue
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:32.840]   possibly.
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.960]   Here's an image of a...
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:38.360]   This is from China, a young one, Chin.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.360]   That is not pretty.
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.360]   No, it's not.
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:43.720]   That is a nasty burn right there.
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:48.680]   And that's by the way, right where the battery is, as I remember, it's a long battery.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:52.240]   And that's about where it would be on the left side of the phone as you're looking at
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:54.480]   it from the front.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.080]   You wouldn't want that to happen in your house.
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:58.280]   That's why Samsung's taking this seriously.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.440]   35 phones is enough to say.
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:01.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:06.120]   And I do have to say, consumer reports might have a point in that maybe they should do
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.840]   an official recall and make it illegal to sell it or whatever.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:11.240]   But I also have to think that they're working with all the retailers.
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:16.560]   They're working with all the carriers.
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:21.240]   Maybe other than maybe some webplaces, I can't imagine any plays after Friday.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:24.960]   I can't imagine any plays continuing to sell the phone just for their own liability reasons.
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:28.640]   By the way, according to the New York Times, it's two and a half million, note seven.
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:29.640]   Two and a half million.
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:30.640]   Wow.
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:31.640]   That's a lot.
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:32.640]   It's a lot of phones.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:33.640]   All right.
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.640]   Well, I guess we've said enough.
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.960]   I mean, if you have a note seven, I think you shouldn't take the chance.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:43.640]   I think you should probably trade it in.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.920]   I'm in the good position of having a lot of things I could use instead.
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:49.560]   So it's not like I'm going to be phoneless.
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.880]   But I am going to be out of the country when I would get, if it's two weeks, I won't be
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:53.880]   here.
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:54.880]   So you know what?
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.280]   I'm going to just ask for my money back.
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:00.320]   I liked the phone, but I don't know.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:04.760]   I hear there's new phones coming from other companies.
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:07.280]   Are they all going to be waterproof?
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.280]   They're all going to be dust-proof?
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.560]   I know Apple will never do that.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:13.360]   Will Little Wayne give back his champagne soaked?
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.600]   No, that's a question.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.600]   No.
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:17.600]   Never.
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:18.600]   All right.
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:22.160]   Well, I think actually, Samsung, I can't remember anybody.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.160]   Apple's never done this.
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:27.360]   I can't remember anybody doing a recall of this magnitude for a smart.
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.000]   Not since the not in smartphones.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.360]   I mean, we had the Sony laptop battery recall.
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.360]   Right.
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:33.360]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:34.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.360]   Same reason.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:36.360]   Same reason.
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:37.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:39.360]   The laptop battery.
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.360]   The Dell laptop, the Sony laptops.
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:45.200]   The Dell was more like it would swell and torque and bend.
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.680]   Although I presume that's the beginning of something bad.
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:48.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:49.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.440]   You don't want to overcharge lithium-ion batteries.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.440]   So, yeah.
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:53.440]   The way Apple--
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:58.400]   The way people act about Ben Gate, I would venture just to see if this were Apple how
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.920]   people would lose their minds.
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:00.920]   Right.
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:01.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:02.920]   I mean, I feel like this is a very--
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:03.920]   I think Apple would do the same thing.
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:04.920]   Do you think?
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:05.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:06.920]   Oh, definitely.
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:10.320]   I'm talking about the wave of people that was stormed down.
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:11.320]   The gates upon Apple.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.320]   The way they do about everything.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.320]   My phone bent.
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:16.320]   They don't know what they're doing.
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.320]   Right.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.320]   Like, the rage.
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.320]   Like, everybody's like, "Okay, Samsung, you made a mistake.
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.320]   All right, you're on top of it.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.320]   Okay, cool.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:22.320]   We'll let it go."
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.320]   The example is getting a free pest.
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.480]   No, they're getting a free pest because they did the right thing and they did it quickly.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:29.720]   And no one was hurt and they responded exactly appropriately.
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:33.040]   Even though, I think they're going to take a big hit on this.
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.040]   The timing could be worse.
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.040]   The timing is terrible.
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:37.040]   The timing is--
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.040]   Especially how popular this game was.
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.280]   Your parents might end up getting an iPhone, Stacey.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:42.800]   Okay, my mom will never get an iPhone.
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:43.800]   But--
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.600]   I love your mom.
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:46.600]   She's not going to go there.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.680]   She's an iPhone hater?
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:49.840]   She's not a hater.
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.240]   She's just-- they frustrate her.
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.240]   Really?
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:55.680]   And Android does not.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:58.560]   I don't-- yes, it doesn't frustrate her.
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:59.920]   She likes it.
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:02.080]   She's-- yeah, not an iPhone person.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:06.000]   Although the increasing size of all the androids for a while, really upset her.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.600]   But now she's like, with this one, she was like, "Holy cow.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:10.600]   It's beautiful.
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:11.760]   I can finally see my screen."
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:12.840]   That's one of the things I like about this.
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:16.320]   This is a big phone with such small bezels that it doesn't feel like a big phone.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:21.960]   It feels like a normal-sized phone with a giant screen somehow magically.
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:26.760]   And she loves the magnifying thing and then the tuning thing, which made me feel like,
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:27.760]   dang it, guys.
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.400]   We got to put more stuff on this design for older people.
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.760]   You're talking about the adapt sound that we mentioned on Twig.
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:34.760]   Yeah.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.240]   I think a lot of people didn't know that Samsung does this.
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:38.640]   It buries it way deep in the settings.
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:42.840]   But you can actually do a hearing test on the phone with your earbuds in and then have the
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:50.160]   phone take the results of that and create an equalization curve tuned to your individual
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:51.160]   ears.
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:52.160]   That's awesome.
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.480]   It produces a very good result.
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:55.680]   I do that with every Samsung phone I get.
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:59.360]   I don't know when they started S6 maybe, but I love it.
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:00.360]   It's called adapt sound.
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:03.800]   It's in your sound settings.
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.840]   And they have a headphone jack, as they said.
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:06.840]   Yeah.
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:07.960]   It's the announcement.
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.840]   We have a headphone jack.
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:12.480]   It's not the first Apple's not the first company to abandon the headphone jack.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:15.440]   The Moto Z does not have a headphone jack.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.440]   Although that's not even out.
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:19.480]   I mean, I don't know when that's going to be widely available.
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:23.880]   Do you think Apple would ever go back on the headphone jack if like no one else adopts
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:24.880]   it?
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.880]   No, here's a question.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:30.840]   No, they have two phones, one with and one without.
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:34.280]   No, no, well, they will still sell the S E.
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.760]   So you will still have a headphone jack.
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:36.760]   S E will still have it.
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:40.960]   But no, I mean, I think that and they're still going to sell I presume just like they haven't
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:45.120]   past years the success and the success plus those still sell those for less money.
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.600]   So you'll still be able to buy a phone with a headphone jack.
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.200]   But if you want all the fancy, you know, new hotness.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.200]   I buy it.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.840]   Going forward, going forward, they will not go back.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:56.960]   They're definitively like define on things.
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:00.800]   When they say A is A, it's always going to be A from here on out.
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.440]   Yeah, only time I can ever.
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:09.160]   Even when it's a mistake, they just force through it and then they make it the standard.
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:15.440]   The only time I can ever remember them going back ever was with Firewire on one of the
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:16.440]   Macs.
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:21.240]   So when they released the first Unibody MacBook Pro, they also released a Unibody MacBook
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:22.640]   at the same time.
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:28.240]   And the Unibody MacBook, this was like the successor to the plastic MacBook, did not
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:32.440]   have a Firewire report on it and people freaked.
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:33.760]   I was one of the people who freaked.
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:37.200]   I remember I was writing for TUAW at the time, RIP.
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.680]   And I was like, this is insane.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:45.880]   And within a year, within probably like six months actually, they re-released that laptop,
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:51.640]   renamed it the 13 inch MacBook Pro, Unibody MacBook Pro and put a Firewire report on it.
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:56.040]   But that's the only time I can ever recall in like recent Apple history of them going
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.040]   back on something.
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:03.280]   Tim Cook, that really good Washington Post interview, he did admit to having made mistakes.
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:06.120]   He said the Apple Maps fiasco for instance.
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:07.480]   But we made a mistake there.
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:10.800]   They didn't recall it or anything, but they worked very hard to make it up, make it work
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:11.800]   better.
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.080]   Someone in the job said.
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:15.640]   There's no new Coke moment for Apple.
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:18.880]   Someone in the job said, we will never have a pencil.
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:19.880]   Stylist.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:20.880]   Stylist.
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:21.880]   Stylist.
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:25.360]   No, but, but, but that's jobs not being around.
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:28.400]   And it was jobs talking about a phone, not a tablet.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.400]   Right.
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.400]   Totally.
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:36.280]   And the Apple pencil is different, definitively different than the typical source of stylists
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:37.840]   that you were seeing at the time.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:40.360]   Like, it is different.
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:47.520]   It's a sort of device that even other stylists that we were seeing for, like iPads and stuff.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:50.480]   It's a different sort of tool.
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:51.480]   But yeah.
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:54.520]   And it's not the primary input mechanism.
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:57.200]   You can still touch as your primary input mechanism.
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:01.280]   If you're going to use the Apple pencil, that's because you need precision for certain stuff.
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:06.040]   It's not as if it's not like a palm trio, which is, you know, who had a stylist.
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:10.320]   That's who he was referencing or the Windows mobile devices, which use Styli, where you
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:15.880]   had to touch their terrible, non-capacitive touch screens, you know, to get stuff done.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:22.360]   And it sure was fun to play like bubble, bubble, but it was a terrible user experience.
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:24.040]   Oh, yeah. I had what was that?
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:29.140]   It was a palm device that had a stylist on it.
[00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:31.040]   And I played a lot of bedazzled on it.
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:32.840]   Actually, that's what it's all.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:36.040]   Oh, but you'll was great on the trio.
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:39.840]   What was that was the was the, oh, it was the Clio.
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.240]   Remember the Clio was Sony?
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:43.160]   It was Sony palm device.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:45.320]   It was awesome device.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:47.600]   Except that I let it to somebody.
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:52.120]   I got it back and she apparently played a lot of the jewel because there was a scratched,
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:53.120]   like grid.
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.120]   Wow.
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:59.800]   On the phone, she played it so much with the stylists that it was like, there was a grid
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:03.120]   of her going because Bajoule, you slide and wow.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:06.000]   So that's aggressive.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.200]   That's an aggressive Bajoule player.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.200]   Serious business.
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:10.200]   Mm hmm.
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:11.200]   Never say never.
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:17.120]   I don't think the modern Apple, I don't think Tim Cook is so adamant that he'd say,
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:21.920]   we will never surrender, never give up forward only if they made a horrible mistake with
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:23.560]   the headphone jack.
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:27.200]   I could see him backing down.
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:29.440]   No.
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:30.440]   No.
[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:33.200]   We all can't even think about it.
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:35.360]   Like it's not even like some of you can envision.
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:38.680]   We all just say here in our eyes going like this, like, it's possible.
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:44.040]   No, I think what's a lot more likely and I think is that Apple does this and then you
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.040]   see how many other companies.
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:48.320]   I mean, look, as you said, they're not the first company to not have the headphones.
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:49.320]   Everybody will copy it.
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:50.320]   Absolutely.
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:51.320]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:57.120]   Lave sheeples that will just go, whatever you say, Apple lemmings off the cliff and it
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:01.000]   will be a mistake in every respect, in my opinion.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   But I've been wrong many.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.600]   I've been wrong more often than not with Apple.
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:08.640]   So I will never be able to talk to anyone again if I have to like charge headphones to
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.640]   make that happen.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:17.160]   But don't worry, they'll give you a dongle that'll last like two months.
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:21.160]   So for two months, two months, you'll be able to talk to people.
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:22.160]   I've dongle fatigue.
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:26.320]   They're going to tell a really compelling story because really the most obvious story is,
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:32.040]   well, we just want to make more money on headphones by licensing the lightning port.
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:34.600]   Sorry, but that's, you know, we're in it for the money.
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:37.640]   More on the table than an apple anybody wants to see.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:39.640]   It's compelling.
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:46.040]   If you think about your carrying your phone and it becomes the basis of you have to keep
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:48.560]   it with you all the time and talk to it.
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:50.480]   Your Siri becomes better.
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:53.120]   You're just going to want to have something that's a lot lighter weight that you don't
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:56.720]   have to worry about like making a gesture and whacking out your headphones.
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:01.640]   I mean, like, so if you envision that becoming when I throw my phone because Siri's such
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:02.640]   an idiot.
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:06.920]   Yes, but you think about taking it also into your car.
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:09.400]   Siri is never going to get better, by the way.
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:12.800]   I can promise you, Siri is never going to get better.
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:14.400]   Maybe they can use Alexa voice services.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:18.520]   Oh, Apple's been lapped twice now on voice recognition.
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:20.760]   I really like Siri on the Apple TV.
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:22.120]   I'm going to disagree with you a little bit there.
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:23.800]   I have issues with it on the phone.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:26.360]   Yeah, because it's such a constrained thing you're doing.
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:27.360]   Right.
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.640]   But on the Apple TV, it works really well.
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:34.000]   Because all you're doing is saying show me Manix reruns.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   It's easy.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   It's so worse.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   Really well.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   I'm sorry, Gilmore Girls.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   Did I say Manix?
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.400]   You did say Manix, but well, I watched Gilmore Girls.
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:42.400]   But yeah, it's really.
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:43.400]   Right.
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:45.880]   I could speak to my Amazon really well too for TV.
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:50.560]   I mean, TV's a Batman and Batman just pops up like nobody's business.
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:52.240]   But even Comcast has TV.
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:53.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:56.280]   And that's saying something even that's the end of the conversation.
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:59.320]   Even Comcast has voice activated TV.
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:02.240]   Speaking of TV, there's a really interesting story.
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:07.680]   Peter Kafka writing in recode from Walt Mossberg.
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:13.480]   Remember that we in the Walter Isaacson biography of Steve Jobs, Isaacson said, Steve
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:18.120]   told him on his deathbed practically.
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:19.520]   We've licked it, I think he said.
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:20.520]   He said, TV is-
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:21.520]   We finally cracked it.
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:22.520]   We finally cracked it.
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:24.120]   Yeah, there it is.
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:26.000]   And then we never heard anything.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.320]   And there was a lot of rumors from people that Apple was going to do a TV.
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:33.920]   He said, well, finally, well, Mossberg was sitting on this all along.
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:40.200]   He says, Steve Jobs called him on the night that he formally handed over control to Tim
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:42.120]   Cook.
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:45.880]   And told him, I think we figure out a way to do it, TV.
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.280]   And it's going to be fantastic.
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:52.040]   And he said, Walt, I want you to come over and see what we're working on.
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:55.120]   But he died two months later.
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:58.160]   And no one, and Walt never made it over.
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:00.240]   And no one really knows what it was.
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:03.680]   The mystery passed with Steve Jobs.
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:08.040]   So that was, okay, Jobs died and was it 2011?
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:09.040]   Yes.
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.040]   Yes.
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:13.480]   That was a very different time for TV.
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:18.640]   And I really want to emphasize that something you were planning way back then, even being
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:22.600]   Steve Jobs, I don't know if it would have a lot of relevance today.
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:25.280]   So maybe that's why we've never seen anything from it.
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:26.280]   Yeah.
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:29.120]   I'm also, I'm the cynic in me and you're going to hate me.
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.360]   But it's okay.
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:39.680]   The cynic in me says that Jobs played Walt Mossberg like a fiddle and used Walt to basically
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:44.400]   get the Wall Street Journal, which he was writing for at the time, to tell the Apple
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:46.000]   story.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:53.640]   And Mossberg even says, Steve wanted to clearly communicate that even though he wasn't going
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:59.120]   to be CEO anymore, he, this is the quote, he was going to still be involved.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:03.200]   Their press release made some vague nod toward that, but he wanted me to know that he was
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:08.120]   going to be involved in big strategic things and also that he was going to reserve one
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:10.480]   particular thing for himself.
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:12.560]   I said, well, what's that?
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:13.760]   Steve said, well, it's television.
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:16.840]   I think we figured out a way to do it and it's going to be fantastic.
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:21.800]   I want you to come out in a few months and I want to show it to you.
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:27.720]   That conversation, I don't think necessarily means that there really was anything significant.
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:32.200]   It could just as well been Steve playing Walt one more time saying, hey, just remember,
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:33.200]   I'm still around.
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.320]   I'm not, I don't want you to think I've left Apple.
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:36.520]   Can I ask you a question?
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:40.760]   He was, by the way, at that point, very sick and very, very sick.
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:44.320]   Now, Steve Jobs, great man.
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:46.880]   Was he out here making everything on his own?
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:47.880]   No.
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:48.880]   Was he literally designing things?
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:50.880]   He had a lab in the Palo Alto house.
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:54.840]   He had a lab when he was working by him soldering together the perfect TV.
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:59.920]   So even if he passed away, the team that was doing everything that he ordained them to
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:04.360]   do is still in existence unless they had like a trap bomb connected to his heart.
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:06.280]   He inspired when he died.
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:09.640]   So if there was something magical to be happened, the magic would have been released and it
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:13.640]   would have been the Steve Jobs in the world and that was passed and here is the first
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:14.920]   thing Steve Jobs ever did.
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:16.800]   It's also called, this is like click bait.
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:17.800]   This is a click bait story.
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:18.800]   It sounds nice.
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:22.480]   But don't tell me that he told you that there was a magical wand and somehow this magic
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:24.200]   wand has disappeared to the ether.
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:28.400]   Here's the other, the less cynical interpretation, which is that he did have engineers working
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:31.560]   on something very exciting and Apple decided after looking at it.
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:34.120]   Well, it's not that exciting or it's not a business for us.
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:35.120]   There's a lot of reasons.
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:36.120]   Apple does a lot of things.
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:39.680]   I don't think they're going to do a car, even though they spent so much money on it.
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:41.040]   I think they're going to do a car.
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.040]   I think they're going to do it.
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:43.040]   I think they're going to do it too.
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:46.560]   I think they're going to do a car, but I think to Stacy's point, I think that the TV
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:47.880]   industry has changed so much.
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:51.480]   And I think the set top box is one thing that makes a lot of sense because.
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:53.480]   Well, there's a new opportunity now, right?
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.320]   The FCC is going to open that up.
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:56.320]   Right.
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:54:00.040]   Well, yeah, the FCC, but also, you know, the whole, the whole rise of cord cutting and
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:01.960]   skinny bundles and that sort of thing.
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:05.160]   And I think with the TV, I mean, as, as a lot of people have seen, I mean, it's become
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:10.680]   so commoditized, even going into 4K, it's become so commoditized that I don't know if
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:14.560]   that would be, it would make sense for Apple to be in that space because Apple loves their
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:15.880]   margins, right?
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:19.680]   So if they're going to have a TV that also has this built in set box component and is
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:23.520]   they're going to want to sell for their price, I think they've got to realize that in 2016
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:29.800]   or even 20, you know, 13, even, even 2011, it would have been harder to make the argument.
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:33.120]   It's going to be difficult to say people are going to buy you an Apple branded television
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:34.120]   set.
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:37.240]   You know, a set top box is a little different.
[00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.000]   But yeah, I'm with a doctor.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.720]   I totally think they're building a car.
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:43.440]   So what's the status of that FCC ruling?
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:45.520]   They're still taking comments on that.
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:48.200]   I believe they're still taking comments.
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:50.080]   They may be in the second round of comments.
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:54.200]   And some, some courts, I think have said this, you couldn't do that if you wanted to.
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:56.480]   But of course, the cable company hates it.
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:55:01.640]   They say, this is how we, this is our value ad you take away our set top box.
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:07.800]   But man, if you can put the internet around television content and access down your TV,
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:08.800]   think about the Apple.
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:12.160]   I mean, like, that is such, it's the biggest screen in your house.
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:13.800]   I get so excited thinking about it.
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:14.800]   I like that.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:18.880]   If com is the state of the art, that the best thing that cable companies can come up with,
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:20.120]   they haven't tried.
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:21.120]   They have not tried.
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:22.280]   That is crap.
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:24.880]   They're, they're always behind the ball on everything.
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:28.320]   I'd like to ask you one general question.
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:30.040]   Do you have $20 on you, Uncle Leo?
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:31.040]   I do.
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:37.000]   I bet you $20 that after you do this next ad read, that you can't go to stories without
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   saying the word Apple.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.240]   I'll give you a note seven.
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:42.400]   If I, I'll take the note seven.
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:43.800]   He's going to read.
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:44.800]   I read.
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:47.200]   Two stores with a stand for an apple.
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:48.200]   All right.
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:49.200]   You guys, you're the witnesses.
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:50.200]   All right.
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:53.600]   Let's get a great, by the way, we've got a great studio, a giant studio audience today
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:54.600]   verifies it.
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:58.040]   I thought we'd be able to get a lot of people in our new tests studios, Eastside studios.
[00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:00.040]   And yeah, we've got about 20 people here today.
[00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:01.280]   And it's wonderful to have you all.
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:03.080]   I guess it's Labor Day weekend.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.320]   So people got nothing better to do.
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:11.800]   And including a guy up front who's wearing a Morse code, a T-shirt and Morse code, the
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:13.640]   dots are marshmallows.
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:16.720]   The dashes are graham crackers and chocolate.
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:20.440]   And it says in Morse code, I love s'mores.
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:24.360]   It is the bizarist mashup ever, but he's a ham.
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:25.360]   So it's okay.
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:26.920]   Anyway, it's great to have you all.
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:27.920]   Thank you for coming.
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:29.920]   We're being our studio audience.
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:31.400]   We love having you here.
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:35.840]   And the new studio is made for visitors.
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:38.160]   Just email us at tickets@twit.tv.
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:42.520]   We did have somebody yesterday who came late and said, "I went to the old studio."
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:44.840]   And so I guess he Googled it or something.
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:46.560]   And he takes a while for Google to update.
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:49.920]   But the wiki's right and the email you'll get back from us is right.
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:52.240]   And we'll give you directions to the new place.
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:58.760]   We also are celebrating the opening of TESS, the site studio, with some new merchandise.
[00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:04.960]   We got some merch, custom T-shirts, mugs, hoodies, stickers with the Eastside logo, Anthony
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:08.520]   Nielsen, in our marketing department.
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:10.160]   It's such a great job with this.
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:21.360]   If you go to Teespring, T-W-E-S-P-R-I-N-G, Teespring.com/Twit, you will be able to pick
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:23.280]   the merchandise of your choice.
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:27.120]   The only thing to remember is that these are limited time.
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:28.120]   We only do this for 30 days.
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:30.480]   So there's only three weeks left.
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:35.200]   Men's women's on the front, the Twit logo on the back.
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:39.560]   I think really tasteful Eastside Studio logo.
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:46.480]   So, you know, in some people I know have the brick house Tees that we made.
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:48.160]   So you've got to have a complete set.
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:52.000]   Here's the hoodie, which I think is really nice, is a pullover hoodie.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.320]   And then there's a mug as well.
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:58.760]   And stickers, which are cheap, I hope.
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:02.600]   Sticker shouldn't be on anything, right?
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:04.240]   Four dollars for the sticker.
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:05.240]   Okay.
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:07.880]   So, Teespring.com/Twit.
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:11.760]   Our show today brought to you by Carmanite online backup.
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.920]   I had a guy call on Radio Show today.
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:15.960]   He said, "Please don't be mad at me.
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:17.320]   I'm so embarrassed.
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:19.200]   I have never backed up in my life."
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:22.560]   He said, "I've been using computers for 12 years and I've never backed up."
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:24.520]   And I thought, "Well, you know what?
[00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:25.520]   Don't be embarrassed.
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:28.880]   You're a lucky son of a gun because data loss happens."
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:31.680]   And of course, it happens at the worst possible time.
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:34.840]   That's why a good backup solution is so important.
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:38.040]   Important enough in your home, you know, if you've got baby pictures or wedding pictures
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:41.320]   or financial records or emails, there's got to be stuff on your computer.
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:43.480]   You just do not want to lose.
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:48.120]   But imagine if you're a business and the computers in your business, they've got your accounts
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:49.560]   receivables.
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:51.080]   They've got your suppliers list.
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:52.720]   They've got your customers list.
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:54.520]   Those computers hold the keys to your business.
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:59.040]   If your business, if that building burns down, you can, you know, you got insurance.
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:00.280]   You can replace all that stuff.
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:01.480]   Do you have insurance for your data?
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:02.640]   I bet not.
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:05.560]   No point in buying insurance for your data after the fire.
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:06.720]   You get it before the fire.
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:08.680]   You get carbonite right now.
[00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:10.400]   Automatic cloud backup.
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:13.800]   You've got great solutions for business, including appliances.
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:15.600]   They recently acquired a company called Evolt.
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:17.120]   They make a really great solution.
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:20.240]   If you're an IT pro, you certainly know the name.
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:21.240]   These guys are great.
[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:25.600]   And you know, one thing that should terrify every business is ransomware.
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:31.120]   90% of all the phishing attacks out there now contain ransomware viruses.
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:33.880]   That's the virus that when it activates on your computer and encrypts your data and
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:36.560]   then asks for a ransom.
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:37.560]   Just send us 300 bucks.
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:38.560]   We'll unencrypt it.
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:42.640]   Well, even if you send them 300 bucks, chances are you're not going to get a decryption.
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:46.800]   But if you've got carbonite, you've got nothing to worry about because carbonite does something
[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:49.280]   every backup should do, but most do not.
[00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:50.800]   It's called versioning.
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:57.720]   It doesn't just save the most recent version, which might well be the version that's encrypted.
[00:59:57.720 --> 00:59:59.520]   It saves previous versions.
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:03.880]   So you can always go back to that unencrypted version and say, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, to
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:05.520]   the bad guy.
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:08.680]   It is kryptonite for ransomware.
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:09.680]   Try it out for free.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.680]   You don't need a credit card.
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.960]   That means there's no way they're going to, you know, like say, oh, we're just going
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:13.960]   to auto renew you.
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:17.320]   No, they really want you to try it free at carbonite.com.
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:21.560]   But when you do try it where you see the offer code, put in Twit.
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.400]   And the only reason I say that, well, two reasons.
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:27.480]   One, so they know you saw it here, but also so you'll get two months free when you buy.
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:32.560]   As little as $5 a month to back up everything on a Mac or a PC, but they've got plans for
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:36.320]   servers, networks and more carbonite.com.
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:39.600]   I'm not kind of a mission to get everybody using carbonite.
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.400]   Well, let me help you out with that mission.
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.440]   Uncle Leo, please do.
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:47.880]   So long story short, I will not have anybody feel sorry for me, but the power went out
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:51.920]   and my security system was down and someone broken to my home.
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:54.000]   They stole all three of my laptops.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   Oh, dear.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.520]   They sold the iPads.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:00.960]   They sold my PlayStation and literally like, you know, I'm a chill dude.
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:05.320]   The thing that made me the most upset was thinking the pictures of my daughter gone.
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:06.320]   Where's my stuff?
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:10.640]   And luckily, you know, most of my hard drives are still here and I still have stuff, but
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.320]   I have everything backed up.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:16.440]   So if you don't have stuff backed up, whether it be a fire or a flood or somebody's coming
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:23.520]   and taking it, you know, that laptop, whatever is the value of it, $3,000 you get back from
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:25.040]   insurance, that's cool.
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:30.400]   You can't get back the pictures of your newborn, your grandfather, your mother, your kid first
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:31.920]   walk in a video.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:35.160]   So everybody should be backing up everything.
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:38.360]   And five bucks to get you in the door is not that much.
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.360]   Well, it is kind of a larger strategy.
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:42.480]   I think it's good to have what you had the backup hard drives.
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:44.360]   You're lucky they didn't steal those.
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:45.360]   That's the problem.
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:46.360]   You got to back up to the cloud.
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.360]   Local backup.
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:48.760]   You have to have the offsite backup.
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:49.760]   You got to have a thank you.
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:50.760]   I know.
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:51.760]   I know.
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:52.760]   Sorry.
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:53.760]   Everything's there.
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:54.760]   Yeah.
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:55.760]   Did your insurance cover it?
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:56.760]   You know, their insurance.
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:57.760]   So I got to wait a little bit.
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:58.760]   Yeah.
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.760]   Because you lost your camera equipment too.
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:01.760]   Yeah.
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:02.760]   That's what I was getting people into chat.
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:03.760]   I was like, why aren't you an HD?
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.760]   And I'm like, yeah, well, you know, they stole your-
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:07.160]   Wait a minute.
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:08.160]   That is low.
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:12.160]   They stole your webcam?
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:14.200]   You know, you know, it was my webcam.
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:16.560]   I was using my Canon 70 day.
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:20.360]   Oh, the crazy part about it is there's like a $1,500 lens on it.
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:22.360]   The lens is more than the camera's worth.
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:25.000]   But the thing that cracked me up was like, these are really dumb thieves.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   They took the $300 mic off of the top of the camera.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.880]   Like unscrewed it, took it off, and went down.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:33.040]   And the tripod, I have like a five-hour tripod.
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.120]   They took the clip off of the tripod, left the tripod.
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:37.320]   So I'm like, why wouldn't you just take everything?
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:38.520]   It's all worth money.
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:39.520]   Right.
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.360]   Like just- That's what thieves do.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:42.360]   They're not that bright.
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:43.360]   That's rather thieves.
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.360]   That's why they-
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.360]   But anyway, back it up.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:46.360]   I'm sorry.
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.360]   Back it up.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:48.360]   Listen, back it up.
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:49.360]   That sucks.
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:50.360]   I want to be really sorry.
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:51.360]   It happens.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.360]   Yeah.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:53.360]   Every time you come on, I feel sorry for you.
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:54.360]   Don't feel sorry for me.
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:55.360]   Everything is great.
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.360]   I'm over here.
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.360]   I know.
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:00.240]   But I'm not really your happy, your smart.
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.680]   But that stuff happens to you.
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:04.360]   Hey, no.
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:05.360]   Stuff happens.
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:06.360]   That's life, dude.
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:07.360]   That's life, isn't it?
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:08.360]   That's life.
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:09.360]   Things happen.
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:10.840]   You know, sometimes you drop a glass and break it sometimes.
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:12.600]   It lands in its hole and you're happy.
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:13.800]   And that's how the world works.
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:15.760]   You have a hole for your glass?
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.280]   No, like a glass.
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:19.360]   Why glass is the hole?
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:21.520]   And you think the luckiest person in the world.
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:22.760]   Like, oh, I got a break.
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:25.680]   When the toast lands buttersight up, I'm a happy man.
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:26.680]   There you go.
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:30.720]   Two stories, no using the word about fruit.
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:31.920]   I got it.
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:37.160]   Google, according to Android police, is going to have an event October 4th.
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:40.880]   And that's what we're going to hear about the new, well, I want to call them Nexus phones,
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:42.640]   the Google branded phones.
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:49.040]   But the rumor, David Ruddock writing for Android police is it will be called a Pixel.
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:52.320]   The Pixel and the Pixel XL.
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:55.040]   I cannot believe you're leading with the phones and not Google Home.
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:56.040]   I'm so sad.
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.040]   You're right.
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.040]   You're right.
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.760]   The Google-- well, so, OK, I need a phone because apparently my Nexus bursts.
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:01.760]   Oh, that's true.
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:02.760]   I mean, my--
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:03.760]   But you're not going to wait till October 4th for that.
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.840]   No, I have other phones lying around.
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:12.080]   But is that, oh, Dr. The Thieves steal his internet, too?
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:13.160]   Oh, my God.
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:15.680]   Talk about bad things happening.
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:16.960]   We'll get him back on.
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:19.520]   So actually, yeah, it is more than the phones.
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:22.680]   We'll start with the phones because people are very interested in these phones.
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:26.920]   I personally think if you're going to get Android, I wish the Google hardware were a
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:30.680]   little bit higher and a little bit better cameras, a little bit better battery life
[01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:34.840]   because you really do want Android from the home office.
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:35.840]   Right.
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:36.840]   Google.
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:37.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.520]   I will not go back to alternatives.
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:44.800]   They just not-- you know, like the Note 7 has a much nicer screen as a much better camera.
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:45.800]   I just--
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:46.800]   I wish they still did the Google Pure.
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:47.800]   The GPE, yeah.
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:48.800]   The Google Pure edition.
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:49.800]   Yeah.
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:50.800]   Yeah.
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:55.600]   Because then you got the best of the hardware you really wanted, but the software, you know,
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.600]   that--
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:59.440]   This will be designed by HTC, which makes very nice phones.
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:03.080]   But you know, they're going to be just a notch below, I think, the top of--
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.080]   Do they, though?
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:05.080]   Does HTC make really nice phones?
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.080]   OK, maybe not.
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.080]   I don't think they do anymore.
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:08.080]   I mean, I'm just being honest.
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.080]   I don't think they do anymore.
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.080]   I hate to be that person.
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:11.080]   I hate to be that person.
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:14.160]   The HTC 10 was pretty good.
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.160]   How many years ago was that?
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:18.160]   No, that was a few months ago.
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:19.960]   Christina, how quickly you move on.
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:20.960]   The HTC 10, the HTC 10--
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:21.960]   The HTC 10, that's fine.
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:22.960]   The HTC 10.
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:23.960]   The HTC 10.
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.960]   No, because I was thinking that the A9--
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:26.960]   You think of the one.
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:27.960]   Or the A9.
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:29.960]   No, the A9, which now they're doing the--
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:34.840]   Now, I had the HTC 10, and I admit I gave it to Tony Wang, one of our editors.
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:35.840]   He loves it, though.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.920]   He says it's an extremely good camera.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:40.640]   It was a pretty nice phone.
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:43.640]   It wasn't like the best ever, but it was pretty good.
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:44.640]   It's just going to be your right.
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.920]   It's like third tier or fourth tier.
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:47.920]   It's like a good phone.
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:48.920]   Exactly.
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:51.600]   It's not a Kalukka Kalaki or whatever you get when you go to--
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:52.600]   I need a Kalukka--
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:55.360]   I'm like, where can I get one of them?
[01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:56.360]   You know what I'm talking about.
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:06:00.640]   Go down to a Metro and go pick up one of those phones for $75.
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:01.640]   It's like you click the--
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:02.640]   Clicials.
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:03.640]   Yeah, or blue, with the blues.
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:04.640]   Yeah.
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:07.040]   You see, it's like the step above that.
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:09.520]   That's their Lexus right there, before you--
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:10.520]   Right.
[01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:11.520]   --like the regular market of phones.
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:15.280]   And look at what Lenovo's done in Moto, which used to be a great brand as now, just
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:16.480]   also another--
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:19.720]   Although I like the magnetic backs, that's interesting.
[01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:20.720]   I don't know.
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:21.720]   I should just get an iPhone.
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:22.720]   Yeah.
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:23.720]   You know.
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:24.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:25.720]   Wait, that's not an iPhone.
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:26.720]   Oh my god.
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.520]   I didn't say anything about Apple.
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:31.520]   Oh, I just think that was just a side comment.
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:35.160]   At room, I think somebody sent me an Explo-dent Samsung 7.
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:36.160]   I don't know.
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:37.160]   I lay that qualify.
[01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:39.160]   You know what, that phone?
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.160]   Just my luck.
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:43.440]   Your house had burned down to be my fault.
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:45.000]   That's fair.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.280]   I guess that's fair.
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:48.160]   I don't want to get me into one.
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:49.160]   The deals are dealing.
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:52.440]   You can't forget you, son.
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:54.280]   We sent your daughter Candy.
[01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:55.600]   You sure did, and she loved it.
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:56.600]   I like a lot of candy.
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:57.600]   She loved it.
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:01.320]   Lisa, is that really the best thing to send an eight-year-old is a bunch of candy?
[01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:02.320]   Yes, yes.
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:03.320]   They will love you forever.
[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:04.320]   I think so.
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.320]   It was.
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:06.320]   So what was she making?
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:07.560]   Unboxing video for it, too.
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:08.560]   I know.
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:10.800]   Yeah, it's unboxing video for somewhere.
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:16.120]   If you look up Leah's Sugar Wish on YouTube, you can go see her enjoying all this candy.
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:17.120]   She even shared it with her friend.
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.360]   She's such a good kid.
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:21.160]   She wouldn't share with me when she shared with her friend.
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:23.800]   So this is actually, Stacy, we'll do this for your daughter.
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:26.600]   It's kind of, I mean, I think it's mean, but it's a-
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.040]   No, don't send my daughter Candy.
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:29.040]   Yeah, right.
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:30.040]   It's mean.
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.040]   No, she's a hoarder.
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.960]   She won't- You won't get any.
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:35.800]   She only eats one a day, and then she keeps it for the rest of-
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:36.800]   Oh, she would love this.
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:37.800]   Oh, she would love this.
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:40.520]   So Sugar Wish is this site that you go there.
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:44.080]   We give you a certificate, and then you pick your candy.
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.720]   Now, my husband would go for that.
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:51.200]   Yeah, so they have just all kinds of weird candy, and you just pick it, and then they
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.400]   send you a box.
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.720]   So it's like a candy gift certificate.
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:56.720]   It's the worst.
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:57.720]   That's amazing.
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:58.720]   I don't know.
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:01.440]   And they have old-fashioned stuff, too.
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:03.720]   You know, they have like the old-fashioned candy.
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:05.600]   Well she's not here, but actually-
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:07.600]   I'm still her.
[01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:10.360]   You say- You stole her Sugar Wish.
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:12.160]   She's still got like- She's still got a peach razor.
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.160]   Look at- She's a winner, too.
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:14.160]   What she gets?
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:15.640]   Well she's even one at a time.
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:17.160]   And these are for us.
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:18.160]   These are the last ones I'm going to have.
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.160]   These are many gumballs.
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:20.160]   Oh, man.
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:22.160]   And these are strawberry marshmallows.
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:23.160]   Look, give me an extra-
[01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:24.160]   I should be in this box.
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:25.160]   I'm not a- I don't understand.
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:26.160]   I'm not a- I'm not a-
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.160]   They have impulse control.
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.160]   What's wrong with them?
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:30.000]   She eats one at a time.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.560]   She eats like one candy completely in the top, so I'm not allowed to go in it without
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:33.560]   her.
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:34.560]   We got to talk about it.
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:35.800]   You guys should make friends.
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:39.280]   So all right, so forget the phone.
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:43.640]   They also supposedly are going to announce a 4K Chromecast.
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.640]   That's pretty awesome, right?
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:47.280]   That's- The city- What is- Huh?
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:48.280]   Oh, go on.
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:49.280]   Go on, Christina.
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:52.320]   I was just going to say that's weird to me.
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:54.720]   Like- Why is that weird?
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:55.960]   I got a 4K TV.
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:56.960]   I can't see anything.
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.160]   Ask you why.
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:08:59.160]   Ask you why.
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:01.560]   And there's not a lot of 4K content is my point is.
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:02.800]   Do you have 4K Netflix?
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:03.800]   Do you have 4K Netflix?
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:04.800]   I do.
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:09.240]   And it's- I have 4K Netflix and I have 4K Amazon.
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:11.240]   Does it feel like 4K?
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:14.720]   You end up watching stupid shows that you would never watch just because they're made
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:15.720]   in 4K.
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:16.720]   And that's exactly my point.
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:19.680]   I keep asking people, people say, "Oh, I'm watching 4K on my Netflix."
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:21.680]   I'm like, "What are you watching that's mean of flea?
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:22.680]   Marco Polo."
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:24.680]   Does it feel like a 4K?
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:30.040]   No, it doesn't because- Because the- I mean, even though I have very fast internet, you
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:32.680]   know, it's still the bit rate that whatever Netflix is putting out.
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:36.040]   So if I had a 4K Blu-ray player, then that would probably be better.
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:37.040]   But I don't-
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:38.040]   I have that new-
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:39.040]   I can kiss you right now.
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:41.040]   That's exactly the answer.
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:42.040]   Why?
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:45.560]   What is your speed that you think that you're really pulling down this 4K that you're supposed
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:47.480]   to be getting it on your TV streaming?
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:48.560]   You're not.
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:50.520]   You're just paying extra for no reason.
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:56.280]   I have 4K HDR, which is the new thing.
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:57.280]   And I got the Sony-
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:58.280]   Nice.
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:01.840]   I mean, the Xbox One S, which has that new kind of Blu-ray player.
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:02.840]   Right.
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:09.000]   But on Netflix, by the way, this little tip, you can search for 4K or search for 8K.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.520]   You'll get all the Netflix content that's in 4K or 4K HDR.
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:19.880]   One of them is Marco Polo, which is the- just dumb stupid show about Marco Polo.
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:25.920]   But the sad thing is, when you see it in 4K and HDR, it doesn't look like this.
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:28.680]   I'm showing a little video clip of it.
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:32.800]   It looks like you're watching some actors in a set, in a room.
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:33.800]   It looks real.
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:34.800]   It looks like you're there.
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:37.480]   It loses all of its magic.
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:41.840]   It's like, oh, that's some guy dressed as Genghis Khan.
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:46.000]   You know, it's like Joe the Plumber dressed as Genghis Khan, and you're watching this.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000]   There's no magic at all.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.320]   I don't even know if I can believe you, because you don't like the show and that just sounds
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:51.320]   like-
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:52.480]   You like Marco Polo?
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:53.480]   I like history.
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:54.480]   I love history.
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:56.200]   I do like Marco Polo.
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:57.200]   I mean, I enjoy it.
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.200]   There's a whole-
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:01.480]   I'm watching a 4K, so I haven't lost the magic apparently.
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:03.480]   So maybe that's why I still enjoy it.
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:04.480]   But-
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:07.200]   All right, so 4K Chromecast, we don't care a whole lot about it.
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:09.880]   All right, finally Stacey gets her wish.
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:10.880]   Yes.
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:11.880]   Google Home.
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:12.880]   Google Home.
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:16.680]   So this is the home is the, like, the Echo competitor, right?
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:17.680]   It is, yes.
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:19.080]   Totally the Echo competitor.
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:22.720]   The big difference in Google Home, there looks to be two.
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:24.120]   Multicasting.
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:27.720]   So you can listen to things in multiple Google Homes.
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:31.320]   And then the other thing that I'm excited about is the potential for notifications, which
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:33.040]   they showed in their video.
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:36.200]   So not only can you talk to it, it'll talk to you too.
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:37.040]   Like-
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.040]   Correct.
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:39.040]   What?
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:40.040]   Yeah.
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:41.880]   Do you want somebody in your house talking to you?
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:42.880]   Already Echo does.
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:43.880]   And it's annoying.
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:44.880]   I'm watching TV.
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:45.880]   She says, "I'm sorry.
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:46.880]   I don't know what the hell you're talking about."
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:47.880]   It's really annoying.
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:51.520]   They showed it going bing, and then you're like-
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:52.520]   Okay.
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:53.520]   I'm listing.
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:54.520]   What is it?
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:55.520]   Yeah.
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:56.520]   Yes, sir.
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:57.520]   I think it was yes.
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:58.520]   Whatever it is.
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:11:59.520]   And then- And it looks like an air freshener.
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:00.520]   So that's, it's got that going for it.
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:01.520]   There is that.
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:02.840]   I'm super excited.
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:07.000]   I want to know when I can buy it, when I can play with it, and how much I can buy it.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.280]   Much better or worse.
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:10.920]   Although with the Sonos news with Amazon, now I'm kind of like-
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:11.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:12.920]   Home.
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:13.920]   That's a big deal.
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:14.920]   That's huge.
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:15.920]   That's a really big deal.
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:16.920]   I was so excited.
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:20.320]   I think only we care about it because Sonos is really one of those things, much like the
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:21.320]   Amazon Echo.
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:22.320]   Okay.
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:26.320]   That is, that is like, if you're the handful of people that own it, you can't stop talking
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:27.320]   about it.
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:28.320]   So let me correct everybody.
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:29.320]   I know it goes-
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:30.320]   Oh God.
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:34.520]   I know two people in the real world that aren't tech people don't really care about much, but
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:35.520]   they use Sonos.
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:36.520]   Oh, I love them.
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:38.320]   I'm not saying.
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:43.680]   And so if you, once you can automate it like that, people already have that system.
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:46.040]   So it's a big deal for regular people too.
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:47.880]   Yeah, my parents have a Sonos.
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:48.880]   All right.
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:51.680]   My parents have a Sonos and they're not, I wouldn't call them tech people.
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:55.600]   I also got my mom and Echo for Mother's Day and she loves it.
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:56.600]   And so the fact that-
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:58.080]   But you want them to talk, they don't.
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:12:59.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:00.080]   Well, now they will, which is-
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:01.080]   Yeah.
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:02.080]   Okay.
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:03.080]   I'm not a member of the team.
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:04.080]   They will.
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:05.080]   Next year.
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:06.080]   Yeah.
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:10.400]   Remember 2017, although that sounds like the future is practically here.
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:11.400]   I know.
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:12.400]   Have you made your CES reservations?
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:13.400]   Oh my God!
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:14.400]   No!
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:15.400]   No!
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:19.320]   I was at the Sonos event this week and they were saying, you know, that the beta will
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:23.440]   be out later this fall and it'll be like early 2017.
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:24.440]   So it's exciting.
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:26.640]   Wait, is the beta's for Spotify though, right?
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:27.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:28.640]   The beta's gonna play things on Spotify?
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:31.440]   Yeah, but they also said there was gonna be a beta for the-
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:32.440]   Yeah, they have tested.
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:33.440]   That makes sense.
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:34.440]   Did they tell you-
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:36.520]   That's what they tell you, because we were wondering this-
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:40.280]   Stacey and I and Jeff were wondering this on Twig.
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:41.480]   If it would allow-
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:46.480]   So, one of the things that's great about Sonos is you attach it to all your accounts.
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:50.640]   Not just Spotify, but Deezer, and Pandora, and even Apple Music.
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:51.640]   And then you can say-
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:56.160]   Well, you can't say, but you could say on the app, you can in effect say-
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:57.160]   Right.
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:59.640]   Choose something from Apple Music, play an Apple Music playlist.
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:01.160]   Will, do you think-
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:03.920]   And Stacey's or the Penis will not be available-
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:10.600]   That you would be able to say to your Echo, play Apple, my Apple Music playlist on my
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:12.480]   Sonos in the living room?
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:18.840]   I wouldn't imagine why it wouldn't work, because you're basically controlling the Sonos app,
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:19.840]   the Sonos experience.
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.720]   I mean, I think that they're building the two things in together.
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:23.640]   I wouldn't imagine why that wouldn't work.
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:24.640]   So, that's what I'm saying.
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:26.880]   Are you controlling the app or the speakers?
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:27.880]   That's the question.
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:30.040]   And that's not clear.
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:32.440]   So yeah, that's a good point, and that would be the differentiator.
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:36.240]   If you're controlling the app, then there'd be no reason you couldn't.
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:39.800]   But if you're controlling the speaker, then that becomes a little bit different than you're
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:42.600]   probably limited to whatever Amazon is doing.
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:46.920]   Although again, Amazon at this point, it doesn't have all the services that you can
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:50.600]   do with the Sonos, Sonos supports more services.
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:52.760]   But it is increasingly doing more and more of them.
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:56.400]   And for instance, if you've got an iPhone, you can't control your Apple Music or your
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:59.400]   iTunes or whatever from that app experience.
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:04.200]   It'll play from your phone and send it to your Echo.
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:07.200]   So I don't know.
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:08.200]   That's a really good question.
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:09.200]   I don't know.
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:11.880]   They were kind of light on details, which was disappointing.
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:15.520]   I was very excited, though, just to see the integration all the way around.
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:21.560]   So the home, the Google's device, which really seemed, and I have to say, if they put whatever,
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:23.800]   what do we call, okay, Google, what do we call that?
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:24.800]   What is that?
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:26.760]   Google is not just assistant.
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:27.760]   Google is assistant.
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:28.760]   Is that really Google assistant?
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:31.800]   Yeah, that's what they're going to -- that's the rebranding that.
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:35.640]   Oh, and that's going to be an aloe with a new messaging app as well.
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:36.640]   Yeah.
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:40.240]   And if they have -- that would be a reason to buy home over the Echo because --
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:41.240]   It's smart.
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:45.680]   -- like, oh, my Echo still thinks after Gene Wilder died -- this is -- I don't know why
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:46.960]   I'm so emphatic about this.
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:52.000]   But it still thinks that he died at the age of 81 when he died at the age of 83.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000]   And I'm guessing it's just a function of Bing.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.400]   But there's little things like that where you're like, oh, come on, Echo.
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:15:59.400]   Echo uses Bing.
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:02.440]   That can mess somebody up on their school project because nobody's kids are out here
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:03.440]   being lazy.
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:04.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:06.480]   They're not checking the real dates on things.
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:07.480]   They're checking with Echo.
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:08.640]   Echo could be off by two or three years.
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:09.640]   I think Echo should use that.
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:13.040]   Or 1776, I have in 1778.
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:14.040]   That's a big difference.
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:16.400]   So I guess after that.
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:17.400]   Okay.
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:18.400]   Okay.
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:20.640]   So that's an interesting point that Echo uses Bing.
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:22.320]   Yeah, I think they use Bing.
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:23.320]   They use Wikipedia.
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:24.320]   They might use Wolfram Alpha.
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:25.320]   I don't know who they use.
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:26.320]   Yeah.
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:27.320]   But yeah, but great, great points, Daisy.
[01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:29.320]   Yeah, Google's going to be more accurate on that stuff.
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:30.840]   Oh, Google's going to be awesome.
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:33.640]   And the notifications will basically be Google now.
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:34.640]   Right?
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:37.080]   That's my happy Google now noise.
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:38.080]   That's what I'm guessing.
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:41.120]   I mean, we don't know anything about it because when we asked about it, when they showed it
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:45.720]   up, they're like, it might say, hi, Leo, it's time to leave for work if you want to make
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:46.720]   it.
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:49.800]   I don't think that's the voice Google's going to use.
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:51.720]   Can they use Scarlett Johansson for me?
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:53.800]   I don't care what you get, but I want Scarlett Johansson.
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:54.800]   Sean Connery.
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:57.280]   It's time to leave for work, Stacey.
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:00.600]   Why you're looking marvelous today.
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:02.400]   With my luck, I get my mom.
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:03.400]   Stacey.
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:04.400]   Time to leave it work.
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:05.400]   Get up.
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:06.400]   Wake up.
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:07.400]   That'll get you moving.
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:09.400]   That'll get you out of the house pretty quick.
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:10.400]   We don't know what voice.
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:11.400]   That's an interesting point.
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:14.200]   Well, that probably just used the Google Assistant voice, right?
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:15.400]   It's a terrible voice.
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:18.280]   It isn't a great voice, but Siri's not a great voice either.
[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:19.840]   We could do better with our voices.
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:20.840]   We need better voices.
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:25.480]   There's a company called Josh.ai that has, they've shown it off.
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:30.000]   I don't know if it's out yet or if it's coming out momentarily, but they've got different
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.800]   voices for the echo that.
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:32.800]   Oh.
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:34.800]   So you can get different accents, different sexes.
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.360]   How open is the echo?
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:37.360]   It's pretty open, right?
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.080]   You could put it on a Raspberry Pi.
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:43.080]   So things like having a new voice, you could theoretically, would they have to make a deal
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:46.360]   with Amazon to make it a task?
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:48.160]   I don't know how they're going to do it.
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:49.320]   I think it's a skill.
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:50.800]   Sorry, a skill, not a task.
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:51.800]   Right.
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:52.800]   Yeah.
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:53.800]   Yeah.
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:57.400]   Who would be the greatest voice of all time to build an any machine?
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.400]   Patrick Stewart.
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:00.720]   Oh, that'd be good.
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:02.880]   Make it show, Christina.
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:04.720]   I'll take that.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:05.720]   Morgan Freeman?
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:07.920]   Nobody is for me.
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:08.920]   Nobody is for me.
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:09.920]   It's amazing.
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:15.320]   I'm trying to think of women who I'd want.
[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:17.080]   Can't think of any.
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:25.120]   They use female voices, I think, because I've always seen this said that fighter pilots,
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:30.040]   when they're passing out, because they're stalled or whatever, they use female voices
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:35.760]   for the fighter pilots, pull up, pull up, because we all have mommies and we're trained
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:37.480]   to listen to female voices.
[01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:39.080]   Okay, that is just silly.
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:42.200]   I want to see the study for that.
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:43.200]   That is ridiculous.
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.200]   Really?
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:47.200]   It's true.
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:50.600]   Yes, everyone has a mother.
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:53.600]   You ask for women have mothers.
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:56.280]   That sounds so silly.
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:57.960]   It really does.
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:18:59.560]   I mean, you think of male voice?
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:00.560]   Why do they use?
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:02.720]   Okay, so here's the thing about that.
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:05.320]   It's universally female voice for things.
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:09.960]   So if there's a woman, like, I would almost believe like, hey, men are more inspired to
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:11.840]   not punk out when a woman's around.
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:12.840]   Like, oh, you're blacking out.
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:15.240]   If your female says get up, you're going to do it because you don't want to embarrass
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:19.080]   yourself over everyone has a mom and your mom tells you get up and you think you're
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:20.080]   going to get up for your mom.
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:21.360]   You know what they call that voice?
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:27.640]   By the way, with fighter pilots call that voice bitch and Betty.
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:28.640]   Bitch and Betty.
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:29.640]   Wow.
[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:34.320]   It's a slang term used by pilots or nagging Nora.
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:35.920]   Yeah, or hang the young.
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:37.440]   Your door is a jar.
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:38.600]   Your door is a door.
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:40.280]   I hate that the door is a jar.
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:42.280]   I hate that.
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:44.840]   But you don't, they're not trying.
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:49.400]   In that case, of course, you're not trying to soothe somebody.
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:51.160]   You're trying to get them to pay attention.
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:52.160]   Yeah.
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:56.200]   Early human factors, research and aircraft and other domains indicated this is Wikipedia.
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:20:00.960]   So you know, it's true that female voices were more authoritative to male pilots and
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:03.880]   crew members and were more likely to get their attention.
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:05.840]   Much now it says citation needs.
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:06.840]   Citation needed.
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:09.160]   Somebody just made that up.
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:11.560]   Maybe even Leo put that in there.
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:16.760]   Much of this research was based on pilot experience, particularly in combat situations where the
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:22.160]   pilots were guided by female air traffic controller, citation needed.
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:25.560]   They reported being able to most easily pick out the female voice from among the flurry
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:27.560]   of radio chatter, citation needed.
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:29.360]   That's because there were no women pilots.
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:31.160]   Of course you're going to get into it.
[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:32.160]   Yes.
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:34.520]   There's a life here that I can point out is like, yeah.
[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:35.680]   That's another logic.
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:39.120]   In the time period back in the day when they had this study, that makes a lot more sense
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:40.120]   too.
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:43.160]   That's a female on the phone because there are supposed to be females on the phone.
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:44.160]   What do you need to do in there?
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:49.800]   And by the way, if we then go to actual studies, a study at Plymouth University in 2003 and
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:56.720]   the defense research and development Canada in Toronto in 2009, in both cases, a male voice
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:01.800]   rather than a female voice in a monotone or urgent enunciation style resulted in the
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:04.960]   largest proportion of correct and fastest certification of times.
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:05.960]   Never mind.
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:08.040]   I forget that there is no citation needed here.
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:09.040]   There's an actual.
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:10.880]   Oh, actual citation.
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:18.480]   Effects of talker sex and voice style of verbal cockpit warnings on performances from human
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:21.080]   factors, Volume 51 November 1st, 2009.
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:22.080]   All right.
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:24.640]   So it's not true.
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:25.920]   Now we have to change the whole system.
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:28.000]   I know we got to change the wicked people.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.600]   We need more men and so because men are just as annoying as women are apparently in life.
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:34.560]   I don't know why they think that they need to nag some money.
[01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:36.160]   You want to meet bitch and bed?
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:37.160]   I get it.
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:38.160]   This is bitch and Betty.
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:39.000]   Wow.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000]   Yeah.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.400]   She's young and attractive.
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:43.440]   But why don't I hear her though?
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.440]   Do you have my audio?
[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:46.200]   We don't have your audio.
[01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:47.200]   How old is she like?
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:48.200]   What?
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:51.520]   She can't be bitch and Betty unless this was shot in 1938.
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:52.520]   Exactly.
[01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:55.880]   Well, I don't know if they had cockpits to talk to you in 1938, but there's got to be
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:58.960]   somebody older than her that was doing that before her.
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:01.160]   This is probably another citation needed.
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:04.920]   Yeah, we can't trust bail from YouTube this time.
[01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:05.920]   All right.
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:06.920]   We need another story.
[01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:07.920]   We can't trust my audio.
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:08.920]   We are false reporting.
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:11.440]   Did you say you did that out?
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:13.520]   I really want to hear this woman's voice.
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:18.080]   I want to know if her voice makes you want to pull up.
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:19.960]   The Tesla doesn't have a voice, does it?
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:21.440]   Yeah, it does.
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:22.440]   Is it female?
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:23.440]   Yes, it is.
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:24.440]   It has lots of voice?
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:25.440]   Yeah.
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:26.440]   Doesn't it?
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:29.680]   Oh, I think it's Googles though because it's the guidance.
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:32.840]   Oh, that's all female voice.
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:33.840]   Yes.
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:38.800]   Google does not get, now with Apple, you can change Siri's voice to a male voice by changing
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:40.600]   the nationality.
[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:41.600]   Yes.
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:42.600]   Yes.
[01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:44.440]   But you can't with Google, right?
[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:45.440]   You're stuck with that voice.
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:46.440]   There's no...
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:49.880]   Yeah, I've never messed around with it, but I don't think you can.
[01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:52.920]   I was like, let us go to the internet.
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:57.800]   The greatest thing about Tom Tom, for instance, remember the Tom Tom GPS is you could use
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:58.800]   celebrity voices.
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:22:59.800]   Oh, yes.
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:00.800]   Those were great.
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:01.800]   I loved that.
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:02.800]   Yes.
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:04.520]   It's actually sad that you don't get to do those anywhere.
[01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:07.240]   I was just talking to somebody about that the other day because they're like, man, I was
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:09.280]   listening to Mr. T. I was like, you still have a...
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:10.920]   I painted the fool, it turns here.
[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:11.920]   Go ahead.
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:15.560]   He was like, yeah, he's like, he uses it when he travels and gets a rental car so he doesn't
[01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:17.560]   have to pay for GPS.
[01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:18.560]   Yes.
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:19.720]   And I'm like, that's really awesome.
[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:21.360]   I missed that stuff.
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:26.720]   Well, so when you have an infinite variety of things to say though, you can't hire an actor
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:27.720]   to...
[01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:28.720]   Right.
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:29.720]   Right.
[01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:30.720]   So when you have...
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:32.800]   Now, can you not get my audio?
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:33.800]   Do you know what that's all about?
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:35.000]   Is that me or you or...
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000]   I'm not going to get you out of here.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000]   You can't.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.240]   Too bad because I want to play this.
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:40.240]   I used to have a voice.
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:41.800]   I used to have Glados.
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:44.200]   Remember Glados, the evil robot from Portal?
[01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:46.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:49.240]   I used her on the Tom Tom and she would tell you to turn left when you're supposed to turn
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:50.240]   right.
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:51.240]   Oh.
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:54.280]   And then when you would arrive, she'd say, I don't know why you went here.
[01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:56.520]   There's no cake here.
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:57.520]   Oh my God.
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:58.520]   That's awesome.
[01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:00.520]   That's the control, but that's fantastic.
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:03.160]   It was a troll because it wasn't useful, but...
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:07.160]   Oh no, it's the least useful thing in the entire history of the world.
[01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:08.160]   That's fantastic.
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:09.160]   Yeah, because of GPS.
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:13.960]   Hello and welcome to the Aperture Science Computer-Aided Navigation System.
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:18.800]   Aperture Science has committed to the welding of all users of its navigation systems.
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:24.840]   Cake and grief counseling will be available at the conclusion of your journey.
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:25.840]   And then I for a while...
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:29.360]   300 meters, you have reached your destination.
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:31.120]   Congratulations.
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:34.880]   Please remain in your vehicle and your cake will be delivered shortly.
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:37.040]   It was fun.
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:44.040]   I also had Dennis Hopper for a while giving me directions, kind of stoned directions.
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:45.040]   That's funny.
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:48.080]   You see, I don't understand why they don't...
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:50.240]   I guess because it's too much of a vocabulary.
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:53.480]   Yeah, I would say she was saying, which I think makes sense.
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:54.480]   Yeah.
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:57.480]   We have systems and algorithms that can just mimic things like that.
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:01.320]   Once they get your basic pattern down, can't they just make the inflections?
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:04.400]   Like they have, you say, the alphabet and then you can just say anything.
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:05.960]   Hello and welcome to the Ticnology.
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:06.960]   It's an afternoon.
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:07.960]   Easy driving.
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:10.440]   I'm exaggerating my point, obviously, but I mean...
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:11.440]   Yeah.
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:12.440]   The technology is fantastic.
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:13.440]   They do, but it's expensive.
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:16.440]   And I think that for most companies, I mean they can do it, but I think...
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:17.440]   800 yards.
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:18.440]   Keep left.
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:20.800]   Guys, I'm gonna have to go red and search this.
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:21.800]   Stance.
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:22.800]   Yeah, would you?
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:23.800]   Yeah, because now I'm fascinated.
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:25.520]   And like, oh, the difficulties...
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:29.760]   I mean, we've been spending so much money on natural language processing and understanding
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:30.760]   people.
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:31.760]   What about talking?
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:32.760]   Communicating.
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:33.760]   Yeah.
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:34.760]   What about talking?
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:35.760]   What about coming back to us?
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:37.360]   Because wasn't that...
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:39.360]   I love the movie Herr.
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:40.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:47.400]   And the thing that made that movie was that Scarlett Johansson was the voice of the AI.
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:49.840]   And when you have a real...
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:53.720]   I mean, it wouldn't have worked if it didn't have that...
[01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:57.200]   It's the same way advertising works.
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:00.560]   Right now, there's a commercial with Kevin Hart's voice on it.
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:03.080]   And he's doing advertising for a business.
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.480]   And my daughter walks to the room and she stops.
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:07.920]   And the reason she stops is because here's the tone of his voice.
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:10.040]   And she looks in TV and she's like, "What is that?"
[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:12.440]   And she doesn't care about it, but she cares about his voice.
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:13.800]   She can feel his voice.
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:17.240]   So when somebody you know and somebody you care about or somebody that is soothing, like
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:19.800]   I said, Morgan Freeman, he can get me to do anything.
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:20.800]   On my phone.
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:21.800]   He's talking about my phone.
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:24.080]   He'll be my best friend.
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:25.080]   Serious trash.
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:28.000]   I would use Siri every day just to talk to Morgan Freeman.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.000]   Like literally.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000]   Well, so...
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.000]   Or James Earl Jones.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000]   Yeah.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000]   James Earl Jones.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.800]   This is the world's most important.
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:36.800]   We need to start this campaign.
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:37.800]   Yeah.
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:38.800]   Yeah.
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:39.800]   I don't know who James Earl Jones.
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:41.960]   I'd feel bad if I didn't follow his directions.
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:42.960]   It's not your favorite.
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:43.960]   He's on my...
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:45.960]   He's on my track best.
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:46.960]   I find the last best.
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:47.960]   I find the last best.
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:48.960]   I'm your father.
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:53.200]   I find the fact that you can't tell your left from your right.
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:54.200]   Disturbing.
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:55.200]   Disturbing.
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:59.400]   The Simpsons had this funny thing when I guess because he guessed it a couple of times
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:01.400]   as a character pleading comes Murphy.
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:07.080]   And at the end of, I guess, his character's final appearance, he made a lot of the comments
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:10.960]   like Star Wars and the Lion King and CNN.
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:13.680]   Like bit by bit by bit, it was very funny.
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:17.200]   But they do use humans to generate these voices.
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:18.200]   Yeah.
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:23.520]   It must be a way to give even though they have to do a lot, you know, sale.
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:26.840]   By the way, the best of them all is Amazon's Echo.
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:28.640]   She is really good.
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:29.880]   She does have a collection.
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:30.880]   Yeah.
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:32.200]   The thing is the price of it, right?
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:37.280]   So I saw the one who was Siri's voice and I'm like, they pay her whatever pendants in
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:40.040]   the beginning and now she's like, not make money.
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:42.040]   If you had to get James Earl Jones, the...
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:43.040]   Oh, you couldn't afford that.
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:44.440]   I'm not a dough, you'd have to pay him.
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:45.680]   No, so you get a voice actor.
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:48.880]   But I do feel like you could have better voices.
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:52.800]   Yeah, but they also have to be understandable and they have to be...
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:56.280]   It's like the woman who did the original...
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:59.760]   The first Siri voice and it's a different voice now, but the first Siri, which is why
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:02.600]   she can now sell herself as like, oh, I was the voice of Siri.
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:04.360]   It's now actually a different voice.
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:09.080]   She was also, I think, the voice of the ATMs, like, makes America used to do.
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:10.440]   I think she was Ma Bell.
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:11.440]   She did...
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:12.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:13.440]   She's selling like a million of her face.
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:14.440]   Yeah.
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:20.000]   You have to have like the right celebrity, like a Kevin Harroby good or James Earl Jones
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:25.040]   or Morgan Freeman, but you've got to have something that's easy to understand and is
[01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:30.800]   soothing and they can also be like, they can work in a lot of scenarios because if it's
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:31.800]   something that...
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:36.360]   If you have any sort of accident at all or an accident that is hard to understand, I
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:40.640]   think that that would end up negating the whole point of voice assistant stuff.
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:44.360]   John Markoff did a great piece earlier this year in the New York Times, creating a
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:50.040]   computer voice that people like and he was talking about Watson.
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:51.040]   Yeah.
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:58.720]   And remember that Watson played Jeopardy and had a kind of a bland voice.
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:00.240]   He sounded like a jerk.
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:01.240]   He was a real a-hole.
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:05.680]   Well, do you want to hear, because this is the best part of the New York Times article,
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:10.760]   they began in 2009 searching for a voice for Watson and here are some of the finalists.
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:12.560]   Do you want to hear some of the finalists that weren't selected?
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:14.120]   Yes, here's the finalists.
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:16.320]   This island that was home to a notorious prison.
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:17.320]   Oh God.
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:18.320]   No, no, that's Oxford, Trebek.
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:19.320]   Oh, yes, that's correct.
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:20.840]   So they're going to actually put this in the Jeopardy game.
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:23.240]   So, Trebek is going to ask a question and you'll hear...
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:24.240]   Gotcha.
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:26.360]   This is going to always be the same kind of basic setup.
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:29.520]   Eight National Recreation Area in San Francisco.
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:30.520]   What is Alcatraz?
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:31.520]   Right.
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:32.520]   National sites for 2000.
[01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:33.520]   So that's pretty good.
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:38.680]   This state's only national memorial honors clergyman Roger Williams.
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:39.680]   Jennifer.
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:40.680]   What is Rhode Island?
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:41.680]   That's it.
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:44.080]   So that's pretty close to the final, but here's some other ones that didn't.
[01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:49.280]   This island that was home to a notorious prison is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:51.080]   Area in San Francisco.
[01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:52.080]   What is Alcatraz?
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:53.080]   Right.
[01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:54.080]   National sites for 2007.
[01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:55.080]   That's nice.
[01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:56.080]   A female voice, right?
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:57.080]   That's nice.
[01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:58.440]   That sounds a little late like Siri.
[01:29:58.440 --> 01:29:59.440]   This may be not.
[01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:04.440]   This island that was home to a notorious prison is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:06.320]   Area in San Francisco.
[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:07.320]   What is Alcatraz?
[01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:08.320]   Right.
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:09.320]   That's a little creepier.
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:10.320]   Right.
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:11.320]   National sites for 2000.
[01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:12.320]   Yeah.
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:15.320]   This is the one that was held in San Francisco.
[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:18.320]   That's the one that was held in San Francisco.
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:21.320]   That's the one that was held in San Francisco.
[01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:24.320]   That's the one that was held in San Francisco.
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:27.320]   That's the one that was held in San Francisco.
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:29.320]   That was held in San Francisco.
[01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:30.320]   That was held in San Francisco.
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:31.320]   That was held in San Francisco.
[01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:32.320]   That was held in San Francisco.
[01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:33.320]   That was held in San Francisco.
[01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:34.320]   That was held in San Francisco.
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:35.320]   That was held in San Francisco.
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:36.320]   That was held in San Francisco.
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:37.320]   That was held in San Francisco.
[01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:38.320]   That was held in San Francisco.
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:39.320]   That was held in San Francisco.
[01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:40.320]   That was held in San Francisco.
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:41.320]   That was held in San Francisco.
[01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:42.320]   Roger Williams.
[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:43.320]   Jennifer.
[01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:45.320]   What is roadiving?
[01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:46.320]   That's it.
[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:47.320]   That is creepy.
[01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:49.320]   That's so creepy.
[01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:50.320]   That is --
[01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:52.320]   I'm picturing a little mouse.
[01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:54.320]   I'm a small child.
[01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:56.320]   I'm like, "Yeah, I don't."
[01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:58.320]   You can disembodied it enough.
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:03.520]   I think you're rightly what made her so amazing was that Scargio's voice, she has a great
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:06.320]   face, feels so real.
[01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:10.320]   You either need to have that realness or you need to have the slightly disembodiedness
[01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:12.320]   where you're like, "Oh, well, this is a nice soothing voice."
[01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:14.320]   So there's an uncanny valley.
[01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:15.320]   There's an uncanny valley.
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:16.320]   Yes.
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:19.320]   But death uncanny valley where then it's like a child voice.
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:22.320]   You're like, "Oh my God, a child is inside my machine."
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:25.320]   It's added to me more like chucky, like a killer doll.
[01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:26.320]   Yeah.
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:27.320]   That's what I was going to say.
[01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:28.320]   That is a cyclic.
[01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:29.320]   Yeah.
[01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:30.320]   Yeah.
[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:31.320]   Yeah.
[01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:32.320]   Alex.
[01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:33.320]   You think yours has a mind, Alex?
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:35.320]   My daughter was small.
[01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:36.320]   I taught her to say red rum.
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:37.320]   It was awesome.
[01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:38.320]   But she did it.
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:39.320]   It's fantastic.
[01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:40.320]   Red rum.
[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:41.320]   Red rum.
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:42.320]   Red rum.
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:43.320]   That would creep the hell out of me.
[01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:44.320]   No, I couldn't do that.
[01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:46.320]   I'd be like, "Black and white kid in the clouds."
[01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:47.320]   Stop it.
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:50.320]   People come over and your daughter comes out and goes, "Red rum.
[01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:51.320]   Red rum.
[01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:52.320]   I'm going to my rim."
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:54.320]   It was very effective.
[01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:55.320]   Yeah.
[01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:56.320]   I encourage everyone to do that.
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:57.320]   No visitors.
[01:31:57.320 --> 01:31:58.320]   Wow.
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:31:59.320]   That is really awesome.
[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:04.320]   Some people teach you kids to swear you taught them to look like a psychotic child that's
[01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:05.320]   about to murder.
[01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:07.320]   It's terrifying people, which is better.
[01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:12.320]   They're both great, but yeah, I'm a big fan of the red rum that's fantastic.
[01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:15.320]   Again, these are all reasons I don't have children because I think that's all I would do.
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:16.320]   You would do that.
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:18.320]   That would be all I would do.
[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:19.320]   Do you dress up your cats?
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:22.320]   I don't know if you can see it, but here's Father of the Year right here.
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:23.320]   That was Lee and today.
[01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:26.320]   She's going to be a lady Deadpool for Halloween.
[01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:27.320]   That's a real sword.
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:28.320]   That's awesome.
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:29.320]   That's so cool.
[01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:32.320]   So he's got to get her her blonde little hair tail.
[01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:36.320]   Here's why your father of the year, you're planning her Halloween costume.
[01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:41.320]   She got that thing a month ago at the fight or not to put it on every weekend.
[01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:44.320]   She just wants to run around in it.
[01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:47.320]   I got it because I didn't want it to be sold out by Tom Halloween came because soon she said
[01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:48.320]   I want to be Deadpool.
[01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:49.320]   I'm like, what?
[01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:52.320]   Let's do that because that is awesome.
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:54.320]   So is it sexist to have a female voice?
[01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:59.320]   Is that like, well, you're my servant kind of like a sub-serving.
[01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:00.320]   I think so.
[01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:01.320]   No.
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:03.320]   I think they're more pleasant to be honest.
[01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:08.320]   I also, and maybe this is sexist, I don't want some guy in the house with me.
[01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:11.320]   I don't mind if there's a guy in the house.
[01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:12.320]   It's just like the female voice is better.
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:15.320]   Although I do like the British Siri male voice.
[01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:16.320]   That's what, yeah.
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:21.320]   That one actually does feel a little like a servant because it feels like it's cheap.
[01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:23.320]   So, you know, feels like, yes.
[01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:28.320]   You feel like you just got an extra 20K in your bank account when you're using that voice.
[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:29.320]   I'm sorry, sir.
[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:30.320]   I got to.
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:32.320]   That's what Amazon should use.
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:33.320]   And you'll be like, oh, yes.
[01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:34.320]   Five more stuff.
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:35.320]   Hey, we got it.
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:38.320]   Can we talk about an ad and then can we talk about Facebook?
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:40.320]   That's some security, maybe?
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:42.320]   Oh, you are all over it.
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:50.320]   Stephen Fry, who has the best British voice right ever, did a talking clock for a while.
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:52.320]   It was called the VOCO.
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:55.320]   And he did it as Jeeves.
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:34:02.320]   Good morning, sir.
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:04.320]   Your horoscope is unusually favorable today.
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:08.320]   Should I get your bank manager on the telephone?
[01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:10.320]   Very good, sir.
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:13.320]   This is a good way to make up.
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:16.320]   Good morning, sir.
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:20.320]   I am delighted you have survived another night.
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:27.320]   I am delighted you have survived a night.
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:30.320]   I am delighted you have survived a night.
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:33.320]   I am delighted you have survived a night.
[01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:36.320]   I am delighted you have survived a night.
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:39.320]   I am delighted you have survived a night.
[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:42.320]   I am delighted you have survived a night.
[01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:45.320]   I am delighted you have survived a night.
[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:48.320]   I am delighted you have survived a night.
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:53.320]   Do you put Wellington presents his compliments through the medium of my arm to Vera?
[01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:56.320]   He is particularly admiring of your shoes.
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:59.320]   I am afraid I have no further information than that.
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:02.320]   It is very random.
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:07.320]   You could actually create something like that with a pie and just load VOC, like M3's,
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:09.320]   or Stephen Fry.
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:11.320]   Totally.
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:14.320]   That's why I am just frustrated that they don't do a better job of this.
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:16.320]   They need to focus more on that, I think.
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:19.320]   I think they are doing quite enough.
[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:24.320]   They have got the APIs they are working on.
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:25.320]   They also probably don't.
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:29.320]   I think the uncanny valley, they don't want to personify it too much.
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:31.320]   They are afraid of freaking people out.
[01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:33.320]   You are not going to get scarred out talking to you just yet.
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:35.320]   It is the whole thing.
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:36.320]   Google especially.
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:38.320]   Google especially.
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:41.320]   Google home looking forward to find out more on October 4th.
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:44.320]   You think we will be able to buy it soon?
[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:45.320]   I hope so.
[01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:46.320]   They have got to get that guy out.
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:47.320]   They announced it.
[01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:48.320]   They announced it.
[01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:51.320]   Yeah, but when they announced it, it was not well.
[01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:55.320]   It was so far away that they couldn't even do an onstage demo.
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:56.320]   It was an empty box.
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:57.320]   That's true.
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:02.320]   I hope that it is available, but it might be one of those things where they actually
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:05.320]   now give us a demo and then are early 2017.
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:06.320]   Yeah.
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:09.320]   I feel like they are still on the beta phase.
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:14.280]   They might get it out to certain people to have a couple of months of testing before anybody
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:15.280]   can even go on an aloe.
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:16.280]   I don't want an aloe.
[01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:17.280]   What is holding aloe up?
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:19.280]   That is the smart messaging client.
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:20.280]   Oh yeah.
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:21.280]   The summer is over now too.
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:22.280]   The summer is over.
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:23.280]   The summer is over.
[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:25.280]   Well, it is over in three weeks technically.
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:26.280]   Technically so the summer time.
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:27.280]   I hate that.
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:28.280]   They have until the 21st.
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:33.280]   Oh, I was going to say Labor Day technically means the end of summer.
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:34.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:36.280]   Notice nobody here is wearing white shoes or white belt.
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:38.280]   Well, I will be wearing white Adidas tomorrow.
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:39.280]   I mean, you know, fuck.
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:40.280]   That is different.
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:41.280]   That is different.
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:42.280]   No white belt.
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:43.280]   No white belt.
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:44.280]   It is still Labor Day.
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:45.280]   Don't say sorry.
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:46.800]   It is your life and your privilege.
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:48.280]   You got it until the end of day tomorrow.
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:49.280]   Sorry.
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:50.280]   I am not sorry.
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:51.280]   That is so nice.
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:52.280]   You are still winter whites.
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:58.640]   Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks, the super simple cloud accounting software that
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:02.280]   changed my life like 10 years ago when I was still a freelancer.
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:07.200]   In fact, Amber McArthur told me about it because I hated doing invoices and there is a problem
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:09.280]   when you are freelancer.
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:12.640]   No one got became, you know, nobody started their own business because they love doing
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:14.280]   invoices so much.
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:16.560]   That is like the worst.
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:17.920]   So it would come to the end of the month and I put it off.
[01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:22.760]   I did not want to fire up Microsoft Word and excel and get all my papers and receipts.
[01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:25.560]   But the problem is if you do not do that, you do not get paid.
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:27.040]   And that is a problem.
[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:29.720]   In fact, there was a period when I was doing this.
[01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:34.640]   I was going to Canada doing the TV show that I did not invoice Rogers for my travel or my
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:37.920]   time for like four or five months.
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:40.920]   And then, you know, I am starting to say I really need to check.
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:43.520]   So I put them all together and they were pissed off.
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:44.520]   They say, how cool?
[01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:47.120]   You are invoicing us for six months worth of travel.
[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:48.680]   We are not going to do it.
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:51.760]   Amber said, FreshBooks comes out of Toronto.
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:54.800]   Great company, one of the first web 2.0 companies and they have gotten better and better
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:55.800]   and better.
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:38:01.800]   In fact, five million small business owners now use FreshBooks for their invoicing, for
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:03.240]   their accounting come tax time.
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:04.400]   You will love the reporting.
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:06.280]   Your accountant will love the reporting.
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:11.240]   It literally takes 30 seconds to create and send an invoice.
[01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:13.720]   Including different currencies, I was billing in Canadian dollars.
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:15.640]   No problem.
[01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:17.840]   You could also brand your invoices with your logo.
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:20.400]   I had a nice little, you know, Leo logo.
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:23.760]   You could set recurring invoices so you don't even have to do it every month.
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:25.120]   The touch receipts.
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:28.800]   You can use the FreshBooks app to actually take pictures of receipts and get them into
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:30.360]   the invoice.
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:34.400]   Clients can pay you online, which most of the time means you get paid faster because it
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:38.000]   turns out clients don't like paying any more than you like invoicing.
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.000]   Not because they don't want to pay you.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.000]   They do.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.000]   It's a pay in the butt.
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:44.160]   If they have a button on the email that says, "Just pay them now."
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:45.160]   They'll do it.
[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:47.120]   You can even set up auto payment reminders.
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:48.120]   It's so awesome.
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:49.320]   They have this new thing.
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:53.240]   I'm not sure I really understand it, but I think if you are, I would have used this probably
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:59.240]   then because you can invoice for a payment upfront when you're kicking off a project.
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:04.520]   So a lot of times you go into debt, basically, comes out of your pocket until you get the
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:05.760]   expenses paid back.
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:10.280]   Now you can use FreshBooks as an escrow, basically.
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:12.960]   You can also import expenses automatically.
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:15.000]   So it's very fast, very easy.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000]   And there's so much more.
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:22.040]   It even has a chip, EMV chip card so you can dip the chip or swipe the stripe that goes
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:25.520]   onto your smartphone using their app.
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:29.320]   So if you're doing business in people's houses, you can invoice them.
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:30.960]   You can actually give them an estimate.
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:31.960]   All this with FreshBooks.
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:33.240]   Give them an estimate on the app.
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:38.320]   Give them an invoice on the app and then take their payment on the app all at the same
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:41.200]   in one day, which is truly amazing.
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:42.200]   You're going to love it.
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:43.200]   It's going to transform your life.
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:46.160]   If you are invoicing people, get FreshBooks.
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:48.120]   You can try it free for 30 days.
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:51.360]   FreshBooks.com/twit.
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:52.640]   FreshBooks.com/twit.
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:53.640]   There's no offer code for this.
[01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:56.280]   When they do ask you, how did you hear about us?
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:40:00.680]   If you would write in this week in tech, I would be eternally grateful.
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:04.160]   They've been a good sponsor for us since I started using them 10 years ago.
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:07.080]   Really great company, freshbooks.com/twit.
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:11.720]   What did you want to talk about?
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:14.440]   Facebook, go, Dr. I don't know, Facebook security.
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:18.200]   You want to talk about them, how they can now zoom in on Instagram?
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:19.200]   That's kind of a minor.
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:20.360]   No, that wasn't a thumbs up.
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:22.440]   I watch people though all the time.
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:25.240]   I'll show them an Instagram picture and they do this.
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:28.480]   I know it doesn't do anything, but now it does.
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:32.960]   The worst part is unless you have a 6 Plus, when you're watching videos and stuff, everybody
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:37.200]   always tries to turn your phone because the videos are so small.
[01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:38.200]   It's just a natural thing.
[01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:40.560]   Anybody who doesn't use this gram, I'm like, "Ew, watch this video.
[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:41.560]   We're laughing."
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:42.560]   They're like, "Why don't you turn it?
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:43.960]   Why can't we watch it bigger?"
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:45.680]   Zooming doesn't even help that.
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:47.200]   I still can't watch the video bigger.
[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:48.360]   You're zooming on a video.
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:49.480]   What point does that make?
[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:51.760]   We had some pretty good coverage this week of EFA.
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:53.160]   None of you went to Berlin for that?
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:56.400]   The big EFA show?
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:58.440]   We sent Father Robert Ballisair to it.
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:07.080]   That show was started by-- opened the first show, I think it was 1923, by Albert Einstein.
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:08.680]   It has been going on since then.
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:11.320]   It was a radio show originally, IFA.
[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:13.840]   Yeah, we talked about this.
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:14.840]   Yeah.
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:17.040]   I mean, that's so cool.
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:22.800]   And Robert was there, he had some pics, some of the things he liked.
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:26.960]   I don't know if he would buy this, but one of the things he mentioned was Sony's Walkman.
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:28.720]   Sony released a new Walkman.
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:29.720]   Whoops.
[01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:31.560]   You know how much the Walkman is?
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:32.560]   $3,000.
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:33.560]   Yeah.
[01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:36.520]   It's related, but it's stupid.
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:39.760]   But you could also get the $2300 headphones to go with it.
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:41.600]   Oh my God.
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:42.600]   What is Sony doing?
[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:44.600]   What is Sony doing?
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:46.600]   It's their 70th anniversary.
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:51.960]   They're pushing Apple even into the pocket of not having headphone jacks and what is
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:52.960]   what Sony's doing.
[01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:53.960]   Wow.
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:54.960]   If that's the price of something.
[01:41:54.960 --> 01:42:00.920]   70 millimeter magnesium dome driver, aluminum coated diaphragm, neodymium magnets, and the
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:02.960]   headbands made out of beta titanium.
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:05.920]   I thought these were all Walkman was dumb.
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:06.920]   Exactly.
[01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:07.920]   Oops, my daughter's calling me.
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:08.920]   I'm sorry about that.
[01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:10.920]   I thought $800 Walkman was dumb.
[01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:15.840]   You could sell that if you called it Alpha or Spreckenstein or something.
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:20.080]   It says something luxurious that people named stupid Tony.
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:21.640]   You know what it's said?
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:24.240]   When you put Sony on, I'm like, I won't do it.
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:26.040]   Sony used to be like that.
[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:27.240]   That's what said.
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:28.240]   They used to be the quality.
[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:29.240]   Remember the.
[01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:30.240]   Sure.
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:31.680]   They were the Apple before Apple.
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:36.480]   Like Steve Jobs, like, wanted Sony to buy Apple back in the 80s.
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:38.040]   No, no more Sony.
[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:41.400]   When I first had my first Walkman and Disc Man, I was the coolest kid on the block.
[01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:42.960]   I truly understand that.
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:45.200]   But for Pete's sake, Sony, give it up.
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:48.160]   All right, here's here's one thing I did want to get.
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:49.160]   I liked a lot.
[01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:52.040]   The Gear S3 Classic from Samsung.
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:53.240]   And I really.
[01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:54.240]   Is it really, really big?
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:55.240]   It's really, really big.
[01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:57.520]   It's really, really big.
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:42:58.520]   But it's so pretty.
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:00.360]   And by the way, this is not an Android Wear watch.
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:01.360]   This is Tizen.
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:02.360]   Tizen, yeah.
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:04.280]   No, I mean, it's good looking, I suppose.
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:07.920]   I can't, I can't look at it and be anything other than angry because I look at a watch
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:12.640]   like that and and and and Samsung has been like, well, we can't make the female version
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:15.600]   of this because we just can't make the electronics small enough.
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:19.600]   And I just get so angry because it looks fine, but it's just like, this is a male watch.
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:23.760]   If you were to wear that watch, it'd be, you'd be like grandmaster Flash.
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:26.240]   It'd be like, yeah, it would be impossible for me to wear the watch.
[01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:27.800]   AOB2 have a BOB2 big.
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:28.920]   Now I have a small wrist anywhere.
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:30.840]   I have like a child size wrist.
[01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:34.080]   And so the 38 millimeter Apple watch is too big.
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:38.560]   It's not too big, but I have like for the leather band, I have the small size, which
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:42.400]   is like the size that typically they they're like, well, we typically sell this to children.
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:43.400]   And like, thanks, thanks guys.
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:44.400]   That's so insulting.
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:54.000]   But like, you know, so, so, but taking me out of it, I just feel like even the average
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.240]   woman like so someone who doesn't have a super small wrist, it's still that watch is
[01:43:58.240 --> 01:43:59.400]   still too big for them.
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:03.840]   And I was talking to someone who like a male friend of mine who's like really into watches
[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:08.800]   and he was like, yeah, he's like anything under anything over 42 because I think it's
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:10.040]   like 46 millimeters or something.
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:13.160]   He's like anything, you know, over 42 is a big watch.
[01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:17.680]   This is this is the latest Moto 360.
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:18.760]   It's pretty big.
[01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:19.920]   You you couldn't wear that.
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:20.920]   I think it's 46.
[01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:21.920]   Yeah.
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:23.360]   But I like I like big watches.
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:24.360]   I cannot lie.
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:28.600]   I mean, it just I just feel like I don't know because I'm a big guy, right?
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:30.560]   It doesn't look doesn't look sure.
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:31.560]   It looks fine on you.
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:32.560]   It looks fine.
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:33.560]   It looks manly.
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:38.280]   That is that is something to be said like how people again, Mr. Mark, I understand like
[01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:43.440]   people are not having a female version of a watch all the time.
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:47.720]   Well, they can't if you just this thing has a 380 milli milliamp hour battery.
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:49.160]   It's got its four day battery.
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:54.560]   Again, you can still make something stylized for a smaller wrist or female.
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:58.800]   That's one of the people who would buy because when we came around with this big clunky thing
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:00.440]   on their hand and new kids.
[01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:04.900]   No, no, no, no, no, because you've got to have if you're willing to compromise and not
[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:08.360]   put like GPS or a cellular radio on it.
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:11.260]   That's what this has a GPS and a phone in it.
[01:45:11.260 --> 01:45:12.260]   Right.
[01:45:12.260 --> 01:45:16.260]   So if you're going to add the modem for the phone plus the battery, you're going to move
[01:45:16.260 --> 01:45:18.740]   into like crazy, fat territory.
[01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:21.420]   I mean, that's just that's hard.
[01:45:21.420 --> 01:45:26.180]   But you can if it's like a normal smartwatch, like just Bluetooth and it's going to use
[01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:29.660]   your phone for most of the stuff totally could do something pretty.
[01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:34.300]   I was so pissed that, you know, the initial pebble was just so I pictured a picture of
[01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:35.300]   that.
[01:45:35.300 --> 01:45:39.620]   They were like, it's like you're wearing a medical device and people rather better.
[01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:43.300]   If it's stylish enough, it has to be stylish.
[01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:44.540]   It has to look like nice.
[01:45:44.540 --> 01:45:48.380]   This is what's been a problem with smart watches is they look, they don't look stylish.
[01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:52.500]   If it's stylish enough, some people, not I admit, Christina, you're not, you're not
[01:45:52.500 --> 01:45:56.020]   in the picture, but some people would, I mean, I think that looks very nice.
[01:45:56.020 --> 01:46:00.740]   Of course, the problem smart watches and this is an OLED, AMOLED, super AMOLED screen
[01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:05.140]   into some 1.3 inches is they always look better in pictures because the screen always
[01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:06.500]   looks like that's real hands.
[01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:08.020]   That's real numbers.
[01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:12.260]   And then you see it and it's clearly a screen.
[01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:13.260]   I don't know.
[01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:14.260]   I'm going to buy this.
[01:46:14.260 --> 01:46:17.660]   So I'm going to be sitting on a board on a panel with design and crews and all the smartest
[01:46:17.660 --> 01:46:23.540]   people in the world could make a lovely, wearable device for a female and it just needs to
[01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:24.540]   get done.
[01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:28.060]   Like just, and again, you don't have to make one with every cycle of watch you make, but
[01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:29.060]   make one once a year.
[01:46:29.060 --> 01:46:30.060]   Give me an option.
[01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:34.780]   I would say women are the biggest markers for fitness bands and fitness watches.
[01:46:34.780 --> 01:46:35.780]   Yes.
[01:46:35.780 --> 01:46:39.940]   And I would say that women would be more willing to spend a ridiculous amount of money on a
[01:46:39.940 --> 01:46:42.300]   watch if it's attractive and fashionable.
[01:46:42.300 --> 01:46:49.260]   I mean, again, my Apple watch, I spent $250 on the band because it's an accessory.
[01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:51.180]   It's a fashion thing at that point, not a tech object.
[01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:55.420]   And so the way that I mentally am able to justify what I spend on something, at least
[01:46:55.420 --> 01:46:59.100]   for me, I can't speak for all women, but at least for me, I'm able to just in my say,
[01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:03.260]   well, I'm now justifying this as a fashion purchase versus a tech purchase.
[01:47:03.260 --> 01:47:07.860]   And so I can make allowances to spend $800 on something for my wrist because it's also
[01:47:07.860 --> 01:47:11.260]   a fashion item rather than just being like, well, this is the gadget.
[01:47:11.260 --> 01:47:13.620]   Couple things I think you're true.
[01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:14.620]   Oh, sorry.
[01:47:14.620 --> 01:47:15.620]   Talk to him, jewelry.
[01:47:15.620 --> 01:47:19.700]   I'm just thinking about because like one of the things I have with a lot of watch, I
[01:47:19.700 --> 01:47:20.700]   would.
[01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:25.220]   Do you think your band will work with future iterations of the Apple watch?
[01:47:25.220 --> 01:47:26.220]   I do.
[01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:27.220]   Okay.
[01:47:27.220 --> 01:47:28.620]   That's one of my things.
[01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:29.620]   Yeah.
[01:47:29.620 --> 01:47:32.500]   I'm like, oh, you know, I have a ring Lee.
[01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:34.580]   I looked at doing the bracelets.
[01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:39.980]   I've looked at a lot of stuff because I love having attractive things that interact with
[01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:44.580]   my stuff, especially because my phone's always in my bag.
[01:47:44.580 --> 01:47:48.540]   But a lot of it's really expensive for something that I'm like, yeah, this is probably gonna
[01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:53.060]   last like like a smart watch is a no go for me if it's more than like 200 bucks because
[01:47:53.060 --> 01:47:55.460]   my God, it's going to get a year or two.
[01:47:55.460 --> 01:47:57.660]   And then one Wednesday.
[01:47:57.660 --> 01:48:00.020]   That's what's talking about.
[01:48:00.020 --> 01:48:01.260]   By the way, that's the other thing.
[01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:03.060]   No, we got through two two stories.
[01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:04.300]   I'm going to send them a phone anyway.
[01:48:04.300 --> 01:48:05.300]   So it doesn't matter.
[01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:09.340]   We got, but the other thing I have to note is that with the exception of Apple, almost
[01:48:09.340 --> 01:48:11.420]   everybody's doing now round faces.
[01:48:11.420 --> 01:48:13.860]   Apple's the only one that's doing square still.
[01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:14.860]   Yeah.
[01:48:14.860 --> 01:48:15.860]   Anything to say?
[01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:17.620]   I mean, I think I don't know.
[01:48:17.620 --> 01:48:20.460]   I mean, I think it's an aesthetic decision.
[01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:22.460]   I like round.
[01:48:22.460 --> 01:48:23.860]   That's the aesthetic decision.
[01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:24.860]   Round's good.
[01:48:24.860 --> 01:48:27.060]   Apple being Apple, wouldn't it be different?
[01:48:27.060 --> 01:48:28.060]   Yeah.
[01:48:28.060 --> 01:48:32.780]   And also, I think that round, unfortunately, you know, it's harder to make a smaller round
[01:48:32.780 --> 01:48:34.020]   face.
[01:48:34.020 --> 01:48:39.660]   So for me personally, I'm okay with the square because I feel like round to get all the stuff
[01:48:39.660 --> 01:48:41.580]   there, it's harder for them to miniaturize that.
[01:48:41.580 --> 01:48:43.020]   I mean, I think pebble did a nice job.
[01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:44.540]   Just to wear your Apple watch.
[01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:45.540]   I do.
[01:48:45.540 --> 01:48:46.540]   Yeah.
[01:48:46.540 --> 01:48:48.340]   I think I like squares actually.
[01:48:48.340 --> 01:48:54.380]   So I feel like round from a design aesthetic, they just, they look weird on someone's wrist.
[01:48:54.380 --> 01:48:57.980]   It's like a, it's a square, it's a rectangular thing in the beginning.
[01:48:57.980 --> 01:48:58.980]   I don't know.
[01:48:58.980 --> 01:49:00.260]   I've always worn square watches.
[01:49:00.260 --> 01:49:01.260]   Yeah.
[01:49:01.260 --> 01:49:05.500]   Well, my Cartier tank watches, a classic square watch, lots of square watches.
[01:49:05.500 --> 01:49:09.140]   See, in classic, how do people feel about watches when they're no longer classic?
[01:49:09.140 --> 01:49:10.140]   I don't know.
[01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:11.140]   Yeah, this is, I don't know.
[01:49:11.140 --> 01:49:18.460]   I think there's a macho kind of Ray Donovan element to a big, clunky watch.
[01:49:18.460 --> 01:49:21.180]   So you just want to have with us.
[01:49:21.180 --> 01:49:22.540]   Nice plug there for Ray Donovan.
[01:49:22.540 --> 01:49:23.540]   Great show.
[01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:25.700]   I was wearing my Apple watch every day.
[01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:28.980]   So I'm looking forward to getting a new one.
[01:49:28.980 --> 01:49:29.980]   Yeah.
[01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:31.580]   I'm curious about this S3.
[01:49:31.580 --> 01:49:36.100]   It also, you can play Bluetooth music via Spotify from the S3 to a speaker.
[01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:41.020]   I mean, this thing basically is this, I think where the app works, is a smartphone in your
[01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:42.020]   wristwatch.
[01:49:42.020 --> 01:49:45.220]   And I think that's kind of what Samsung's thinking is if we could just get all the functionality
[01:49:45.220 --> 01:49:48.260]   of a smartphone into a wristwatch now, then you'd have something.
[01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:51.060]   You're just going to make sure that the battery doesn't explode.
[01:49:51.060 --> 01:49:52.060]   Yeah.
[01:49:52.060 --> 01:49:53.500]   That'd be a bad thing, right?
[01:49:53.500 --> 01:49:54.500]   I mean, imagine that.
[01:49:54.500 --> 01:49:58.700]   Like, again, something where the size of it, but like imagine if you can give a kid that,
[01:49:58.700 --> 01:49:59.700]   right?
[01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:01.660]   You don't want to give a younger kid a phone per se.
[01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:05.340]   But if you said, oh, here, put this watch on and I can at least text you or call you
[01:50:05.340 --> 01:50:08.820]   when you're out at the park or outside or over Suits house or something, you can still
[01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:09.980]   communicate with them.
[01:50:09.980 --> 01:50:10.980]   And they only had that one device.
[01:50:10.980 --> 01:50:13.340]   They'd have to carry something in their pocket.
[01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:14.340]   That would be huge.
[01:50:14.340 --> 01:50:18.060]   It's also going to do something that Android, Android Wear does not do, which is touch to
[01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:19.540]   pay.
[01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:22.740]   And it's going to do something the Apple watch doesn't do, which is not only touch to pay,
[01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:27.900]   but Apple's, I mean, Samsung smartphones with Samsung pay work with card readers, swipe
[01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:31.820]   card readers, because it sends out a magnetic signal that tricks the card reader into thinking
[01:50:31.820 --> 01:50:34.060]   it's a credit card being swiped.
[01:50:34.060 --> 01:50:35.740]   The watch will do that too.
[01:50:35.740 --> 01:50:37.220]   You're almost sold on that watch now.
[01:50:37.220 --> 01:50:38.220]   That's interesting.
[01:50:38.220 --> 01:50:39.220]   Well, you're a big guy.
[01:50:39.220 --> 01:50:40.220]   We're big guys.
[01:50:40.220 --> 01:50:41.220]   We could wear this.
[01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:42.220]   We could wear a bigger watch.
[01:50:42.220 --> 01:50:43.220]   Yeah.
[01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:45.500]   And then, I mean, here's my question mark.
[01:50:45.500 --> 01:50:47.740]   Will it work with anything but Samsung's phone?
[01:50:47.740 --> 01:50:50.260]   Because in the past, that's been a stopper for some people.
[01:50:50.260 --> 01:50:51.260]   I doubt it.
[01:50:51.260 --> 01:50:52.260]   Probably not, right?
[01:50:52.260 --> 01:50:53.260]   It's running ties in.
[01:50:53.260 --> 01:50:54.260]   Can it?
[01:50:54.260 --> 01:50:55.260]   I don't know.
[01:50:55.260 --> 01:50:56.980]   I don't know what the capabilities are.
[01:50:56.980 --> 01:51:01.140]   AT&T has already announced that we'll sell it and it takes advantage of a new feature.
[01:51:01.140 --> 01:51:02.140]   AT&T has been touting.
[01:51:02.140 --> 01:51:05.980]   And in fact, it explains why AT&T has been touting it, which is that you will have a
[01:51:05.980 --> 01:51:10.340]   phone number on your phone that's and the phone number on the watch that are different,
[01:51:10.340 --> 01:51:15.700]   but you can tell the phone that the watch phone number is now the phone number to ring
[01:51:15.700 --> 01:51:17.340]   when the phone rings.
[01:51:17.340 --> 01:51:19.620]   So it's going to in effect spoof your phone.
[01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:22.020]   So you will have one phone number.
[01:51:22.020 --> 01:51:23.020]   The phone number has been explained.
[01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:24.020]   The phone number has been explained.
[01:51:24.020 --> 01:51:25.020]   The phone number has been explained.

[01:51:35.020 --> 01:51:36.020]   The phone number has been explained.
[01:51:36.020 --> 01:51:37.020]   The phone number has been explained.
[01:51:37.020 --> 01:51:38.020]   The phone number has been explained.
[01:51:38.020 --> 01:51:39.020]   The phone number has been explained.
[01:51:39.020 --> 01:51:40.020]   The phone number has been explained.

[01:51:43.020 --> 01:51:44.020]   The phone number has been explained.
[01:51:44.020 --> 01:51:45.020]   The phone number has been explained.
[01:51:45.020 --> 01:51:46.020]   The phone number has been explained.
[01:51:46.020 --> 01:51:53.020]   The phone number has been explained.
[01:51:53.020 --> 01:51:56.020]   The phone number has been explained.

[01:52:03.020 --> 01:52:04.020]   The phone number has been explained.
[01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:05.020]   The phone number has been explained.
[01:52:05.020 --> 01:52:06.020]   The phone number has been explained.

[02:16:07.020 --> 02:16:13.020]   There is no plausible medical reason why I should still be alive.
[02:16:13.020 --> 02:16:17.020]   Maybe my DNA could say why.
[02:16:17.020 --> 02:16:18.020]   Maybe he's not alive.
[02:16:18.020 --> 02:16:19.020]   Maybe he's a zombie.
[02:16:19.020 --> 02:16:20.020]   Sharon!
[02:16:20.020 --> 02:16:23.020]   That was a terrible Aussie-ass born.
[02:16:23.020 --> 02:16:24.020]   I apologize for that.
[02:16:24.020 --> 02:16:27.020]   I know there's great stuff.
[02:16:27.020 --> 02:16:30.020]   Is it true that this SpaceX rocket was destroyed by a drone?
[02:16:30.020 --> 02:16:35.020]   No one knows, but I've just started that rumor.
[02:16:35.020 --> 02:16:38.020]   I like it.
[02:16:38.020 --> 02:16:40.020]   Mark Zuckerberg is very disappointed.
[02:16:40.020 --> 02:16:41.020]   Mark was in Africa.
[02:16:41.020 --> 02:16:46.020]   There's a very funny exchange.
[02:16:46.020 --> 02:16:47.020]   Where did I read that?
[02:16:47.020 --> 02:16:50.020]   I think maybe it was New Yorker between Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk.
[02:16:50.020 --> 02:16:52.020]   Elon's texting him.
[02:16:52.020 --> 02:16:57.020]   Mark, I got some bad news because on that SpaceX rocket which exploded
[02:16:57.020 --> 02:17:02.020]   was a $200 million satellite for internet.org.
[02:17:02.020 --> 02:17:07.020]   We don't really need the weird music.
[02:17:07.020 --> 02:17:09.020]   I don't see a drone anywhere there.
[02:17:09.020 --> 02:17:12.020]   That would be pretty terrible if that were the case.
[02:17:12.020 --> 02:17:13.020]   Poor Elon Musk.
[02:17:13.020 --> 02:17:17.020]   I think that's actually going to be a big hardship for SpaceX.
[02:17:17.020 --> 02:17:18.020]   Nobody was in it.
[02:17:18.020 --> 02:17:20.020]   It wasn't even being launched.
[02:17:20.020 --> 02:17:22.020]   It was just being tested.
[02:17:22.020 --> 02:17:24.020]   However, the most-
[02:17:24.020 --> 02:17:25.020]   That's why we test.
[02:17:25.020 --> 02:17:26.020]   That's why you test.
[02:17:26.020 --> 02:17:28.020]   And make it better.
[02:17:28.020 --> 02:17:30.020]   Mark's not happy.
[02:17:30.020 --> 02:17:32.020]   But they got insurance, right?
[02:17:32.020 --> 02:17:34.020]   You do insure satellites, yes.
[02:17:34.020 --> 02:17:36.020]   Must cost a lot to get satellite insurance.
[02:17:36.020 --> 02:17:40.020]   Yeah, I was looking at a common thread on that.
[02:17:40.020 --> 02:17:43.020]   It depends on, because I think it was 95 million.
[02:17:43.020 --> 02:17:47.020]   I guess you've got to figure out how much do you insure it for.
[02:17:47.020 --> 02:17:49.020]   It's like 10 million and it's worth it, right?
[02:17:49.020 --> 02:17:53.020]   If it's like 50 million or 80 million, I'm like meh.
[02:17:53.020 --> 02:17:54.020]   Yeah.
[02:17:54.020 --> 02:17:56.020]   Let's face it.
[02:17:56.020 --> 02:17:58.020]   Facebook can't afford it.
[02:17:58.020 --> 02:17:59.020]   Right.
[02:17:59.020 --> 02:18:00.020]   Cannot.
[02:18:00.020 --> 02:18:01.020]   Can.
[02:18:01.020 --> 02:18:02.020]   Oh, yeah, of course, possibly.
[02:18:02.020 --> 02:18:03.020]   That's like cigarette.
[02:18:03.020 --> 02:18:04.020]   That's like cigarette.
[02:18:04.020 --> 02:18:05.020]   That's Mark's cigarette money for the year.
[02:18:05.020 --> 02:18:07.020]   No, the face was supposed to do when we build it again.
[02:18:07.020 --> 02:18:10.020]   Yeah, but this is also a big strategic effort for them.
[02:18:10.020 --> 02:18:11.020]   Right.
[02:18:11.020 --> 02:18:12.020]   Like kidding.
[02:18:12.020 --> 02:18:14.020]   And he was in Africa to celebrate this, right?
[02:18:14.020 --> 02:18:16.020]   Because that's where it was going to work.
[02:18:16.020 --> 02:18:17.020]   Okay.
[02:18:17.020 --> 02:18:18.020]   Okay.
[02:18:18.020 --> 02:18:19.020]   I'm going to let you off the hook.
[02:18:19.020 --> 02:18:20.020]   You've done a wonderful job.
[02:18:20.020 --> 02:18:24.020]   There are so many more stories we could talk about, but golly after two hours.
[02:18:24.020 --> 02:18:25.020]   Who cares?
[02:18:25.020 --> 02:18:26.020]   And it's Labor Day.
[02:18:26.020 --> 02:18:30.020]   And it's Labor Day and you're slaving on Labor Day.
[02:18:30.020 --> 02:18:31.020]   What are you going to do, Stacey?
[02:18:31.020 --> 02:18:33.020]   You're going to have a Austin barbecue?
[02:18:33.020 --> 02:18:34.020]   Yep.
[02:18:34.020 --> 02:18:36.020]   Tomorrow barbecue and swimming.
[02:18:36.020 --> 02:18:37.020]   Oh, what fun.
[02:18:37.020 --> 02:18:39.020]   What will be the adult beverages served?
[02:18:39.020 --> 02:18:41.020]   Because I could be there.
[02:18:41.020 --> 02:18:46.020]   Oh, what do you stop like?
[02:18:46.020 --> 02:18:47.020]   Oh my God.
[02:18:47.020 --> 02:18:49.020]   Do you hate me?
[02:18:49.020 --> 02:18:52.020]   No, I'm just having fun with you.
[02:18:52.020 --> 02:18:54.020]   First you don't follow me on Twitter.
[02:18:54.020 --> 02:18:55.020]   Now you try to kill me.
[02:18:55.020 --> 02:18:56.020]   No, it's done.
[02:18:56.020 --> 02:18:57.020]   No, that'll be fun.
[02:18:57.020 --> 02:18:58.020]   I think that'll be a lot of fun.
[02:18:58.020 --> 02:19:00.020]   How about you, Christina and Manhattan?
[02:19:00.020 --> 02:19:02.020]   What do you, what do you, or you're in Brooklyn?
[02:19:02.020 --> 02:19:03.020]   You're in Brooklyn.
[02:19:03.020 --> 02:19:05.020]   What do Brooklynites do on Labor Day?
[02:19:05.020 --> 02:19:06.020]   That means similar drinking.
[02:19:06.020 --> 02:19:08.020]   So there will be some drinking.
[02:19:08.020 --> 02:19:10.020]   I can't drink too much because I've got a 7 a.m.
[02:19:10.020 --> 02:19:12.020]   flight on Wednesday or Tuesday.
[02:19:12.020 --> 02:19:14.020]   You got somewhere to be on Wednesday?
[02:19:14.020 --> 02:19:15.020]   Yeah.
[02:19:15.020 --> 02:19:16.020]   Yeah, I got somewhere to be.
[02:19:16.020 --> 02:19:17.020]   The Apple event.
[02:19:17.020 --> 02:19:20.020]   So I've got to fly out on Tuesday for that.
[02:19:20.020 --> 02:19:23.020]   So, but there will be some day drinking tomorrow for sure.
[02:19:23.020 --> 02:19:28.020]   We will get some cameras down there to the Bill Graham Memorial Auditorium.
[02:19:28.020 --> 02:19:30.020]   Maybe we can catch you as you come out.
[02:19:30.020 --> 02:19:31.020]   Yeah, that'd be great.
[02:19:31.020 --> 02:19:35.020]   Yeah, as soon as I'm done with my hands on and time with that stuff.
[02:19:35.020 --> 02:19:37.020]   That's the reason to go because there are a couple of things.
[02:19:37.020 --> 02:19:42.020]   Andy and I go as always says, you want to kind of watch the kind of the gestalt of the executives
[02:19:42.020 --> 02:19:45.020]   as they're talking and announcing that can maybe read between the lines there.
[02:19:45.020 --> 02:19:48.020]   But also the hands on afterwards is always of interest.
[02:19:48.020 --> 02:19:52.020]   That's the real value because the live log anybody can do for you.
[02:19:52.020 --> 02:19:54.020]   Anybody can do from remote.
[02:19:54.020 --> 02:19:58.020]   And that is we're going to watch the stream together and we'll see all of that.
[02:19:58.020 --> 02:19:59.020]   Exactly.
[02:19:59.020 --> 02:20:03.020]   And so the real thing, the real reason you go is for the hands on time.
[02:20:03.020 --> 02:20:08.020]   Just be able to offer your impressions and get photos and do Facebook lives and all that stuff.
[02:20:08.020 --> 02:20:12.020]   Oh, Dr. Let me see Lee as Halloween costume one more time.
[02:20:12.020 --> 02:20:16.020]   It looked like she had an actual Katana sword in her hand.
[02:20:16.020 --> 02:20:17.020]   She did.
[02:20:17.020 --> 02:20:21.020]   Actually, Casa's sitting over there and the sword is like right here.
[02:20:21.020 --> 02:20:22.020]   It's on the floor.
[02:20:22.020 --> 02:20:24.020]   You're giving your daughter a sword?
[02:20:24.020 --> 02:20:27.020]   Oh my God.
[02:20:27.020 --> 02:20:29.020]   Oh my geez Louise.
[02:20:29.020 --> 02:20:30.020]   Okay.
[02:20:30.020 --> 02:20:31.020]   Good.
[02:20:31.020 --> 02:20:32.020]   Good.
[02:20:32.020 --> 02:20:33.020]   That's good.
[02:20:33.020 --> 02:20:34.020]   That's good.
[02:20:34.020 --> 02:20:35.020]   She's been handling sources.
[02:20:35.020 --> 02:20:36.020]   She was four.
[02:20:36.020 --> 02:20:37.020]   She's a pro.
[02:20:37.020 --> 02:20:38.020]   Wow.
[02:20:38.020 --> 02:20:40.020]   Christina, do me a favor?
[02:20:40.020 --> 02:20:41.020]   Yes.
[02:20:41.020 --> 02:20:44.020]   Pour some out for my homies and the headphone jack when you're out there.
[02:20:44.020 --> 02:20:47.020]   I'll pour some out for my phone.
[02:20:47.020 --> 02:20:50.020]   Just pull a little Wayne for us there.
[02:20:50.020 --> 02:20:53.020]   Just a little to the corner liquor store wherever it just went out there.
[02:20:53.020 --> 02:20:54.020]   Get your 40.
[02:20:54.020 --> 02:20:55.020]   Yeah, get your 40.
[02:20:55.020 --> 02:20:56.020]   Get your 40.
[02:20:56.020 --> 02:20:57.020]   Molt liquor.
[02:20:57.020 --> 02:21:03.020]   Oh, and besides plugging the fact that I am on the Dr. Cas, what's it called?
[02:21:03.020 --> 02:21:04.020]   Ductails.
[02:21:04.020 --> 02:21:05.020]   Ductails.
[02:21:05.020 --> 02:21:06.020]   I love that name.
[02:21:06.020 --> 02:21:07.020]   Yeah.
[02:21:07.020 --> 02:21:08.020]   Tell us the word.
[02:21:08.020 --> 02:21:09.020]   And you get that IQMZ.com.
[02:21:09.020 --> 02:21:10.020]   Anything else you want to plug?
[02:21:10.020 --> 02:21:14.020]   No, I just want to plug Supreme Happiness and Joy.
[02:21:14.020 --> 02:21:16.020]   I'm trying to get some positivity back in my world.
[02:21:16.020 --> 02:21:17.020]   Yes.
[02:21:17.020 --> 02:21:18.020]   That's what happened.
[02:21:18.020 --> 02:21:22.020]   I was going to say earlier, don't ever feel bad for me because my life is great.
[02:21:22.020 --> 02:21:24.020]   I get to sit here and suffer with you on a Labor Day.
[02:21:24.020 --> 02:21:25.020]   I mean, enjoy myself.
[02:21:25.020 --> 02:21:26.020]   I never feel bad for you guys.
[02:21:26.020 --> 02:21:28.020]   You were just on a Labor Day weekend.
[02:21:28.020 --> 02:21:30.020]   You were just, you're full of life.
[02:21:30.020 --> 02:21:34.020]   And I'm going out tonight and going to go have some drinks later and have some drinks tomorrow.
[02:21:34.020 --> 02:21:35.020]   And you got to come here.
[02:21:35.020 --> 02:21:40.020]   You got to come here because we had, you remember we had your body outline on the wall in the
[02:21:40.020 --> 02:21:41.020]   old place.
[02:21:41.020 --> 02:21:42.020]   And you couldn't bring that with you.
[02:21:42.020 --> 02:21:43.020]   We could bring that wall with us.
[02:21:43.020 --> 02:21:44.020]   Huh?
[02:21:44.020 --> 02:21:46.020]   What did you do with all those signatures?
[02:21:46.020 --> 02:21:47.020]   They're still there.
[02:21:47.020 --> 02:21:48.020]   They're gone.
[02:21:48.020 --> 02:21:50.020]   Not really important people sign that wall.
[02:21:50.020 --> 02:21:51.020]   I know.
[02:21:51.020 --> 02:21:54.020]   We had Nolan Bushnell drew a pong.
[02:21:54.020 --> 02:21:55.020]   I know.
[02:21:55.020 --> 02:21:56.020]   I know.
[02:21:56.020 --> 02:21:57.020]   But the same thing happened to Tech TV.
[02:21:57.020 --> 02:21:58.020]   We had amazing stuff.
[02:21:58.020 --> 02:22:01.020]   Neil Gaiman had come in and drew a sandman cartoon on our set wall.
[02:22:01.020 --> 02:22:03.020]   It's a tradition in studios.
[02:22:03.020 --> 02:22:05.020]   You have people sign the wall.
[02:22:05.020 --> 02:22:08.020]   And when the set's down, it's gone.
[02:22:08.020 --> 02:22:11.020]   I mean, but we can start over by nutrition.
[02:22:11.020 --> 02:22:14.020]   And we have the technology to scan that and then just like, "Ahh, I'm so ready."
[02:22:14.020 --> 02:22:18.020]   Yeah, I was supposed to take pictures and I didn't get around.
[02:22:18.020 --> 02:22:20.020]   There's pictures on the internet.
[02:22:20.020 --> 02:22:22.020]   People sign them all the time because people sign inside my body.
[02:22:22.020 --> 02:22:24.020]   They tell me people were doing that.
[02:22:24.020 --> 02:22:28.020]   We put, oh, Doc, against the wall and I outlined his body with a magic marker.
[02:22:28.020 --> 02:22:30.020]   And then people would sign inside.
[02:22:30.020 --> 02:22:34.020]   It stayed pristine for like a good year than somebody went and sold my image.
[02:22:34.020 --> 02:22:37.020]   Once the dam breaks, it's just out of control.
[02:22:37.020 --> 02:22:38.020]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:22:38.020 --> 02:22:41.020]   We do this week in Tech every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m.
[02:22:41.020 --> 02:22:47.020]   Rainer Shine Holidays Not Accepted, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern Time, 2200 UTC.

[02:23:13.020 --> 02:23:14.020]   Bye-bye.
[02:23:14.020 --> 02:23:23.020]   (Music)
