[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   This is Twit. This week in tech, for May 22nd 2005, episode number six.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.500]   And it looks as though we're in for a splendid afternoon sport.
[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.500]   This the 127th of the last quit of the year, shall we?
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.000]   And now for something completely different. We are all Twits now.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Whoa, that's great! Twit!
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   That's one. Yeah.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Let us get underway, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   It is this week in tech, episode number six.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   And on the line with us, Yoshi.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Hello, yeah, Yoshi. We got Robert Herron.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Hello.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   We also have David Prager joining us for the first time since the pilot.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Hey, David.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Good to talk.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Hey. Patrick Norton is here. At least I see his icon, but I don't see him.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   So he's wandered off. He said he wanted to get a soda.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Maybe he ran out and he's gone down the street to 7-Eleven.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   A little later on, Roger Chang will join us to talk about E3.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   The big game show conference is over, but Roger was there.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Robert was there. David Prager was there. A lot of you were visiting, so we get some input on that.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   And of course your question is coming up.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   And then we're sorry to say Kevin's not with us live today because he's still in Canada.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   I don't know what happened. He went up to do the TV show this week and he never came back.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Maybe he liked it too much. He liked it a lot.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   But we did record. I took him out to the Kit-K club.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   And we recorded his big announcement because there's a couple of big announcements from Kevin Rose coming up later in the show.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Let's take a look though at the top stories of the week starting off with Google.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Google's been very busy, not only with their iGoogle or Google.com/ig.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   I guess it's their answer to Yahoo's, my Yahoo.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   They also have announced that there's some...
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Actually, we'll get the story on this from Yoshi's.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Some things shoes with China. And then Steve Balmer.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   I love this. Gives an interview in Business Week in which he says, "Google, eh, they're a one-hit wonder."
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Yoshi, what's going on with Google and China?
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Well, basically, first of all, Google, I do not think is a one-hit wonder.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   I think that's a safe to say.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   They're opening offices over there because they like Yahoo move over there.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   They want to move their search market into China.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   It does a lot of filtering, that kind of thing.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   They're domestic.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Internet users being able to see outside of China in which websites.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Yahoo actually agreed to censor the results.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   And now there's talk of, "Will Google do the same?"
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   A lot of people are really kind of going, "Hey, Google's like the press.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   They want freedom information. They don't want them to say which information you can get."
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   It kind of brings to... It's like an ethical thing.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Is it right to censor the results?
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   China could say, "No, if you don't do it, we're not going to let you in."
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   China is actively censoring sites right now.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   They're blocking IP addresses.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Oh, yeah, of course.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   They definitely could.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   My feeling is, I think Google should say, "Then fine, don't let us in."
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   It's the biggest market in the world, though, isn't it?
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I mean, billions of people.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   It comes down to, "Is there a company about the ethics and the information they provided?"
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   The reason why people like Google is because you can get a lot of good information.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Or is it just a matter of making a buck?
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Because right now, they're already a huge company.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   They're not a one-hit wonder.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   They're going to be around for a while.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   They've got a lot of good stuff coming up.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Is there such a thing as a 100-hit wonder?
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I don't think so.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Look at Google Labs.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   There's dozens of things.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Has anybody used a new Google portal?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I started playing with it.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   I like it a lot.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   It's really cool.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   It's real simple.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   It's a lot simpler than Yahoo's to guess, which is one of the things I've always liked about
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Google Search Engine.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Well, the thing I like is, as you say, it's simpler.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   So it doesn't clog up your page.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   But it's got news.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   You're going to have slash-statter at the times or wired news of the BBC.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Or Google News.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   It also has a quote of the day, a word of the day.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   You can look at your Gmail box, driving directions, weather, movies.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   It's got access to the Google services.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   My favorite thing is you can drag them around live, which you can't do on Yahoo's.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   So you can rearrange your page, just drag it around.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   That's so slick.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   It is.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   I have it as my home page now.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Yeah, me too.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   How about you, Robert?
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Have you looked at it?
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   I haven't used that particular service yet, but Google's actually one of the Google lab tools
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.400]   I use is their search tool that allows you to suggest beta, where it types in and fills
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.040]   in the characters as you're typing.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.120]   Then the other cool thing related to the new mapping function is that have you seen the
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.000]   site that basically married Craigslist to Google Maps?
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   It allows you-- I love that.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.400]   You can do home searches, apartment searches, anything you like, and you can even overlay
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.880]   the satellite information that they acquired from Keyhole.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.040]   It makes sense because if you're doing a Craigslist search for a rental, it'll generate a Google
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.120]   map with pins in it for all the rentals that are available.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.040]   You click on that pin, so you know where they are.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.880]   And like you said, you mentioned the ease of the interface where you can't click and
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.040]   drag around.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:00.040]   And it's such a simple thing, but at the same time, it makes it so easy to use.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.360]   What-- this Google suggests is kind of cool.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.360]   What do you think of this?
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.960]   The ender and sleepy, dopey, grumpy, and then it fills in the rest of the seven doors.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:07.960]   I did try.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.880]   I have to say I tried Patrick, Leo, Kevin, and nothing happens.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.880]   So it's not perfect.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.480]   I guess we're not on the list.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.320]   Is there a submission system for that?
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.960]   Yeah, submit to Google.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.320]   That's the submission.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.880]   There's a Google ride finder now.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.400]   You can find taxis, limerzines, or shuttles, and locate them in real time.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.400]   Don't you love this?
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.400]   One hit wonder.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.680]   You notice that it's also perfectionists because they keep everything in beta forever
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.200]   until they have it to their satisfaction.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.280]   Gmail's still in beta.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.280]   Everything still but it is.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.200]   I don't wonder if Microsoft's kind of salty of some of their people going over to Google
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.520]   with all the talk of the Google OS.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.960]   Well do you think there'll be a-- what is the deal on Google OS?
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.960]   You think they'll do that?
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.120]   I think it's paperware at this point.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.760]   But there are definitely some of the people that have gone over to Google from Microsoft.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.520]   Look at the list, the job listings on the Google Labs.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.920]   If you're passionate about these topics, you should work at Google.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.360]   Look what they're looking into.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:10.720]   Artificial intelligence, computer architecture, computer graphics, data compression and mining,
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:17.440]   internal system design, genetic algorithms, machine learning, profiling, robotics.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.280]   This is stuff they want to do.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.960]   Sounds like the beginnings of an operating system if you ask.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.760]   Especially this file system.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:29.440]   I mean unless they're going to do a Google FS, what's that about?
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.360]   I never know.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.360]   I'm looking forward to seeing one.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.120]   Well Google FS is what their entire search, their entire cluster of computers is based
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:43.000]   upon multiple redundancy, cheap boxes.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.920]   So they're doing in-house you think.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.840]   Is there a file system?
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.840]   Yeah definitely.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.840]   Yeah it's for it.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.080]   But it'd be interesting to see for enterprise class solutions.
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.280]   You know, it could be a real challenge.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.600]   I have to say, I mean I think what we're really seeing, when you see BOMR do something
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:09.400]   like that, what you're really seeing is Microsoft admitting that they don't have anything.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.360]   They've got another year before their operating system update, they've got another year before
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.160]   office.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.120]   It's time to spread the fud.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.120]   Right?
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.040]   Rod, Patrick Moore in his ear, ladies and gentlemen, sorry about that Patrick.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.560]   I don't know, we kind of messed up somehow.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.040]   Oh I, it turned the backlogged in on the machine downstairs.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.040]   Oh okay.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.240]   Strange and unfortunate things happened.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.360]   We're still a little crackly on us so we'll see if we can fix that up.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.240]   I want to apologize to everybody by the way, we're still doing this in Skype as you probably
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:45.160]   can tell until we get the recorders, they didn't arrive yet so.
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.640]   But maybe by next week we'll have it all good.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.080]   I'm going to be in New Orleans next week, I don't know how we're going to do the show
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.080]   by the way.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.080]   No Orleans.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.080]   No Orleans.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.520]   Can we do the show a day late because of Memorial Day weekend?
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.520]   Oh.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.520]   Monday, Thursday afternoon.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.520]   That'd be perfect.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.000]   I'd say so everyone, no one's driving into work one day anyway.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   That's right.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   But they're driving.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   There's, thank you Yoshi.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.560]   The Spin Meister.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:12.480]   Item number two, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to talk about YMAX.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.720]   David Prager is excited about new Wi-Fi and CDMA solutions.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:22.400]   Do I get to mock David since I've written like four columns on YMAX in the last three
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.400]   weeks?
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.140]   Oh David.
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.480]   You guys will be in complete agreement.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.800]   No I'm interested to talk about it.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.560]   I am not necessarily too ecstatic about it.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.560]   Really?
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:35.560]   Why not?
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.280]   Well and this, the, the, the, the upgrades, the upload speed isn't really as quick but
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.400]   I have been using some of these 3G systems on the CDMA back building.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.960]   I'm just, I'm really impressed with really being able to go anywhere.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:47.960]   You think this is far as out.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.960]   Wait, wait.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.320]   You think this is all talking about, are you talking about 3G or are you talking about
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.320]   YMAX David?
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:57.560]   No, I'm talking about 3G and I only brought it up because of the fact that all this stuff
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.800]   is about 802.11n and what they're going to ratify is, is been in the forefront.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.280]   And I've been using this Verizon 3G service.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.760]   Well you're in LA.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.640]   You're lucky because the 3G in LA is amazing.
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.520]   Well are you using the EVDO stuff?
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.520]   Yep.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.520]   Cool.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.520]   It's, it's pretty fast.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:18.600]   Isn't it in fact fast enough so you can watch TV at 30 frames a second on your cell phone.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.600]   Uh huh.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.760]   Well the reason, the reason I was trying is because we're trying to, uh, we're trying
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.200]   to fly a kite on the beach and put it on, on the, uh, on the internet.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.360]   And so we thought we need to get something in the middle of nowhere that gives us broadband
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.360]   and that's what we thought.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.360]   How do you follow Verizon?
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.200]   How do you follow a radio website?
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.440]   It's a, somebody's butt.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.360]   Well you fly a kite on the beach with a website.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.360]   No, something like that.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.440]   No, Verizon says you're not supposed to serve this stuff but we'll let you try it for this
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.160]   stunt purpose, for the stunt's sake.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.160]   Yeah.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.160]   So you're going to use EDVO to serve a, to do a web server.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.160]   Yeah.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.800]   Now of course the uptime isn't as good as the down.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.400]   And of course it's nowhere near the throughput of the YMAX but it's still getting, you know,
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.680]   significantly faster than any kind of dial up you'll ever get and you can get it just
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.680]   about anywhere.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.920]   No, you can get it in 34 markets.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:01.920]   Right.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:02.920]   But they're rolling it out fast.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:03.920]   More and more markets very quickly.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:04.920]   Verizon, where they are.
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:05.920]   Oh they are.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.600]   I mean, it, you know, if you can get it in Providence, Rhode Island now, I mean, it's
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.800]   pretty amazing that you can get it.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:16.120]   No, I mean, they've, they've, they've got 34 really weird market choices.
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.800]   I mean, that's what's odd about where they rolled it out because they didn't roll it out
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.400]   in San Francisco and they didn't roll it out in the couple other major.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:26.480]   Patrick, remember cable modems which were rolled out in Fremont, which is a small town
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.600]   in Silicon Valley years before they rolled out San Francisco.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.320]   In fact Comcast didn't roll out cable in San Francisco, came one of San Francisco to
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.320]   way late.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.320]   Yeah.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.120]   So I think that there, you know, there may be good legitimate market reasons.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:42.400]   I know com, I know at home didn't do it because they didn't want to be swamped.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.400]   They wanted to slowly grow the network and that may well be what Verizon's thinking.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:51.160]   I'll be in a, I'm just going to see how long it takes them to, to really upgrade the rest
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.600]   of their network with that.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.600]   Hot item right now.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.800]   And I know Patrick, you'll have something to say about this.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.160]   Yahoo announced this week that Yahoo will have music.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:06.240]   We'll have unlimited downloads for $5 a month, $4.99 when you sign up for a year.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.880]   That brings the, you know, the cost of music down to practically nothing.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.280]   Well, do you hear what Mark students said about that?
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.280]   Yeah.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.280]   I love it.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:21.520]   Mark Cuban said that, well, if you, if you get an unlimited number of, of, you know,
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:28.200]   legal music downloads, that means the RIAA can no longer sue anybody for more than $5
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.200]   per month.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.600]   They were violating, you know, peer to peer file trading because obviously the value of
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:37.000]   the music of an unlimited amount of music is $5 per month indefinitely.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.480]   What are they going to charge you for damages?
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.480]   Five bucks.
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.480]   Oh my gosh.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.040]   He owes us $60.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.560]   Now the issue, of course, the issue, and I asked a lawyer about this and you're right
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:53.120]   that the punitive, that compensatory damages and now, now effectively $5 a month because
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.240]   that's how much it's worth.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:58.720]   But they still go for statutory damages and punitive damages.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.120]   So you could, this doesn't let you off the hook.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:05.280]   But what it means, and this explains why the record companies in the movie industry go
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:10.920]   to Congress with bags of money because they need there to be statutory penalties so that
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.960]   they can get some, you know, these lawsuits carry some weight.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:14.960]   But you're right.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.200]   Five bucks a month.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.200]   What's it worth?
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.240]   But he said the files were legal.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.240]   They're legal, man.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.040]   They nailed me on statutory file trading.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.440]   Yeah, you don't want to go to prison for that, man.
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.920]   They really treat you poorly.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.680]   Oh, he's a file trader.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:31.880]   Go get him.
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.720]   You're my bitch now, baby.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.520]   So here's the question.
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.440]   So you can get on Rhapsody.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.200]   It's what $14 a month, but Rhapsody lets you play on three different computers and your
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.480]   MP3 player.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.400]   If it has this Microsoft place for sure on it.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.560]   Yahoo, one computer, any MP3 player with plays for sure.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.040]   Now that's not a huge set.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.560]   Which would you choose?
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:57.240]   Five bucks a month, one computer, 14 bucks a month, three computers.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:01.560]   Well, I mean, you know, it's kind of a swamp, by the way.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.400]   I think Yahoo is mostly going to get people who are really loyal and really in the Yahoo
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.400]   more than anything else.
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.400]   I'm attracted to it.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:13.240]   Don't you think it makes me want to swap my iPod for a creative?
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.240]   No.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.240]   Have you used the creative?
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:21.600]   By the way, by the way, 192 kilobit WMA.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.600]   That's pretty good quality.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.600]   Is it only WMA?
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.800]   Yeah, I'd like to see it.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.800]   I'd like to see it.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.800]   I'd like to see it.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.880]   It's my for iTunes to start upgrading the quality or downloads.
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.120]   Predictions for you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.960]   Well, I just know Lady in here, but if there were, I would have a prediction for her too.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.640]   Next month, WDC, I think Apple's going to pull a switch.
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:42.040]   I think Apple has to do a subscription model now on iTunes Music Store.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.880]   I think they're going to, and in order to do that, they have to announce new iPods.
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.800]   I think they will, and I think they may well do a video iPod this next month.
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:50.800]   What do you think?
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.080]   Well, they're already offering video through iTunes.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.080]   Exactly.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.120]   They upgrade iTunes to 4.8.
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.200]   All of a sudden it shows video.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.840]   What do you think?
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.840]   The clues are there?
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.200]   I guarantee they're releasing a video iPod.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.560]   I don't think they're doing it next month.
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:06.840]   I'd be surprised with it that quick.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.440]   Maybe August and Macworld.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.440]   Yeah.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.440]   Well, there's two.
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:15.320]   Last year at the De-conference, which is the Wall Street Journal Conference for Technology
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:20.160]   Executives, is when they announced the airport express.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:25.280]   I think what's going to happen, a lot of people are saying that the next iPod major development
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.920]   is going to be wireless headphones, which I've heard from two or three different directions.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:34.960]   There are a lot of people who are saying that Steve is still really, really down on creating
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:35.960]   a video iPod.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:40.960]   A lot of people don't think that there's the cooperation there from the motion picture
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.960]   studios.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.960]   It'll be interesting to see what they come up with.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:49.040]   The other thing, the other really strong rumor is that they're going to do WMA support on
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:54.960]   the iPod, which I can't believe, but on the flip side it's a really interesting idea.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.480]   Supposedly they're going to do WMA and Aug-Orbus support.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.600]   You said that they have the hooks in there, but it's not connected to anything yet.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.600]   Somebody told me that, wasn't it?
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.600]   I couldn't understand what you were saying.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.840]   Somebody told me, I don't remember if it was you, Patrick, that the hooks are in there,
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.840]   the icons are in there.
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.840]   They just haven't hooked them up to anything.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:15.280]   Yeah, some people notice in 4.8, there's some undeveloped links in there that have some
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.520]   interesting problems in Aug-Orbus and WMA.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.720]   I think they want to do it early in the summer because I think they want to get the college
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:27.640]   kids a summer long buying spree, don't you think?
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:33.960]   Well, did anybody see Hillary Rodden's column she did online where she was whining because
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.400]   the iPod and iTunes are a closed system?
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.840]   Well, she's right.
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.240]   If you're an iPod user, you're stuck with the iTunes Music Store.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.400]   And vice versa, if you have the iTunes Music Store, you've got to buy an iPod.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:50.440]   I think she's, I mean, I don't know what her dog is in this hunt, but I think she's
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.440]   right.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:56.840]   Well, she was upset that she couldn't WMA encoded tunes on an iPod.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.400]   That would be a big component.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.080]   Steve, free my music.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.080]   Free the music.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.320]   Yeah, well, I ain't going to ever be free.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:06.120]   And it's Hillary Rodden and people like her that are keeping it from being that way.
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.120]   Where is she now?
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.720]   She left the RIAA.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.240]   Is she a consultant now or what she doing?
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.240]   Lobbyist?
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.240]   I don't know what she does.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.400]   Let's do a quick search on Google.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:21.000]   You missed our Google discussion, but we've decided that Google is not a one-hit wonder.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.840]   So, this is what I think, Microsoft's just kind of on the offensive.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.600]   And I mean, they're offensive.
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.960]   You get bombers saying Google's a one-hit wonder a couple of weeks ago.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.280]   You got Gates saying the iPod's a one-hit wonder.
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.040]   I think this is wishful thinking at this point.
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:39.640]   Well, Google talks is a big friend to the iPod.
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.640]   Good point.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.640]   Hey, you know what?
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.600]   It's time to get our E3 Roundup from a Roger Chang.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.200]   So, David, that means I'm going to put you out to pasture.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.200]   I want to thank you for joining us.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.200]   What are you doing these days?
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.920]   You're still at the G4, yes?
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:17:01.120]   Yeah, still working there on the current incarnation of screen savers.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.120]   Attack of the show.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.120]   Attack of the show.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.120]   Ratings are good.
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.120]   I understand.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.120]   They've gone up significantly.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:09.360]   So, it's really interesting to see how it's going.
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:12.240]   So, and of course, the CEO is pleased.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:18.360]   Well, we're going to have you be a regular, I know, on the Twitcast down the road.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.840]   I have to say right now we have this issue with Skype, which we can only get five people
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:22.840]   in here.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:28.440]   In order to get our CES coverage in from Roger Chang, I have to let you go.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.440]   But thanks for being here.
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:36.360]   Be sure and ask Robert here to get his cousin's input on E3 as well.
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.360]   It's cousin's.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.360]   Who's your cousin?
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.520]   Oh, my cousin works for G4.
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.520]   Oh.

[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.280]   Take care.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.280]   All of us together now.
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.280]   One more time.

[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:27.280]   He's a great guy.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:36.280]   The thing is, especially in the video game industry, is like, you know, as all very media-hyped industries are, you know, it's the numbers, it's those key words.
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:47.280]   Nintendo referred to as two to three times more powerful than the GameCube, well, so I was saying that the PS3 was on orders of ten times more powerful.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:51.280]   I mean, than the PS2, I mean, it's very semantic oriented.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.280]   You know, what does that mean, ten times more powerful?
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:24:01.280]   But when people pick up on just the numbers to ten, they're three, and then they start thinking, well, you know, the PS3 is going to be ten times more powerful than the PS2.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.280]   So it's better.
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.280]   Yeah, I mean, so, you know...
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:07.280]   The article I saw said it was 35 times more powerful than the PS2.
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.280]   Yeah, and my daddy can beat up your daddy.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.280]   And it's two teraflops.
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.280]   How many teraflops are you?
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.280]   You little wimp boy.
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:22.280]   Yeah, you know, I doubt any of those teraflops would be able to calculate, you know, any engineering, you know, you know, show you.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.280]   You know, you know, stress test, you know, the C, C where...
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.280]   So which is the better machine?
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:41.280]   Is it the three-point two gigahertz, three-point two gigahertz power PCs plus a 500 megahertz ATI in the Xbox 360, or the cell processor running at three plus gigahertz in the white-face.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.280]   You know, it's...
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:43.280]   How do you decide?
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.280]   I mean, they're different architectures.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:54.280]   I mean, you know, you have a multi-core G5 and one that you have not only a power PC derivative, but basically entirely new cell.
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:59.280]   No one's ever kind of seen that before in a home entertainment device.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:05.280]   You know, the expectations are high, but, you know, the expectations high were for the PS2 when they announced the emotion engine.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:09.280]   Everyone was expecting to be bold over and when it came out, you know, people...
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:18.280]   People are having, you know, developers having, you know, the first games are always going to be kind of, you know, a little shot at it because developers haven't had time to exploit the power.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.280]   You know, it's been what?
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.280]   Four, five years later.
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:23.280]   The first year of the PS2, it took them to figure out how to program to it.
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.280]   It was so hard to find.
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.280]   It was so hard to find.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.280]   The game's got spectacular.
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:29.280]   Do you see anything about the type of cooling they're going to use also?
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.280]   I heard there were some rumors of liquid cooling.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:44.280]   I didn't hear any specifics and I don't want to draw any conclusions, you know, just saying like, yeah, that's going to have, you know, a huge water vat cooler that connects to your refrigeration unit in your kitchen.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.280]   The kitchen...
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:51.280]   You've got to get an ounce of a new video card, though, that's on their site, I believe, right now that offers liquid metal cooling.
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:52.280]   It's the new XA50.
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.280]   You got mercury running through?
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:26:00.280]   It's some, you know, metal alloy that supposedly can transfer heat 60 times or 65 times better than water.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.280]   I want to upset that liquid so again.
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:07.280]   They developed something like that for nuclear reactors, so they found out it was unreliable.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.280]   But...
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.280]   What about...
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:10.280]   I love Roger.
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:16.280]   He's like the only... he reads Jane's, you know, military guides for bedtime re...
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:17.280]   What?
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.280]   History channel, but...
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.280]   Why, yes, they did use that in the 1942.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.280]   So let me ask you this.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:31.280]   The rumor was that Microsoft's kiosk demos of the Xbox 360 weren't running on an Xbox, but running on Apple Max, G5.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:40.280]   Yeah, I personally did not... was not able to get out there because I was literally... I was a chain, but figuratively I was chained to my booth.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.280]   But yeah, people were saying that a lot of the demos were not running.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.280]   How about Sony's? Were they real?
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:50.280]   That was... they just showed the video. They had no box to show other than the announcement they made.
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:55.280]   There was no hardware. And that's where Microsoft is trying... I think they're trying to leverage is like,
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.280]   "Hey, we have a tangible product that you can touch that will work."
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.280]   I mean, even the pre...
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.280]   But it is an Apple Macintosh.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:06.280]   Yeah, well, you know, it's a surprising thing and I probably shouldn't let this out.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.280]   Go ahead, tell us.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:14.280]   A lot of the games that I've seen so far are all running on development units.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:19.280]   None of it is the official... this is the final Xbox 360.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.280]   You expect that.
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:32.280]   So it's not surprising to see that at E3. It's because they're either working out the games or figuring out how to produce this in mass quantities without costing Microsoft an arm and a leg.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.280]   When is the Xbox 360 hit the...
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:38.280]   Supposed to come out this fall basically in time for the holiday shopping season.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.280]   And it's not till March of next year for the PlayStation 3.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:47.280]   Yeah, and it remains to be seen if what the price went for the PS3 will be.
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:53.280]   Most people are probably speculating around 300 bucks because any more than that you're going to price yourself out of the market.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.280]   Sales of the PSP still robust?
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:01.280]   Yes, PSP, you know, is doing pretty well.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:08.280]   There's nothing... I mean, people have been so used to the Game Boy and then you come out with essentially what is a little downgraded version of the PS2.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.280]   A Dreamcast level, you know, console in your hand.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:17.280]   I mean, the graphics are... I would have to say very, very, very nice.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:20.280]   I love the PSP. We've talked about it before, of course.
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:32.280]   It's great. I mean, the battery life isn't as great as what would expect from a handheld, especially if you're a frequent flyer that has to travel five plus hours on an air...
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.280]   I'm going to make you spend...
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.280]   I'm going to make you spend like four and a half, five hours out of mine.
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.280]   It's been pretty good. I've been happy.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:40.280]   I'm going to make you spend money, guys. Imaginary money on imaginary game consoles.
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:45.280]   Robert Herron, PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360?
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.280]   PlayStation 3.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:47.280]   Yoshi.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.280]   That it out.
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:49.280]   Xbox.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.280]   Xbox.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.280]   How about you, Roger?
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:57.280]   Xbox, just because it supports... it will act as a Windows Media Extender.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.280]   That's really what they're going to do. They put a hard drive in there and they didn't get a hard drive in there.
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:04.280]   And the ability to... I think Microsoft has hit the nail on the head.
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:11.280]   Sony was really pushing the technical specs of their machine and Microsoft was trying to kind of spin the whole...
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.280]   This is what it's going to do for your lifestyle.
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:14.280]   How it's going to fit in.
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.280]   Patrick, Xbox or PlayStation 3?
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:19.280]   Oh, boy.
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.280]   I gave you a tie to the Motor Storm.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:24.280]   What's the one Motor Storm comes out on first?
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:27.280]   I think it's going to be the PS3.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:31.280]   All right, so I've got two PS3s, two Xbox's. I'm going to break the tie.
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:35.280]   It's Xbox, but I might get a PS3 too if you guys look that good.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.280]   You didn't say that. I'm probably going to buy both.
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.280]   Well, both.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.280]   I've had an eye definition output.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:48.280]   So far Microsoft hasn't said how they're going to do it and there is no word for anything like a digital video about like DVI or HDMI.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.280]   They're not going to go on.
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:51.280]   And once again, you're going to have to buy a separate...
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:56.280]   ...in a AV box just to get S-video or even component output.
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.280]   There's going to be no upscaling of DVD content behind it.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:02.280]   I thought it was going to be HD. It's not going to be HD.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:11.280]   It will be capable of HD resolutions, but the only connector on the physical box itself that's somewhat official at this point is a simple composite output.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.280]   Oh, interesting.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:16.280]   But they did do that with the old Xbox where they had a connector and then you could buy a composite component.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:19.280]   Yeah, I mean, they all do the multi-avs because it's cheap.
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.280]   You don't have to build them into it.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.280]   Yeah, still. You think they'd be...
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:23.280]   ...stating flat.
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:30.280]   Yeah, but Sony also says that I'll support two HDTV outputs at the same time for the PS3.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:34.280]   But I mean, is that really realistic? Are you going to expect people to have...
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.280]   Will they be digital or not? That's my real only question.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.280]   You want digital.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.280]   And as long as digital doesn't matter, what kind of connector you have.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:48.280]   But you got to work for what a majority of your audience will have at any one time when they have a digital device.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:51.280]   And one time when they have an Olympic room.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.280]   Oh, it's our Microsoft.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.280]   And you also have to...
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.280]   ...the AP packet will offer that, so...
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.280]   Patrick, go ahead.
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:00.280]   Yeah, but they... I mean, Microsoft also likes to make money on upselling accessories.
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.280]   Right.
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:04.280]   I mean, think of all the accessories that should have been in the box in the Xbox.
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:07.280]   I like the DVD remote control that you had to buy for you.
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.280]   Yeah.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:11.280]   To get the... Well, how about this, though? They're going to have a Blu-ray in the PS3.
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:16.280]   I mean, doesn't that sound like it's your HD DVD player?
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:23.280]   I don't know. Did anyone... Has anyone found out what a majority of the studios have decided on as a format?
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.280]   There's a split.
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.280]   The studio has a split across the two.
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:26.280]   But of course...
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.280]   Sony's going to offer Blu-ray. What else would they do?
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:32.280]   Yeah, I mean, you know, of course they can leverage their studio holdings to that effect.
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:41.280]   I mean, they Blu-ray and then, "Hey, we have Columbia Tri-Star. Why don't we just leverage that entire library of movie content on Blu-ray exclusively?"
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:44.280]   And that way we can kind of force it from both ends.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.280]   Well, I'd rather support a format, at least that's out there currently.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:54.280]   And Microsoft's been promising HD Windows Media 9 HD support and SUT-Top devices for a long time now.
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:57.280]   And they're still not there.
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:00.280]   Well, at least you can buy Blu-ray right now in Japan.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:06.280]   This brings us in a nice, smooth segue to our questions portion of the show.
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:12.280]   Now, you guys just stay on and jump in with your answers, whatever you have to say about the questions.
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:16.280]   I'm going to try to get through 20... You want to do 20 questions?
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.280]   Alright.
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:20.280]   Sounds like an old column.
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:25.280]   Which is one of the audience right now. These are all cold questions. We have no idea what's coming.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:29.280]   You know, I was really incensed. I did a podcast interview the other day, and the guy said,
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:33.280]   "Well, when you did the screensavers, of course you had the earpiece, and the guy's telling you the answers on the other end."
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:34.280]   What?
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:35.280]   She said that to you.
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.280]   That made me mad.
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:38.280]   Who said that?
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:41.280]   Oh, it was a podcast interview. And I think that a lot of people think that.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:44.280]   I know, but it's kind of like funny.
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:50.280]   Well, I told him. I said, "If you only knew who was on the other end of those earpieces, you wouldn't say that."
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:56.280]   And then most of the conversation on the earpieces was shut up. Shut up. Speed up. You're killing me here.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.280]   Question number one.
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:03.280]   This is Brennan from Maryland. I'm really glad to hear you're all together again for a show.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:10.280]   I was wondering if he's thought that Sony's announcement that the PlayStation 3 would include iTunes capability,
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:26.280]   coupled with the fact that iTunes is now offering video sales. Meant meant that Sony and Apple were trying to position the PlayStation 3 as a convergence device that might allow consumers to basically buy movies at home,
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:33.280]   and whether that was a real threat to rental services like Blockbuster and Netflix. Thanks, guys. Bye.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.280]   PlayStation 3, convergence device?
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:41.280]   Well, isn't that, I mean, definitely. But they don't have a hard drive in it.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:46.280]   It's, you know, it's both Microsoft and Sony are pushing it as a convergence device.
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:56.280]   You know, Sony wants it from the hardware end because, you know, if you notice with the PSB, what kind of flash memory do you need to buy for the PSB to store your games and store media content?
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:58.280]   Memory stake. Right.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:05.280]   What are they going to make you do when you get a PS3? It's Blu-ray. I mean, it's basically all about consolidating a vertical integrated...
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:09.280]   Makes no sense, though, to do the iTunes music store if you don't have a hard drive.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:14.280]   You know, that's going to have to have some serious form of storage on there. So...
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.280]   How about Blu-ray burner? What do you think?
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:20.280]   How about just an external hard drive that you pay $50 for?
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:23.280]   Or your external hard drive plus your remote control is $150?
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:27.280]   Or, you know, if it is networkable, why not network storage?
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.280]   Ah, there you go.
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:32.280]   Yeah, this is true. And then the big question is, what is their compression going to be?
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:37.280]   Is it going to be the new H264, which is beautiful or lovely, or is it going to be something else?
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:50.280]   Well, I mean, it's kind of interesting as you look at it right now. Microsoft pretty much owns the legitimate online and, you know, kind of splits with divvix, the illegitimate online distribution of feature movies.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:57.280]   You know, you go to MovieLink or whatever. Walmart just gave up on distributing, you know, doing the mail rental DVDs.
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:02.280]   They basically gave it up to Netflix. But I mean, it's like...
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:16.280]   Microsoft has a pretty huge lead negotiating the deals with the studios. I'm kind of curious whether or not, you know, the studios are maybe, you know, are the studios going to go, well, Microsoft may be doing all of our other online stuff, but we'll make everything available on, you know, the iTunes video store.
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:20.280]   Right. If it actually ends up existing because it's got such a good economic model.
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:31.280]   It made the whole thing end up being a moot point with the new competition offering $5 a month front limited downloads that it might be a bundle feature to the PS3, but it could be a very unpopular one.
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:41.280]   I got it. 20 bucks a month. You get PlayStation Live. You get all the music you could listen to. You get networking games. You get, you get maybe video rentals.
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:46.280]   One, not just one flat fee and you get all the stuff. Wouldn't everybody go to Sony if that were the option?
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:56.280]   If for online gaming, Sony's been free to this point. Yes. Yeah, but you know, with online gaming, it's been up to the developers to basically implement all that.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.280]   That was a mistake. Didn't Microsoft eat their lunch because of that?
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:11.280]   Microsoft fan, but I think their model worked better because they had total control. They made sure that whatever game you had that was Microsoft's Live enabled.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:16.280]   You would have a working server to connect to you and have to rely on EA or Ubisoft or someone else.
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:20.280]   That's very true. Maintain a server for everyone to join in. Question two.
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:25.280]   Hey, you guys. This is sharing a restaurant calling from Carrie North Carolina.
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:41.280]   My question for you all this week is do you think that with the league of the Star Wars workprint that came out before the episode three was released in theaters and then there's also popularity in the theaters, which of course, well, knew was going to happen?
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:54.280]   Do you think that that goes to undercut the MPaA position that sharing files is going to hurt the industry? I'm of the opinion. It does nothing but enhance the excitement.
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:59.280]   So I'm watching it with you guys. Thanks. Bye.
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:07.280]   Star Wars in its first weekend, $50 million. Obviously people saw that.
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:16.280]   I haven't seen it yet because I'm not seeing it. So good. So they made $50 million and you guys still haven't seen it. So there's another $50 million to be made next weekend.
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:24.280]   But I think it really depends on the film. You get something as popular as Star Wars that people will go see it three or four times and still download it and still buy the DVDs.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:29.280]   See Star Wars is a weird case. It's a phenomenon. It's not just a movie.
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:36.280]   You get something bad movie and it's not going to make it different. People are going to download it and see it and spread the word that it's crap and no one's going to watch it.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:46.280]   So it's to protect crappy movies. That's mine. I think, you know, really, it's just a way of distribution of movies in general.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:55.280]   The workprint that got out had time code all through it. So big deal, right? I mean, but still it's a workprint. It's better than somebody recorded in a camcorder in the theater.
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:59.280]   Yeah, with half the screen. Yeah. Some guy walking against popcorn.
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:06.280]   I mean, it's funny. Like people say like, you know, oh, I got the divx version of Lord of the Rings special edition.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.280]   Whatever. They just got the textures.
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:12.280]   But I'm one of those people that would actually go out and buy the DVD box.
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.280]   No matter what.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:17.280]   Yeah, because not only for the collection reasons, just because the quality is better.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:20.280]   You know, you want those little plasticine bookends that you get with the Hobbits.
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:23.280]   Yeah. Okay. I got a couple of books to us.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:28.280]   You know, the files on the internet though are ripped from DVDs. So the quality is good.
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:33.280]   Yeah. But they don't upload special features. They don't upload menus.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:36.280]   You know, any of that crap. That's just the movie. That's true.
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:50.280]   And, you know, I still have you found anyone found a really cool set top standalone divx player that won't, you know, I won't have to go through some online store and show money instead of just paying 60 bucks at Best Buy to get a DVD player.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:39:11.280]   I mean, it's just one of those things that for convenience sake, I think people would still choose a medium like DVD or something like iTunes where it's pretty much about thought-off or you don't have to go through a bunch of hurdles in order to get the thing on a freaking disc and then get a player that's compatible with that format to watch it on TV.
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:19.280]   You're not selling the movie or the music anymore. You're selling the experience of where you're seeing it or how you're buying it. That's the value add.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:24.280]   Although I think movie theaters are shooting themselves in the foot by putting ads in front of movies.
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:25.280]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:33.280]   I think that is like the worst idea anyone has ever come up with. I mean, the whole point of going to the movie is to watch something without flaming commercials, right?
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:41.280]   And then you sit there and you watch a Samsung phone commercial, you know, a movie pwns commercial and a bunch of other coca-cola ads that you don't want to say.
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:47.280]   Question from Dorothy. This is the woman who by the way designed our little twit that's on our webpage. I love that little twit guy.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:54.280]   Isn't he cute? I think when he's on his side, I think that's an electrical symbol for it. She told me it was like an inducer or something.
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:40:00.280]   And then you turn him around and he's a little guy. So thank you, Dorothy. We're still the logos. They're still pouring in.
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:06.280]   I don't know if we're going to have more logos or what. We're going to do t-shirts. I'm using a lot of the images throughout the site.
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:09.280]   I'm there all great. So thank you everybody. Here's Dorothy's question.
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:20.280]   Hi, I'd like you to put on your twit visionary caps and ask what is your most optimistic vision of technology impacting on every life and your most pessimistic vision.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:28.280]   And are these visions necessarily mutually exclusive? I don't have a time span, but let's just say within the next decade or two.
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:33.280]   Patrick, you're the... You'll stand in for the pessimist. What do you think?
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:49.280]   Terminator. The machines take over. Oh, man. I've been doing a bunch of reading lately about the whole idea of peak oil, which is the idea that basically this economic downturn where it becomes really expensive to pull oil out of the ground.
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:56.280]   And they thought it would be 40 years from now, but they forgot that there's all these countries coming online and becoming more industrial.
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:09.280]   And China is starting to use huge amounts of crude oil. And the idea that basically life as we know it is going to end because we're going to run out of electricity and fuel to move food over school.
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:16.280]   We'll go back. Essentially, it's going to look like the story has been told in the road warrior.
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:31.280]   If you listen to the beginning of Mad Max, it's basically massive global economic downturn because of the reduction of oil production.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:39.280]   That's what people are driving around the highway, V8. Trying to clean the last gallon of gas from someone.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:49.280]   It's going to be a down. You may as well go down in flames. Why not? And then we're really cool SNM gear. We're at it.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:54.280]   Does anyone have an optimistic vision for the future?
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:42:05.280]   She's right. She hit on a very interesting point where she said the pessimistic and optimistic, not necessarily exclusive. It's going to all happen.
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:17.280]   For certain groups, and these are groups that are probably in the position at least able to deal with it, developing countries, people in economically depressed areas.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:30.280]   People who are in regions that have capital inflow that are based on a knowledge economy will probably be more flexible and more able to deal with it.
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:42.280]   But countries that are resource dependent that are, for example, countries that all they do for revenue is export cold, export raw materials.
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:55.280]   They're going to be more susceptible to the shock because they're that one commodity export market. Coffee beans, all those coffee beans growing countries get hit when there's a glut of coffee.
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:59.280]   There's a price decrease and they have nothing else.
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:02.280]   I don't think Elle Rogers is talking about it. You don't understand what I'm saying?
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:05.280]   Basically, it's this. It's that.
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:12.280]   One sentence, Roger. One sentence. Basically, it's this.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:20.280]   Basically, it's this. That people who are basically well off will be able to deal with any kind of...
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:23.280]   The rich get richer, the poor get poorer.
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.280]   Yes, you are correct.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:30.280]   Robert, what's your scenario for the good old day?
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:34.280]   We're all going to get 1080p televisions and we'll just sit and watch.
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:37.280]   Well, that too, but TV's will continue to get cheaper.
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:42.280]   In the next 10 years, you're going to see flat screens at outrageous sizes for $500.
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:46.280]   Oh, I like that. See, who cares what the rest of the world's going to the hell in a hand basket?
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:50.280]   I got a big TV or even better some form of wallpaper.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:53.280]   We just integrate the display into a wall itself, maybe an organically.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.280]   But anyway, getting back to her question.
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:44:02.280]   For me, it's really about medical advances. The South Koreans right now are just pushing stem cell research into places that everyone was afraid to touch.
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:05.280]   They've been able to create new lines. We couldn't do it in the States.
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:10.280]   Bush said, "You can't create new lines. We've got enough lines." The Koreans figured out a way to do it.
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:17.280]   If you need a way to get up to speed on that subject, PBS has done a few episodes of shows related to that very topic,
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.280]   but get out what it is they're doing.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:23.280]   The biotech revolution is going to make the information revolution look like nothing.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:32.280]   That, and I also feel very small machines is one of those items where you can build on an atomic scale machines to perform certain functions.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:36.280]   That's one of those topics where you can see it as either being very bad or very good.
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:39.280]   Patrick, is Nanotech going to happen?
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:45.280]   Well, Nanotech, the little tiny machines is sort of the extreme forward.
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:59.280]   That's the far end of Nanotech. Right now, it's already starting to show up everywhere from makeup, paint, that technology that essentially was creating thousands of tiny fiberlets on fibers.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:04.280]   You had basically created better coat of attention.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.280]   Yeah, well, it's not even coating.
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:14.280]   By actually modifying the fiber, by creating more surface area, by creating these little tiny fiber fingerlets off each individual fiber strand,
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:19.280]   they apply it with a chemical, but basically what it does is you ever see a cat when you get angry and it puffs out?
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:24.280]   Like imagine doing that to a tinyest form of a cotton.
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:27.280]   I can't wait to write this synopsis for this cat in the morning.
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:29.280]   Puffed up cats.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.280]   But on a simple...
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.280]   What's a cat fancy?
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:40.280]   There was a lady researcher out of, I think, Cornell who developed her in a group came up with a way to take a sphere of gold.
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:46.280]   By varying the thickness of this tiny little sphere, it would shift the color of the wavelength that would bounce back.
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:53.280]   So depending on how big or small or how thick or thin you make the ball itself, you could literally generate any color you wanted.
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:46:03.280]   That was applying to paints and other things as well, but it also had uses in the medical industry where they could actually inject these little balls that would respond to specific forms of laser light.
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:11.280]   They'd inject them into tumors and be able to operate just by shining light and heating and destroying this one area without ever making an incision.
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:15.280]   Guys, I made a pledge that we would keep this thing much shorter from now on.
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:17.280]   It just goes on and on and on.
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:23.280]   And I know it's fun and that nobody wants to stop, but I think people need to have a podcast that's less than four hours long.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:26.280]   So let's move on to the plugs before we...
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:30.280]   Because we have Kevin Rose coming up with his big announcement that he teased us with last week.
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:33.280]   And I think it's a big announcement, so I know everybody's going to want to hear it.
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:38.280]   But before we do that, Yoshi, I know you wanted to mention you've got the new videos out, right?
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:42.280]   Yeah, we released Box 2.0 on Friday, which was our...
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:48.280]   Actually, that video was originally going to be in the video that we're releasing, we're releasing another one on Tuesday.
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:49.280]   Wow.
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.280]   But it got too long.
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:57.280]   So we released that one as a 15-minute stand-alone because it's basically about these kids we found that live their life through the Jedi religion.
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:58.280]   Wow.
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:00.280]   And I'm hosting...
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:01.280]   What's...
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.280]   Go ahead.
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.280]   I just want... Where can people see it?
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:06.280]   Oh, from the shadows.tv.
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:07.280]   From the shadows.tv.
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:12.280]   I'm hosting direct downloads to it that are linkable from there on my site so people can get nice, fast downloads.
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:13.280]   Good.
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:19.280]   And then Tuesdays is vulnerability, and I'm doing another mod in that one, which will be a PSP Wi-Fi mod.
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:21.280]   Ooh, I'm so glad you're still doing mods, Yoshi.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:22.280]   Yes.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:23.280]   That's the...
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:24.280]   That was always the fun...
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:26.280]   The best part of the screen sandwich, so...
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:27.280]   Oh, I enjoyed it.
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:32.280]   And this one's kind of fun because it was presented in the way it's like before, you know, I always had a few minutes to kind of just show it off.
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:35.280]   Now I got to show it being made, which is a lot of fun.
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:36.280]   Very, very cool.
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:39.280]   Robert Herron, anything you want to plug what you up to these days?
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:47.280]   No, still working in the labs at PCMag doing my thing, writing and reviewing HDTV sets and getting them in as fast as possible.
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:53.280]   Other than that, I also have the video project also from the shadows.tv that I think is in box three coming out on Tuesday.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:54.280]   Wow.
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:59.280]   And when I was still down in LA, and hopefully we'll get around to doing some more of that now that I'm up here in the Bay Area.
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:00.280]   That's really great.
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:01.280]   That's really great.
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:02.280]   Fun stuff.
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:05.280]   Yeah, I'm glad you guys are both doing a downloadable video.
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:08.280]   Kevin's going to talk a little bit about System in just a second.
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:13.280]   Patrick, I know we see you on ExtremeIPod.com and Extreme10.com.
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:14.280]   Yeah.
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:16.280]   Anybody out there with an iPod?
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:19.280]   You can win a hundred and twenty free songs from enusic.com.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:21.280]   Send a picture of us with your iPod.
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:30.280]   Don't send Photoshop pictures because if you don't have the rights to the art and we can't prove it, we can't pick your picture no matter how unbelievably cool your photoshopping.
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:35.280]   Hey, I wanted to mention that you've been to Patrick's gonna go to ExtremeIPod.com or the...
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:36.280]   What's that?
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:37.280]   ExtremeIPod.com, yes.
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:38.280]   Let's get that plug in there.
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:43.280]   I just want to mention Patrick, you've been kind of the pollster on the Twit.tv site, which is great.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.280]   And I love these polls.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:46.280]   We keep meaning to talk about the results.
[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:48.280]   The most recent one was "How People Listened."
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:52.280]   Were you surprised that more than half listened on the computer?
[00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:55.280]   I was actually... I was kind of amazed.
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:49:02.280]   I figured there'd be at least 30, 40% listening on the computer, but it ended up being... I think it was 64% last time I checked.
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:03.280]   Let me pull it up.
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:07.280]   I think it says it's now gone down a little bit, but to 69%.
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:13.280]   It's still a huge number, especially compared to portable players, which is only about 43%.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:18.280]   Yeah, well, 33% are on iPods or digital players.
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:23.280]   60% on the computer, 5% burn at the CD, and 2% other.
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:25.280]   So, yeah, I was...
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.280]   What would other people like your cell phone?
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:30.280]   What else could you listen on?
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:37.280]   Well, you could move it with a tape, you could move it to, yeah, your cell phone, you could...
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:38.280]   Somebody had something really in her.
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:39.280]   Let me scroll through.
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:40.280]   Somebody did something really nutty.
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:43.280]   And I'm crazy ways to listen to the broadcast.
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:48.280]   Yeah, we want somebody to cut the Quickcast of vinyl.
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.280]   Or 8-track.
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:53.280]   I want to listen to the Quickcast on 8-track.
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:54.280]   We got to get a vinyl cutter.
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:58.280]   We're going to improve our audio quality before we get it on vinyl, I think.
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:01.280]   I'm just the idea of having a vinyl cutter would be great.
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:03.280]   I like... Oh, yeah.
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:05.280]   Yoshi, you should build a little vinyl cutter.
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:07.280]   That'd be a nice mod.
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:10.280]   It'd be just a big fan camera retro throwback thing.
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:13.280]   Leo World Tour continues on Wednesday.
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:15.280]   I'll be in Athens, Ohio.
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:19.280]   For the Southeast Ohio Macro Media Users Group, we've got a link on the show page.
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:22.280]   If you want to go, I'd love to see you there.
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:25.280]   We're going to have a little meetup for breakfast, and then I'm giving a speech at lunch.
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:27.280]   Registration, including lunch is $25.
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:32.280]   And Wayne and Akron is put together a cafe press store with the Leo World Tour T-shirts.
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:34.280]   Did you see those guys?
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:35.280]   Oh my gosh.
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:39.280]   By the way, proceeds from that store benefit, uh, Twitch.
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:45.280]   So thanks to Wayne for setting that up there, and Tacky for doing the art, which is far from Tacky.
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:48.280]   Any other plugs you guys want to get in?
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:50.280]   Uh, none.
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:52.280]   I have nothing to plug.
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:57.280]   I work 60 to 70 hours a week.
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:59.280]   Don't really have much out of it.
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:02.280]   And Roger, you do the videos, a lot of the videos for GameSpot.
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:07.280]   Yeah, the cool thing for you is that we actually got a lot of HDV.
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:14.280]   We got like four HDV cameras in for that, and we were using Premiere Pro to cut with it.
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:19.280]   It was the first time that I actually used HDV, and it's kind of, it's kind of a cool format.
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:20.280]   I'll say that.
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:27.280]   It's technically an HD spec, but it's a super compressed form of mini-dV.
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:30.280]   You're using the H.364, or what are you?
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:38.280]   It essentially uses MPEG-2 to compress down, and to basically make it fit onto a mini-dV tape,
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:41.280]   it cramps 15 frames into a single frame.
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:46.280]   It matrixes this into a single frame.
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:53.280]   So it's kind of weird because your software actually has to be designed for it, so you just can't use H.G. software.
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:59.280]   You have to use one that's HDV compatible in order to do the editing because it has to pull out those 15 frames.
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.280]   So you can do a frame in it.
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:04.280]   Alright folks, we're going to roll in.
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:08.280]   Don't go away because we'll have some final words in just a bit, but Kevin Rose had a big announcement.
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:11.280]   He said that he wanted to make on the show.
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:20.280]   He can't be here. He's still up in Canada, but we had some time to talk on Thursday night at the lovely KitKat Club in Toronto.
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:24.280]   So here he is. Kevin Rose with the big announcement.
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:28.280]   Here we are at the beautiful KitKat Club in downtown Toronto.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:32.280]   I'm sitting across from Screenstar Kevin Rose.
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:36.280]   He's the babe toy magnet, or the toy babe magnet.
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:37.280]   He's talking about it.
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:39.280]   That all the girls go for.
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:45.280]   The King of the Dark Tip. Kevin, tell your loving and doring audience.
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:49.280]   What is it, this big announcement that you can't be on the Twitter for? What's going on?
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:53.280]   The big announcement is that I'm leaving G4.
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:55.280]   What? I can't leave G4.
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:56.280]   Are they firing you?
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:59.280]   No, they actually tell me truth. It's okay. You can tell us your own friends.
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:09.280]   The truth is I've been in negotiation with them for the last, negotiations with them for the last, probably close to a month now to get out of my contract.
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:11.280]   So what's the deal?
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:13.280]   Well, the deal is I really want to do my own thing.
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:22.280]   It's like I've, for the longest time now, it feels like I've just been doing content that I'm not happy with or haven't been able to get as geeky as I want to get with the content.
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:30.280]   And I miss a lot of the old Screenstar this days, and I just want to get out there and produce and create really solid downloadable tech content for the web.
[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:36.280]   And the only way to do it is to actually have some time to do it, and that's to get out of my contract with G4.
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:43.280]   Well, and the system thing is about to explode, right? I mean, this is really about to take off this new TV on the web site.
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:46.280]   Yeah, it starts Monday, and yeah, that's what I'm seeing all over the place.
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:57.280]   I'm seeing more and more downloadable content, and you know, with IPTV coming up, and all these different little miscellaneous set-top boxes that people are starting to buy, that they can get this all those IP-based content delivered right to their television.
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:00.280]   There's no reason why we just can't create it on our own.
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:04.280]   Wow. Have you started a company for System in all of you?
[00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:13.280]   Yeah, we started a small production company, and we're going to be working on System full-time. There's four of us, myself.
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:14.280]   Who was involved?
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:19.280]   You and Dan Neuard, Keith Harrison, which is the old ScreenSaver's technical director.
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:21.280]   And he added the broken for you, right?
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:22.280]   Right.
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:27.280]   And Ron, who is our chief Linux, Unix guru/tech guy.
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:31.280]   So really, except for Ron, it's the old gang that did the broken.
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:38.280]   Yeah, it's the old gang that did the broken, and we're going to be doing it full-time, putting out as many episodes as we possibly can.
[00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:45.280]   We're going to be selling ad space within the episodes so that, you know, different tech companies can place their ads within.
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:55:00.280]   I'm proud of you. This is pretty bold. I mean, you're really turning your back on a normal, real paying gig, a national television show, to devote your time and energies to something that's fairly speculative, and yet you really believe is the future of television?
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:07.280]   Well, it's just that, you know, you remember when I first started tech TV, I didn't get into this to be on TV. I really didn't want it.
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:08.280]   You weren't on it.
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:14.280]   In fact, you know, tell me, I don't remember. How did you get to tech TV? I don't remember how that happened.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:17.280]   Well, Chris Kraus was working there. A friend of mine.
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.280]   Oh, oh, oh, yeah. He was an IT guy.
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:22.280]   He was an IT guy at tech TV, and he said they had a position open.
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:25.280]   The inventor of the IP chicken website.
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:27.280]   That's right. IP chicken that I got.
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:28.280]   Is that still around?
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:30.280]   He still makes a ton of money off that side.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:31.280]   You're kidding.
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:33.280]   No, I'm so mad. He makes a ton of money off that side.
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:36.280]   Does he do anything else? He just sits there and relaxes at home.
[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:39.280]   He does consulting work from home now, but...
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:42.280]   Okay, so he was a buddy of yours. Did you go to school with him?
[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:45.280]   No, it's just through a common friend.
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:49.280]   He said there's a job in an IT? Or what was the job?
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:54.280]   Well, it was just basically being like the tech guy behind the scenes on the screen, so he was setting up the computers.
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:56:00.280]   Yeah, anytime there was a demo that needed to be done, a scan line that needed to be ran, I was just the guy that took care of it.
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:02.280]   That lasted about a month.
[00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:05.280]   Yeah, that was... I mean, really, you were on the air very quickly.
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:08.280]   Well, start with that vulnerability. Remember that window of vulnerability?
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:10.280]   Was that the first thing you did on the air?
[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:12.280]   Yeah, you had to discover the messenger flaw.
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:17.280]   Right, well, the way to automate it to send out to all those machines, and you were like, "Hey, come on the show and talk about it."
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:18.280]   You're kidding. No, it was you.
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:19.280]   That was your first time? Yeah.
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:21.280]   Well, it wasn't me, but that was the first time.
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:25.280]   Well, you found something fairly significant. And remember we called Microsoft, and that's right.
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:26.280]   That's not a bug.
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:28.280]   And then they patched it in the next release.
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:31.280]   Oh, no. We did that on purpose. That's intentional.
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:32.280]   That's right.
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:37.280]   So I didn't realize it was the first time. And then from there, did you start doing things regularly?
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:39.280]   As far as on the show, yeah.
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:43.280]   Yeah, just eventually, you know, remember I started doing some of the kind of shady hacker type stuff?
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:45.280]   So you were always the dark tipper from day one.
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:46.280]   From pretty much from day one.
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:47.280]   That was call block, same.
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:49.280]   Yeah, I never liked that name.
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:52.280]   You didn't? Well, you know, it's just kind of one of those TV things.
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:54.280]   You know, I mean, I don't want to be called the dark tipper.
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:56.280]   I don't think anybody really wants to be called that.
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:57:02.280]   But, you know, Paul Block, who was the executive producer of The Screensabers, had that TV sensibility.
[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:07.280]   He knew how to do, you know. He knew this is how you marketed. It's how you created a character.
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:08.280]   Right.
[00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:12.280]   So really, we should give him credit, because he was the guy who saw you as being a star.
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:13.280]   Definitely.
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:17.280]   And he did very well. And then, of course, with the acquisition by G4.
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:18.280]   Right.
[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:22.280]   And then I left, actually, even before the acquisition, I left The Screensabers.
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:24.280]   And you took over for me.
[00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:25.280]   Right.
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:26.280]   So it was you and Patrick.
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:27.280]   Uh-huh.
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:29.280]   And then G4 took over, and then it was just you.
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:31.280]   Right. And then it was Alex and myself.
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:32.280]   And then Alex, that's right.
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:35.280]   And then they, the brief Alex Albert Diro, which is what, two months?
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:37.280]   That was a lot of fun, though. I really enjoyed that show.
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:39.280]   That show was great. You know, it was a lot of fun.
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:42.280]   We still got through a lot of techy stuff. We did a lot of product reviews.
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:43.280]   Robert Herron was there in the labs.
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:45.280]   You're still friends with Alex.
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:46.280]   What's that?
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:47.280]   You're still friends, but you might be working with you on system.
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:50.280]   Oh, yeah. We talked, I talked to Alex all the time.
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:51.280]   He's a great guy.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:53.280]   Let's get him on the show.
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:54.280]   Definitely.
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:55.280]   Yeah.
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:57.280]   So, uh, you were doing that.
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:01.280]   At what point did you start to say, this is not where I want to be?
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:07.280]   I think that's, it would, that pretty much happened after they laid off Alex, Dan, Yoshi, and Robert Herron.
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:10.280]   That was, what was that day like? That was terrible day.
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:16.280]   That was, that was a rough day. That was, um, that was probably my worst day at, um,
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:21.280]   on the job. That was just, it was so rough. Cause it was like, these are all some of my best friends.
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:23.280]   Well, and they all came to LA to be part of the show.
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:24.280]   Right. Exactly.
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:26.280]   I mean, that was two or three months later.
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:26.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:27.280]   Oh, no.
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:29.280]   What, what did G4 say? We want a new direction?
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:36.280]   Well, you know, they, you know, I don't think a lot of people would say that G4 like had this master plan to destroy tech TV,
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:40.280]   but I don't think that's the case. I mean, they just wanted, it's a little like slu-sore.
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:41.280]   No, no.
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:43.280]   But, you know, you've seen the forum post on that.
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:49.280]   And it's, and it's not like, that's not what G4 set out to do. I mean, they really wanted the show without a time to take off,
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:55.280]   and it just didn't turn out to be the direction that they wanted. And so, they made modifications, and now it's an entirely different show.
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:56.280]   It's nothing but a new thing.
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:57.280]   It's doing very well by the way.
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:02.280]   Yeah, it's doing great. And it's, it's actually a good show for what it is. You know, I, I enjoy watching it, and I like it.
[00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:05.280]   It's just not the tech stuff that I really want to do.
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:09.280]   Nobody's going to believe me when I say this, but I actually think the tech of the show is a pretty good show.
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:13.280]   The problem that you guys always had was you were being compared to the old spring.
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:14.280]   Right, exactly.
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:21.280]   And there was no way you could succeed on those terms. So, leaving the name behind, starting fresh, was a smart idea.
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:26.280]   Then nobody's comparing you to anything else. How does this show stand on its own? And it's doing much better.
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:26.280]   Right.
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:27.280]   As a result.
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:31.280]   It's doing much better. And, you know, everybody that works on the show, I have to say, like, when I first came down to G4,
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:36.280]   you know, we're kind of looking like, "Oh, you're the G4 people." Like, you know, everyone's kind of stand-offish.
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:42.280]   And then, but they're just a great bunch of guys. I mean, they're creating a great show, and I really like Kevin Perera.
[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:46.280]   He's a great guy. Everybody that works on the show is a really nice guy.
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:51.280]   And, yeah, I am going to miss working with him. I'm going to miss working with that entire crew.
[00:59:51.280 --> 01:00:01.280]   But I'm glad that they finally like, you know, they released me for my contract. Many people don't know that I was bound to G4 for, it was a four years.
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:07.280]   Yeah, four year contract, but I couldn't do anything else. You couldn't even do what you're doing now.
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:15.280]   Yeah, so they let me out and they set me free, which is great. I'm thankful that they did that and they understand.
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:19.280]   I mean, they get it. They know what I want to do. They want to go out there and produce really cool tech stuff.
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:24.280]   And, you know, I'll probably come on the show every once in a while or, you know, to show off some of the cool stuff that I'm doing.
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:27.280]   It's along the same lines of what, you know, that they like.
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:30.280]   Well, I hope you'll come up to a call for help in Canada and join us.
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:34.280]   As you are, that's why you're up here right now and I hope you'll come up more often.
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:35.280]   Oh, definitely.
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:40.280]   I'll have a little more free time. And I know we're going to see the system and the broken system and the broken.
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.280]   That's why STM got...
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:43.280]   Org.
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.280]   Org.
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:45.280]   Yep, that's it.
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.280]   That's what I thought.
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:47.280]   Yeah, it comes on to...
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:48.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:49.280]   By choice or by...
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:50.280]   Well...
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:51.280]   (laughter)
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.280]   It's...
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.280]   Soon to be profitable, any day.
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:56.280]   I'm going to be hungry, so I'm going to be pissed at a lot of content.
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.280]   And of course, Twit will go on. You never leave in Twit.
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.280]   No.
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.280]   You're not allowed...
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:02.280]   Because you have no contract, so you can't get out of it.
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:03.280]   (laughter)
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:04.280]   You think I'm a fool?
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:09.280]   No contract for you. You must continue for the rest of your life to do this silly little podcast.
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:10.280]   Oh, it's fun.
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:13.280]   All right, well, have fun in Toronto. I'm glad you could be with us virtually.
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.280]   Yeah.
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:16.280]   Joy, what did you have, Salmon?
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:18.280]   Yeah, it was great, actually Atlantic Salmon.
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:19.280]   Kit Kat Club, Atlantic Salmon.
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.280]   It's different in the Atlantic, isn't it?
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.280]   Yeah, it's good stuff.
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:23.280]   Everything is different here.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.280]   There's a...
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.280]   That's not the Atlantic, though, though.
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.280]   You know, that's the lake.
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:27.280]   That's the lake...
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:28.280]   What is it?
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:29.280]   Lake Ontario?
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:32.280]   It looks like an ocean because you can't see the other side, but it's actually just a really,
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:33.280]   really, really big lake.
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:34.280]   It was nice.
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:35.280]   A little choppy up there.
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:36.280]   It was nice.
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.280]   Yeah, we went swimming.
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:40.280]   We coded ourself in Bear Grease.
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:44.280]   Kevin looks better in Bear Grease, frankly, than any man ought to.
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:47.280]   I'm telling you, you look pretty good yourself with it, though.
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.280]   Well, thank you.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:52.280]   It's because I'm part Bear.
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:59.280]   Alright, well, on that note, on that fabulous image, let's take it back to the studio, guys.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.280]   Wow.
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:02.280]   What is his last day there?
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.280]   That...
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.280]   Yeah.
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:07.280]   He's going to announce it on the show Monday night, so the first...
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.280]   Wow.
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:12.280]   This is the first time anybody's heard of it is on the Twitcast, and then he's going to announce
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:14.280]   it on the show on Monday night.
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:19.280]   And yeah, he was able to get out of his deal, and he's going to devote all his energies to
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:22.280]   the system to IPTV.
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:23.280]   Nice.
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:27.280]   You know what I find interesting is that we're all kind of doing this kind of stuff.
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:30.280]   It's like just exploding right now.
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.280]   It's like the thing to do.
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.280]   It's amazing.
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:33.280]   Yeah.
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:34.280]   It's the one that's more fun.
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.280]   It's when geeks get frustrated.
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:39.280]   We learn to find new ways to satisfy the way a movie needs.
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:42.280]   Microsoft's and Yahoo are heavily investing in it, too.
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:47.280]   Yeah, but the deal is, from my point of view, with this podcast and the stuff he's doing
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:54.280]   on system, the stuff you guys are doing, the shadows, the shadows, is we don't work for
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:55.280]   the man anymore, you know?
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.280]   Bye-bye, man.
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:58.280]   We're doing our own thing.
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:04.280]   And you know, the truth is, the man never understood what technology was all about.
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.280]   I don't know who the man is, but...
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.280]   Well, the man tried to tell us how we can do this.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:09.280]   I do.
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:12.280]   The people generating a fud.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:13.280]   Yes.
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.280]   Yes.
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.280]   Because you remember the thing.
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:19.280]   I remember how cool Napster was before it was illegal and hardly anybody knew about it.
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:21.280]   So it's back to the same thing with TV.
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:23.280]   Back to those days.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:25.280]   Hey, I can date.
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.280]   He was more than man than it is now.
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:28.280]   This is becoming...
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:32.280]   I'll tell you, this Twitcast is really becoming the venue for big announcements.
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:37.280]   Yoshi announcing his impending wedding and baby and now Kevin announcing he's leaving G4.
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:40.280]   Patrick, you have anything you want to announce?
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:42.280]   Nothing new.
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:45.280]   We're not here.
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:46.280]   Roger, any...
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:47.280]   I don't know.
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.280]   Roger, you're getting the sex change operation.
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.280]   Anything you want to tell people about?
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:55.280]   Not to my knowledge, but when I do, you'll be the first to know.
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:57.280]   Hey, I have questions.
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:58.280]   Speaking of sex.
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:03:59.280]   Wait, wait.
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.280]   I can hear Roger's sister crying now.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.280]   Wait a minute.
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:03.280]   Yoshi said something.
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:06.280]   Yoshi said speaking of sex, I've got to hear this sentence.
[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:07.280]   Go ahead.
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:10.280]   Speaking of sex, I found out the sex of our baby is a boy.
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:11.280]   It's a boy!
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.280]   That's a big announcement.
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.280]   We're going through all the name books now.
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:17.280]   That's great.
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:18.280]   Congratulations.
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:19.280]   Yoshi's going to have a boy.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:20.280]   I think that's appropriate.
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:21.280]   Yes, yes.
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.280]   I've already got the URL.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:27.280]   It's a couple of years off, obviously, but I registered myfirstmod.com.
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.280]   It's all the other ones.
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.280]   His mods on there.
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:34.280]   With any luck, he'll be doing his first mod on a Twitcast.
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:35.280]   Robert Herron.
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:37.280]   Super Jeff, the official price PC.
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:40.280]   Yoshi, Patrick Norton, Roger Chang, and the other one.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:42.280]   I'm Lee O'lopeort.
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:46.280]   Mark, quote for the day from William Gibson, the author of "Neuromancer."
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:48.280]   He says, "The future is here.
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:51.280]   It's just not evenly distributed yet."
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:53.280]   Have a great day.
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.280]   We'll see you next week on Twitcast.
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:05:20.280]   [Music]
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.280]   Well, that's it for this week's Twitcast.

[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:07.280]   I'm Lee O'lopeort, the Chief Twit.
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.280]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:09.280]   We'll see you next time.
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:28.280]   [Music]
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:30.280]   You were talking to Kevin at the KitKat Club?
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:32.280]   Is that a strip club?
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.280]   No.
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.280]   [Laughter]
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.280]   Not in Toronto, but it is another place.
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:39.280]   It does sound like a straight...
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:43.280]   Well, you know, it's the KitKat Club was the name of the club in Cabaret, wasn't it?
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:44.280]   Oh, was it?
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:45.280]   I think it was.
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:47.280]   You know, man, you know, it's a restaurant.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.280]   It's a nice restaurant.
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:50.280]   It's like a chain of strip clubs in San Jose.
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:51.280]   [Laughter]
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:53.280]   No, that's the pussy cat.
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:54.280]   What is that?
[01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:55.280]   No, there's a KitKat club.
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:56.280]   There's a KitKat club.
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:57.280]   And I do mean...
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:58.280]   I know it.
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:06:59.280]   I know it.
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:00.280]   Robert's talking.
