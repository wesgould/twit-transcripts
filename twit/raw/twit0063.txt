[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Bandwidth for this weekend tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com/podcasting.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   This is Twiz, this weekend tech, Episode 63 for July 23, 2006.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   [Music]
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Last week I said, "Oh, you know, Dog Days Summer."
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   That's the doldrums, no news stories, and looks like this week we've got a three hour show.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   We've got more news stories than you can shake a stick at.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Let me introduce our panel and then we'll get right into the story, some big ones to this week.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Speaking of big ones, John C. de Vorak and his big ones are here, de Vorak.org/blog.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   I should talk with a deep voice now, is that what you're trying to eat?
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Hello, this is John C. de Vorak. Patrick Norton is here, Mr. Slam Dance Industry.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   We're trying to stay cool as hot where we are.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Hot. Can you hear the fan going in?
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   It was like 108 up there. Yeah, it's just awful.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   We have a new guest, Kevin Creewell, as in Spreewell.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Kevin is a former editor of Microprocessor Report.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   He worked at AMD for many years and is now in video.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   What do you do in Nvidia, Kevin?
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   I am director of strategic marketing, do corporate research for Nvidia.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Well, it couldn't have been better timing.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   I wanted to get Kevin on, if I'm not, Kevin asked to be on because of our con-row, continuing con-row issues.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   We'll talk a little bit about con-row and marim in a bit, but really, the big story of the week,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   and it's still at the rumor stage, although I think it's less of a rumor than just a matter of time.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   AMD, a friendly takeover of ATI for $5.5 billion.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   A billion. A billion.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   An interesting merger because, of course, you've got the Nvidia ATI battle and then the Intel AMD battle
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   and the C AMD take on a partner here.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Now, I want to say right up front, Kevin, we're going to say right up front, you are not speaking for Nvidia in any way.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   You're not here as a representative of Nvidia in any way.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   That's correct.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   I want you to feel able to speak freely, and so I'm not asking Nvidia this, I'm asking you.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   It is a rumor. It seems pretty credible, yes?
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   It's a rumor that's been around for a few weeks now.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   It actually goes back to just before Computex, and it's a rumor that just doesn't seem to want to die.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   So it's spread quite widely on Friday, and at this point in time, it's looking fairly realistic.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   It's something that you would expect AMD and ATI would have denied heavily if there wasn't actually something ongoing.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Apparently, somebody in the boardroom at AMD leaked the fact that the vote occurred on Friday.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   The fact is that the stock market believes it. AMD declining ATI going up considerably.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   And all the other tech companies were going down on Friday except ATI.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Yeah. What's the advantage of that?
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Exactly.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   What was AMD get out of buying ATI?
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Well, actually, short term, there's a couple things.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   One, they get to zing Intel because Intel invested heavily in ATI and CrossFire for the launch of Conro.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   So there's a little bit of a zing to Intel.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   That's by far not important. That's a transient type of thing.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   The most important thing is AMD now can say they have a full complete solution.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   They have chipsets that work with their processors, and they've always felt a little bit disadvantaged to some extent that Intel had their own chipsets, and AMD did not.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   They're not lying on third parties.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Now, that said, AMD's partners ourselves, NVIDIA and ATI, as well as via server works,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   have been doing a pretty good job supporting AMD over these years.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Yeah. And NVIDIA makes a great AMD chip set, the M4's chip set.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Well, thank you.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Well, no, but I mean, literally, that brings me back to you.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   What, why would they know?
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I'm not sure I see the corporate synergy that justifies a leveraging of assets.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Well, you're not a lot of stock market didn't either. They thought they'd have stock tanked.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   What it is, it's actually a long-term bet. Partly is all the fab capacity AMD is putting in place.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   So now ATI would get access to that directly.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And even though ATI could always sign an agreement to access the fab as a, you know, as a foundry type deal,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   having a ATI design group part of AMD would make it easier.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   The real long-term issue is about four years from now, two more process generations.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   We're going to go from multi-core to many core.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   You know, there will be, there will be going from two to four next year and then eight.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And eventually what you have is Moore's Law keeps giving you more and more transistors to play with.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   And what do you do with those transistors on the silicon?
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Somewhere along the way, you really seriously consider adding the GPU function onto the same silicon with the CPA.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Much like back in the 46 days, we added the math code processor onto the same silicon with the CPA.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   So Kevin, this is essentially your releasing the earliest long-distance rumor about the acquisition of NVIDIA by Intel.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   I was going to say, you know, there's always, there's traditionally some tension between Intel and NVIDIA,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   because NVIDIA makes a chipset competing with Intel's chipset.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Not as much as it's going to be after the buyout attempt.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Yeah, maybe. What do you think about this, John?
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Well, you know, I've been talking to a lot of people about this over the past week or so.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And the word I keep getting from people, there's actually a number of things going on at once,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   which may not make the ATI stock run up such a good idea.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   But first of all, with AMD stock going down and ATI stock going up,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   it makes the proposition a lot more expensive because this kind of thing is a stock deal.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   And so that, and I'm also hearing that Intel knows about this and they're doing everything they can by, you know,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   pumping up their con row and then sending out rumors about what's going to happen in December,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   which is apparently some killer chips, to do anything they can to queer this deal
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   by, you know, slamming AMD stock and Megan, so it's the deal so expensive for AMD
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   that they just simply won't do it.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   So you're saying Intel doesn't like this. This is a scary thing, this merger for Intel.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   They don't like anything that AMD does and they just don't want to see them, you know, picking up the, you know,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   a chip company that's going to give them a little leverage because right now Intel thinks they're back in the driver's seat.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Now, on top of that, there's supposition that if this deal actually does go through that NVIDIA,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   even though our guest there won't confirm this for sure because he can't,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   but the rumor is that NVIDIA will then, you know, get in bed with Intel more closely,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   hook their products together, and since they really do dominate in the high-end gamers world,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   they can literally switch the focus of the gamers from AMD to Intel overnight,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   and it would be a disaster for AMD. So there's a lot more to this deal than meets the eye.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   There's kind of a move in that direction anyway. I mean, people like this, the new Corduo.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   They love the new Conro gamers do. They prefer SLI to crossfire, which is ATI's SLI technology.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   So an NVIDIA Intel pairing is rapidly looking like the best way to game.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Well, there's one other aspect too that has cropped up in the conversation,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   which is the possibility that if this deal does go through since it will kind of screw NVIDIA,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   that NVIDIA, if they can maintain their dominance in the gamers side,
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   they'll simply tweak the next generation of chips so they don't even run on AMD.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Now that would be a complete disaster for AMD. So this deal is not what it appears to be.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Yeah. Well, I mean, as John pointed out, there's a lot of negatives to this.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   And in addition, if you look at even the balance sheet,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   ATI is a much lower margins than AMD. It's going to take AMD's margins down
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   if they merge. Is this a desperation move from AMD?
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   They didn't have, you know, they're looking at the Conro.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   The X4 is not out till mid 2007. Are they panicking?
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   How will this help them? I don't understand how this is going to help them at all in the short term.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   If anything, it's going to distract management as they try to merge the two companies.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Just in the time when they have to be most focused on beating Intel
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   and coming up with solutions that solve the issue.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   So why are they even considering this? Could it be disinformation? Could the rumor be bogus?
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   No, the rumor seems pretty valid. I think it, they consider it.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   I think somebody came up with this idea in the board room or somebody,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   and they thought it was a good idea at the time, and then they started to pursue it.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   I don't think it was fully thought out. I think that's the problem.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Well, I think actually the Wall Street analysts have finally discovered Dig.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   They're now making investment decisions based on a number of Digs on a particular article.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Because I've played rugby with these guys. I've drank with them downtown.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   They make some really interesting...
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   They're just out of you and me, you're saying. They put their lamp...
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   No, we're much more rational than they are.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Wall Street punishes companies for beating their own estimates,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   but not hitting analysts' estimates. They delivered 55 cents on an estimated 46 cents per share.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Wall Street expected 58, so they blew 25% of the value out of the stock.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   It's just like, "Wow, you guys are mean. You suck."
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Sounds like John, you think that this may fall apart, that the only fall apart.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   Yeah, I think it probably will.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Well, I would be stuck to it. A rumor still at this point.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Well, pretty good. How about you Kevin?
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   The problem, as John pointed out, is the stock game.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   These stocks tank so badly, and ATI stocks held up recently well,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   that it's getting much more expensive.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   So when they originally thought this out...
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Could that be a blessing in disguise for AMD?
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Well, I don't think it was a great idea to buy ATI at this stage.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   It's never safe.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Save from themselves.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Save from themselves.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   They wanted to do a stock buyback.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   They had to generate a rumor to drop the value.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Speaking of stock buybacks, Microsoft says it's going to buy back 40 billion of its own stock.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Why?
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Because they've got $15 billion doing nothing.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   I'd give them that money to the shareholders.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Microsoft with a 40 billion to the shareholders. What are they doing?
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   Microsoft never does dividends, do they?
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   No, they have a little dividend.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   But if they gave out a big dividend, that would go mostly to Bill Gates.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   They'd make a fortune off that.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   I could give it to the Africa then.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   But it's beside the point.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   You know, they could give it, you know, that shareholders should get that money.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   It's actually...
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   It's a little misleading to say 40 billion because it's going to take them a long time.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   They're going to...
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   The board of directors authorized the company to buy 20 billion through a tender offer on August 17th,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   and then additional...
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   As much as an additional 20 billion through 2011.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   They bought 30 billion back a couple of years ago.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Maybe they're trying to go private.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   You know, it's not a bad idea. Go private and split up.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Then issue another...
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Then do a new IPO.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   They could be three companies. I've always believed that that company should be split up into three anywhere.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   They should maybe spin off two companies and go and make them public companies.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   I know nothing about financial markets, but wouldn't that be a very profitable move?
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   If you buy back the stock and it's current depressed value, you take the company private, you split it up into three,
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   and then you do IPOs and all three.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Well, you don't even need to take it fully back.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   I mean, you don't even have to go that far.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   You can split it without doing that.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   You can split it up without doing that.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   I think they should split it up. I think it would be more fun for everyone.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   According to Yahoo Finance, the market cap for Microsoft is $243.5 billion.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Hey, they're getting there.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Yeah, it was quarter of the way there, sixth of the way there.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Something.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   You can see now why I'm not in finance.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Too high.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Companies traditionally do those buybacks for two reasons.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Their stock price is depressed. They feel like they want to get it up, so to speak.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   They also want to show confidence to the investors.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   It always looks like desperation to me.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   And they don't know what to do with $40 billion.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   I mean, you could just put it in CDs.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   I could think of some things to do.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   What do you need to buy back your stock for?
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   A casket used a couple of bills.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   All right, most of the stories that weren't ATI and AMD were about $40 billion.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   AMD were about YouTube this week, a lot of YouTube news starting off with Monday when it was announced that the prior week, the weekend in July 16th, YouTube grew to astoundingly, I think 75% growth in one week.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   They've had 300% growth since January.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   They're now doing 100 million videos a day.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Yeah, and it's starting to become a problem.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   You know what the kicker is to that story?
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   That is overlooked? This is the slow time of year.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Well, but is it for them? I mean, the kids are home.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   This is when kids are watching, right?
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   No, I'm not a slow.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   It's just this.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   It's definitely the web numbers for most sites who dropped during the summer when kids are off the outside enjoying the weather.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Yeah, and it's kind of interesting also is somebody who shares a content distribution with YouTube and it turns at my space.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   It's not that they're killing bandwidth.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   It's at ISPs.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   I have a strong and rapidly growing theory that ISPs are starting to throw out a whole pretty much everything coming from YouTube.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   Ted Stevens was right.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Ted Stevens was right.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   YouTube is choking the tubes.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   He knew what he was talking about.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   No, no, no, no.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   It wasn't YouTube.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   So YouTube is making no money.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Microsoft and Google are clogging the tubes.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   We can't get anything out of YouTube.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Never mind that.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   YouTube says it's videos account for 60% of all videos watched online in the US.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   20 million unique visitors.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   And still we wait patiently for a business model.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   They don't need a business model.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   They got a business model.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   NBC just announced that they're going to start using YouTube to show previews of new shows.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   They're even going to put an old show watching that they canceled.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Nobody's watching.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   They're going to put back on the net via YouTube.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Don't you remember the phrase burn rate?
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Well, I probably, yeah, I mean, imagine that bandwidth doesn't cost more than they can make.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   But I mean, they've got some good partners, NBC's partnering with them.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   After suing them, they decided never mind.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   So if like, I would be really curious to see what a breakdown between the number of, you know, girls talking about the guy that just broke up with them slash, you know, tired.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   Most of the videos are guys in their underwear pretending to be Shakira.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Yeah, I mean, it's really kind of fascinating to look at, you know, what the number one most viewed video is in the last 24 hours, the last week, because like during the World Cup, it was amazing because there was world cup content from everywhere.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   I think a couple of things that are interesting.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   First of all, a lot of mashups and remixes.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   A lot of creativity out there.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   You want to call it that you use YouTube, John, you've got videos up on YouTube.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   Yeah, I use it.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   I'm using it more now too.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   I'm trying to shoot stuff with a little pocket camera video.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   I'm probably going to do a review on this on the blog.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   The Kodak V-610 is not the world's greatest camera, but it makes a terrific video mainly because the microphone is so good as you attest.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Yes, I looked at your video of Analisa and it looks great.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   And, yeah, you put it on YouTube and you post it on the internet or post it on your website because you can embed it.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   You start to realize that you probably should have two or three of these posts a day, but you know, every other blogger in the world is thinking the same way.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   So that's why these numbers are increasing so drastically.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Yeah, that's an important point.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   These are not all going to YouTube's homepage, whether you could see an ad or monetize it.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   A lot of these are just linked into web pages, other web pages.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   Yeah, because they let you embed.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   I mean, Google was the first one that did that.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   As far as I know, I don't know anyone else who did let you embed some flash.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   A couple other companies, Video Egg does it now. There are a couple other companies that do this.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   I suppose they could put pre-roll or post-roll ads in there and make some money.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   Oh, they might someday.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Well, there's a Panasonic online video fest that there is a sponsor dead on YouTube.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   I click through.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   I think that there is potential to make money there.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   I guess the only issue is...
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   So, yeah, but they don't make enough.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   Yeah, because their bandwidth bill is extraordinary.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   And if they grew 60% last year, it's last week.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   I heard it's extraordinary to insane.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   I heard it's $1.5 million a month.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   That's nothing.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   It's nothing.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   It's not...
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   We have $10 million in the bank.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   If it's that...
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   But see, that was...
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Even that statistic is a couple of months ago.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   They're growing.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   They're doubling every few months.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   I mean, that even is out of date.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   I'll have to... I mean, I don't have the time to sit down with scratch paper, but I can give you a pretty good idea if they're doing the...
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   If I get a number of the voting relationships, it's hard to tell really.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   But you're using the same provider, so you would know better than us.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Yeah, do the calculation for us, Patrick.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   I think everyone would be interested.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   We'll have you now.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   I don't.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Second, but not now.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   No one would just sit here.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   I'll place no notice.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   Actually, why don't we actually...
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   It's to keep the subject on YouTube, but to shift a little bit.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   You know, have you been watching the new YouTube policy?
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   It's been interesting watching a boy.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   That's a story-boy.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   That's a story-boy.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   They say...
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Now, but this happens all the time with a lot of these sites.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   We own anything you post here.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   We own anything you post, but when you take it down, we won't own it anymore.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   But if we've sold it, it's amazing.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   They can see...
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   I have this horrible vision of America's funniest home videos.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   By submitting the user submissions to YouTube, you hereby grant YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sub-licensible, and transferable licenses.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   To use, reproduce, distribute, prepare, derivative works of, display, and perform the user submissions in connection with the YouTube website and YouTube's.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   And it's successors, businesses, in any media formats and through any media channels.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   They left out the clause we used to have in our agreement in any...
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   What did we say?
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   In any world here to be discovered in any media content?
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   I mean, that's just a normal disclaimer.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   You know, it doesn't bother me, you know, because you can't...
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   Like, the fact that you can't take it down if you feel like it.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   But most of who cares?
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   Yeah, but they can sell it before.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   Yeah, what are they gonna sell junk? It's a bunch of crap.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   I wish they could sell it. I'd like to see them stick around.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   You think they'll be acquired? That's one of the...
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   It would be Yahoo, of all people, I'm sure.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   Yeah, I was gonna say, unless Yahoo buys them, hasn't every other company learned to not buy food?
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Yahoo has learned. After Flickr, Yahoo has learned...
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   Flickr has a similar issue where you've got a lot of bandwidth, nothing like YouTube, but you've got a lot of bandwidth.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   And they buy delicious, too?
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Yeah, but the list just doesn't use bandwidth the same way Flickr does.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   And Flickr does use bandwidth the same way YouTube does.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   YouTube really is a classic.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   YouTube's now being sued also by a news agency, the Los Angeles News Service.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   They're hosting footage of the beating of Trucker Reginald Denny, and he's suing them.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   This was... I truthfully interviewed Steve Chen of YouTube in March for inside the net, one of our other podcasts, Amber MacArthur and I.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   And at the time, that was... I think the big concern, I think it was Chen's concern, wasn't monetization, wasn't bandwidth, it was...
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Are we gonna be sued to death?
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   I believe so.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Yeah, my personal favorite is people are putting these little homemade disclaimers that, you know, the replant of this video is covered by commonly accepted fair use principles.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   And Chen said, "Look, if you issue a DMCA takedown request, we respond immediately to them."
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   And I think they're covered if they say, "Look, we've got 100 million videos."
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Yeah, I think the situation is a little more liberal than it was back in the Napster days when it was like, you know, they were under total attack.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   I don't think it's that bad, but I still think it's pretty bad.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   And I think these guys are gonna get, unfortunately, I think they are gonna get shut down at some point.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   I just can't see it not happening because, in fact, when I... Because I think a lot of people from all sorts of angles are complaining, for example,
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   and cranky geeks we did a show that are running probably a week or two with J.D. Lassica, who has a famous blogger.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Yeah, and he's got our media, and he's got all these people, and he's very conscientious about copyright stuff,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   and he went on a rant about how YouTube's success is only because of all the copyright violations.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Oh, that's a good point.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   And he went on and on and on about it, and I'm thinking, "Well, maybe..."
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   They certainly copied it by the...
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   They became famous with the lazy Sunday video that was stolen from NBC.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   I mean, that's a good point.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   They have the Dave Chappell show over, and it's a clip so neat, and there's tons of anime on it.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   Yeah, I think a lot of what is most compelling, if you look at the top videos, it's not, in fact, repurposed content.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   It is from time to time when that's the viral video of the moment, but most of the time, it literally is morons in their underwear singing Shakira songs.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Or morons watching people in their underwear.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   A lot of lip syncing going on.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   Well, while you're on the topic of the sort of videos and morons in their underwear, there's another website that you should go check out.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   It's very hard to get off of the site when you get on it because it's so kind of uniquely interesting if you want to study the sociology of Gen Y.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   And that's Stickam. Have you seen this site?
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   No.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Have you been there?
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   STIC-A-M?
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   No, STIC-A-M.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   Stickam.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   And it's people, mostly Gen Y people, with their cams.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   And it's like a wide open system with all these people online with cams that people keep at singing with each other.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   It's the...
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   No, come on, that's going to be the most boring thing in the world?
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   No, I'm telling you, it's so...
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   It seems boring, but it's like compelling in some weird way.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Just go check it out.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   I mean, it's just odd.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   This is the interesting thing about the success of YouTube or the problems YouTube faces.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Everybody ignores the financial issues and the legal issues they face.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   They look at 100 million videos a day, they look at 300% growth this year, and they say, "We want that too."
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   And there are a lot of copycat signs.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   Have you guys sort of, uh, Gooba.com?
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Gooba, yeah, that's weird.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   Gooba has been around since '97 or '98.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   Have you seen Johnny?
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Have you heard about Johnny, which they put together?
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   What's Johnny?
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   It's really interesting, it's essentially... it creates... it'll take a... create a hash for a frame of video.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Basically, they took a tool that was designed to detect copyright violation for stills, and they adopted it.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Oh.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   To detecting copyright violations for video, and they're filtering.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Basically, they're getting a list of content from the... or a list of, of, you know, things to look for from the MPAA, I believe.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   And they basically run this system on all of the videos that you posted up on.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Post it up, Post it up, not Gooba.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   Because they just did a deal with Sony to carry Sony's movies for sale.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   Yeah, the Warner Brothers. They're doing Warner Brothers stuff, but apparently they're actually making it available to other sites.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   Hmm.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   So...
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   Well, if you think about it, YouTube smells like the next Napster, uh, soon to be sued out of existence.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   You know, the Napster lawsuit is still going on, by the way.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   I didn't realize that.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   Um, and, and, and you're going to need something like that.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Some sort of... that was what killed Napster.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   They said, "There's no technological way we can prevent the piracy."
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Well, one of the other things about YouTube and then these clips, I mean, you have people like John Stewart of The Daily Show who...
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   they pretty much freely distribute all these clips to their show.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   They give sections of the, of the entire program.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   They put it on their own website and they don't really care if somebody's posted on YouTube.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   And the fact of the matter is most of these things are promotions in some odd way.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   I mean, the, the, the classic example was that NBC suing them over a clip from Saturday Night Live that actually indicated to people that maybe Saturday Night Live was funny again.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   It was, it was essentially a commercial.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   They learned their lesson though.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   I mean, they did.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   Well, they did.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   But I mean, how many other people aren't learning their lesson?
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   I mean, because it's mostly, you don't really watch anything that runs more than a few minutes on YouTube.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   At least I don't.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   I mean, I have watched some longer things.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   But here's where they're going to get in trouble. And this is like this lawsuit with the news agency, the news service is this video.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   This guy sells this Reginald Denny Trucker beat up video to news outlets.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   This is his bread and butter. And there's a lot of people like that.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   You know, the Zapruder film comes to mind where of the Kennedy assassination, where that's their bread and butter.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   That stuff leaks out onto the net and is widely distributed.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   Right.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   They're dead.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   No, I agree.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   It's a problem.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   Apple may be doing movie rentals according to Think Secret.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   You know, Apple, this always happens. Apple's got a conference coming up the World Wide Developers Conference next month.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   And always the rumor mill goes crazy talking about the next iPod or the next this or the next that.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   There seems to be though, but some consensus that Apple may in fact offer movies for rent on iTunes.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   Kind of a Netflix, a virtual Netflix.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   What a shock.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   Who would have ever even anticipated such a move?
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   Well, you know, Netflix has been negotiating for months to try to do movie sales through iTunes.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   Right.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   I guess if they did it, you would want to see them come up with an iPod that had a better screen, right?
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   Which Apple's, you know, what's Think Secret says is going to be available in 2007.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   And rumor has it that it's going to be an Nvidia processor in it to do some 3D for the menuing system.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   Since it seems to be rumor day when we're not.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   Just a rumor.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Just a rumor.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   He will.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   New comment.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   It's always fun to watch the Apple rumor mill get overheated.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   It's kind of crazy.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   I usually don't report these.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   I just thought I'd throw that in since it's got a movie angle.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   Moving on.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   Did you see Jason Calicanis?
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Everybody's favorite hothead.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   He created a dig alike on Netscape as a Netscape homepage.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   And now he's pissing off the diggers by offering to pay the top dig submitters, not just dig,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   but delicious flicker, MySpace and Reddit to pay them for their stories.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   This is actually, this is, I've read his original posting.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   And what he said he wanted to do is he wanted to hire people who basically,
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   the people who, there's a small group of people who generate a huge amount of traffic on dig
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   and whatever you are, right?
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   They're kind of the leaders of it.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   And what he wants to do is he wants to hire them to post on Netscape.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   He wants to basically, you know, he's basically trying to jumpstart Netscape's homepage and he needs a core group of people who,
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   you know, have the cool hunters, whatever you want to call them.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   We have that ability to track down the really cool stories and post them.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   Jason has an amazing ability to not only pick some hot button issue,
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   but get a lot of attention for it and while doing it to piss everybody off.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   But, you know, he was also the one he's, you know, how much did he sell web blogs for?
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   And, you know, this is like, what does this sound like?
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   You know, you're paying people to blog.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   That's against blogs or blogs are about being free and breaking out of, you know, corporate media controls.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   It does.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   It says it's an important question.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Why does somebody, like, I mean, look at these guys are putting up hundreds of stories,
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   like 450 stories a month on diggers.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   They're just, they're editors are free.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   And the question is, why do they do it?
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   Do they do it for the glory, right?
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   Are they for sale?
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   That's the question.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Are they for sale?
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   This isn't about sale.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   There's nothing, you know, the only, the only thing is that he says I'll pay you a move.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   You're posts over to my place.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   Well, so, you know, if somebody, you know, I, you know, look, you know what, if you're good at something and somebody offers you to pay you for it.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   It's like, I got outside of a couple particularly extending out samples in the golfing world who stayed amateur their whole careers.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   If you're already spending four hours a day posting on dig and somebody says, I'll give you a grand a month, you know.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   Well, I don't think it has any takers yet.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   That's an interesting question.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   I mean, if you did it, don't you think it'd become a pariah?
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   Did you just use a pseudo, Nimleo?
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   You know, I mean, how many people know who it is, you know, you know, your Johnny 2274 on dig.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   I mean, how many people know who you are unless you give a lot of information.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Well, because I think at least now, while there's no money in it, a lot of the reason people do this is because they want that, you know, that handle, whatever that handle is to be well known.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   You know, it's good to be the amateur champion of the world. It's great to make a living.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   Well, that's what I was saying.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   How much of a living a thousand dollars a month?
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   It's not a great living.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   Well, yeah, but you think about this way.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   If you're spending four hours a day posting on dig or researching and posting on dig or maybe you're a genius and you've managed to find 150 to 400 stories a month, you know, in your co-op.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   You know, in your copious, you know, a minute here and a minute there.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   If you can do the same thing and pick up a grand a month, you know, you want to be low to dig?
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   I respect that. You want to pick up a thousand dollars a month to cover the fact that, you know, you're spending on that.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   You think that somebody with deep pockets can take a site like Netscape and turn it into a success?
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   No, by throwing them in the eye.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   But they can try.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   Of course they can try.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   He is trying.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   The question is, can you do it?
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   It depends on your definition of success. I don't think they're going to be able to match dig because there's also other kinds of...
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   Well technically they're bigger than dig, but just because people don't know how to change their home page.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   Yeah, exactly. They're dumb.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   So they're big mops up and then they immediately move to something else.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   It's not the same if somebody goes there.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   No, I agree.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   So I don't know.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   It just seems, I think it's an interesting publicity stunt.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   It's a parallel between the people.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   It's a parallel between the relationship with Microsoft and Apple for most of the previous decades.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   Hey, it worked.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   I mean, we got our attention.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   Or my attention anyway.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   You guys don't care.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   Have you ever Patrick? I know you go to DefCon. Have you ever been to the Hope conference?
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   No, actually.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   We have a correspondent. I'm going to bring him in right now.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   Hey, Darren.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   Hey, how's it going, Leo?
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   Welcome.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   So joining us, John C. Devorex here, Patrick Norton, Kevin Creewell of NVIDIA.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Darren Kitchen is one of the hosts of hack.5 at hack5.tv, right?
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   Or is it hack5.org?
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Hack5.org.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   It's H-A-K5.org.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   Yep.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   And you were at Hope.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   Yes, we just got back from Hope.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   It was really boring.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   It was, there was laws, you know.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   There was some interesting stuff and there was also some crazy political activism stuff that we weren't so really into.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   And then, you know, the whole general sense of the thing kind of had a loose, land party feel going on.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   There's, you know, I had night, you know, drunk people on segues and people hanging out in hammocks watching movies on projectors.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Sounds like my house.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   So Hope is run by Emmanuel Goldstein of 2600, the Hacker Magazine.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   A couple of interesting things happened.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   One was that a speaker was arrested just before his presentation.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   The FBI let him off in handcuffs.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   Did you know, did you, did you see that?
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   Yeah, actually that was in the A hall.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   And I was thinking about it.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   It was in the hall that I wasn't in.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   Okay, basically.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   So the session was, "Privacy is Dead, Get Over It."
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   And I'm looking at the book and I'm like, "Eh, you know what?
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   I know that.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   So I'm going to go to this other one on password cracking, time memory trade-off, and then see quantum cryptography."
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   So the password cracking and TMO was really cool.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   And then decided to check out, you know, stay in that hall for the quantum cryptography.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   And Guy comes in and says, "Quantum cryptography has been canceled and blah blah blah.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   We're like, "Ah, let down."
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   And then he's like, and Kevin Mitnick won't be joining us for like a habummer.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   It turns out he's in a hospital in Columbia.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   What happened?
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   Is he okay?
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   They don't know anything more than that.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   In fact, they told us if you're a hospital in Columbia and we're like, "Where?"
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   And they're like, "I don't know if it's Columbia Hospital, if it's Columbia, so that's all we know."
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   I'll try to find out.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   I'll ask.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   And then the hope guys like show you want to know what just happened in the other room and we're like, "Oh, would we miss?"
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   So he lets us know the whole story about the Stevens guy.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   Steven Rambam.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   I can't be pronouncing that right, but that's how it's spelled.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   I can't either.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   And Rumbam, the owner and CEO of Polorium, a company that builds itself as the largest privately held online investigative service in the United States.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   I guess the deal was a volunteer gave Rambam a few small pieces of information.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   Their volunteer was Rick DeCon.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   And Rambam was going to show how in just four and a half hours he was able to dig up 500 pages of personal data and show that data and show how he did it.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   And we don't know why the FBI arrested him if it was related to that.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   I can't imagine it was or just something else.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   Well, it could be if he's accessing networks, he's not supposed to do that.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   He doesn't have legal access to.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   He was the best thing that the guy did the research on, DeCon.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   He actually found that somebody who's been spoofing their social security numbers since 1983.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   Yeah, I thought that was the best part.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   He said, "All I gave him was my email and name. He knew everywhere I'd lived every car I'd driven, even someone else in Alabama who was using my social security number."
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   He found all my friends, pictures of friends, knew about my brother's criminal record.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   Oh, that's a scary.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   So I guess privacy is dead.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   But you knew that, didn't you, Darren?
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Well, yeah.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   But as soon as we found out that the Quantum Cryptography session was over, I caught the last half of the privacy's dead.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   And, you know, I hate how these conferences are with all the good stuff side by side.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   And you got to choose.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   So when I did a conference, I mean, a ram-bam had been arrested.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   Oh, well, there was three of them.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   So there were three others, private investigators.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   And it was really interesting.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   And the guys were really funny.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   And the Q&A session was great.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   It always helps if one of the speakers has been arrested by the FBI minutes before the presentation.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   It just gives it that little edge.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   Freezal.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   Oh, definitely the atmosphere around the conference right after that was a lot more amusing.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   I saw a story.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   Maybe you can clarify also about cloning RFID cloning.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   Did you see that demonstration?
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   No, I didn't.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   It looked like what they did is took it out.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   Somebody had an RFID chip embedded in his arm.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   And they had a device which cloned it within a minute or two and was able to make a duplicate RFID with exactly the same information.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   So something supposedly impossible according to the RFID people.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   You see, that's why I went to the vendor booths and picked myself up a RFID-resistant wallet.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   I made a duct tape, no doubt.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   No, it's not duct tape, but it's got this mesh installed.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   I don't know.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   They, I know, like, probably could make my own for, like, way less.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   But you know, if the U.S. government is going to use RFID in passports and it's easily cloned,
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   how long before somebody in Alabama is using my passport?
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   Well, I thought they said that they were going to provide wallets for the RFID passports that would shield them.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   Yeah, that's real.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   Until you open it, of course.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   And once you open it and then...
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   I've got a friend that does RFID basically, his group does RFID attacks.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   And they've already done a lot of stuff by, you know, designing a decent antenna and pointing it.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   They can basically pick up RFID tags from distances that are theoretically impossible.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   Didn't they do that at DEF CON? They did a long...
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Yeah, John did that.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Harry threw that.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   Any other stories from Hope? Any other interesting things happen?
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   You know, besides funding at Kevin McNich was in the hospital, I can't really think of anything else that was, like, really stood out.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   There was...
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   I think the most interesting thing I saw there was the password-cracking time memory trade-off,
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   which is similar to rainbow cracking or rainbow tables.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   But it's kind of a different aspect of that.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   It's a different technique done by this guy, Jason Davis, and he's doing the site MD5 Lookup.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   And it takes a lot more memory than rainbow tables, but it's 100% effective.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   So for those of us in the studio audience that aren't familiar with rainbow tables...
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   Okay, what are you talking about?
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   Ah, yes, yes. Okay.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   So this guy basically creates a huge database of all the possible passwords and our hashes,
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   so that when you're going to brute force a password instead of just trying everything one after another...
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Just do a look at this lookup table.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   And it seriously took one second for everything.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   He would do five, it'll take one second, because he's put into MySQL database rather than flat files.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   So it's really amazing stuff.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   Which is why you use a longer hash or a longer...
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   Well, what you should be doing, at least with Windows, or actually anywhere, is using a passphrase.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   Use something like my first computer was IBM PC XT in 1983.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   That's a bit long.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   That's maybe a little overkill.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   But at least you've got capitals, numbers, spaces.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   And if you do that on a...
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   If you use a password, 15 characters, more on a Windows system, it won't save an LM hash.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   And LM hashes are really, really weak and really easy to break.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   There you go.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   Well, I thank you for the update on Hope.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   And I hope Kevin's okay.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   We'll see if we can find out and we'll let you know.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   I just checked his website and there's nothing there.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   Yeah, I haven't seen anything in the blogosphere.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   Also, Kevin Mitnick who got sick.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Kevin's a real spy action flickers.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   We should...
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   Wow.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   What's his girlfriend?
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   We should...
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   Darcy.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   Darcy.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   I'll call Darcy right now while we're talking.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   But we're going to let...
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   Right now we're going to let Darren go.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   Darren, I thank you.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   That's incredible.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   And I appreciate your making the effort.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   Hack5.org, H-A-K, the number 5.org.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   G is a really great...
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   Your second season just began.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   No, it's...
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   Our season premiere is August 5th.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   Oh, it hasn't happened yet.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   Okay.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   We're going to have stuff from Hope, a whole bunch of coverage of that as well as lots of other nifty exploits and mods.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   You have season?
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   On stuff.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   Yes, we're in our second season.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   Well, we figured we'll do 10 months on and then take two months off because we don't do this for a living.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   They were easily...
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   Patrick, I just want you to know they were inspired by the screensavers.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   Yes.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   We adopted the format.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   We just never realized they were doing it in seasonal.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   We didn't even do seasons.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   We just kept going on and on and on.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   Well, we needed to break and not go insane.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   Of course, yes, we were getting paid to do it.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   Hey, it's great to talk to you.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   One of these days, I hope.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   All right, thanks guys.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   It will happen.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   It will.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   You got a great program.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   Hack5.org.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   Thank you, Darren.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   So, a little update on Hope.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   And...
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   He said it was kind of disorganized.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   Kind of wacky.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   It is extremely disorganized.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   Everybody knows it says it's fun.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   It's much mellow.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   Defcon is more of a raging party.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   And it's also Defcon is really interesting because it takes place after Black Hat.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   And Black Hat is a pretty hard core industry conference.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   So, everybody's in the air already.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   Yeah, so a lot of people basically do the presentation from Black Hat at Defcon.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   So, instead of paying $6,000 or whatever, Black Hat costs, you can pay $90.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   Right.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   Right.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   And I should also point out, it's John Herring and Flexalus.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   He said the RFID, well, he said the RFID detection world record last year.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   Not Herring.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   That's the other thing I like about it.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   I've never been to either conference, but he always come back with great stories from
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   Defcon.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   And I like these contests to do the longest Wi-Fi or the longest RFID detection, that kind
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   of stuff.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   Those contests are kind of fun.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   Those competitions.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   And the Wi-Fi ones are really getting out of control.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   So, it's like 30 kilometers last time, wasn't it?
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   A lot farther than that.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   Wouldn't that?
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   Really?
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   They're getting into the hundreds of miles at this point.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   I mean, 125, 200 miles.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   Wow.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   Can you really get atmospheric bending?
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   Because this is a conference of the air since this, you just can't do a point to point, unless
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   you're really high.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   Fortunately, there's a lot of hills.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   Actually, they probably had to do a high point down to a low point or something.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:41.400]   Yeah, they actually, with the folks that run the Wi-Fi shootout, they actually spent a
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:46.520]   bunch of time with maps to figure out where they could get the longest value with a high
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:49.400]   point at either end that was near Las Vegas.
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.400]   So, you have to drive way out of town.
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:52.400]   Did you see this Google?
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.400]   I don't know what to make of it.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:41:00.400]   This Google Earth picture of this Chinese, I don't know what it is.
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.400]   People are using Google Earth and having a lot of fun.
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.400]   It is spying.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:10.400]   But they found a 700 meter by 900 meter patch in China that is like a scale replica.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:17.400]   It's huge, but it's a scale replica of peaks and valleys and snow-capped peaks and stuff.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:20.400]   It's the weirdest picture if you see it.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.200]   I don't know what it means.
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.200]   Nobody does.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.200]   It's conspiracy theory time.
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.200]   You're going to give us a link?
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.920]   I will put a link in the show notes.
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:28.920]   You want a link?
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.000]   I'll find one for you to give on the air.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.800]   But before I do that, we've got to stay with hacking news because there's another huge hacking
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:34.800]   story.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:41.800]   Lindsay Lohan says that Paris Hilton has hacked her blackberry.
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:46.800]   And I just wanted everybody to know that there's some security issues now.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.800]   Why would Paris Hilton care?
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:52.720]   Just quote, "Lude messages to her friends on Earth."
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:42:00.200]   I think these people are using a few too many mind-altering substances at this point.
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:09.520]   Lindsay Lohan says that someone used her blackberry to send some disgusting and very mean messages.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:14.200]   The wording of the messages sounds just like Paris Hilton wrote it.
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.200]   Oh, please.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.200]   Who was?
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.200]   They said I'm hot.
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:18.200]   That's how he wrote it.
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:23.200]   That's how he now certifies the nuts.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.720]   Paris Hilton's spokesperson says, "I'm saddened that this happened to Lindsay.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:30.560]   I've lived through this with Paris two years ago when her sidekick was hacked and the
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.760]   loss of privacy is unbearable.
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:36.160]   But as far as any suggestion that Paris Hilton would have anything to do with this, that
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.480]   is silly, untrue, and unfortunate.
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:39.480]   I don't know.
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:40.480]   I just love that story.
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:43.400]   Has no impact whatsoever on any of us.
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:46.160]   Nah, I'd probably run up the dig numbers again.
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.800]   Yeah, that's a classic dig story.
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:56.920]   Yahoo's stock price tumbling 22% on Wednesday marking its largest one-day drop ever.
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:02.840]   Yahoo Post poning its Google AdSense technology that we're going to do something like Google's
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:06.360]   doing with the tech-based web ads and they said it's not ready.
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.440]   The market did not like that.
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:09.640]   They are doing something interesting.
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:14.320]   They are going to offer a Jessica Simpson song without copy protection.
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:16.360]   This is an interesting trial.
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:17.360]   You pay twice as much.
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:21.600]   Pay a buck 99 for the song, but you get an unprotected MP3.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:24.480]   If only I could find some decent music to do that.
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:27.600]   Yeah, it's too bad I hate Jessica Simpson.
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:32.080]   You know, there's a fairly large number of people still buying her music.
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:36.760]   Do you think they're the kind of people who say, "Oh, I don't like DRM?"
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:39.720]   Yeah, but they're not looking at it as DRM.
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:41.680]   They're looking at it as being able to download it.
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:42.680]   Well, that's true.
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:46.280]   And now if you do that, you can play it on anything, including an iPod, which up to
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:50.360]   now Yahoo has not been able to sell something that would play an iPod.
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.680]   So it's actually a...
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:53.680]   What do you think?
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.200]   Would you pay a buck 99 for unprotected music?
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:56.200]   Heck no.
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.200]   By the CD.
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.200]   Rip it.
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.200]   You're talking about 199 for a single track.
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.640]   Single tracks should be 25 cents.
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:04.640]   That's what it should be.
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.640]   25 cents unprotected.
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:09.440]   Like a phone call should be 10 cents.
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:10.440]   This should be paid for...
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:12.160]   And I was a kid of nickel.
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:16.080]   And they don't care if a thousand people pirate that one song because yeah, exactly.
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:17.080]   It's a promo.
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:18.080]   It's to get them to buy more.
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:19.080]   Yeah.
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:22.480]   Well, no, the premium is for a personalized name version of the song.
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.480]   It says paid content.org.
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:25.480]   Oh, what did you see?
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.480]   Oh, Leo, I love you.
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:30.200]   Leo, you're my man.
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.200]   What a personalized how.
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.200]   What?
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:33.200]   Hold on.
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.200]   Just...
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:38.040]   I'm adventuring Jessica Simpson's Yahoo music Jessica for you page.
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:39.040]   Download it.
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.040]   Get it.
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:41.040]   Pay a buck 99.
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.040]   Oh my God.
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:43.040]   That's exactly what it is.
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.040]   Get your name in the song.
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.040]   Download a personalized MP3 just for you.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:46.800]   I'd pay a buck 99 for that.
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.360]   So they have some names?
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.360]   What did they have?
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:50.360]   They have a lot of names.
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:53.800]   So Jessica have to go to the studio and sing "I Love You, Andrew.
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.440]   I Love You, Patrick.
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.080]   I Love You, Kevin.
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.280]   I Love You, Devorak.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:00.280]   How do you say Devorak?
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.280]   Is it Devorak?
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:02.280]   Is it Devorak?
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.280]   Don't get it.
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:04.280]   They don't get it.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.280]   They don't get it.
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.280]   I have Leo.
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.280]   Hold on.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:08.280]   Hold on for a half Leo.
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:09.280]   They have Patrick.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.280]   I'm sure they have John.
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:11.280]   Can you buy that song?
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:14.880]   I'd like to distribute it.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:15.880]   Patrick, you're my man.
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:17.440]   Patrick can't do it.
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:18.920]   No one can.
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:20.560]   Gizmo's giving away free stuff.
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:21.560]   It might be nicer.
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:23.560]   I'll play the same one.
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:26.200]   In fact, here we go.
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.200]   Oh dear.
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:28.200]   Here we go.
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.920]   This is probably violating some sort of copyright.
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:33.680]   I think we actually do have fair use for this.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:34.680]   Just the first few seconds.
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:36.600]   Okay, we're connecting.
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.640]   So you're buying this on Yahoo Music?
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:40.640]   You actually buy it.
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:41.640]   No, it's the free sample.
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:42.640]   Oh, good.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.400]   I was going to say if you bought it, I'd be impressed.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:47.480]   I probably can't even do it on a Mac, can I?
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.120]   That's about enough of that.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:51.520]   We didn't even hear any of it.
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:54.480]   It's probably not getting picked up by Skype.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:57.280]   No, you have to have special techniques.
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.280]   It was perky.
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:01.160]   Get a personalized-- I'm going to do it now.
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.160]   What?
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.160]   Leo?
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:06.320]   Have it personalized for the Twitch show?
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:09.720]   No, she didn't sing one that says, "Oh, Twitter me.
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:11.440]   I love you."
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.440]   Why not?
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:13.840]   I love you so very much.
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:14.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:16.160]   I'm going to buy one that says, "John."
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:18.480]   I think you really like singing.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:21.840]   Is it a new talent for you?
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:23.920]   Leo's Secret Bubblegum Pop Talent.
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:24.920]   It's not that worth it.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:26.840]   Usually used to describe it.
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:28.000]   I'm afraid, Kevin.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   It's more like a curse.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.400]   All right, let me see if I can curse.
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.240]   Okay, credit card type.
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.880]   Okay, let's just type in my American--
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:40.480]   Oh, now that shows the two rated jobs filling out forms on the air.
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:43.080]   I was going to say, this is even better than watching gaming on YouTube.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:44.080]   I can't edit it out.
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:45.080]   I can't edit it out.
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:46.080]   Give back to Stickcam.
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:47.760]   All right, you pick a story.
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:50.840]   You guys talk amongst yourselves while I buy John a song.
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.840]   Hey, one terabyte hard drives.
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:53.840]   What about me?
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:54.840]   Who?
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:55.840]   Who?
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.200]   They're going to be available before the end of this year.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:01.360]   We had Brian Dexheimer on DL.tv.
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.440]   And I did like a 20-minute interview.
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:06.920]   It's one disc, it's not a container with two of them in there, right?
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:10.760]   No, I think the one terabyte discs are going to come later.
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:11.760]   Oh, what was that one?
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:13.480]   I've got a one terabyte disc.
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:14.480]   We're sitting right here.
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:16.560]   It's made by Mac stores, one terabyte.
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.760]   But it's not a new about that.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:19.600]   It's just multiple drives rated.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:21.280]   Yeah, there's two drives in a box.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:25.520]   Yeah, but this is actually a single drive that contains a terabyte.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.520]   Oh, okay.
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:27.520]   For the end of this year.
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:29.880]   Somebody else will talk to us about what's going on with--
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:30.880]   I'm sorry?
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:31.880]   Do I use multiple letters?
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:36.120]   So late-- so I'm sorry, but one of the things we should probably do a special show on since
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:40.960]   I wrote a column on it and I'm up to speed on this, which is unusual for me, is this
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:45.200]   is where we're coming on the 50th anniversary of the hard disc in September.
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:47.040]   Wow, that's amazing.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:48.040]   That's amazing.
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:53.440]   I don't think I'd want to buy a single platter or even a single mechanism terabyte.
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:57.160]   It just doesn't seem like a bad idea.
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:59.640]   Not single terabyte platters.
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:04.080]   If you listen to the fabulous interview with Brian Dexhill, one of the things he talks
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:08.760]   about is what it's going to take to get to terabytes levels of aerial density on a single
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:12.400]   disc and it's coming, but it's a ways out.
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:15.600]   We're talking about a terabyte in a single hard drive at this point.
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:25.360]   If you talk to Gibson about this, he says that-- because his software spin right will
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:28.360]   actually watch the ECC corrections going on.
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:33.000]   And on a 200 gigabyte disc, there's whatever it is, a few hundred corrections in a second
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   or whatever.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.320]   It gets to a very rapidly gets to a very big number where it's constantly correcting errors
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:42.480]   as you get this aerial density up so high.
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:44.400]   As you might imagine, really.
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:53.800]   Ladies and gentlemen, the musical stylings of Jessica Simpson and a very special personalized
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:57.120]   song for John C. Devore.
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:59.400]   It's called a "lick of fame."
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:03.400]   She's not singing at some point, I'm sure.
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:06.400]   Have I already used up the fair use of time?
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:08.400]   I've never heard of it.
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:10.400]   Now you get to plug it in later, Leo.
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:11.400]   Oh, you can't hear it?
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:12.400]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:13.400]   I'm adding on a little bit.
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:14.400]   Here you go.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:15.400]   Enjoy, guys.
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:16.400]   This is for you.

[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:36.400]   Yeah, it sucked.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:38.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:43.400]   But hey, no DRM, which doesn't mean you could play it on your podcast.
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:44.400]   Brother.
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:46.400]   Maybe I misunderstood.
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:47.400]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:48.400]   I'll put it on there.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:49.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:51.400]   I'll give it to you, John, because I have really no use for it.
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:52.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:53.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:54.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:50:00.400]   So, you know, I have a couple of personal notes to make, since we keep throwing this stuff
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:01.400]   on these broadcasts.
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:05.400]   One of them is that I've noticed that we've got no response from anybody World Cup.
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:08.400]   We don't have any listeners, I believe, in Italy or France.
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:10.400]   They're too busy partying.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:11.400]   I don't know.
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:12.400]   I don't think they speak English.
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:17.400]   It might be where we do actually have-- France is one of the countries that we get a few thousand
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:21.400]   downloads a month from, but maybe they're not soccer fans.
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:22.400]   It could be.
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:26.400]   And also, I've been getting a lot of people complaining since I last week.
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:27.400]   We started talking about cooking.
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:31.400]   And I've claimed that I was going to post my flank steak recipe.
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:32.400]   Did you ever do that?
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:34.400]   No, you know, I'm going to post it today.
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:35.400]   So it'll be up when they go on that.
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:36.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:38.400]   How many people wrote to you and said, John?
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:39.400]   About a dozen.
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:41.400]   Well, here's your flank steak recipe.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:46.400]   There's a bunch of, apparently, a bunch of, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Twitter listeners
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:49.400]   who are, like, the cook stuff, and they're just hungry for recipes.
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:50.400]   That's great.
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.400]   So I don't know.
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:53.400]   Welcome to the latest network conference cooking with John.
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:54.400]   Thursday.
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:55.400]   John and Leah.
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.400]   It's the first audio cooking show.
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:00.400]   Actually, well, you know, there's control alt chicken.
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:02.400]   That's Alex Albrecht has a cooking show.
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:04.400]   Yeah, but I'm talking about doing it, you know, over audio.
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:05.400]   Sound, pure audio.
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:06.400]   Yeah, right.
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:07.400]   Radio cooking show.
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:08.400]   There you go.
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:09.400]   I asked you to do it now.
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:10.400]   I asked you to do a radio.
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:11.400]   Rick, get sure to look hot.
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:13.400]   Done many a radio cooking show.
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:14.400]   That's a good format.
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:15.400]   It's a long time.
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:16.400]   Radio cooking show.
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:21.400]   Anyway, so I apologize to people who were writing and dying for that.
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:26.360]   So before we go, one of the things we wanted to talk about with Kevin Crewell is, is,
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:29.360]   the new chips from Intel, the Conro and Marimtob.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:30.360]   I saw something quite interesting.
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:34.360]   I didn't realize this, but at the IDF, and you probably saw this, Patrick, but I just
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:35.360]   I wasn't paying attention.
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:41.360]   One of the demos they did is they took a motherboard, a Yona, a Dell with a Yona in it.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:47.360]   They popped out the Yona, popped in the Marim, and got like 25% better performance on it.
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:49.360]   It's, I didn't realize it's socket compatible.
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:52.360]   It's platform compatible, so you can just drop on that.
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:53.360]   That's fantastic.
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:54.360]   Yeah.
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:57.360]   Do you think you're going to see a lot of people doing that kind of an upgrade?
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:58.360]   No, actually you can't.
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:01.360]   And the fourth thing, notebooks really can't do that kind of.
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:02.360]   You can't get it.
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:03.360]   Right.
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:04.360]   Yeah.
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:07.360]   And most of the time there, and then the desktops there actually, I think you do require a different
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:13.360]   motherboard because they've changed the voltage regulator.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:14.360]   Oh shoot.
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:17.360]   So Conro, so Conro's got different voltage regulator and different control.
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:18.360]   But if it were a Marimt, you could.
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:23.360]   So the reason I'm asking is because there, for instance, a Mac Mini is using a Yona chip.
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:26.360]   My understanding is that the Mac Mini should be able to, the Mac's Mini and the IMac should
[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:27.360]   be able to do it.
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:28.360]   Just not confirmed though.
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:29.360]   Yeah.
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:30.360]   Wouldn't that be something?
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:31.360]   Yeah.
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:35.960]   Depends if choosing a socket inside the parts and that you could access the processor and
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:37.360]   pop it out and swap it in.
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:39.360]   And you might need a BioSuck right too.
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:44.360]   If you could do such a thing, what kind of improvement and performance you expect to
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:45.360]   see?
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:51.360]   Well, Intel's been talking about 20% or more on notebooks.
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:55.360]   It depends on the application.
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:53:00.360]   I mean, if you're doing a lot of media stuff where you use the new SSE instructions or
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:04.360]   the new SSE unit, it's much faster than the old one.
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:09.360]   Also, if you're doing 64-bit software, the new, well, actually, the unit didn't do 64-bit
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:10.360]   software.
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:11.360]   Only did 32-bit software.
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:13.360]   So it couldn't actually do 64-bit software.
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:15.360]   You should usually easily see 20% improvement.
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:17.360]   So let's take those one at a time.
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:20.360]   What programs use SSE?
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:26.360]   Those would be more like games and anything media oriented.
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:29.360]   If you're ripping or video editing songs or video editing shots.
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:30.360]   All that stuff.
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:31.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:32.360]   Transcoders would definitely use SSE.
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:34.360]   Also, it's a big cache.
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:37.360]   It's a 4 meg cache versus the 2 meg cache on the unit.
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:38.360]   That should make it.
[00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:42.360]   On the high end parts, the high end parts have 4 megabytes cache, the low end parts have
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:43.360]   2 megabytes.
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:44.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:50.320]   But it sounds like really the significant difference here is not 64-bit or better SSE, but it
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:51.320]   was really a new core.
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:52.320]   Yeah.
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:56.640]   And it was a really major redesign from the guy that's in Israel who did the original
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:57.640]   Yona design.
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.120]   These guys are great in Israel.
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:00.880]   They really know what they're doing.
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:06.320]   They really saved Intel's bacon when net bursts turned out to be a dead road.
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:08.320]   Yeah, because they had no pun intended.
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:13.320]   They had this Prescott chip which could actually fry bacon.
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:14.320]   So they did?
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:15.320]   They saved them.
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:16.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:17.320]   The kosher bacon.
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.320]   Well, they backed away from the hole.
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:21.840]   I mean, they had to see that pipelining was going to work and people were going to optimize
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:26.000]   your software for these really long branch predictions and pipelines.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   And they gave up.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   They just made it faster.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   They just, they made a shorter, shorter, shorter.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.080]   Well, Kevin, Kevin used to be at the microprocessor report.
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:35.000]   So he really knows what he's talking about here.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.600]   Is the pipeline shorter on the new cores?
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:38.600]   Yeah.
[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:40.360]   Well, it's shorter than the Pentium 4.
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:42.840]   Pentium 4 went up to 31 stages of pipeline.
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:44.920]   This is back down to 14.
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:46.320]   And you go back to the Pentium 3.
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:47.920]   It was like 11 stage pipelines.
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:51.080]   The clock speeds are not improved clock speeds.
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:53.040]   So they must be getting some efficiency somewhere.
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:55.920]   How are they making it a more efficient chip?
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:57.160]   They do more in parallel.
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:58.160]   They do it wire.
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:02.040]   Actually, they're doing more of what AMD did with Athlon XP and Athlon 64.
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:03.040]   Oh, interesting.
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:05.720]   So, but they did it one more than AMD.
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:08.960]   They, instead of three decoders, they put four decoders.
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:11.440]   They put more cash on board.
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:14.240]   They sped up all the circuitry that they could find.
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:19.840]   They crunched a couple of instructions that could fit together and executed them at once
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:21.680]   so they could speed up there.
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:26.400]   There's lots of improvements, but basically it's more similar to what AMD did with the
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:32.240]   Athlon 64 than the Netburst architecture, which turned out to be way off into the weeds.
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:37.680]   They did take some of the instructions, like the SSE instructions and some of the features
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:43.680]   that they had built in Pentium 4 and added it to Conro into the core microarchitecture.
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:49.280]   But the microarchitecture itself is more, actually, more related to the Pentium 3 than it is to
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:51.200]   the Pentium 4.
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:52.200]   Really?
[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.560]   That's the reason actually when they introduced the Pentium M.
[00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:57.160]   They're not going to put that in the ads.
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:58.160]   I don't think.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:59.160]   No, no.
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:03.240]   When they introduced the Pentium M, originally, the Centrino part, they wouldn't talk about
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:09.240]   what's inside of it at all because it was much closer to a Pentium 3 than a Pentium 4
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:13.120]   and they didn't want that sort of to taint the Pentium M. Even though the Pentium was
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:18.280]   a great chip, it formed real well, and this is just an evolution of that Pentium M chip.
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:20.280]   Very interesting.
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:24.480]   It actually all goes back to a failed chip from Intel called Timda.
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:29.880]   Timda was a chip that took a Pentium 3 core, modified it, had a built-in memory controller,
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:33.640]   and a built-in display drive for all one chip.
[00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:37.520]   Intel never released that chip because they made a mistake in choosing the memory.
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:41.960]   They use Rambas and Rambas turned to be a big disaster.
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:48.720]   That's actually the origin of the Pentium M and now the core micro-architecture.
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:57.400]   You never know what a failed program can actually come back in the end and save the day.
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:00.160]   What have we learned here in chip design?
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:03.600]   What mistake did Intel make and how did they fix it?
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:09.120]   We learned that it's always good to have a Plan B.
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:14.040]   If your great idea about long pipe lines and branch prediction doesn't work, have a Plan
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:15.040]   B.
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:16.040]   Have a second idea.
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:19.640]   The 386 was a Plan B for Intel many years ago.
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:24.000]   They had a different part called the 432 that was going to be the next big architecture,
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.240]   and that didn't pan out.
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:28.920]   So that Plan B was the 386.
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:34.680]   Essentially, to boil it down, what we're seeing with the Merrim and the Conro is essentially
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:38.440]   returned to the Pentium 3.
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:40.640]   Which closer to the Pentium 3 than it is to a Pentium 4.
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:41.640]   That's really interesting.
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:43.720]   I think that's really...
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:48.400]   I'm not going to say we missed the boat, but I think it is where people don't understand
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:50.240]   what's happened here.
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:53.880]   It isn't just a new Pentium 4, a new way of doing a Pentium 4.
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:57.080]   It's a new core that is in fact considerably faster.
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:01.080]   Well, it's faster in performance, not faster in clocks being efficient.
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:02.080]   More efficient, yes.
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:03.080]   It's a good word.
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:04.800]   The efficiency is really good word.
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:11.120]   Kevin, what do you think of AMD's kind of pulling an Intel and saying, "Hold off.
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:13.120]   We've got our 4x4 technology coming."
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:19.240]   Yeah, the 4x4 has some potential because you really double amount of memory bandwidth
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:24.120]   because now you have two processor sockets, each with up to four, a total of four DIMMs
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:25.120]   each.
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:28.000]   So you can put tons of memory in this thing and also lots of bandwidth.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.080]   So it could be a killer, but it's going to be hugely expensive.
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:41.360]   It's going to be a really niche product for probably a $6,000 or $7,000 or maybe more.
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:42.360]   It couldn't possibly.
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:46.680]   The only other way you can see this is very similar to is what Apple is going to do with
[00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:47.680]   the next power Mac.
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:51.920]   It's also probably a well-imbecaled power Mac, obviously, because it's not power architecture
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:52.920]   anymore.
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:59:00.120]   But dual sockets and lots of expense on it, it's pricier to do that way, but it does have
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:02.320]   advantages.
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:09.640]   Do you think that they're going to think Max going to release a Core 2 based desktop at
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:13.720]   the World Wide Developers Conference next week or a week and a half from now?
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:19.520]   Well, everybody tries to guess what Apple is going to do next, but it's a great fun thing
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:22.880]   to do, but actually you would be surprised if they didn't by now.
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:27.480]   It seems like it might be easier, though, for them to do a Merum upgrade to the MacBook
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:28.480]   Pro first.
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:33.680]   Of course, they must be sitting on these chips and ready to do this power this new time.
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:37.200]   They have to be dying to replace the G5s at this point.
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:42.080]   You know what's interesting to me is that every time Apple sneezes, as you know, a report
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:45.560]   on it, nobody ever talks about when Dell's going to bring out their next chip or when
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:48.160]   the G-Dell is going to or anybody for that matter.
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:53.920]   But Dell hasn't been sitting on the same processors for the last two years.
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:56.400]   And Dell has shipped Conro, or at least is offering Conro.
[00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:58.400]   Well, how can we never talk about that?
[00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:01.000]   Because they release at the same time, Intel releases their chips.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.480]   They're going to tell releases it.
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:04.120]   Then everybody comes out and says, "Here we are."
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:07.040]   Well, then Apple brings it out sometime later, so that's news.
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.280]   I'm just baffled by this.
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:11.120]   I think you guys are a bunch of Apple bigots.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:14.360]   Oh, you're just saying that because you know you're going to get a lot of lovely mail
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.360]   from people.
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:16.360]   Save it for your blog, John.
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:17.360]   Save it for your call.
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:18.360]   You just sample.
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:19.360]   Apple baiting.
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:20.360]   It's not actually...
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:21.360]   Apple baiting.
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:22.360]   I thought they weren't.
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:28.320]   I thought the court you wasn't physically going into this, hitting a street until next
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:29.320]   week.
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.320]   Are they actually selling them now?
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.320]   No.
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:32.320]   Or just ordering.
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:35.760]   I'm going to Dell right now, John.
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:36.760]   Just for you.
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:37.760]   No, no, no.
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:38.760]   No, no, no.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:39.760]   I don't believe you can buy it yet.
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:42.600]   I think it's the end of the month or early August.
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:44.600]   Yeah, I suppose it was the 27th.
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.520]   Yeah, when they pulled off, it was kind of weird.
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:51.200]   It's like the strip tees of this thing where they released some more information and a
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.960]   little more information.
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:57.600]   And what they did last week was release the NDAs for all the sites that had done benchmarks.
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:01.360]   So we saw a whole after benchmarks, but no chip-chat.
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:02.520]   It's amazing if they're actually...
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:04.840]   They're filling the entire channel from the low end.
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:08.520]   Instead of just doing the high-end version and then trickling the rest of them in, it's
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:10.360]   kind of neat to watch them.
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:13.880]   Basically, this is a total little salt on AMD.
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:19.120]   Yeah, they said that there were financial conference calls that they had $200 million
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:24.440]   dollars worth of extra units that they found that they could use, that they were production
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:25.440]   worthy.
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:29.080]   In addition, they expect to have chips in the channel when they launch it.
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:34.280]   So that means motherboards and chips maybe go down to fries and buy one.
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:35.280]   Hmm.
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:37.280]   I like that thought.
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:43.400]   I'm just laughing because I haven't built an Intel-based system in a really long time.
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:46.720]   So I'm looking forward to the idea that it may be for $183.
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:51.960]   I can pick it up as $6,300 that will kick the snot out of my existing $500 system.
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:55.240]   And of course you'd use a N-Force...
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:57.240]   Oh no, you can't.
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:58.240]   You could.
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.240]   Could you?
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:03.160]   Well, yeah, there'll be NVIDIA support for Conra.
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.160]   There will.
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:05.160]   Oh yeah.
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:06.160]   You haven't seen it yet, but...
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:07.160]   Yeah, we'll be.
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:08.160]   Had you liked how I got that out of them.
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.160]   Nicely done.
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:10.160]   Yeah, I'm gonna go...
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.720]   Do you have a ship date for that?
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:16.240]   So when am I building my $500 upgrade for my $500 PC?
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.240]   With SLI and...
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:18.240]   Mmm.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:21.880]   Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna be an SLI kind of guy.
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:25.040]   I have two SLI systems right here.
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:27.320]   Oh, yeah, John, have you paid for either one of them?
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:29.320]   I'm sorry I can't hear you.
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:30.320]   Exactly.
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:31.320]   It dropped off there.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.320]   Yeah.
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:34.520]   Actually, the GX2s are pretty good.
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:36.840]   Actually, it's like SLI on one card.
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:42.680]   Yeah, see, I try not to own any single graphics card that costs more than, you know, the first
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:43.680]   card purchase.
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:44.680]   You're not a big gamer either.
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:45.920]   I mean, that's not what you build a machine.
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:46.920]   No.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:47.920]   Well, I can be a great gamer.
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:50.120]   It's just the problem is it's gonna cost me my marriage and my job.
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.120]   As long as I can.
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:52.120]   As long as I can.
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:53.120]   I'm already a cat.
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:54.120]   I'm already a cat.
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.720]   Would you benefit in anything besides gaming with SLI?
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:57.760]   For instance, video processing.
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:03.880]   If you keep a lot of windows hoping to invest, yeah, glass will look great.
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.640]   Really seriously, is it just like...
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:12.040]   No, actually, you do some really good anti-aliasing, but I couldn't actually give you a good answer
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.040]   on that.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.640]   It's also, wait, it's also good for multi-monitors.
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:16.640]   Yeah.
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.640]   Why is that?
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:18.640]   Yeah.
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:22.160]   It's about, yeah, four monitors off of a double system like that's amazing.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.360]   Yeah, I'd like that.
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:24.360]   Yeah.
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:25.360]   You would, actually.
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:26.360]   Yeah, I'd love that.
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:30.160]   And I've actually seen like, you know, the graphics card, like mid-range graphics card
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:33.600]   from a year, year and a half ago actually start to choke when you get like 50, or...
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:39.080]   If you get like 15, 25, 35 windows open and vista.
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:41.760]   You start getting the, you know, your performance is not optimized.
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.920]   Although newer drivers are helping out with that.
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:47.000]   Yeah, I mean, it's a lot of these early drivers still.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.760]   And you're really beta drivers, and the drivers will improve a lot in the next six months.
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:56.440]   Is there anybody else that's playing this game, you say, "You and ATI?"
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:57.640]   In any significant way?
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:58.640]   No.
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:00.640]   Yeah, well, about in a insignificant way.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:05.920]   Well, you still have VSS and S3 around.
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:08.200]   Intel's, you get, of course, you got Intel.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:13.960]   Intel's integrated graphics has the largest market share in the business, by far.
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:19.120]   You know, it's good enough graphics is still acceptable to a lot of people, especially
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:20.120]   businesses.
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:27.160]   It really comes down to its, you know, ATI, Nvidia, and Intel for the business.
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:28.160]   That's it.
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:29.160]   And a little bit of S3.
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:32.600]   But S3 is like, it's pretty small at this point.
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:37.920]   You just remember back when it was S3 and ATI used to battle it out and leapfrog each
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:38.920]   other.
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:42.040]   I remember reviewing graphics cards in those days.
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.040]   That was really fun.
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:46.360]   And it'd be back and forth and back and forth.
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:50.080]   Oh, they just mean like 90 graphics vendors at one point in time.
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:51.080]   Wow.
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:52.600]   Yeah, they all had these problems.
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:54.600]   Remember number nine?
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:57.160]   Yeah, Voodoo and Voodoo.
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:58.160]   Well, Voodoo.
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.160]   Not Voodoo.
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:00.160]   You mean 3DFX.
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:01.160]   3DFX.
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:02.160]   3DFX.
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.160]   And Voodoo cards.
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.160]   Yeah.
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.160]   Yeah.
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.160]   What happened to 3DFX?
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.160]   Who acquired them?
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.160]   Was it, was it you guys who acquired them?
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:09.160]   Yeah.
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:10.160]   Nvidia.
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:12.640]   Well, we acquired the property and we hired about a hundred of their people.
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:15.800]   But physically we didn't actually acquire 3DFX.
[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:18.080]   They just wasn't much to acquire probably by the way.
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.080]   Yeah, I know.
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:20.640]   But you know what I like about 3DFX?
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:22.680]   Well, I liked about 3DFX and it's overlooked.
[01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:25.760]   And I think you guys should really pick it up a little bit, which is they had some of
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:27.320]   the best charge keys.
[01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:29.360]   Like what?
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:30.360]   Like what would you get from some?
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:33.440]   Oh, they had some gym bags and all kinds of cool stuff.
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:35.160]   They have a great commercial.
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:38.200]   I have a fantastic Nvidia jacket.
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.200]   Like that one.
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:40.200]   Oh, really?
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:41.200]   Yeah.
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:42.200]   Oh, John.
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:45.200]   John, I'll get right out of that.
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:47.200]   John, have you seen Valley Shwag?
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:50.520]   No, there's a place where you can swap Shwag.
[01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:55.440]   They're basically saying like if you subscribe, I can't figure out if it's a joke or if it's
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.320]   serious, but they're basically there.
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:01.000]   The idea is they threw a party and they're going to be able to like basically sign up
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.320]   and receive shipments of the best in Silicon Valley Shwag.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:05.320]   Yeah.
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:06.800]   Can't attend the parties?
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:07.800]   Can't get inside.
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:09.520]   You know what I like to do with that stuff?
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:12.720]   Oh, I wouldn't do it with that jacket, but you never know.
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:14.160]   Give it away to the homeless.
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:20.200]   Now, what I really enjoyed doing, this is a, when I was at, during the era of tech TV,
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:24.000]   I grabbed as many of the big thinkers, hats and caps.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.800]   I could get a hold out of a box of them and I'd give them to those guys that are at the
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:30.320]   freeway off ramps asking for money.
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.320]   Excellent.
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:34.960]   And I'd get the biggest kick out of seeing some guy begging for money with a big thinkers
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:35.960]   cap on.
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:41.120]   I do something weirdly strange about, it's kind of a surreal kind of an image.
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:42.320]   That's, that's perverse.
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:49.680]   I just wanted to say a really brief hello to, and he is a listener and he is a big fan.
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:54.680]   And his, I guess his brother in Los Senes said no, and he just wanted to say hi to him.
[01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:55.680]   What else?
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:07:02.080]   Oh, amazing, amazing statistics from the last episode of Twit.
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:11.160]   I got a great note from AOL from Jeffrey Graham, who was our contact over at AOL radio.
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:15.040]   So the server guys were, and it was quite a bit of steam coming off of the server on
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:17.720]   a Sunday night when Twit 62 came out.
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:25.240]   We pushed, I think, three and a half terabytes at a peak of very close to a gigabit, a second
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:26.520]   off the server.
[01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:30.160]   So a tip of the hat and a thank you to the guys who hose down the servers and keep them
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:32.060]   from overheating.
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:34.200]   And Twit comes out because that's an important job.
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:37.960]   Don't you just see them kind of in the, in the hole there with the boilers?
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:40.560]   Say, oh my God, more coal.
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:41.560]   Here comes Twit.
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.400]   I don't know, man.
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:47.680]   I think it's, maybe it's time to start, start staggering how the RSS is released.
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:49.480]   Yeah, well, we talked about that before.
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:52.240]   I wish somebody would because it's not our, it's not up to us.
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:55.600]   It's be people like iTunes or somebody.
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:57.000]   We got to find a way, Patrick.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.840]   The main reason Patrick's on is he has three boxes of crap now.
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:04.940]   Yeah, it was originally, it was one box of crap for the person who came up with the
[01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:05.940]   name.
[01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:06.940]   Okay.
[01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:09.700]   And we are going to send a box of crap to the per, nobody ever came up for the name of
[01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:10.700]   this week in tech.
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:13.220]   That was, I, I deserve the box of crap because I came up with it.
[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:16.540]   The closest, no, I don't want it.
[01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:19.420]   What's in this, what's in this box of crap?
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:24.340]   Oh, it's, it's, it's selections of the, you know, selections of some of the finest remnants
[01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:26.340]   of my last 10 years in technology.
[01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:27.340]   Oh my God.
[01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:29.020]   There'll be at least one GPS device.
[01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:30.820]   One, I've, well, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's
[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:37.680]   a, there'll be a couple GPS devices, like GPS devices for notebooks, at least one wireless
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:41.540]   video camera, a few Pentium chips, who knows what all else.
[01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:43.460]   A little bit of software.
[01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:49.540]   Well, I'm going to go back through, through the entries because we do have, I believe it
[01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:55.020]   was a girl, a young girl who came up with this week in geek, which was the closest anybody
[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:57.140]   came to twit.
[01:08:57.140 --> 01:09:04.500]   And so that young girl who's now 21, but that, she was just 14 at the time, but she did,
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:08.220]   in fact, I believe, come the closest to naming to it.
[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:12.900]   And in fact, it was when I read her submission this week in geek that I actually thought
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:14.700]   of this week in tech.
[01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:17.700]   So perhaps we can get everybody to sign, you know, something.
[01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:20.420]   We'll put, we'll put something from the great Leo Laporte library.
[01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:21.820]   We will put some autographs.
[01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:23.740]   Yeah, we'll put some more stuff in there.
[01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:29.460]   But, but I am going to send her an email saying, "Congratulations, one and a half years later,
[01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:35.340]   you've actually won the contest and congratulations to you."
[01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:36.820]   And then we still have two boxes.
[01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:38.300]   How are we going to get rid of the other two?
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:39.780]   Well, we'll think of something.
[01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:40.780]   All right.
[01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:41.780]   I'm sure we'll get the university class for you.
[01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:43.300]   You want to do another contest?
[01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:44.300]   Yeah.
[01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:45.300]   Now that we've completed our first.
[01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:49.420]   Yeah, every, every, we'll do one every two years, whether we need to or not.
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:50.420]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:53.940]   This sweater sent in for John gets a box of.
[01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:54.940]   There you go.
[01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:56.940]   John, what address should they mail those sweaters to?
[01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:59.500]   They should send them to you.
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:00.500]   I'll blow it though.
[01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:02.220]   Just how people email me.
[01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:05.580]   I got to clear on me first, so I'd get in bags of dog crap or something.
[01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:06.580]   No way.
[01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:09.060]   Somebody actually sent me a box of crap.
[01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:10.060]   I mentioned this.
[01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:16.300]   I think probably a kind of muted protest over the contest, you know, dribbling off.
[01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:18.540]   And it was just full of power cords.
[01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:21.060]   Hey, you can't have any power.
[01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:22.300]   Are there any Shaver cords?
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:23.300]   No.
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:24.300]   It's a box.
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:29.060]   It was the cords that everybody has the same cord, you know, that standard AC cord that
[01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:30.060]   everybody's got a million of.
[01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:32.860]   And now I did any of the mouse ear cords in there for the old thing.
[01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:33.860]   Good.
[01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:36.740]   It was the same was a hundred PC power cords.
[01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:37.740]   And you know what?
[01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:40.020]   You can send them to my step sign up in Washington.
[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:41.500]   He sells that stuff on eBay.
[01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:44.020]   You get like five bucks a pop for those things.
[01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:45.260]   What do you think I could get?
[01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:46.260]   I have my own Mac cube.
[01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:48.420]   What do you think I could get for that on eBay?
[01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:50.020]   I can be 20 bucks for it.
[01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:51.660]   I probably make more of a power cords.
[01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:53.140]   You can get no, I think it's worth a lot.
[01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:54.620]   I think people can mod that thing.
[01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:57.260]   They can like pull out the guts and put in a good machine.
[01:10:57.260 --> 01:10:58.260]   It's a work of art.
[01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:00.420]   Yeah, it is actually quite attractive.
[01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:01.420]   Hold on, hold on.
[01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:02.420]   I'm going to eBay right now.
[01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:03.420]   I have to know.
[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:07.140]   Kevin is thinking, why did I ever say I'd appear on this show?
[01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:09.060]   What a bunch of geezers.
[01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:10.260]   Kevin, I do want to thank you.
[01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:11.260]   I'm sorry.
[01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:13.700]   Kevin, I don't talk in a second.
[01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:17.860]   He's formerly of the Microprocessor report, formerly AMD.
[01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:22.180]   Now he is doing marketing at NVIDIA.
[01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:25.820]   You're doing a great job, Kevin, because we all know the name NVIDIA.
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:29.780]   And I have a jacket.
[01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:31.620]   So you're doing a good job.
[01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:32.620]   You in that jacket.
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:33.860]   Thanks for having me.
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:34.860]   I really appreciate it.
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:37.860]   Thanks for sending us straight on to Conro too, it's good actually to get that information.
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:42.140]   And you couldn't have picked a better week to come on with the exciting news of the AMD
[01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:43.140]   ATI rumor.
[01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:44.140]   It's only a rumor.
[01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:50.540]   And I think we've turned that deal pretty good.
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:51.540]   Thank you, Kevin.
[01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:52.540]   And welcome to our talk.
[01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:53.540]   All right.
[01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:55.900]   And thank you, John C. Devorak for joining us.
[01:11:55.900 --> 01:12:00.140]   Send your sweaters and whatever else you'd like to to devorak.org/blog.
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:02.020]   Or check it out.
[01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:05.100]   Are you going to put a recipe up or anything up?
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:06.620]   Yeah, I'm going to put the recipe.
[01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:08.100]   I have, I found all the recipes.
[01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:09.340]   They were all done on board watch.
[01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:11.100]   I'm going to put a little page up with all of them.
[01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:12.100]   That's awesome.
[01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:13.900]   I've been developing some new recipes.
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:18.340]   So this is a recipe you came up with some scratch.
[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:20.180]   I designed recipes.
[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:22.780]   I've been doing it since I was a kid from the Devorak test.
[01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:24.180]   Something new about you.
[01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:29.060]   This particular recipe for flank steak, though, is not a is not something you wouldn't find
[01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:30.060]   out there.
[01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:31.740]   You could find it anywhere.
[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:37.100]   The key is to cut the muscle striations in a diagonal so it doesn't, you know, curl up.
[01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:40.860]   Actually, the key is to make sure they have a very high temperature that you cook with
[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:41.860]   and you said 800 degrees.
[01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:43.300]   What do you, how can you get?
[01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:44.300]   Where do you get 800 degrees?
[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:49.460]   You get 800 degrees off of a, off of a, off of a, a bongering fire of a mesquite charcoal.
[01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:50.460]   Okay.
[01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:51.460]   Yeah.
[01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:52.940]   A really big pile of.
[01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:54.500]   You basically are serious.
[01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:55.500]   Yeah.
[01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:56.500]   Yeah.
[01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:57.500]   Yeah, you are.
[01:12:57.500 --> 01:12:58.500]   All right, John, thank you very much.
[01:12:58.500 --> 01:12:59.500]   How about you?
[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:00.500]   It was a great afternoon.
[01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:06.460]   And of course to Patrick Norton, my good friend and owner of three, count them three
[01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:08.020]   boxes of crap.
[01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:10.340]   But dwindling now, we're going to get word of one anyway.
[01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:13.260]   Unless, unless she turns it down, then I don't know what we're going to do.
[01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:14.260]   Which thing?
[01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:17.620]   Well, you know, if it turns it, I'm sure we'll, if she turns it down, we'll, we'll give
[01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:21.580]   it to the first person who emails you requesting the box of crap.
[01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:22.580]   We could do that.
[01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:23.580]   We'll do that.
[01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:27.020]   We'll put it, I'll just put it on the front steps at the Twit headquarters and just maybe
[01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:29.020]   some homeless person will want a GPS device.
[01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:30.020]   I don't know.
[01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:31.180]   No, we're in sleeping.
[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:33.780]   You can, I'll tell you where Patrick Norton is sleeping these days.
[01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:39.860]   It's right under the desk at dl.tv with two or three shows a week.
[01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:40.860]   Two or three?
[01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:43.140]   We do two episodes of dl.tv.
[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:47.860]   We do an episode of John C. Duvallack on Cranky Geeks and we do a whole bunch of podcasts.
[01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:48.860]   He works hard.
[01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:51.380]   The hardest working guy in show business.
[01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:52.380]   Thank you Patrick.
[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:53.380]   Have a great afternoon.
[01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:54.380]   You too, let us know.
[01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:55.380]   All right, take care.
[01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:58.380]   And that just leaves me to saying another Twit is in the cast.
[01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:21.540]   I don't know what the answer is.
[01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:35.620]   I really don't.
[01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:36.620]   Microsoft proof rooted.
[01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:40.420]   The case could be denied is a no problem.
[01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:43.660]   The case could be a higher system.
[01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:45.420]   The case could be a higher system.
[01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:47.420]   The case could be a higher system.
[01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:49.420]   It's a fool's paradise.
[01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:51.420]   The case could be a higher system.
[01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:52.420]   It's amazing.
[01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:53.420]   I see you looking over here.
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:54.420]   All right.
[01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:55.420]   Do it in the Twit.
[01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:56.420]   All right.
[01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:57.420]   Do it in the Twit.
[01:14:57.420 --> 01:14:58.420]   All right.

[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:06.420]   All right.

[01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:08.420]   All right.
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:09.420]   Do it in the Twit, baby.
[01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:10.420]   Do it in the Twit.
[01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:11.420]   All right.
[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:12.420]   Do it in the Twit.
[01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:13.420]   All right.
[01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:14.420]   Do it in the Twit.
[01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:15.420]   All right.

[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:22.420]   All right.

[01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:24.420]   Do it in the Twit.
[01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:25.420]   All right.

[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:27.420]   Do it in the Twit, baby.
[01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:29.420]   baby
