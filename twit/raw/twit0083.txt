[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:57.320]   On the eve of the biggest week in the computer world
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.880]   we bring together five Twits, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.480]   Our long-lost Twit compadre from Revision 3 and Dig Kevin Rose
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.480]   is here.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.080]   Hello, Lo.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.320]   You don't tape--
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.560]   what day do you tape dignity?
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.960]   Wednesdays or Thursdays?
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.760]   So you're sober up by now.
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.600]   Right.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.640]   I'm actually-- I just got back from LA last night.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.800]   Ah, cool.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.920]   David Prager is also here from Revision 3.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.160]   David laughs knowingly.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.680]   We're going to actually--
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.800]   we're regrouping, and I hope you guys will come at 21st Amendment
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.280]   where this all began.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.040]   In fact, it began two years ago at Macworld.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.640]   That's what we're going to do Macbreak weekly on Tuesday
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.320]   after the keynote.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.080]   So come by.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.640]   It'd be kind of like old times.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.160]   Oh, immediately after the keynote like during the--
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.760]   No, we're doing the evening at 6 o'clock.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.240]   OK.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.560]   Yeah, no, we can't have beard to him in the afternoon.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.360]   Also here, Bill McCrone from PC Magazine.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.040]   Hello.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.440]   And a man who spent many a year walking
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.840]   in the streets of Vegas.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.600]   That sounds really good.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.440]   And the halls of the sands.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.960]   What?
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.920]   More down many a pair of shoes going up and down the LVCC
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.240]   South Hall.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.680]   Also, John C. Devorak.org/blog.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.560]   So a great panel.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.480]   And John and Bill, to me, you're the Macworld--
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.800]   I mean, the CES guys.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.720]   You're the guys who you go to CES.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.800]   You expect to see the stalwarts, the PC Magazine guys.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.920]   And then to me, Kevin Rose and David Prager,
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.480]   you're kind of more the Macworld guys.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.480]   They're kind of the Mac guys, right?
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.480]   That's so funny you say that because I've had my Mac--
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.840]   my first and only Mac for all of about five months now.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.200]   Oh, all right.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.800]   But you're hooked?
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.680]   You're hooked now.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.760]   Oh, it's fantastic.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.880]   And we're going to make Devorak nauseous here.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.440]   So let's be careful.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.040]   It was like the last show we did,
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.200]   we had these other two guys who were big Mac users,
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.560]   like YouTube guys.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.240]   But they're ranting and raving about how great Vista was.
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.760]   And that was making me sick.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.120]   Did we ever--
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.280]   What was that all about?
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.480]   You're just easily nauseated, I think.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.680]   That's the problem.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.800]   I need a patch.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.040]   I just interviewed literally moments ago,
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.040]   Peter Gutman from New Zealand, who
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.080]   wrote that article that's just spread like a wildfire
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.040]   on the internet about Vista's content protection
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.120]   and how it was going to hobble Vista and make it unreliable.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.840]   And really, what a big problem it
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.720]   was going to be for users.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.920]   I mean, did you read that article, anybody?
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.960]   And John, did you read it?
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.680]   Did you have an opinion?
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.600]   Never heard of it.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.720]   Never heard of it.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.280]   Isn't that something that came out quite a while ago?
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.000]   It came out on a security newsletter
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.400]   about a month ago.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.960]   The telegraph in England picked it up.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.640]   And it was--
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.360]   That's an old thing.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.280]   It's not that old.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.000]   It went around the internet pretty much a couple of days
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.360]   after Christmas is when I got about 100 years.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.840]   Yeah, I had internet years.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.520]   No, OK.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.360]   Well, we just talked to them.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.960]   It was actually a fascinating conversation.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.560]   It'll be on security now on Thursday.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.360]   But what's the-- do you wrap it up for us?
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.680]   Essentially, it looks like what Microsoft did
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.200]   is really give Hollywood everything they wanted
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.160]   and turn-- to turn Vista into a platform
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.880]   for playing high-def content.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.320]   In order to do that, I mean, the things you have to do,
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.600]   the AACS you have to support, the ways you have to--
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.400]   the spec from Hollywood is very vague.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.480]   Mostly, it looks like you have to prove to them
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.640]   that you're interested in protecting their content.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.360]   And Microsoft's been over backwards
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.160]   at the cost of reliability.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.080]   There's this thing called tilt bits.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.120]   Here's-- I'll give you a good example.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.680]   As you know, Bill McCrone, the hardware in PCs
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.440]   is pretty cheesy and voltages fluctuate like crazy.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.400]   And it's really-- there's got to be
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.440]   a lot of tolerance, a lot of redundancy
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.160]   to make a reliable PC.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.760]   Well, essentially, Microsoft said as well,
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.800]   anytime there's a voltage fluctuation,
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.120]   anytime anything doing a little odd, you set a tilt bit,
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.080]   and you have to reset the entire video subsystem.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.320]   You have to-- and we don't know how long that'll take,
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.280]   but you have to-- essentially, to avoid piracy.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.880]   So this tilt bit is named after a pinball machine?
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.360]   It is.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.360]   That would get to--
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.000]   Oh, brother.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.520]   The idea is if you're piracy stealing stuff,
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.160]   we're going to brick your PC.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.280]   Well, this comes down to one simple fact.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.000]   And that is that there is no reason to ever
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.160]   buy a media-centered PC, especially if it's running Vista.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.160]   But the point is, it's in all versions of Vista,
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.880]   and that's what's really scary.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.720]   I think what's odd is that Microsoft
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.120]   has put so much effort and so much energy into this.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.080]   And when it's really only a small subset,
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.360]   I think of Windows users that want
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.480]   to be playing high-def movies on their computer.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.240]   I mean, how important is that for computer users?
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.400]   For guys who want to rip their high-def content,
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.320]   they ain't going to have laptop--
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.400]   They're not going to watch it on the airplane.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.560]   It ain't going to happen.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.320]   What's wrong with that?
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.440]   What's wrong with ripping the content you paid good money
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.840]   for and then watching it on the airplane?
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.960]   Nothing, but try and do it on a Vista PC.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.800]   You'll be surprised.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.200]   You'll be surprised.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.000]   Anyway, that's just another hack that we have to work around.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.440]   Well, in fact, that's one of the stories
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.400]   we're going to talk about a guy named--
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.200]   I want to say Musilix.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.800]   Musilix 64--
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.720]   Musilich.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.720]   Musilich.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.400]   You know, that's the old glue.
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.840]   That shows your age, John.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.000]   I don't think they make Musilich anymore.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   That's not you.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   That's not you.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   I'm making it home.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.880]   That's a library glue, isn't it?
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.880]   Cracked.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.360]   I make it from the dog's toenail clipping.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.040]   It was made out of horses hoes.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.120]   That's exactly right.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:32.320]   This guy, Musilix 64, has cracked HD DVDs content protection.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.240]   Now, the crack he did is a little bit difficult to make work
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.760]   because you have to go out and get keys
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.960]   and he doesn't give you keys.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.080]   But it's a good proof of concept.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.960]   And he says he did it because he was so mad at Vista.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.960]   Right.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.840]   So why did Microsoft bother when they-- well, actually,
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.360]   they had to bother otherwise.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.440]   They would have out liked him.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.240]   But they probably knew from the outset
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.960]   that Google did somebody crack it in 60 days.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.400]   The real consequence-- I feel bad for video card manufacturers
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.320]   because they've got to do all this jumping through hoops,
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.320]   too.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.880]   I mean, it's tough to make a compliant card.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.680]   And they've eliminated the audio card business.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.800]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.640]   That's right.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.560]   So I have to say, though, I'm hooked on the HD DVD format.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.720]   It looks good, doesn't it?
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.280]   It does.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.320]   And honestly, the reason why I chose it over Blu-ray--
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:22.920]   I don't know.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.480]   I might go back.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:23.800]   Who knows?
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.920]   But it was just because it was so cheap and expensive.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.960]   For an add-on for the Xbox 360--
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.520]   You did the same thing I did.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.240]   199 bucks.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.320]   It was a Christmas present.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.400]   It was done deal.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:34.920]   Came with it.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.720]   It always comes down.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.640]   It moved into price.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.640]   Yeah.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.160]   Yeah.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.840]   Although the HD DVD format does have a lot of--
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.320]   like I said, I think the way we talked about this last week
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.760]   or the week before were, I've been to these dog and pony
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.520]   shows that they're putting on.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.720]   I'm going to go to a couple more down in CES.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.960]   And the HD DVD guys have a better pitch.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:51.680]   That's all I can say.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.720]   It's a better pitch.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.040]   It's a much better pitch.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.120]   And when they show you some of the cool features
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.920]   that they demand everybody put in those players, you go, wow.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.720]   I mean, these other guys have got a problem here.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.520]   Bill McCrone, do you come down on one side
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.120]   of the other in this war?
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.600]   I like what LG did.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.960]   They've got a combo player, and they
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.400]   live on both sides of the fence.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.760]   You know, I had an order out.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.440]   Tell me one, Bill.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.120]   Where is it?
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.400]   Well, they say it'll be out soon.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.880]   They're going to announce it at CES.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.760]   I'm going to look at it there, but I bet you don't ship it.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.040]   I had an order for the Toshiba HD DVD player.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.280]   Because one thing I don't like, Kevin,
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.360]   is how loud the Xbox 360 is.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.400]   And so--
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:22.920]   Oh, really?
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:23.960]   Haven't you noticed?
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.040]   It's kind of whiny.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.800]   I haven't got a lot of one.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.240]   I'll just crank up the audio, Leo.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.160]   You'll be fine.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:29.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:30.680]   That's probably my problem.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.880]   I'm playing it way too loud.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.360]   Yeah, I watch Chick-Flicks where there's actual conversation.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.280]   And that's when you can really hear it.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.400]   Those long pauses, you go, hmm.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.560]   But I added an order to--
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.480]   because it was so noisy, I ordered it to Toshiba HD DVD player.
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.120]   And then I canceled the order.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.920]   It's been back order for a while because of this LG.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.920]   So you don't think LG said Thursday.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.680]   It's going to launch a DVD player that supports both Blu-ray
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.840]   and HD DVD.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.120]   You don't believe it, John?
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.880]   No, I believe they're going to launch it.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.920]   But I would like to see it when they ship it.
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:07.280]   I mean, I'm just skeptical about this
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.920]   because everybody's been announcing these things
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:10.840]   over the last few years.
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.160]   And then they pull back for some unknown reason.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.480]   I just don't know.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.800]   Until I see one in my hands that is actually shipping,
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.600]   I'm not going to buy into any of this.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.680]   Yeah.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.160]   What's the price point on that?
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.920]   I don't have a Xbox and I don't have a PS3.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.520]   But if this thing ships and it's not insanely expensive,
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.320]   I'll buy it.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.720]   Well, that solves the problem.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.720]   I feel the same way.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.120]   I wait.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:31.560]   Which way?
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.880]   Let's go ask the poll.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.280]   The poll of guys now, what is not insanely expensive?
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.920]   I mean, what would you pay for when
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.080]   would you pay 600 bucks?
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.920]   Is that cheap or $350 for it?
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.200]   $450, $399.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.920]   Right now, the Blu-rays around $1000
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.720]   and the HD DVDs around $500 for the standalone players.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.600]   I pay $500.
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.880]   I wouldn't pay $1000 for a player.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.360]   Yeah, but it's still too early to figure out who's going to win.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.320]   Well, I mean, it comes down to when my mom and dad
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.200]   want to go out and buy one.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.480]   They're going to want to spend $100 to $150.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.080]   Whoever can get there first is going to win.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.400]   I went to Best Buy and it's frustrating because I'm looking
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.360]   at the HD DVD and most of the movies I want are an HD DVD.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.040]   But there's a couple of titles on Blu-ray.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.360]   You just really want that evil-- what is it?
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.840]   Evil Dead 3.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.720]   And it's only on Blu-ray.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.040]   It's a little frustrating.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.760]   Oh, man, that keeps me awake at night.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.200]   Actually, the truth is most of the movies on Blu-ray
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:24.960]   don't attract me.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.600]   And that's another reason why I thought HD DVD might win.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.400]   Yeah, they certainly are out early.
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.000]   And it's funny because the studios have all said, well,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.960]   we're Blu-ray.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:39.000]   And yet they've cranked out all of their content on HD DVD
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.720]   because it was their first.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.640]   And it was cheaper and more reliable.
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.560]   Man, I watched a movie by Sony.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.480]   This is a sidebar.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.440]   But I watched a movie by Sony last night.
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.320]   I went to see The Holiday.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.120]   I don't know.
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.600]   One of the Sony movie companies, MGM or whatever.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.840]   There was Sony computers, Sony TVs, Sony players.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.240]   It was like a Sony universe.
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.640]   And to me, it had a negative impact on me.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.160]   You know, it's odd since the Japanese are so into subtlety.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.000]   It was far from subtle.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.480]   I mean, Vio computers everywhere you look.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.640]   So that's like the New James bomb was that way.
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.680]   Well, what was it?
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.720]   Was it Sony?
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.680]   Yeah, Sony.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:15.520]   Yeah, they were everywhere.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.920]   I think it's terrible.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.320]   I think it takes you out of it.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.160]   It takes you out of--
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:19.800]   I blame Howard Stringer.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.360]   It takes you out of the movie.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.640]   It doesn't make me well disposed towards Sony.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.040]   It's certainly not subliminal.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.200]   Every mind we have, when we watch 60 Minutes with the family,
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.000]   we're finally get the kids to watch something like that.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.280]   And then as soon as they do one of those puff pieces,
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.360]   which they do constantly now, usually about an actor or a movie,
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.400]   the kids all chime in going, it's, I bet you it's a Viacom movie.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.920]   I bet you it's a Viacom movie.
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:43.400]   Oh, wow.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.320]   So everybody is clued into this.
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.120]   It's savvy to me.
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:46.600]   Yes.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.480]   They know this CBS--
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.760]   Yeah, but 60 Minutes did a puff piece on Howard Stringer.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.400]   Well, there you go.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.080]   Adon Alio, would you be saying this though if it was an Apple?
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.280]   Because you'd be seeing PowerBooks all over the place.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.480]   You do, but it's--
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.320]   And you don't care if it's an Apple.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.080]   No, but the Apple pays for it, and it's like product placement.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:05.960]   It's not like corruption.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.960]   I still would bug me if you--
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.800]   what it doesn't bug me is you see some apples
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.920]   and some other stuff.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.080]   But if it were all Apple, it's just not credible.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.360]   That's why, like, 24.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.360]   The bad guys use PCs.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.360]   The good guys use Macs.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.920]   It's just been like in real life.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.480]   Just like in real-- no, no, but I mean, that's to me.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.560]   I don't care if it's switched around.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:25.720]   Bad guys could use a Macs.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.520]   But at least there's some other models out there.
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.360]   I mean, it takes you out of the movie
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.800]   to be in a Sony universe.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.480]   It's not a Sony universe.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.960]   All right, let's get to the CES Blitz that we've been talking about.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.400]   Well, in a way, we've kind of been talking about CES
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.680]   because these are going to be the big stories.
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.080]   In fact, one of the big stories-- in fact,
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.240]   if you look at my recent column in MarketWatch,
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.160]   it's ready for the CES Blitz.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.880]   I mentioned that I think one of the big things that's
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.040]   going to happen there-- and everyone else can chime in on what
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.240]   they think is going to go on.
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.800]   But the HD DVD Blu-ray Wars, I think,
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.080]   are going to be a big deal there.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.040]   Absolutely.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.480]   And if LG-- if there are dual player boxes,
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.080]   won't that be the big story?
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.840]   Yeah, well, I'm sure that's why I'm first there.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.960]   I'm going to check out.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.840]   Will there be-- you'd think that be booths facing each other
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.880]   with HD DVD and Blu-ray?
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.280]   Growing marshmallows that each other.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.800]   Shooting any-- yeah.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.720]   Absolutely.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.240]   Now, you're not going to CES, Bill McCrone.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.680]   Do you feel like you're going to miss out?
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.280]   No, I'm not.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.200]   No, I don't.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.720]   I mean, all of this stuff is on the web.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.560]   I can talk to any PR person or whomever I want to.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.800]   I can get all of the information I want.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:33.080]   And as a matter of fact, I've gotten about all I can stand.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.440]   So I don't see a particular reason
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.840]   to subject myself to Las Vegas.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:38.920]   Last year, I didn't go.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:42.280]   And I put up that website, which was like the virtual CES
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.480]   show, because the show is over-covered.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.400]   I wouldn't go myself this year if I didn't
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.280]   have to do a couple cranky geeks there
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.480]   because somebody insisted.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.440]   Because believe me, I don't like the show at all.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.480]   I'm not going to enjoy it.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.440]   I guess I'll get to see a few people.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.080]   I get to glad hand and say, yeah, yeah, let's do lunch
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:13:59.640]   this year.
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:00.880]   People haven't seen for five years.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.120]   I'll never see them again.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.280]   Well, you've got to be cranky.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.400]   That's good.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.960]   It's just a-- yeah, well, I'm cranky generally anyway.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:07.680]   I don't know what it is.
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.200]   The weather.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.880]   But it seems like Comdex used to be fun.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.920]   Maybe it was because I was fresh faced and wet
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:13.720]   behind the ears.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.800]   But--
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.000]   Condex, to me, was always more concentrated.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:17.840]   It was about one thing.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.480]   This has got multiple topics.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.680]   And it's kind of a horrible thing to transverse.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.680]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.360]   Condex was more single focus.
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.920]   It was all about computers.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.480]   And it was total immersion.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.560]   And it was certainly right for its time.
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:38.840]   CES always has been and always will be, I guess,
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:43.840]   more than you can encompass or more than you'd want to.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:44.880]   Do you think always will be?
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.160]   I mean, will CES survive?
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.680]   Why did CES survive when Condex could not?
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.120]   And E3 could not.
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.560]   And so many other trade shows have gone by the way.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.280]   I'll tell you what, Gary Shapiro.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.600]   One guy kept it alive.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.720]   The chairman of the Consumer Electronics.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.800]   I think Gary Shapiro says that, yeah, I think if he left,
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.080]   to be honest about, I think the show would change drastically.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.720]   He's a-- you know, I just give him all the credit for it.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.080]   But if he sells it hard.
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:12.160]   If nobody wants to go there and nobody needs to go there,
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.320]   why do we need to show?
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.400]   Well, some people need to go, like, for example, me.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.640]   Yeah, because it's Patrick.
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.960]   Patrick, by the way, is not here today because he and Roger
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.960]   Changer in a van driving to CES right now.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.200]   This is why when somebody asks me, why don't you go to CES
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.440]   and say, because I don't work for Ziff Davis anymore.
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:32.080]   And I have to say, I'm really pleased I'm not on the way to CES.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.040]   On the other hand, I'm looking forward to going to Macworld.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.960]   Kevin Rose, are you excited about it?
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.200]   Yeah, Macworld's going to be fun.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.960]   We're going to do a live dignity there.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.800]   So that'll be cool from the showroom floor.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.960]   You're doing that Thursday.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:44.440]   Wednesday.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:44.880]   Wednesday.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:45.680]   OK.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.560]   Where are the days of Macworld?
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.160]   Well, Tuesday is the keynote.
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.160]   It starts on Tuesday, and then it goes through Friday.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.840]   Well, the conference on the 8th and then the Expo
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.680]   opens on the 9th.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.280]   Right, dead-- I mean, this has happened once or twice
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.200]   before, right against CES.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.040]   Well, not quite.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.160]   I mean, we can still do both shows on Thursday.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.920]   I'll go to Macworld and then I'll do a comparison report.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.120]   For the first time in a long time,
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.360]   Macworld's actually taking up a little bit more
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.840]   of the San Francisco Convention Center.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.360]   Two halls, instead of just one.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.960]   In fact, it's in the past, but it's kind of pathetic.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.560]   It wasn't even taking up a whole hall.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.400]   There was kind of curtains around it.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.800]   And so you wouldn't see all the vastness that was empty.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.920]   As I said, the problem with Macworld that I find, though,
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.560]   at least in the last couple of years,
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.880]   that it's all about the iPod.
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.880]   And it's like the entire floor, or a good portion of it,
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.840]   is nothing but accessories for the iPod.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.120]   Yeah, it's the iPod accessory show.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.160]   This year is-- I've been told by everybody
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.800]   is going to be a big year because of the announcements
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:45.560]   Apple's going to make.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.240]   Now, here's the latest on the iPhone.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.240]   Now, you Kevin really kind of broke the iPhone.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.160]   And I've heard now a number-- you said
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:56.000]   it was going to be a dual mode GSM or CDMA.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.920]   I had somebody tell me on the radio show,
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.400]   sounded like you knew what he was talking about.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.920]   It was going to be CDMA and that they were working on the deal.
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:06.600]   He just sent me an email saying the deal didn't happen.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:11.000]   And that means that there will not be an iPhone announcement.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.120]   They couldn't make the carrier agree.
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.040]   What were they going to call it?
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.600]   Because Cisco had the iPhone name.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.760]   It wasn't going to be an iPhone.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.520]   In fact, this guy said it wasn't going to have
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.080]   I in the word at all.
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:27.080]   Another guy told me that it was going to be called the iChat
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.880]   mobile, which I find hard to believe.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:30.720]   Yeah.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.800]   Yeah.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.200]   Terribly.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.120]   Well, it'll be interesting.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.120]   Probably nothing will come up.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.120]   But there won't be a phone.
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.000]   There won't be a phone.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.200]   There will be the ITV.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:39.800]   I think we agree.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.840]   It won't be called the ITV.
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.080]   This is going to be an interesting device.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.600]   In fact, the number of people who told me this is going to be much bigger than anybody
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.600]   realizes.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:50.360]   You know, I heard a rumor about the ITV that has to do with them partnering with Netflix
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.760]   and doing rentals, streaming downloadable rentals through the ITV.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.760]   Wow.
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:55.760]   High def?
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:56.760]   I don't know about high def.
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:57.760]   I want high def.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.760]   But it has to be high def.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.000]   That would be the biggest mistake they could make by not going high def.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.120]   So this is a solution that may be a good way Apple.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:10.560]   Instead of trying to build in this high def capability into the operating system and
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.560]   bogging the whole system down, make it a black box.
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.640]   Take it out of the computer.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.480]   If you want high def content, buy a separate box.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.480]   Well, they have that right now.
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.800]   I mean, have you tried the marketplace for the Xbox 360?
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:22.800]   Yes, I have.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.800]   And actually, I love it.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.120]   So have you seen the downloadable high def movies that they have?
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.080]   You can get Superman right now on the Xbox 360 high def.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.240]   They're rattles.
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.240]   And there's one.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.240]   Yeah.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.240]   And there's one big problem.
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.240]   You only have a 20 gig.
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.240]   The currency.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.240]   But 20 gig.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.040]   I don't know if you can put one high def movie on there.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.040]   But yeah, they're rentals.
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.040]   That's true.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.040]   But you know what else kills me?
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.040]   Is the currency that they use?
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.640]   They use those Microsoft's like little points and you can't figure out like quickly what
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.640]   the conversion rate is.
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.000]   So you're like a my spending.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   I didn't spend.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   No idea what you're spending.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.320]   Credits are at $6 approximately.
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.320]   It's just kind of confusing.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.360]   It kind of worked for me though.
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.120]   I just spend spend spend because it's all just points, right?
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.120]   Right.
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.120]   Funny money.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.680]   Yeah, it's funny money.
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.680]   It's weird.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:09.160]   It's the TV shows are I believe a buck 99, although it's what 160 Microsoft points or
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.160]   something.
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.160]   That's weird.
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.160]   All right.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.080]   Well, you know, another thing that's going to go on at the CES show, apparently according
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:19.480]   to the list that CES themselves put out is a promotion of this HDPLC.
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:20.480]   What's that?
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:26.080]   Which is the new high definition power line communication, you know, standard that supposedly,
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.760]   you know, this has been going on for years, right?
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:28.760]   Bill's been following it.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.280]   I've been following it.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.880]   Where you have these, you know, these systems that use the power lines in your house and
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:37.760]   then the whole neighborhood for all the, you know, for all practical purposes that to
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.640]   communicate at some high bit rate used to start off at one mega bit than one to two
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.080]   then one to ten, they went to a hundred supposedly.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:48.200]   And now I just think called HDPLC, which is supposed to be the system that you can plug
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.760]   in that with the wall.
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:55.000]   And then anywhere in the room house, you can plug in a connector and you get high definition
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.880]   streamed from your PC over the power line.
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.280]   So is it networking or is it just?
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.280]   It is networking.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.000]   It's not just for TV.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   No, no, it's networking.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.440]   And then the, you know, the long term speculation is that what you have, you'll be able to buy
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:12.880]   television sets that have that networking capability built into the power plug itself
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.840]   and you won't have to hook anything up.
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.840]   But you know, I, I want a microwave with that built in the nose, a movie I'm watching
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.200]   and puts the right pizza in.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.400]   Or maybe puts the cat in.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.840]   Do you know what the throughput capacity is supposed to be of this HDPLC?
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.160]   Well, I'm going to look it up right now.
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:35.280]   That's one of the issues with the ITV as well, is it's going to be over Wi-Fi.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.120]   According to B.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.320]   Well, you're sonic, it's 190 megabits.
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.600]   You need a hundred ninety megabit?
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.960]   No, but you only need like 19 megabits for high def, right?
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:43.960]   Right.
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:44.960]   Yeah, that's panasonic is a big.
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.960]   It's a big.
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:46.960]   It's a push of this, by the way.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.120]   So in theory, if I had a neighbor that lived a couple of doors down, they could put a
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.800]   movie in for me to watch at my house.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:52.880]   You know, that's what I'm thinking.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.120]   You can, you can join the network.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.240]   You know, you can already do this, I say already.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:06.240]   This stuff isn't really available yet, but wireless USB is getting an equally big push.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.480]   And that's ultra wide band.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:12.640]   And it's, and of course, it's not over the power lines.
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.840]   It's transmitted, but that's 480 megabits.
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.080]   That's full speed USB.
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.080]   And what's the distance though?
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.080]   That goes.
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.440]   Yeah, it doesn't have a great distance.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:25.080]   Yeah, but all you have to do is put a reflector behind your antenna and you're there.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:29.280]   Yeah, you know, but it's not as good as stealing the signal from your neighbor.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.280]   Come on.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.280]   Well, no, you can beam it to your neighbor.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.280]   Does it go through walls?
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.560]   I mean, is it pretty high frequency?
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.320]   Well, it's ultra wide band.
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:40.200]   It covers a huge, you know, it's like that spy stuff that was.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.640]   It's a spectrum that spread spectrum.
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:42.640]   Yes.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.960]   Well, actually it's not quite, it's not really spread spectrum.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.600]   It's more of a, you know, a bit of a heady Lamar, right?
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.640]   No, no, that's heady Lamar.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.440]   So this is ultra wide bands, a different kind of technology.
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.440]   It is a technology.
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.680]   It's a sputter radio, it's got all kinds of different names.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.640]   But it goes through walls pretty well.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.480]   In fact, it's used for radars.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:04.080]   Ground penetrating radar is this technology.
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.880]   Will it heat up my alpo?
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.400]   You only put it.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.400]   I must be hungry.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.320]   We're doing this at dinner somewhere.
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:16.160]   No, but the serious point is that, you know, these microwave radiation, I mean, this high
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.080]   power microwave radiation could be dangerous, couldn't it?
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:24.840]   No, ultra wide band is like spread spectrum in that it doesn't stay long at any one frequency.
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.640]   So the heating effects are nil.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.640]   Very cool.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:32.720]   It's actually worse than that because the FCC has limited the power to such an extreme
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.200]   that you get more radiation from a digital watch.
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:40.000]   I put my Wi-Fi base station at the head of my bed.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.520]   You think I'm going to get brain cancer?
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:44.520]   Not from that.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:45.520]   No?
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.520]   Probably.
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.520]   Not from that, says John.
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.120]   What will I get it from, John?
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.760]   The radium dial on your clock or, you know.
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.280]   That's more dangerous probably.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.280]   Yeah.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.280]   By far.
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:00.680]   Well, so the ITV, the rumor is we'll use 802.11n.
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.720]   And of course, the reason there's a rumor for that is because all of the new Macs have
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.360]   this kind of stealth 802.11n capability.
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.360]   Is that fast enough for I-deaf?
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.360]   Are you kidding?
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.360]   That was up to 600 megabits per second with the latest iteration.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.760]   But in reality, isn't?
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:16.760]   It's going to be fast.
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:17.760]   Okay.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.600]   So we've got really a number of ways to move these high-deaf signals around.
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:25.600]   I mean, I think that's about people want better not to use wires if you can.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.360]   Yeah, they said it's going to have an HDMI port.
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.760]   So you get there.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:30.920]   I'm excited about it.
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:34.560]   So the rumor is that Netflix deal, any other rumors about that, Kevin?
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:35.560]   No, that's it.
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.560]   That's just all I heard.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.800]   So I don't know when that's coming out or.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:39.800]   And will you have a hard drive?
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.760]   I guess it'd have to if you're going to download movies.
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.720]   Well, it's streaming from your client, right?
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:49.480]   So if it was built into iTunes, you can log into your Netflix account through iTunes or
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.320]   through just, yeah, I don't know.
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:54.480]   That would solve the problem because iTunes, they only have Disney movies and iTunes.
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.880]   That'd be huge.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:01.680]   But you know, there is a silliness factor in this, all of this wireless USB and so forth,
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:06.560]   because they're talking about cameras, just bring your camera into the room and you can
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:09.360]   transmit the pictures to your PC.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:13.680]   Well, the wireless USB isn't going to recharge the camera or all of those other devices.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:16.680]   That recharge from your USB cable.
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.520]   So you still have to plug something in.
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:23.320]   I want those little mats that I've been seeing all over the place on digging and gadget and
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.320]   all that.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.320]   Have you seen those little mats that you can just set yourself on on or set your camera
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.320]   on?
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.320]   Just charge the device.
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:33.160]   And so then you have to basically attach the antenna, which, you know, is just a wire
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:40.400]   and a diode to the back of your device so that it can receive that power and convert
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.400]   it into DC and charge the battery.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.400]   How do you try to build?
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.400]   Does it work?
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.400]   Well, of course it works.
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:50.240]   But I mean, this is not new technology by any stretch.
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.920]   I mean, Nikola Tesla invented this.
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.000]   I mean, it's really a century old.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   Right.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   So more.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   Well, sometimes a good stuff is the old stuff.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.360]   We're going to see it.
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:07.560]   Speaking of one of the old stuff, we're going to see a lot of new TV technologies at CES this
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:08.560]   year.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:12.320]   The biggest non-show is SED.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.160]   I want my SED.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.560]   Silicon admitting diodes.
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:17.560]   Is that what that is?
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.960]   No, surface-electron emitter.
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.160]   Yeah, this is the same thing.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:27.560]   Pony baloney technology at the FEDs were years ago, field emission, whatever they were.
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.560]   So that's why we're going to see them.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.560]   Is it is it bogus?
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.560]   Yeah, you know, I got an argument with Harry about this.
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.560]   Yeah, he was all excited about it, wasn't he?
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:36.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:41.080]   Well, jacked up about it, and I told him this is a BS technology that looks good on paper
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:42.800]   and it has all these other characteristics.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.920]   And then the FED thing went on for almost 10 years.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:49.640]   The company came to less and dropped more money than any other company in the history
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.000]   of venture capital.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.920]   They couldn't get the thing to work.
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.400]   There's a couple of companies out of France.
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.400]   It was going on.
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:00.000]   And most of those patents have been all bought by Toshiba and they're trying to, they renamed
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   it SED.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.920]   Oh, it's exactly the same?
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.600]   Did you see the SED set last year?
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:09.560]   No, I never, you know what, the thing is everybody does say this one thing I have to say.
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:15.280]   I saw old FED technology, but when I, the SED stuff, everybody says it's the most spectacular
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.840]   flat panel you'll ever see and it's possible.
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.640]   But that doesn't mean they can make them.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.640]   Well, exactly.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:28.880]   I mean, that's the problem is that Toshiba has come out and said it's not going to be
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:34.760]   a consumer product for this foreseeable future, but as a professional display product.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:41.040]   So that means it's going to be $10,000 enough for moderate sized SEDs.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.800]   But boy, are these things gorgeous.
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:44.800]   You saw it?
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:45.800]   Yes, yes.
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.440]   And it looks great?
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:55.360]   It's like walking up to, I don't know, like a McKnight lithograph except that it's a television
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.360]   set.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.160]   I mean, it's a flat surface that...
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:03.400]   It's orders of magnitude better than an LCD or a plasma then.
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.160]   Is that what everyone says?
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.160]   Definitely better.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.160]   Yes.
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:13.280]   Visibly, I mean, just walk right up to it and man, the resolution, the color saturation,
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.280]   everything.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:18.200]   Now, the problem is that it's a phosphor-inmissive display.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.760]   So like a plasma, you can conceivably burn it in.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.360]   So it's not perfect.
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:26.520]   Right, but it's the same way with a regular old CRT.
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.160]   I mean, my understanding was that this is the CRT.
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:36.040]   It is a flat CRT, essentially, instead of having a scanning electron gun, it has individual
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.560]   electron guns behind every phosphor.
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:39.560]   So it can be totally flat.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.280]   And that's what an FED was.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:45.280]   But they had all kinds of problems with heating was one of the things, the things would heat
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:48.560]   up because of all these guns and then melt.
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:49.560]   And then they had...
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:53.000]   And because the gun was so close to the phosphor, it would also burn out the phosphors.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   They needed special...
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.960]   I mean, there's one thing after another with this technology.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:59.040]   So are they going to even bring the demo TV back?
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.040]   Not this year.
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.200]   Not even the demo.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.200]   I don't think so.
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.200]   Wow, that's not a good sign.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.200]   I think it's off the...
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.200]   That's a bad sign.
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:10.640]   If you can't even bring the demo, you know, you got a problem.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:15.480]   But on the other hand, the Elcos sets liquid crystal on silicon.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:21.280]   You know, JVC, as they're what, D-I-L-A and Sony is SXRD.
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.280]   They're looking pretty darn good in the rear projection.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.360]   I have to point out, John, you didn't think Elcos was going to happen.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:29.000]   In fact, a couple of years ago, maybe it was last year you said, "That's it.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   It's over.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   Nobody makes them.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   Nobody's going to make them."
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:38.520]   Well, you know, I'm still not going to give Elcos the award for like taking over the world.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.520]   In terms of...
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:43.080]   I mean, I've seen some Elcos displays that look pretty good.
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.080]   I don't know.
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.080]   I have mixed films about it.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.920]   We have a guy on our blog, by the way, Devoract.org/blog.
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.920]   You may have heard of it.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:53.000]   Alex Pultry, who is actually an expert.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.960]   He's actually an editor at one of the magazines that describes parts more or less.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:03.000]   But he's like a superstar with display technology.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.200]   He's written about this quite a bit.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:09.240]   We'll post some of that stuff.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.240]   He's kind of more...
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:13.320]   Actually, he's kind of leans toward Elcos too a little bit.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:15.320]   Never mind.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:25.160]   Of the two, I think that JVC's D-I-L-A is probably a little better than SXRD.
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:31.960]   Unfortunately, they don't make a set that fits in the nook that I have.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:36.720]   If size and price were no object and you could choose any technology right now, Bill McCrum,
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.880]   which one would you choose?
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:44.360]   Tough choice because some of the DLP sets that are now illuminated by three LEDs and
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:53.760]   three DLP chips are awesome because the LEDs have a bigger color gamut than any light bulb.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:30:01.760]   And it would be between JVC-DI-LI or some of these three DLP sets.
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:02.760]   Plasma's out.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:03.760]   It's gone.
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:04.760]   It's over.
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:05.760]   I'm not interested in plasma.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:06.760]   I don't know.
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:12.120]   Because when you do get close to them and I don't advise it because they just don't look
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.680]   good when you get close.
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:19.000]   LCD has better resolution when you get close.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.240]   Elcos has seamless resolution.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:25.480]   There's no pixels at all.
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:31.560]   You don't see that window screen-ish kind of separation that you do on the direct view.
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:35.000]   The guy we should be asking is Kevin, he's the only one that monks just here that can
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   actually afford one of these things.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.320]   Well, he got his sofa.
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:40.840]   Did you buy a TV now, Kevin?
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.040]   I did get a TV.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.040]   What'd you get?
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:47.200]   I went to Best Buy and got a Samsung flat screen LCD.
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.200]   I think...
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.200]   I don't know.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.000]   How big is it, Prager?
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.400]   How big can you buy them?
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.400]   I'll buy the biggest.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.880]   It's probably about 42.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.680]   It's like 800 on TV.
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.480]   It's not bad.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:04.240]   I confess to having just bought, and now that I made the mistake, I bought plasma TV.
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.880]   You know what I like?
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:06.880]   I love this.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:07.880]   I like this.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:08.880]   I don't think there's a mistake.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:09.880]   I think there's a mistake.
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:10.880]   I like it.
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:11.880]   I like my...
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.440]   Well, the Visio, man, Visio just announced a...
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.440]   What was it?
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.440]   They're under three grand.
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.960]   They just announced a new huge LCD.
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.960]   And they look good.
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:20.960]   They're cheap.
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.160]   They're doing good.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:25.640]   I think where you lose something in Visio, I may be wrong, and I wish, Harren, we're here
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:30.840]   to verify this is on the processing capabilities.
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:34.520]   When you watch a standard definition television, for instance, on it, it does not look that
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:37.920]   good because they just don't have the hardware in there to...
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.800]   In the plasma?
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:40.800]   Or the LCDs.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:41.800]   I think that's where they're...
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:42.800]   I mean, they're cheap.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:43.800]   These Visios are very expensive.
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:44.800]   That's because it costs...
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.600]   You have to put those forucius or...
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:47.600]   Exactly.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.600]   Or whoever...
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:49.600]   And that costs money.
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:51.600]   That's right.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.240]   And they make a bundle on that.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.240]   Here it is.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.240]   Visio, 60-inch...
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.240]   They'll probably show this at...
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:59.840]   In fact, they're going to show this at CS 60-inch plasma.
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:03.520]   Get this for a 60-inch plasma under $3,000.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:04.520]   Yeah.
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:05.520]   Unbelievable.
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:11.640]   My sister and I just bought my mama a flat screen from Costco.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.840]   29.9 holiday break.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:14.840]   The Mecksum.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:15.840]   Dertcheaps.
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:16.840]   Yeah, they're amazing.
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:17.840]   They've really gone right.
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:18.840]   Costco.
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:19.840]   We're getting more publicity for Costco.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:20.840]   They're crazy.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:21.840]   They're literally...
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.520]   I know, but they owe us free publicity.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:25.520]   They owe us free memberships now.
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.520]   Right.
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:27.520]   Seriously.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.520]   You don't have to...
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:29.520]   Do you have to pay for a membership to come?
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.520]   Yes.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:31.680]   $50 a night at Costco member.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.080]   What planet do you live on?
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.080]   I'm not.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.600]   I thought you had to be in the Union or something.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.520]   No, that's Gemko from the 60s.
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:41.400]   I'm not in the Union.
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.800]   I don't know if I can join.
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:44.800]   Was that the...
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:49.200]   Hey, Jerry, what's the story guy with the belly or was that an East Coast thing?
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.520]   I don't remember that one.
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:56.920]   So other TV technologies, are there any other new TV technologies?
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:57.920]   Yes.
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:02.560]   I've heard a lot of rambling about metadata and TV and building your own custom clips.
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.440]   Is anybody released anything on that?
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.440]   Oh, be cool.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.440]   Well, they were...
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.440]   Who was it?
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:10.480]   It was direct TV that I went to their booth last year at CES and they were talking about,
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:16.680]   "Okay, let's say Brent Farm throws four passes over the last three weeks that have gone longer
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:17.680]   than 40 yards.
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:21.600]   And you'll be able to put that into your television and it'll build you a custom clip
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.280]   based on the recordings that are on your DVR.
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.280]   That's what I want.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.280]   Why?
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.280]   You like Brent Farm that much?
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:28.280]   I do.
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.280]   I do.
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.280]   It's Brent Farm.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.280]   Not "Butt Farm."
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.280]   I thought it was...
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:33.280]   Did I say "Butt Farm"?
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.280]   I think you were...
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.440]   I'll have to go back and check the tape, Alex.
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.720]   You can't tell me that's not cool though.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:39.720]   I mean, first words...
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:40.720]   It would be cool.
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:41.720]   And though, for any clips, it would be great.
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.920]   You could have the best sign-filled jokes or the...
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.720]   Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:49.520]   It's taking flicker style tagging and bringing it to TV.
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.520]   Oh, this is when you get to the camera.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:52.520]   They have to be duplicated.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:53.520]   That's what's gonna happen with YouTube.
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.120]   Don't you think that's what's gonna happen?
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:59.440]   You can launch your own station and people can groove on your clips.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.440]   That's right.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.320]   It's the Leo station.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.800]   I am nauseated.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:09.840]   Officially, we've now nauseated two out of the five panelists.
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:10.840]   That's really great.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:14.120]   Hey, let's talk about other ridiculous stuff.
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.120]   Okay.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.120]   It has a working list, right?
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:21.920]   And I'll give you one that's on the dvorak.org/blogblog.
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:22.920]   Okay.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:27.760]   And that is the new dual HD DVD Blu-ray discs.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.880]   Yeah, you know, I'm skeptical about this one too.
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.880]   Time Warner.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.560]   Time Warner Brothers is announced.
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:37.800]   They're gonna make Blu-ray and HD DVD single disc.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.720]   It's called Total HD DVD.
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:42.560]   And I guess you could put it in either player.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:43.560]   Great idea.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:47.640]   This is the one upspinship from the combo disc.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:49.600]   I think it was universal, whoever it was.
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:53.880]   It said they're gonna have a regular DVD on one side and then HD DVD on the others.
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.000]   And so this like ups the ante on that idea.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.440]   But the technologies are so different from HD DVD and Blu-ray.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:00.920]   I don't know how they're gonna make them.
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:01.920]   I mean, it's doable.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:05.200]   I mean, except for the fact that it's gotta be an expensive proposition.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.560]   I think a dual player is a better solution than a dual format disc.
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.480]   Do you decide a laminated disc?
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:15.080]   On one side, one on the other, they couldn't interleave them.
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.080]   I can't imagine that.
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.080]   No, you can't interleave them.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:23.040]   No, the problem with Blu-ray, the surface that's recorded on is very close to the surface of
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.720]   the disc that you're reading from.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:29.560]   With the regular DVD and HD DVD, it's actually behind the label and you have to go through
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.440]   a bunch of plastic to get to the data.
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.440]   It's true.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:36.720]   And so you'd have to have this one layer that has both, I mean, it's just maybe laminating
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:39.080]   two discs and gluing them together might work.
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:40.880]   I don't know how they're gonna do it.
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:46.000]   It's very clearly there's some attempt to resolve this battle, I mean, from a number
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.080]   of different camps.
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.080]   I don't know.
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:53.240]   I like the idea that, am I wrong, but does Blu-ray only support MPEG-2?
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.240]   Yes.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.240]   That's one of the issues, too.
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.920]   I mean, HDOT 264 is so much better looking.
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:01.720]   I just seems to me that that's a disadvantage.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:04.760]   But Blu-ray holds more on the disc, so less compression.
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:10.520]   And if you start adding layers, if you start adding layers, Blu-ray can hold a lot more.
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:14.080]   I think the Blu-ray, I would like to see the combo disc work out because I'd like to see
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:20.040]   a Blu-ray that we can use in our computers that have multiple layers read/write capabilities
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.480]   so we can back up these huge hard disks that we're starting to get.
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:27.640]   And then HDD, I think, should be the stuff for the consumer electronics.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:30.120]   I think the combo thing is a way to go.
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.120]   That's the only way it's gonna be resolved.
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:36.360]   Speaking of multilayer Blu-ray writing, that's gonna be expensive.
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.360]   I like that, though.
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:40.920]   I'm like, well, a number of manufacturers, I'm sure HP and Apple both are gonna do Blu-ray
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:41.920]   discs.
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:47.700]   Maybe the Apple will even announce them on Tuesday, but I'm sure they're both gonna do
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:50.000]   Blu-ray drives in their machines.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   That would be cool.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   That would be cool.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   That would be cool.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.040]   It may not be multilayer, maybe single layer, but they'll be rewrite, I'm sure.
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:37:02.000]   Speaking of big hard drives, Hitachi announces the first terabyte drive out by end of March.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   Pretty cool.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.800]   Would you buy a terabyte drive?
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.680]   I have one now.
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.480]   I have a terabyte drive.
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.480]   I have one of the Maxter ones.
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.480]   It's not one disc.
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.960]   Oh, it's multiple drives.
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:13.960]   Well, yes, so.
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.760]   I'm rated to make a terabyte.
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:16.960]   It's a terabyte.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.880]   But you can still do it with just two.
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.080]   You can do it with two spindles.
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.080]   That's not bad.
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:22.280]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:24.520]   So is there a point in getting a terabyte drive?
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:27.600]   I just worry about the density on the discs.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:28.600]   Why?
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:29.600]   Because the Teriel Dense is so high.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.600]   They were worried that they were gonna be unreliable.
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:34.560]   Okay, well, this brings me to an anecdote.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:35.560]   Here it comes.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:36.560]   Okay.
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:42.480]   Years and years ago when the first gigabyte drives came out and then the first one was
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.480]   a nine gig.
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:46.040]   I remember when the nine gigabyte drive came out and this is-
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:47.240]   Well, it will never work.
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:50.520]   My Cropolis was still in business.
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:54.840]   And my Cropolis decided to stop making these big drives and make go into RAID.
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:59.240]   And I went to the booth at one of these shows and the guy from Macropolis says, you know,
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:01.880]   it's in the same panicky way that you did Leo.
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:09.040]   He says, you know, this is the way to go, this RAID thing because nobody will ever trust
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:12.240]   nine gigabytes on a single spindle.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.640]   They never happen.
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:16.400]   I got nine gigabytes in my pocket, baby.
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.160]   It's unbelievable.
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:23.360]   So the terabyte, I mean, maybe when you get to a petabyte, that's when I'll bail out.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.360]   All right.
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.760]   Hey, can I try and try something out on you?
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:31.240]   Because I don't know whether this is great or ridiculous, you know, and that's where
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:32.800]   he's me when I can't tell the difference.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:33.960]   And you guys can be-
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.840]   We'll be here ridicule meters.
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:36.840]   Okay.
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:37.840]   All right.
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:42.680]   So location based services, GPS, you know, the whole you are here phenomena.
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:43.880]   And here's what else is here.
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:44.880]   Now that you're here.
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:45.880]   Awesome.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:46.880]   Awesome.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:47.880]   That's built into this.
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:48.880]   That's built into this.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:49.880]   All right.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:50.880]   Keep going.
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:51.880]   Keep going.
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:52.880]   You didn't finish.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:53.880]   Okay.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:56.960]   Now, so you can get a Garmin or, you know, you name it GPS device.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:01.840]   And the way they're going with these things is it can give you not only the location of
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:06.920]   the local gas station, the nearest gas station in case you're low, but also the prices that
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:07.920]   they're charging.
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:11.520]   So you can get the price and you should love it.
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:12.520]   Local weather.
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:13.800]   I mean, you are here.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:17.000]   Why don't you just look out the damn window?
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.720]   I mean, I don't understand.
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:21.720]   Do I really need to come to the first chat?
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:22.720]   I can't imagine.
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.920]   I mean, are you, is this a company you're going to get involved with, Bill?
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:30.640]   I would buy a thing, a device if there was, if that had that capability that you just
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:31.640]   described.
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:32.640]   They're already available.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.800]   Well, where it gives me the gas prices?
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:40.440]   The way you call, who's, who's, who is that?
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.280]   The newbie from Garmin?
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.280]   Newbie 680.
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.280]   Yes.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:45.280]   Has that feature.
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.280]   You have that.
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:47.280]   You have that.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.280]   I know.
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.280]   I just got it.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.280]   Well, tell us about it.
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.280]   I don't, I have, I didn't know it had that feature.
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:55.760]   I don't have one and I'm telling you the features.
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.560]   No, no, no, I think either I have the 600 of the 680, I have one of the new newbies and
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:02.760]   it's got, I mean, the coolest thing it has is the traffic stuff.
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:03.760]   You can.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:04.760]   Let's have from XM, right?
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:05.760]   Yes.
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:06.760]   Yeah.
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:08.640]   And then I am pretty certain, but I don't want.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.080]   That's a $10 a month thing, though.
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.080]   It's an add-up.
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:15.160]   Oh, now this one, the newbie 680 gets it from MSN Direct.
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:19.320]   And that's why you get, you get gas prices and movie times because you get, you have
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.680]   MSN basically tied into it.
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:22.680]   Wow.
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:23.680]   So it's the spot watch.
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:24.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:25.680]   It's on your dash.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.680]   It's a, it's a spot GPS.
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:28.680]   But yeah.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.960]   And you know, it's better on your dash than your wrist, frankly, those spot watches look
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.480]   so stupid on people's wrists.
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.320]   And, and the thing is they're still small enough that you can stick it in your pocket
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:40.040]   and go hiking or walking around the town or whatever.
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.400]   You're going to pay some money for this though.
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:42.400]   It's a thousand bucks.
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.960]   How much was the one you bought, David?
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.520]   I got it for the holidays.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.240]   Oh, it was a gift.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.240]   But they said, what do you want?
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:49.240]   And like, how about this?
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.800]   And I send a link and next thing, you know, I got it.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.360]   I think that was pretty well.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:53.360]   Nice.
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:54.360]   I don't know if I had to go anywhere.
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.040]   I'd get one of these, but I never go anywhere.
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.080]   I know exactly how to get to my office and back.
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:01.680]   Well, I mean, the great thing about having it is, is that you can take it, you can, it's
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:04.880]   so portable, you can stick it anywhere you go, which means like you might not want it
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.920]   in your factory condition automobile.
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:08.920]   Right.
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:12.120]   But when you travel, you can throw it in your backpack or your suitcase and take it anywhere
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:13.120]   you want.
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.120]   Very cool.
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.560]   My brother has one of these products, not the same model, older one, but he was able to,
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.680]   he used to live in Prague and he has a place out there and he was able to buy the maps
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:24.440]   and load it onto his garment device and all of a sudden he can drive all over Eastern
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:26.040]   Europe with the darn thing.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:29.840]   But I think to answer your question, Bill, I don't think location-based services are
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:30.840]   all goofy.
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.800]   I think that's, there's a lot there.
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:39.040]   You know, Vista will find other Vista computers and say hi for you.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.040]   Zoom style.
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.280]   It sounds like some I don't need.
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:46.000]   Well, I think the neat thing about the gas station thing is, I mean, I've been on the
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.320]   freeway with these things and you can hit look for gas stations and I'll tell you there's
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.320]   a shell over here.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.320]   I like the idea of it telling you prices.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:56.240]   And if it'll also tell you the prices, then I'll go to the ones that got the cheap prices.
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:57.240]   Love that.
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:02.920]   Hey, I've got a question for all everybody since Bill's asking these open questions.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:06.920]   How did, where did Garmin come from out of the blue to become such a dominant characteristic
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:09.640]   or get dominant character around a long time?
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:11.440]   Yeah, but they came out of the blue.
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:12.760]   They like took over the business.
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:18.440]   No, they came out of the military industrial complex.
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:25.360]   They were doing all of that early GPS system when it was all proprietary and mostly military.
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:27.360]   So they've got the heritage to do it.
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.520]   Yeah, they had the oldest heritage.
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:34.720]   My first GPS was that I purchased for some of the stuff I was even doing in Boy Scouts
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:37.360]   way back in the day over, you know, Boy Scouts.
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:38.880]   You had GPS in Boy Scouts.
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.280]   That's well, I get the tail.
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:41.280]   We barely had fire.
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:44.880]   When I was a kid, we didn't have kids.
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:47.360]   But it was Garmin based.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:51.000]   It was really nasty and clunky, but it was, yeah, it was an old Garmin.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   Interesting story.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.480]   It needs to be told.
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:58.120]   According to Wikipedia, Garmin is a Taiwan based company incorporated in Georgetown,
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.120]   Cayman Islands.
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:00.120]   Uh oh.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.120]   This doesn't sound any.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.120]   That's a bad sign.
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.120]   Cayman Island.
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.120]   That sounds.
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.960]   That's a really bad sign.
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:08.160]   I don't think, let me see.
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:12.440]   In 1991, they, their first Garmin GPS is in 1991.
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:13.440]   So that's a long time.
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:15.000]   Are you looking at the same Wikipedia?
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.120]   No, I'm looking at Garmin's site.
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:18.080]   I'm not sure that I would trust the Wikipedia.
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:20.880]   This doesn't sound like a military operation.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:21.880]   No.
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:25.560]   What started out in 1989 with a handful of dedicated engineers and a great idea for
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:29.400]   a product has grown into the GPS leader in sales.
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:30.960]   So, but I don't know.
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:31.960]   Yeah, you know what?
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:33.440]   You're right, Bill.
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:39.520]   From the first GPS handhelds supporting the coalition forces in the first Gulf War.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:40.520]   That's what I remember.
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:42.520]   So you're absolutely right.
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:43.920]   That doesn't mean they're not in the Cayman Islands.
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:45.920]   I mean, it could be that too.
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:50.920]   I mean, they could have been bought by Taiwanese government.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:51.920]   Yeah.
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:52.920]   Yeah.
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:56.680]   In the front of below, it says it was founded by a guy named Gary Burell who was born in
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:00.240]   1937 with a degree in electrical engineering from Wichita State.
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.240]   Well, there you go.
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:02.240]   A good Kansan.
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.920]   Well, then what's the Taiwan connection?
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:06.000]   That's a Taiwan company.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   Maybe it's sold.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   No, you know what?
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.500]   The manufacturer's done by, in fact, if you go to the Carmen site, there's co-founders
[00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:15.880]   Gary Burell from Wichita and Dr. Minh Kao.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.400]   So they obviously have a tiny spartan factory.
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:19.400]   Yeah.
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:20.640]   I design you make.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.640]   Yeah, perfect.
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:22.640]   That makes sense.
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.640]   Have we answered that question thoroughly?
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.040]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:27.880]   Okay, another open-ended question.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:28.880]   Anybody?
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:29.880]   You learn.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:31.640]   Kevin Rose, I have a question for you.
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:32.640]   What do you know?
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:33.640]   You must know something.
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:34.640]   Your source is at Apple.
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:35.640]   Come on.
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:36.640]   You've risked them before.
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:37.640]   Wrist them again.
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:39.280]   You know something about Tuesday at Macworld.
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:40.280]   Tell us all.
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:42.080]   I really don't know anything.
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.860]   Okay, I'll tell you what I said about the iPhone.
[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:46.460]   I'm going to say some things.
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:49.700]   If it's true, I just want you.
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:52.060]   Honestly, I wish I knew.
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:53.220]   I'm just giving you all right.
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:56.580]   I lost one of my sources a while ago last year.
[00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:58.060]   You got him fired.
[00:44:58.060 --> 00:44:59.500]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:04.100]   We had somebody email us who said that one of the ways to know what's going on at Macworld
[00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:06.100]   is to go to the printers where they print up the banners.
[00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:10.500]   Of course, this makes sense because during Jobs keynote, these banners are all covered.
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:13.920]   And as soon as the keynote ends, they take the wraps off because now you know about these
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:14.920]   products.
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:17.860]   He claims that the ITV will be called the iMix.
[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:20.040]   I don't think that's going to happen.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:23.340]   The iPhone is the iChapp mobile.
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:27.320]   I think what does happen, and I think this happens fairly frequently, is they plan for
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:29.080]   these announcements.
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:32.160]   And then sometimes things that they thought they would be announcing don't happen.
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:35.340]   And I think that's what I've heard now is going to happen with the iPhone, which would
[00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:37.340]   be a bit of a shocker.
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:40.860]   It was supposed to be made out of zirconia.
[00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:41.860]   You know, you're a material.
[00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:48.260]   Yeah, no, you're a materials guy, Bill McCrone, is zirconia, which is a zirconium metallic
[00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:53.500]   alloy that's basically a ceramic and is a radio transparent.
[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:54.500]   Right.
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:46:00.700]   And can be made transparent or can be translucent or any solid color.
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:03.420]   Sounds like a perfect cell phone material.
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:08.020]   So, like, it's like the zirconium is made from this stuff.
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:11.940]   Yeah, it's kind of, I mean, it's not dirt cheap.
[00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:13.900]   I mean, it's not expensive, but it's not dirt cheap.
[00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:15.340]   Well, it's not a plastic though.
[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:16.740]   It's a metal, essentially.
[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:17.740]   No.
[00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:18.740]   Well, it's a crystal.
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:19.740]   It's a crystal.
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:21.900]   So it's like, it is a ceramic.
[00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:22.900]   It's a ceramic.
[00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:23.900]   Yeah.
[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:24.900]   How about just a plastic?
[00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:28.460]   If you want to make it clear or make it like loose, you know, because we don't want scratches,
[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:29.460]   we want it robust.
[00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:30.460]   Right.
[00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:31.580]   No, they want, you know, I think you're wrong.
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:32.580]   I think they want scratches.
[00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:36.260]   I think the whole iPod deal was to make them so they scratch up.
[00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:37.420]   So you have to buy a second one.
[00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:40.260]   There's a lot of people out there that have two and three and four of these things because
[00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:41.260]   they got all scratched up.
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:42.260]   That's a good point.
[00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:44.660]   I think it's done as a marketing ploy.
[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:45.660]   I needed new one.
[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:48.140]   Has anybody ever power buffered their iPod?
[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:50.140]   It would work.
[00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:51.900]   You can buy, you know, you can buy your right bill.
[00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:53.340]   You can buy the right, you can buy the...
[00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:54.580]   Just buff out the scratches, you say.
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:58.460]   You get a high speed buffer and you get what some of that, there's some stuffing by most
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:46:59.460]   hardware.
[00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:00.460]   Turtle wire stores.
[00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:01.460]   No, it's a special stuff that...
[00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:02.460]   You just use...
[00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:03.460]   Toothpaste.
[00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:11.220]   Toothpaste actually works very well for plastic scratches, but I restored my son's iPod which
[00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:18.500]   just looked like it was brushed stainless steel kitchen sink metal instead of shiny,
[00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:21.180]   you know, and buffed it back into the right shiny.
[00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:22.180]   You're kidding.
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:23.900]   Yeah, you're talking about the metal part, not the plastic part.
[00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:24.900]   Right.
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:27.540]   Actually, I did both sides, and it looks gorgeous.
[00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:28.540]   Can I bring that?
[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:29.540]   Yeah, sure.
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:31.860]   The most important part about that, by the way, the best part with Bill did.
[00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:33.580]   It buffs out the Apple logo.
[00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:35.580]   That was so cool.
[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:37.340]   Hey, that was still there.
[00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:43.260]   I like how Kevin Buffed in the dig logo to his aluminum MacBook Pro.
[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:44.260]   Laser etched it.
[00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:45.260]   Is that awesome?
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:46.260]   Yeah, it's fun.
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:48.420]   You should come out and get yours done.
[00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:49.420]   I should.
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:50.420]   Leah Culver did it.
[00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:51.620]   It's her company, right?
[00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:52.620]   No, she...
[00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:54.620]   She did it first.
[00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:56.420]   Yeah, she didn't do mine though.
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:57.420]   Phil Trone did mine for me.
[00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:58.420]   Can you explain it more?
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:02.780]   Hey, you guys, explain in detail to the listeners what you're talking about.
[00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:08.260]   So there's a laser etching machine, basically, that is made for engraving pretty much anything.
[00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:10.780]   I don't think laptops.
[00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:11.780]   But...
[00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:13.580]   No, she's the same one that Yoshi had?
[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:15.420]   Yeah, it's similar to the same one that Yoshi had.
[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:16.420]   Which is a Versa Laser.
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:17.420]   Yeah.
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:18.420]   Versa Laser.
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:19.420]   They're great.
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:20.420]   And you can certainly do a laptop with one.
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:24.300]   Yeah, so we're at food camp, and Phil basically said, "Hey, if you have your company, logo,
[00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:28.220]   or anything else that you want on your notebook, come on over."
[00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:33.540]   And there's a list of probably 30 or so plus geeks waiting in line to get their laptops
[00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:36.500]   and cell phones and iPods laser etched.
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:39.780]   And I think they were doing it using like CorelDRAW or something.
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:40.780]   Yeah, it's always...
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:44.660]   Just for the record, you guys, I broke the Versa Laser.
[00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:47.820]   I introduced it to the world.
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:48.820]   Very cool.
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:49.820]   Very cool.
[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:50.820]   Yeah.
[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:51.820]   That was my discovery.
[00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:53.340]   Did you check them out in Phoenix, Arizona?
[00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:54.340]   Yeah.
[00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:55.340]   Actually, they're in Scottsdale.
[00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:56.340]   Okay, yeah.
[00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:58.340]   I went out there with this.
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:00.220]   Did Yoshi get to keep that one?
[00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:01.660]   Do we have to send it back?
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:02.660]   You know what Yoshi did?
[00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:03.660]   He had it.
[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:05.140]   He took it down to G4.
[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:07.460]   He had it in the loading dock there.
[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:08.900]   Everyone got fired.
[00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:12.940]   He could have taken it with him when everyone got laid off and fired, and he left it sitting
[00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:15.340]   there for so long that they sent it back to the manufacturer.
[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:16.340]   Oh, well that was good.
[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:17.340]   That's so wrong.
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:18.340]   He was...
[00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:19.340]   No, but that stinks.
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:21.260]   I mean, no, he just was too lazy to take the darn thing.
[00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:24.740]   You got a $10,000 laser printer to take the darn thing.
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:26.740]   That's funny because this...
[00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:28.380]   Laser printer.
[00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:29.380]   I'm sorry.
[00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:30.380]   Yeah, laser printer.
[00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:31.380]   It is a laser printer.
[00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:32.380]   It is a laser printer.
[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:33.380]   No, it's true.
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:34.380]   It sends it to the words.
[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:35.380]   Yeah, it sends it to the words.
[00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:36.380]   Yeah, it sends it to the printer.
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:37.380]   It prints on metal.
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:39.980]   It works just like a dot matrix.
[00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:44.820]   Well, no, just like a printer except like a dot matrix printer, but it shoots a high
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:45.820]   end laser.
[00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:49.900]   Well, Squid Labs, that's probably what they're using to do their etching, and they're making
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:51.540]   some good money on that, right?
[00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:55.980]   Yeah, actually Phil is starting a business where he's going open source with it.
[00:49:55.980 --> 00:50:02.060]   So I think he's developing an open source laser that he's going to release the plans
[00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:04.420]   for and you can build it at home and then go out and laser it.
[00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:05.420]   Well, it's only 25 watts.
[00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:07.580]   It's not that powerful laser.
[00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:08.580]   Really?
[00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:12.380]   Now, instead of all the little kids shooting their little red dots on the movie screen
[00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:14.940]   and the movie theater, they'll be actually ripping little holes in it from their screen.
[00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:19.020]   Yeah, they'll be right in their initials on someone's forehead with this thing.
[00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:20.020]   This doesn't sound right.
[00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:23.620]   Kevin, you got the dig logo lazed onto your laptop.
[00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:24.620]   Yeah.
[00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:25.620]   How's it look?
[00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:26.620]   It looks pretty good.
[00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:30.420]   You know, I got it done on the black MacBook and it comes in.
[00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:32.180]   Oh, he had done a plastic?
[00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:34.420]   No, well, this isn't really plastic.
[00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:35.940]   It's something it's some kind of aluminum.
[00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:38.020]   Oh, the black MacBook is not plastic?
[00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:39.020]   No, it's not plastic.
[00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:42.020]   Oh, all this time I thought I had a plastic notebook.
[00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:43.020]   That's funny.
[00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:45.620]   Well, maybe the front, the surface is where you type of feel the back of it.
[00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:46.620]   It's metal.
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:48.620]   So it's etched into there.
[00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:51.620]   Yeah, so it's etched in there.
[00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:53.620]   But yeah, is there somewhere we can see this?
[00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:54.620]   I'm a logo.
[00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:56.620]   Yeah, it's on actually, I put the clip on YouTube.
[00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:57.620]   Oh, cool.
[00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:59.620]   So we just search for laser and dig.
[00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:01.620]   Yeah, just put more gettin' delicious.
[00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:07.420]   Yeah, it sounds like I should do the devorect.org/blog logo on the devorect.
[00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:09.220]   Do that on your forehead.
[00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:10.220]   It should.
[00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:11.980]   Well, no, I don't think so.
[00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:14.500]   But I think on a laptop.
[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:18.140]   Did you do it on Dignation or was it?
[00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:22.220]   I was just, no, we showed it on, well, I have it on Dignation every single week.
[00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:23.220]   So you can see it the lower back.
[00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:24.220]   Right, I've seen it on the extension.
[00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:25.220]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:26.700]   But you didn't do it on the show?
[00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:29.700]   No, we didn't do it on the show.
[00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:30.700]   Wow.
[00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:34.740]   Next time you have, so I was talking to Phil about this, and next time any one of us puts
[00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:39.380]   on kind of a live event, you know, a live live Twitter something, he'll bring the laser
[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:42.580]   out and then offer free Twit logos on.
[00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:43.580]   Okay.
[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:44.580]   Yeah, so he was gonna do that.
[00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:45.580]   I'm calling him right now.
[00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:46.580]   Call up and see if he can--
[00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:51.820]   Well, we're doing a show Tuesday at the 21st Amendment brew pub.
[00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:55.060]   If he's in town, I know he was in New York for a while, but yeah, hit him up, email him.
[00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:58.140]   And if he's in town, have him come out and laser-ish people know books.
[00:51:58.140 --> 00:51:59.140]   That'd be so cool.
[00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:00.620]   That'd be so cool.
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:01.980]   I'd love to do that.
[00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:03.940]   Everybody could go leave with a Twit logo on their notebook.
[00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:04.940]   That'd be awesome.
[00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:05.940]   Is it safe?
[00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:06.940]   No.
[00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:07.940]   Sure.
[00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:08.940]   Come on.
[00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:10.860]   There was some alignment issues.
[00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:11.860]   Like you have to make sure--
[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:14.820]   Well, if you screw up, you've got a bad logo burned on you.
[00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:15.820]   Exactly.
[00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:21.420]   What about potentially blowing out that little fluorescent bulb that's behind the case?
[00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:26.140]   You know, right behind the LCD, there's a light bulb back there.
[00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:27.780]   You'd have to feel pretty deep.
[00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:29.700]   And it doesn't really engrave that deep.
[00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:30.700]   No, on--
[00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:34.740]   You do get some awesome smoke from some plastics and woods and things.
[00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:38.020]   Yeah, and remember the manufacturers don't-- they're not too happy about this.
[00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:40.380]   If you have to do warranty repairs or things like that.
[00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:41.380]   So--
[00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:45.140]   Well, in your case, Kevin, you could just say, do you know who I am?
[00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:46.140]   Oh, boy.
[00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:47.140]   Do you ever do that, Kevin?
[00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:48.140]   No.
[00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:49.140]   Yeah.
[00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:50.140]   Nobody knows who I am.
[00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:51.140]   That's the whole thing.
[00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:53.620]   That's because you're not going, do you know who I am?
[00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:54.620]   The design.
[00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:55.620]   I'm going to play the--
[00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:56.620]   What design?
[00:52:56.620 --> 00:53:01.060]   Oh, this is-- David Prager just sent me a link to the YouTube of Leia etching her
[00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:02.900]   MacBook Pro.
[00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:05.940]   But yeah, and you had that MacBook on Digged, right?
[00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:06.940]   On DigNation?
[00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:07.940]   Yeah, on DigNation.
[00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:08.940]   Yeah.
[00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:11.940]   She is actually dating Daniel Berka, who's the DigDesigner.
[00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:12.940]   You're kidding.
[00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:13.940]   I didn't know that.
[00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:14.940]   Yeah.
[00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:15.940]   Yeah, she's cool.
[00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:16.940]   Yeah, well, well, well.
[00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:17.940]   I'm impressed.
[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:20.940]   Anyone who can write Django is okay in my book.
[00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:23.340]   Yeah, she's a job developer.
[00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:25.340]   She's a developer, yeah.
[00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:26.340]   Yeah.
[00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:27.940]   All right, so anything else we're going to see?
[00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:29.540]   Well, I'm getting a big echo back.
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:30.540]   No, no.
[00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:31.540]   Hold on a second.
[00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:32.540]   John, what are you doing?
[00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:33.540]   John, what are you doing?
[00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:34.540]   This is our friend Kevin.
[00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:35.540]   Oh, no.
[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:36.540]   Oh, you did.
[00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:37.540]   Polish?
[00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:40.220]   I was one of the most talented artists I've seen.
[00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:43.180]   So basically what this guy has done is he takes extra sketches.
[00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:44.180]   No, that's not it.
[00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:47.180]   Yeah, I thought I was just saying.
[00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:48.180]   I've seen that one, though.
[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:50.180]   That's the guy who does the etch-a-sketch art.
[00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:55.820]   All right, so any big announcements at CES that are going to be surprises, we've already
[00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:58.700]   kind of covered what Macworld is going to be?
[00:53:58.700 --> 00:53:59.700]   No, nothing.
[00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:00.700]   So that's the thing.
[00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:05.660]   All of the displays and the HD they're saying CES is going to be evolutionary, not
[00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:06.660]   revolution.
[00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:10.220]   Well, you know, one of the things I expect to see that's going to be maybe a surprise
[00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:11.780]   because of the collapse of E3.
[00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:12.780]   Yeah.
[00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:16.060]   So the gaming companies are going to gravitate towards CES.
[00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:17.700]   And they're going to like pump something up over there.
[00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:21.900]   The other thing I'm looking at is I think there may be a little bit of more of a push
[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:27.420]   for this EVD-O cell phone technology, which I find kind of like distressing, which is
[00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:32.860]   the CDMA online internet connection game.
[00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:34.860]   It's a huge.
[00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:36.500]   Yeah, I know it's huge.
[00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:38.980]   Is it exclusively Verizon?
[00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:39.980]   Right now.
[00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:41.980]   Well, it's a technology that...
[00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:44.620]   I mean, it's essentially a Qualcomm cells.
[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:45.620]   And anyone...
[00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:48.660]   It's who you do the deal with.
[00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:54.620]   If you're a notebook vendor and you want to use that new Vista Microsoft sideshow display
[00:54:54.620 --> 00:55:03.100]   thing, you can keep your outlook synchronized and your calendar synchronized even when your
[00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:04.740]   notebook is off.
[00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:08.700]   Has anybody released a sideshow laptop?
[00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:10.180]   I can't comment.
[00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:11.180]   Yeah.
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:12.180]   So maybe we'll see some of those at CES.
[00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:15.660]   Could you say that?
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:20.900]   Maybe not on the show floor, but probably in a suite or two in a background.
[00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:24.500]   You want to describe what sideshow is because it's kind of a neat idea.
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:31.900]   Sideshow is a mostly Microsoft innovation that you attach to your notebook and it can
[00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:38.380]   be anywhere from a one-line screen to something the size of a small LCD window.
[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:46.980]   It's got its own microcontroller that just sips power and it's connected usually to the
[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:53.980]   Wi-Fi and/or EVDO cellular connection.
[00:55:53.980 --> 00:56:00.500]   So it's sitting there even when your notebook is off receiving updates and calendar stuff
[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:01.780]   and so forth.
[00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:09.780]   And it just shows up in this little LCD window which probably isn't even going to be backlit
[00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:10.780]   on most machines.
[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:12.740]   Why do I want this?
[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:15.300]   Because they couldn't sell the spot watch.
[00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:17.340]   Why do I want this?
[00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:24.700]   Because the norm in business today is that you're accessible 24/7 and this thing will
[00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:30.660]   even keep you updated while you're asleep and while the notebook is asleep.
[00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:35.820]   The one thing that it's really, really good for is for these mobile professionals and
[00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:36.820]   everything else.
[00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:41.820]   When you're in the airport and you see all of these guys doing one last sync before they
[00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:43.180]   get on the plane.
[00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:44.740]   Yeah, I've done it.
[00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:47.180]   Yeah, I'm a wheel do it.
[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:53.380]   And this obviates the need for that because you're always in sync and when you get on
[00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:59.540]   the plane you just supposedly shut off your cellular radio and your Wi-Fi and then you
[00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:03.660]   can sit there and watch the movie.
[00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:08.900]   And it's the onus for the propensity of words like crackberry because people get addicted
[00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:09.900]   to stuff like that.
[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:14.220]   I imagine this would be built into the lid of the laptop or somehow attached.
[00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:15.220]   Exactly.
[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:19.100]   Or the actual side, the vertical height in some cases.
[00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:22.420]   Oh, because it could be a one-line display.
[00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:23.420]   Exactly.
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:27.580]   Ladies and gentlemen, this is more crap we don't need.
[00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:29.580]   You heard it here first.
[00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:34.660]   No, I think this is a pretty decent idea.
[00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:40.500]   Not for you and me but for the people who really are on the go all the time because
[00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:44.580]   there's this whole kind of subtle thing where it's rude to have your crackberry out on the
[00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:48.300]   table during the meeting because it's beeping and scrolling messages and you can't keep
[00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:51.900]   your damn eyes off it.
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:55.020]   And you can't have your cell phone out for the same reason.
[00:57:55.020 --> 00:58:00.900]   But you can have your notebook on the table closed off and yet you can look at the little
[00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:06.540]   sideshow display and see all the stuff that is demanding your attention, you know, scheduled
[00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:07.540]   changes and what.
[00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:10.260]   And no one's going to notice you doing that.
[00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:15.300]   I'm just checking my laptop edge right now.
[00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:16.300]   It's still mind me.
[00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:18.460]   Look, I'm going to look at my laptop.
[00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:21.740]   You know, you could just glance at your watch and people know that.
[00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:27.540]   Obviously, but anyway, it's one less thing to carry.
[00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:34.100]   I think you know, they're looking to replace blackberries with this thing.
[00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:39.940]   It kind of fulfills the role of the pager once it except that it also sinks without
[00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:42.540]   looks so you're always up to date.
[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:46.300]   Yeah, it's like replacing cigarettes with cigars.
[00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:47.300]   All right.
[00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:51.700]   Well, I think we're going to wrap this up because I don't see any other big.
[00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:56.020]   Big announcements coming out of either Mac world or CES, but maybe we'll be proven wrong
[00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:58.300]   and we'll be back next week to talk about it.
[00:58:58.300 --> 00:58:59.300]   I hope you'll join us there.
[00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:00.300]   What?
[00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:02.940]   Definitely have an exciting show next week because there's all this action.
[00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:03.940]   Action.
[00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:04.940]   Action's going to happen.
[00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:07.860]   You know, usually January is considered a slow news month, but not in tech.
[00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:08.860]   It's a big month.
[00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:14.060]   Oh, by the way, that that laser etching thing that Phil Tron for make is doing.
[00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:17.780]   It's called at a fruit, A-D-A-F-R-U-I-T dot com.
[00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:20.180]   And it's in New York City, unfortunately.
[00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:21.180]   I don't know.
[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:22.180]   What's interesting about that?
[00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:24.100]   Well, for me, it's unfortunate.
[00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:25.540]   It's good for you, Bill.
[00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:27.100]   Actually it's cool.
[00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:31.500]   Kevin says you could just stop in and make an appointment like a tattoo apartment.
[00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:32.500]   Yeah.
[00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:34.500]   You're just walking and getting your laptop tattoo, which I think--
[00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:35.500]   Not my arm!
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:37.180]   I think that's probably a good idea.
[00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:38.180]   Don't laser your arm.
[00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:39.180]   Lazer your laptop.
[00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:41.540]   They got some really cool photos on their website.
[00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:43.740]   A-D-A-F-R-U-I-T dot com.
[00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:47.300]   Yeah, slash laser actually, but you'd find a link there anyway.
[00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:48.300]   Right.
[00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:49.300]   Right.
[00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:51.140]   And the photos are pretty-- I mean, you can laser etch an iPod nano.
[00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:53.620]   Yeah, it's amazing what they can do.
[00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:54.620]   It really looks good.
[00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:55.620]   Not the nano.
[00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:56.620]   I mean, the little shuffle.
[00:59:56.620 --> 00:59:59.620]   Yeah, they've got-- with a glengooled signature on a shuffle, I think that's cool.
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:01.380]   Yeah, it's glengooled.
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:02.380]   That's neat.
[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:03.380]   Or this one is a laughing squid.
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:05.220]   There's a lot of laughing squids.
[01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:10.020]   I guess that's where the original idea came for.
[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:11.580]   I like this one.
[01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:16.300]   It looks like it's the universal symbol for do not steal this laptop.
[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:19.460]   It's a triangle with a reaching hand and a line across it.
[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:22.620]   I don't know if that'll work, but it's a good idea.
[01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:26.940]   We'll be back next Friday or next Sunday, I should say, to talk about what happened at
[01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:27.940]   CES in Macworld.
[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:29.180]   Maybe we'll have some great things to say.
[01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:30.940]   I want to thank you all for joining us.
[01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:34.900]   Bill, do you have a website that you want us to send people to?
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:36.380]   No, actually I don't.
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:37.980]   I ask you this every time.
[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:38.980]   Yeah.
[01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:39.980]   I don't care.
[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:43.700]   You're going to have to steal, Bill, to put some stuff up on my site.
[01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:44.700]   Don't come on, Bill.
[01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:49.140]   Get a MySpace page, something, anything.
[01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:51.740]   But you always love Bill McRone, and it's great to have you.
[01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:54.540]   I bet you're happy you're not on the weight of Vegas right about now.
[01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:55.540]   I'm very happy.
[01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:56.540]   Yeah, me too.
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:57.540]   I couldn't be happier.
[01:00:57.540 --> 01:00:59.540]   John, you probably got to get on an airplane.
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:01.540]   I'm going Monday, coming back Wednesday.
[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:02.540]   Don't kid yourself.
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:03.540]   Short trip.
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:04.540]   Stayin' at the Bellagio?
[01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:07.540]   No, actually I'm staying at the Paris.
[01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:08.540]   I don't care.
[01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:09.540]   All right.
[01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:12.340]   As long as it's not the circus circus.
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:14.540]   Remember that Kevin when they put us up on the circus circus?
[01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:15.540]   That was awful.
[01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:18.940]   I think I stayed with my parents that live in Vegas because I have to find them.
[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:20.940]   For that over the circus circus.
[01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:23.740]   That's the hotel where they bolt the lamps to the table because you might want to steal
[01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:24.740]   them.
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:25.740]   Absolutely.
[01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:26.740]   And the remote control.
[01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:27.740]   I hate that.
[01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:28.740]   David Pranger.
[01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:29.740]   Yes.
[01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:30.740]   Do you remember that?
[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:33.140]   Yea, did they bolt into the remote controls?
[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:34.140]   Who are we with?
[01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:35.140]   Well, there's just clowns everywhere.
[01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:37.940]   Nobody can sleep well when there's clowns everywhere.
[01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:38.940]   Clowns.
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:39.940]   Who are we with?
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:40.940]   Was it you, Kevin, who's?
[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:44.940]   I've stayed at the Lucksort and I've somewhere else.
[01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:47.940]   Are you talking about the clowns from ZDTV?
[01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:48.940]   Yes.
[01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:49.940]   Now they...
[01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:53.220]   Greg Dremen was bolted to the table.
[01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:54.540]   Who was it?
[01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:56.540]   Maybe it's just a...
[01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:57.540]   I'm not sure.
[01:01:57.540 --> 01:01:58.540]   I don't want to get me in trouble.
[01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:01.140]   But it was stole a lamp from the Hard Rock Cafe.
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:05.140]   I mean the Hard Rock Hotel from the lobby.
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:06.140]   Why?
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:07.140]   I don't remember.
[01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:08.140]   It was a strange thing to do.
[01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:09.940]   It was a group of us.
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:12.140]   They put it under their coat and they ran out the door.
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:13.140]   That's really funny.
[01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:14.580]   It doesn't ring a bell.
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:17.340]   I'm pretty sure it was a tech TV type.
[01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:19.340]   It wasn't you, Kevin.
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:21.340]   No, it wasn't me.
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:22.340]   Chris Kraus?
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:24.340]   It might have been Chris Kraus.
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:26.340]   If it was anybody it would have been Chris Kraus.
[01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:28.740]   Bill McCrone, JohnC.org/blog.
[01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:29.940]   We thank you for joining us.
[01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:32.140]   David Prager or Vision3.
[01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:33.740]   Anything you want to tell us about Revision3?
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:37.660]   Now that Kevin's here, he can be your counselor, your consuliary.
[01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:39.780]   He can keep you from saying anything bad.
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:42.340]   I want to plug a Macbreak week.
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:44.540]   A Macbreak's coverage of Macworld next week.
[01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:45.540]   Thank you.
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:47.540]   You come out for that?
[01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:52.340]   I want to accept that I'm going to be at CES on Monday and Tuesday.
[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:53.980]   You're going to CES.
[01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:55.940]   We're shooting two episodes of In Digital.
[01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:56.940]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:57.940]   Yeah, well that makes sense.
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:58.940]   See, that's a gadget show.
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:00.540]   That makes sense.
[01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:01.540]   I'll tell you.
[01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:02.540]   That was the best for us.
[01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:04.140]   I did for you about the Zoom.
[01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:05.140]   That was everywhere.
[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:06.140]   It was awesome.
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:08.340]   I mean, I don't mind.
[01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:09.340]   It was funny.
[01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:14.220]   Speaking of Macworld, though, I do want to plug that Ignatian starring Kevin Rose is going
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:20.340]   to be doing a live taping on the 10th and on the 10th and the North Hall at the Macworld.
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:22.340]   And you can still get free passes to Macworld.
[01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:26.100]   Anybody that uses the code DIG when they're going to get a pass, you don't want to pay
[01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:27.100]   the $40 free.
[01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:28.100]   Oh, cool.
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:29.100]   Good.
[01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:30.100]   I can get in.
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:31.100]   Nice.
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:32.100]   I'm coming.
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:33.100]   I'll be there, Kevin.
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:34.100]   And that's at 4pm on the 10th.
[01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:38.660]   Macbreak Weekly will be Tuesday at the 21st Amendment Brewery and that is on 2nd Street,
[01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:42.220]   just a little ways down from the Convention Center.
[01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:43.220]   That should be a lot of fun.
[01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:44.220]   Starts at 6pm.
[01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:45.900]   Lots of Mac luminaries that'll be...
[01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:51.340]   If I get Phil Tyrone, we'll lays any logo you want into your laptop.
[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:54.380]   And you guys are releasing a whole bunch of little shorts, right?
[01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:56.220]   Yeah, Macworld is going to do wall-to-wall cover.
[01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:58.580]   I mean, Macbreak is going to do wall-to-wall coverage in Macworld.
[01:03:58.580 --> 01:03:59.900]   Yeah, it's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:02.260]   It's going to be interesting.
[01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:03.260]   It's an experiment.
[01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:04.260]   We'll see how it goes.
[01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:06.060]   You guys get Steve Jobs from an interview?
[01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:07.060]   Never.
[01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:08.060]   Never happened.
[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:09.060]   He won't talk to me.
[01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:10.860]   I'm going to talk to anyone.
[01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:13.180]   That's just that volleyball incident.
[01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:16.980]   But Twik.tv, if you want to see Macworld coverage, I don't think we're going to do any CES coverage.
[01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:19.500]   So revision3.org, if you want to see CES coverage.
[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:20.780]   And if you want to see Dig Nation...
[01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:22.340]   Do we have .org?
[01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:23.340]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:24.340]   Did I say .org?
[01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:25.340]   .com.
[01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:26.620]   You're not a nonprofit.
[01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:30.740]   Let's make that very clear.
[01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:32.740]   Any profit welcome.
[01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:33.740]   No, we have revision3.org.
[01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:34.740]   I had to check.
[01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:35.740]   Do you?
[01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:36.740]   Yeah.
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:37.740]   No, I don't think...
[01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:38.740]   They don't care if you get .org.net.
[01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:39.740]   No, there must have been a reason that I thought it was .org.
[01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:41.740]   You can't get .gov and you can't get it.
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:42.740]   The broken.org.
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:44.660]   The broken.org, that's it.
[01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:45.660]   Dig.
[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:46.660]   The broken is a nonprofit.
[01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:49.660]   Because no one will advertise it.
[01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:51.060]   Never advertise it.
[01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:52.060]   That's why.
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:56.300]   Dig Nation.com for Kevin's show with Alex Albrecht, of course, Dig.com.
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:57.820]   That's where the big bucks are going to be.
[01:04:57.820 --> 01:04:59.620]   Congratulations on your second round of funding.
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:00.620]   That's wonderful.
[01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:01.620]   Oh, thank you.
[01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:03.620]   And Dig the TwiPodcast.
[01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:04.620]   Dig.com/podcast.
[01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:05.620]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:06.620]   Thank you.
[01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:08.660]   That new podcast feature is fantastic.
[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:09.660]   Number two.
[01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:10.660]   Number two.
[01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:11.660]   TwiPodcast.
[01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:12.660]   Yeah, guess what's number one?
[01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:14.740]   Just take a wild guess.
[01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:16.220]   Will we ever catch up with Big Nation?
[01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:17.220]   No.
[01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:18.220]   We're close.
[01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:19.220]   We're close.
[01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:20.220]   You're the entire audience to go dig.
[01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:21.220]   TwiPodcast.
[01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:23.540]   We're only 2,000 votes away.
[01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:27.740]   I can't believe that it's 12,337 votes for Dig Nation.
[01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:30.340]   10,242 for TwiP.
[01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:32.340]   Hey, what's your deal with getting TwiPodcast?
[01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:33.340]   Where's Cranki?
[01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:34.340]   Two weeks.
[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:35.340]   2,741.
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:36.340]   I'm surprised that.
[01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:40.220]   What's the deal with TwiP getting the ninth best podcast?
[01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:41.620]   Oh, I forgot to mention that.
[01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:42.620]   Time magazine.
[01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:43.620]   Time magazine.
[01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:44.620]   You haven't brought that up at the beginning of the show.
[01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:46.540]   I completely forgot that.
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:50.300]   Time magazine named us one of the 10 best podcasts of the year.
[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:51.700]   You are so modest.
[01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:52.700]   That's...
[01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:53.700]   Well, no, I'm just baffled.
[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:54.700]   Believe me.
[01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:55.700]   He's not that modest.
[01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:56.700]   John knows.
[01:05:56.700 --> 01:06:01.180]   You know, the worst thing is, and I sent him an email with Time Magazine's a black hole.
[01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:03.740]   They put a link to my radio show in there, not to TwiP.
[01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:05.460]   I don't understand why.
[01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:06.460]   Isn't that bizarre?
[01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:10.100]   Oh, that's modern journalism at its best.
[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:11.620]   They can't use Google.
[01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:12.620]   They couldn't go.
[01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:13.700]   Google Twit.
[01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:14.700]   If you Google Twit...
[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:15.700]   Unbelievable.
[01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:18.580]   The first thing that comes up is Twit.tv.
[01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:19.580]   I don't understand it.
[01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:20.580]   Which is very popular.
[01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:23.380]   I get a ton of mail every time I'm on one of these.
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:26.940]   It's inexplicable, but we are very grateful.
[01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:27.940]   Explicable.
[01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:28.940]   Very explicable.
[01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:29.940]   You do a great job.
[01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:30.940]   Okay, and it's great.
[01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:32.140]   You all do too, and it's great to have you.
[01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:33.780]   Kevin, David, Bill, John.
[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:38.860]   We have a great week, wherever, whatever conference you're going to, we'll re-adjourn this afterwards.
[01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:42.020]   I'm just going to stay here in my little office and read Time Magazine.
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:44.220]   What a fabulous journal that is.
[01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:46.180]   Just love it.
[01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:47.620]   Another Twit is in the camp.
[01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:54.620]   I'm just going to be a great guy.
[01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:58.620]   I'm just going to be a great guy.
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:04.620]   I'm just going to be a great guy.
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:09.620]   I'm just going to be a great guy.
[01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:16.620]   I'm just going to be a great guy.
[01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:17.620]   All right.
[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:18.620]   Do the Twit, baby.
[01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:19.620]   Do the Twit.
[01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:20.620]   All right.
[01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:21.620]   Do the Twit, baby.
[01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:22.620]   Do the Twit.
[01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:23.620]   All right.
[01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:24.620]   Do the Twit, baby.
[01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:25.620]   Do the Twit, baby.
[01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:27.620]   baby.
