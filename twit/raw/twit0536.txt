[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.640]   A big panel today because we added a token Frenchman, Patrick Bejaw is here, not Patrick.

[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.480]   We're glad to say your English language and news podcast and Le Ronde voutech, your French
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.520]   language tech podcast.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.520]   Absolutely.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.520]   Thank you for having me.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:49.040]   The last minute thing but I'm fresh off the plane from Helsinki and jumping into a little
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.400]   bit of a, well I thought it was going to be madness but actually it seems pretty quiet
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.400]   but we'll talk about that.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.960]   Yeah I really wanted to get you on it and I know it was very short notice but I thank
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.400]   you for doing that because I appreciate it.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.400]   Thank you.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.360]   Also with us Jeff Jarvis who's been traveling on even more than Patrick.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.640]   You've been all over the world it seems like since we saw you last.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.040]   Yup, you're muted.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.040]   We do that or did.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.080]   No I did it so I could chomp on something.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.160]   I was in Lagos in Johannesburg and then the week before that I was in Berlin and the week
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.440]   before that I think was in Mexico City so I'm like three continents all over the world
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.840]   but it's so glad to have you.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.840]   We missed you.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.840]   I'm just glad to be here.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.840]   I missed it terribly.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.440]   And you know it's funny because I collect all week long stories that go, oh I want to
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.400]   hear what Jeff has to say about this.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.160]   So I have three weeks of stories I hope you're ready.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.160]   I am.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.360]   Also joining us from Engadget Davender Harder War is here always a pleasure having you
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.360]   on, Davender.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.360]   Thanks for being here.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.360]   No problem.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.360]   Yeah.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.360]   It's fun.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.360]   Yeah.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.080]   And actually I have the iPad Pro in front of me and Engadget just wrote an article saying
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.120]   eh not so fast.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.120]   It's not that fast.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.600]   And we'll talk a little bit about it.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.600]   It's pretty crazy.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.040]   Yeah, we'll talk a little bit about that as well.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.080]   And we have a newbie and we want to be very gentle and kind for a few minutes anyway.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.600]   So Jennifer Booten, she's a tech reporter at MarketWatch.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.600]   She covers the market.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.080]   She covers finance.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.840]   And there is a lot this week to talk including about, including Mark Andreessen dumping his
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.840]   Facebook.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.960]   It's a significant portion of his Facebook stock.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.440]   Jennifer, welcome to a twit.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.280]   Hey, how are you doing?
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.640]   Very nice to have you.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.280]   I warned Jennifer ahead of time that we're all just a bunch of loud maths and you should
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.280]   just jump right in.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.080]   Anytime you have it.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.080]   I'm prepared.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.080]   Yeah.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.080]   I'm ready.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.080]   Don't hold back.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.080]   I'm going to take you guys on.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.080]   Take us out.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.080]   Take us out.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:44.800]   So boy, you go on Facebook, French flags over faces.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.480]   Facebook made that possible.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.080]   They said they were going to do that.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.400]   Last time they did it was the marriage equality, Supreme Court decision.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.960]   And now, but they've made it very easy for Facebook users to show their solidarity.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:04.200]   You see the Paris peace sign, the Eiffel Tower peace sign on all over Twitter.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.800]   Not that any of that makes a difference, but I think it's a, I think it's, you know,
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.240]   I saw some people say, hey, you didn't do that when last week Beirut had or the Russian
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.080]   plane was Bob.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.080]   Why Paris?
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.840]   I think Paris is the capital of the world.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.120]   Not only that, Leo, but it was the first time that I didn't realize it because I hadn't
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.400]   seen safety check before because none of my friends were in the basically Pacific region
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.040]   where these things had happened in Afghanistan and so on.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.600]   And so this was the first time it was also a man made disaster, not a natural disaster.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.600]   And really interesting stuff.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.000]   And Zuckerberg said, okay, fair, fair, fair criticism and we should have done Beirut
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.440]   and we will in the future.
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.400]   But they also have some very interesting criterion for this that you can't really in their view
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.680]   use this for an ongoing war or epidemic because there's no definition of safe.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.360]   In the case of a one off event, a horrible event like this, it happens.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.880]   There's a period of time you can say I'm safe from not and you can have some veracity
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.360]   to that statement.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.040]   So I think there was a lot of criticism of Facebook.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.520]   I think it was misspent just because if they'd done other other man made disasters, other
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.680]   terrorist activities and didn't do Beirut, they could be fair criticism.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.720]   But the first time they did it was Paris, they're going to do it now.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.720]   I think it was legitimate criticism and but legitimate answer by all means for the future.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.520]   And this was the first time they did it for terrorist event.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.880]   Patrick, you were in Paris.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:37.040]   So you didn't get, but I heard from some people, Cedric and Grown, for instance, I saw that
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.040]   he was safe.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.840]   Other friends, I have a friend who's in Paris today was safe and a Facebook apparently knows
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.240]   where you are if you ever use it while you're there.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.920]   And in at least one case, we'll send you a text message saying, are you okay?
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.920]   Let your friends know.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.920]   Wow.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.480]   So as I was saying, I was in Helsinki, but I still, I think there are two things on Facebook.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.720]   There's the French flags which feel, you know, it's one way to express support.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.880]   It feels a little bit gimmicky sometimes and certainly in the, in it did feel a little
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.920]   bit as a parishion, it felt like, yes, it's wonderful to see all of this, but at the same
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:21.720]   time, what you were saying earlier, they didn't do it for other disasters, including, you
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.560]   know, some terrorist attacks, the thing in Beirut last week and things like that.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.920]   So that did feel a little bit, okay, it's, it's, you know, different approaches to different
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.920]   people, I guess.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.040]   I think though, in America, at least we feel a real bond with France.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.040]   Yeah.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:41.840]   I mean, yeah, it is, you know, the reality is there is some amount of proximity of culture.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:47.640]   And you know, it feels more, you feel more intimately hit when it's a country that is
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:52.480]   closer to you culturally and historically and all of this, then it's not an excuse, but
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.720]   I guess it's an explanation.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.920]   But certainly for the, are you safe tool?
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:02.880]   I have to say that this was immensely useful, including for myself.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:08.920]   It's hard to realize how useful these things are until you're actually in the middle of
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.920]   a situation.
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:15.000]   I was able to signal everyone in one fell swoop that I was okay.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:22.400]   But mostly I was, you know, it's, it was a small area of the city.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.440]   And of course, you know, one, two, three hundred people hit is enormous, but there's
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.800]   still a very small chance that your specific specific friends in a city of two million.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.360]   You're talking to worry about it.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.600]   And how many, how many friends of yours checked in?
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.680]   How many, how many friends in your world?
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:41.680]   Everyone.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.680]   So long list.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.680]   Yeah.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.680]   My world was 12 people.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.680]   Well, yeah.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.640]   So it's your number in all of my friends who live in Paris checked in.
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:56.040]   And for everyone, it was a relief when, you know, it was really the signal that they were
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:02.400]   safe was if they had put the, the, the, I'm safe on Facebook, you were like, that was
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.880]   what I was going to check.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.320]   It was like, okay, I mean, of course, you know, the very close friends you're going to call,
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.000]   but there are a few people that you're not necessarily going to call a hundred people.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.280]   So you think of the people who live in the city and you go check Facebook and once they're,
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.720]   they've checked in, they said they're safe.
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.080]   It's seriously a big relief.
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.840]   And especially I was, since I was in Helsinki and we had some card problems and I was using
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.040]   a finished SIM card in my phone.
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.480]   So I couldn't be reached by, by phone.
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:35.000]   I had to check on the internet and I had to choose, do I want to be reachable on my phone
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.160]   or do I want to have access to the internet?
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:42.000]   Obviously I chose the internet, but so Facebook was really the way, you know, after I switched
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.200]   cards to call my mother and, and, you know, my parents and my very close friends, Facebook,
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.560]   absolutely the check in tool, I can see how it's invaluable.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:55.840]   Like seriously, it's, it provides an incredible service to the community in that case.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.080]   It's a great example.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.080]   Sorry.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.680]   But just quickly, it's a great example of how Facebook's using its platform for good
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:07.720]   because normally all we hear right is about how Facebook is taking over people's privacy,
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.640]   you know, or eroding our privacy.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:13.400]   And this is a really great use of the platform that's not just like self, not just publicity
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.400]   for Facebook.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.400]   Right.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.400]   Yeah, Jennifer.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.080]   And at least it's a useful tool, whereas I feel like if people are just changing their
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.480]   profile pictures to the French flag, I think it's nice, but it doesn't really serve a purpose
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.560]   besides some people saying that they're behind it.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:31.760]   But then what else are they doing, you know, besides changing for one second their picture.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.080]   But the, but the tool, the survival tool saying your safe, I think that has served a good
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.360]   purpose in past natural disasters.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:46.720]   Look at the earthquakes, for example, in Afghanistan and it allows people and even people, for example,
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.680]   who are on vacation there.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:53.440]   And I have a friend who is in Europe right now and to if they had been in parts at the
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.200]   time, that would have been a useful purpose of that role as well.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:03.680]   Well, even more so, the Twitter tag port, who vart, which means a door is open that was
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:11.080]   used by a Parisian residents to send signal that they would be willing to put up somebody
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:18.520]   who's seeking safety or even just somewhere to stay in Paris that on Saturday night.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:25.160]   And that's how it ever and every one of these instances, we find new uses for this and the
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.760]   scale changes.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.000]   Four million people according to Facebook used the safety check.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.880]   And then of course that's not all there is.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.160]   I don't want to say his name because he shared it with just his friends, but somebody I think
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:40.680]   you and I both know was in Paris was to go to a birthday party for his friend at Nobel
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.160]   Icupé.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.760]   His mother called as a result.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.760]   He did not go.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.640]   He is alive, but all his friends died there.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.640]   Wow.
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:53.360]   And he tells this story on Facebook in a way that in what can you do, but your heart pour
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.840]   out to him for what has lost, but your gratitude that he's there.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.840]   That's what Facebook enables.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.840]   It's the connection.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:05.320]   I just wrote a column for the New York Observer remembering Katrina, where, which was a no
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:10.360]   lot of comments aside, I helped start back in the day, where people used it and use the
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.520]   forums, they use Craigslist, they use whatever they could to tell people they were safe for
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.160]   to connect with people.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:21.040]   Facebook's case, this is a very specific purpose-driven application they created that
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:25.480]   does a job and they turn it on to do that job and they turn it off when they don't.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.480]   And yeah, the man who got with some hassle, but I think it's pretty amazing that they
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.080]   really anticipated.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:39.400]   They said it was inspired by the Tokyo Tsunami and the reactor problems in Japan.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.120]   That's what inspired them to make the safety check and how the safety check is now used
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.640]   and how they anticipated the use case and thought of it.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.960]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.960]   I think Twitter should implement something like that as well.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.440]   I wouldn't be surprised if they did in the near future.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.840]   And that hashtag, "Poktouver" basically opened doors.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:03.800]   Just for people to understand, there was a lot of confusion in the beginning of this
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.960]   thing.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:11.120]   We started having reports of gunfire and attacks, but we didn't know how many were there.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:16.800]   There were people who were staying close to, it was a Friday night.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:21.400]   So in Paris, people, like in every city, you go out, you have drinks with friends and people
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.840]   were close to those areas and they didn't want to stay in the streets.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.680]   So that was also heartwarming.
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:34.800]   I think a few, some taxi cabs also just turned off the meters and just drove people home because
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.520]   people didn't want to stay in the streets.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.400]   They didn't want to take the subway.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:44.400]   But the "Poktouver" was nice, of course.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:52.360]   I think there was also one thing that was still related to technology, but kind of heart-breaking
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.000]   in the next day.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.960]   You could see people sending tweets asking to be retweeted because they hadn't heard
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:07.240]   from some of their friends or family members in, you know, that they knew where at those
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.000]   places that had been attacked.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.800]   And you would see those photos being retweeted many, many times.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:19.600]   And you knew that there was a very good chance that person was dead and it was kind of putting
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.120]   it in front of your face.
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.560]   It was heart-breaking.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:31.560]   There was also another thing, a couple of teenagers started accounts for basically broadcasting
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:39.000]   those pictures of people that they wanted to have, that other people wanted to have news
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.480]   about.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:46.720]   And there were a couple of kind of mishaps or, you know, I'm guessing they were kids,
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:52.320]   but one of them, one of the people who was there at the concert, my understanding is
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:58.880]   that they pretended to not be, they didn't call their parents or something.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:06.120]   And once they saw that retweet being retweeted a thousand times, they answered to it and
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.160]   they were like, "Oh my God, I got a thousand retweets."
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.200]   And you're like, "What are you thinking?"
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.320]   But they were very young people.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:22.040]   And then one of those accounts created to retweet these, basically, announcements was
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:31.040]   saying this person has not been heard of or, you know, this person was killed in the attacks.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.520]   One retweet is one piece of support.
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:39.760]   And so you would see people retweeting this in the very, I guess it's lack of taste.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.720]   I guess it's teenagers.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:46.040]   They're not sure exactly how to handle all of this.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.760]   But this is going to happen.
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:53.940]   I think what's interesting about it, though, is contrary to the past where a news story
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:58.840]   like this was really at arm's length, you watched it on CNN.
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:03.880]   Thanks to social media, it's really much closer to home for everybody.
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:08.440]   And even if you don't know anybody on safety check, all you have to do is scan Twitter
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.920]   during these events.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:15.640]   And really, in a way that the news media is incapable of doing, have a direct personal
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.920]   experience of this.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.920]   I think that's got to be good.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.520]   Actually, I have to add something.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.160]   Sorry, I'm speaking of thought.
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.720]   Well, this is your story.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.320]   That's why you're here.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:37.080]   But I have to say I can't count the number of people that sent messages mainly through
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:41.680]   Twitter because Facebook is going to be more personal and people you actually know.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:48.960]   But on Twitter for someone like me who's a semi-public person, there were so many,
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:54.440]   so many people that sent messages of support and just, you know, we're thinking of you
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.400]   and we're with you and we're happy you're fine.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:01.520]   And that every one of those messages counted.
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:09.320]   It was everyone felt made me feel a little bit less alone and a little bit more supported.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:13.160]   But even if it's people you don't necessarily know, you know, I went to bed.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:18.080]   I decided not to watch the things that as they were unfolding, it was the evening for
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:22.080]   us on Saturday evening or Friday.
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.320]   I can't even remember.
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:29.120]   I decided not to watch because I knew it was going to be some kind of unproductive, almost
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.520]   voyeuristic thing where you were going to worry more than you were going to be informed.
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:36.640]   So I just decided, you know, I'm going to go to bed and we'll see what happens tomorrow.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.720]   And at that point it was, I think we were estimating about 20 dead.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:51.440]   And I woke up the next day and it was the toll was almost 130 dead and 200 people hurt.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:58.240]   Sorry I'm getting a bit emotional, but so I wake up and I see that toll and my heart
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.840]   just sank, you know.
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:05.000]   It was really hard to just read that it was, I thought it was going to be 20, maybe 30
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   people.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:16.360]   And along with that, there were so many messages of people expressing support that it made,
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:21.240]   I don't know, it refueled my heart, I guess, or my soul.
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:30.040]   And again, with the Facebook, French flag on avatars, it's really a dual feeling.
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:35.320]   It's both at the same time you kind of feel it, you know, what does that achieve?
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:39.760]   But also you understand that people who are hearing this, they want to show their support
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.280]   and you're on the internet.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.280]   What are you going to do?
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:47.920]   You know, you're not, you can't go and shake someone's hand, who's 10,000 kilometers away.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:56.640]   So it's also nice to see that people are actually doing it and that they want to tell
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:01.000]   you we feel for you.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.480]   So it does count.
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.560]   I guess is what I'm saying.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.880]   It's not going to solve the world's problems, but it does count.
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.960]   And yeah, I could talk about this a lot.
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:16.480]   And I, as somebody who did that, both put the French flag on my Facebook and put the
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:21.000]   Paris Peace, the Eiffelterre peace sign on my Twitter, it makes us feel a little bit
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.280]   better because you feel helpless in a situation like this.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:30.360]   And so I think people want to do something and that's something, it's small, but I feel
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.000]   like that also makes us feel a little bit better.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.440]   And we hope that it makes our French, a friends feel better.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.880]   Boy, you looked at face.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.440]   Did you see what Amazon did?
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.400]   Which was quite dramatic.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.440]   Yeah, yeah, they're like with so la darité.
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.880]   There were a couple of initiatives like this.
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:54.800]   Do you feel like that's just commercialism or is that that's heartfelt?
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:55.800]   I feel like that's heartfelt.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:20:00.720]   No, I think, yeah, I think it's a little bit of maybe a little bit of both, but I don't
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:05.360]   think the heartfelt feeling is fake.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:10.360]   There was also Uber that made their little cars into French flags, which was a little
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:11.360]   bit tacky.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:15.360]   But, you know, well, it's Uber, what do you expect?
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.360]   I guess so.
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.080]   Uber's always going to do the bro thing.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.920]   You know, whatever the bro thing would be, that'll be what that'll be.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.000]   What are you going to do, right?
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.640]   That's the kind of things you can do.
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:30.120]   And there were a lot of other things, you know, maybe not as tech related, but it made
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:34.880]   a lot of people think, you know, we've had a lot of discussions about refugees coming
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:41.040]   from Syria and a couple of people were saying, including myself, you know, these, this is
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.960]   so dramatic for us.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:47.200]   And there'd be a lot of discussions about the refugees, you know, we don't have enough
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.760]   space for all of them and blah, blah, blah.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.920]   And you're like, what if this is your every day, right?
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:56.520]   How long until you actually want to leave and go somewhere else?
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:02.440]   And I guess the other thing is the other shoe, which is going to drop fairly soon, I guess,
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:10.240]   is how are the this is going to be translated into policies and possibly make policies even
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.240]   more encroaching.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.240]   I do want to.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:16.240]   Although I don't know how much farther they can go with what they've drawn after the shoddy
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.240]   abductions.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.720]   We are definitely going to talk about it.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:25.120]   Well, from normal people, you saw heartfelt outreach and stuff from governments, of course,
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.960]   and immediate reaction is, oh, how can we use this to our advantage?
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:29.960]   Here's YouTube.
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:33.760]   This is interesting because of course, YouTube would like to be the next CNN.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.040]   I mean, they would really prefer that instead of going to Twitter or CNN or Facebook that
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:42.160]   you would go to YouTube and they have not only the let we stand with Paris, but they
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:46.360]   have a button that says latest news.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.760]   And this is interesting.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:53.480]   This is the first time I can remember YouTube using a news story as an opportunity to promote
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.720]   itself as a news source.
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:59.880]   And that's not the first thing I think I was going to YouTube.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.800]   I would have never thought to go to YouTube.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.800]   That's interesting.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:03.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.520]   I think they'd like you to think of it.
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.000]   Please think of us as a news source.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   And you know what?
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.480]   They can reinvent themselves.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:16.240]   If there's one thing that's for sure true is nothing is permanent in the internet.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:22.000]   And there's been, you know, most of the news stations use YouTube to hold their content.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.760]   I mean, in France, a lot of them are going to be using date emotion because it's French,
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:29.360]   but there's still a lot of them also going to YouTube.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:36.400]   So I think it's a relatively easy affair from the YouTube engineers to develop something.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:40.480]   It's interesting that when I clicked Learn More, what I got was France 24.
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.640]   There's no other brands on this.
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:46.000]   I don't know if France 24, if how'd that happened?
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.320]   If there's a relationship between YouTube and France 24, is that a state run television
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.960]   network or is it a private?
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.640]   Yeah, it's basically a state run.
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.600]   So that seems like a logical choice.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:04.720]   Yeah, it's somewhat separate from the state, but it's financed mostly from the TV contribution
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.120]   that every person who owns a TV space.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.600]   It's like the BBC.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.760]   So it's a be a natural thing to go to, I guess.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:12.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:16.520]   And it's one of the, it's the one that is international facing.
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:20.040]   So they have, it's kind of more like CNN.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.720]   Well, I guess BBC as well, they have a French channel, an English channel and an Arabic
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.720]   channel actually.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:26.720]   So they do that in three languages.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:31.080]   The other thing I did almost immediately is, you know, the first thing that struck me
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.120]   is, well, I want to understand this better.
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.440]   What is, what is this all about?
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.940]   What is now?
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.080]   I guess you don't call it ISIS or ISIL anymore.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.080]   We call it Daesh.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.080]   Yeah.
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.240]   That's the new thing.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.800]   That's the Arabic initials for the Islamic State.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:50.000]   Well, that's actually a very, there's a funny story behind it.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.880]   Or, by the way, this is not what they want to be called.
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:58.240]   Apparently it's annoying to them to call them Daesh, which is why we want to call them.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:01.640]   Like that's going to, oh, let's annoy a terrorist.
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:02.640]   That's smart.
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.640]   Let's all do that.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.000]   That's all just me as annoying as we can.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.720]   Troll the terrorists.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:12.080]   All of the, all of the politicians are, I don't know how purposeful it is, but I'm sure
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.920]   they know that, you know, the difference between the two words, but all of the politicians
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.280]   are calling them Daesh.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:21.280]   Well, the thing that was interesting to me is I wanted to, I wanted to know more.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.680]   My thought was why, why are they doing this?
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.680]   What's their point of view?
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:30.640]   And I was able very quickly to find some really good resources, one from the Atlantic,
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.120]   which had a cover story on this in March.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.120]   That was a...
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:37.280]   Matthew and Lacey wrote a great piece on Vox explaining the case for you.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.280]   Yep.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.840]   Ezra Klein retweeted a few videos.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:48.640]   And then Der Spiegel had an interesting article tying the top leadership of Daesh to former
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:52.720]   Iraqi leadership under Saddam Hussein, which I thought was interesting.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:58.000]   So this is, the internet is really can shine at a time like this in some very interesting
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   ways.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.680]   However, when we were, we're to take a break, when we come back, let's talk about how government
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.040]   reacts to this.
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:06.600]   And sometimes that's a little more disturbing.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.480]   Our show today, wait, we got a great panel.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:12.600]   And I'm sorry it's so big and we've got so many people that means we're all going to
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.560]   have to take turns.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:20.040]   And boy, we picked a bad time to break in Jennifer Booten from market watch, but you're
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.040]   great.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.840]   And I'm not worried about you, but I just, I apologize for the size of the panel, but
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:28.680]   there's a lot to talk about, obviously, with the events in Paris.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:32.200]   Devinder Hardewar also here from Endgadget.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:37.600]   The return of Jeff Jarvis from Parts Unknown.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.040]   I was following your travels.
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.480]   There's another one where the internet's great.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.720]   I was following your travels and your frustrations on Facebook.
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.200]   And it was a lot of fun.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.720]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:51.720]   And thank you, Patrick Bejoff for joining us at the last minute to give us the Parisian
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.200]   perspective.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.360]   My pleasure.
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:58.000]   Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.240]   This is the time of year where you do not want to go to the post office because that's
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.240]   amateur.
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.240]   It's amateur.
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.240]   I'm at the post office.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.800]   Lots of people go there once a year to mail all their Christmas gifts.
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:12.320]   And if you're running a business and you're mailing is part of your business, you don't
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.440]   want to go there.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.320]   You want to do it all from your desk.
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.760]   That's what Stamps.com is so great for.
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:21.600]   Anything you could do at the post office, you could do at Stamps.com.
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.840]   You have a digital scale.
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:23.840]   They're going to give it to you.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:29.440]   A USB scale that will calculate exact postage for any letter, any package, any class of mail,
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.120]   including media mail.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.880]   It's easy to set up.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.240]   You print these labels that are professional looking.
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:39.120]   You can print right on an envelope with your company logo, the return address.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:44.100]   The addresses are populated automatically from, if you're an eBay seller, from the eBay
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.840]   site or from Amazon or from Etsy.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:50.120]   It makes you look like a pro and it saves you time.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:53.320]   And all you need is your computer, your printer.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.680]   You don't need a postage meter, special ink or anything like this.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.600]   It makes a small business look like a big business.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.120]   There are no long-term leases.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.720]   There are no hidden fees.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.480]   There's no postage meter.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:10.440]   There's no, you know, postage meter ink is more expensive than inkjet printer ink?
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.880]   That tells you a hundred times more expensive.
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:18.520]   Plus, of course, they charge you to reset and they charge you processing fees.
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.200]   If the postage changes, you've got to bring it to the post office.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.480]   You don't want a postage meter.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.320]   This is the modern world.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.440]   This is welcome to the 21st century.
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:30.040]   You even get discounts you can't get at the post office.
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:34.120]   And it'll automatically fill out the customs forms, the certified mail, the return, the
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.120]   receipt.
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.400]   You even send an email saying, "Hey, your package is on the way.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.640]   I love stamps.com."
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.640]   Here's the deal.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:40.640]   Go to stamps.com.
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:46.360]   Click the microphone in the upper right hand corner and use our promo code TWITTWIT.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.000]   You're going to get a $110 bonus offer.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.960]   $55 in free postage.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.960]   $55 in free postage.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:28:00.000]   You get a digital scale and you get a supply kit and a four-week trial of stamps.com.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.600]   It's all great.
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.160]   It's all good.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:08.520]   Once you use it, you'll never stop stamps.com.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.400]   We thank you for their support of this week in tech.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:15.360]   Don't forget our offer code is TWITT.
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.040]   So of course, immediately government responds to this.
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:24.400]   Glenn Greenwald with a very emotional piece in the intercept this morning, written at
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.560]   4.23 a.m.
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.840]   So I think he was up all night.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:34.560]   Seeing emotions about Paris to blame Snowden and distract from actual culprits who empowered
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:45.200]   ISIS, isn't that it's almost shameful that a variety of newspeople, government officials,
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:51.680]   he says, former Bush Chaney apparatchicks, people with deep ties to private NSA contractors
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:55.960]   all saying, "Hey, thank you Snowden."
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:02.960]   And of course, as Glenn points out, Snowden didn't tell us any, didn't tell the bad guys
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.480]   anything about how we observed them.
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:09.600]   He let us know that we were also in the electronic dragnet.
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:15.240]   And anybody who saw Zero Dark 30 knows that even Osama bin Laden as early as 2003 knew
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:19.240]   not to use the cell phone or the internet.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.360]   Terrorists know this.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:24.040]   Here's an article, February 5th, 2001, USA Today.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:27.560]   The paper groups hide behind web encryption.
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:30.240]   We're going to see a tax on encryption now that are just...
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.480]   It's already started.
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.480]   Yep, it has.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.760]   New York Police Chief Ben Bratton.
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:42.080]   Let me see if I can find that article says, "Well, you can bet that the bad guys in Paris
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.080]   were communicating.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:47.840]   I'd like to know what kind of phones they had because they were communicating with encrypted
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:48.840]   technology.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:52.000]   They're just one more dark."
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.320]   So actually, the latest...
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:30:00.920]   I don't know if their rumors are substantiated, but apparently it's mentioned as a possibility.
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.480]   So good luck to the police chief.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:08.280]   Apparently the latest rumor is that they were using the PlayStation network on PlayStation
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:09.280]   4.
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:13.840]   Oh, that's not the first time I've heard that that's been done before.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.840]   Interesting.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:19.120]   Yeah, they're not being monitored as...
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:21.120]   I guess just people didn't think of it.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:26.640]   But I'm sure that now people, the government officials are going to go knock on Sony's and
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:31.520]   Microsoft's door and try to get some visibility into that as well.
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:35.640]   But obviously, I think the issue is they're always going to find something else or use
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:38.040]   some encryption that they...
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.560]   It's easy to do it.
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:43.520]   The problem that we're being faced with now, there are a couple of things.
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:50.280]   First of all, after the Charlie Hebdo attacks, there was a very strong movement in the French
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:31:02.960]   government to try and empower the police forces to have access to more information on everyone.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:09.440]   And basically formalizing and legalizing, I think, what they had been doing for a while
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.440]   anyway.
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.360]   So that's why they were pushing it so much.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:13.920]   That's the way I look at it.
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.000]   And it did go through.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.160]   So I don't know what more they could be doing.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:28.880]   But the other thing is, the big problem with these kinds of attacks is that it seems that
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:33.160]   most of the time, if not all of the time, they're perpetrated by people who are already
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:35.360]   known by the...
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.360]   That's what I always remember.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:38.360]   ...is my mind.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:39.360]   They've interviewed these guys.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.120]   They know they're there.
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:44.200]   So they are people who are...
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:48.680]   They have giant lists of people that they should be surveying, who are already being surveyed
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:53.160]   anyway, that they have the proper judicial approval.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.160]   They have everything.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.160]   And they are...
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:32:00.760]   If they had the resources for it, they would be following all of these people anyway.
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:05.640]   And the way they're pushing, I think because they just don't know what to do.
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.560]   And they want to appear to be doing something.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:10.560]   I don't think there's incredibly malicious intent in there.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.200]   Maybe that's me giving them the benefit of the doubt.
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:21.280]   But what they're doing is pushing it to say, "We have to be able to survey everyone."
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:25.440]   But really, I'm not sure how efficient it would be because the people that need to be
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.440]   surveyed are already...
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:32.720]   They already know who they are and they have the right to survey them anyway.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.240]   So that's where the disconnect comes from.
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:38.120]   And that's where people think, "Although I have to say..."
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.200]   And I'll finish on this.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:48.440]   When I heard about the attacks immediately as tech literate as I am, I had a few minutes
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.600]   of...
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.000]   I thought...
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.560]   And I have been fighting those laws very publicly to the best of my ability.
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.720]   I've been saying they are bad laws.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.960]   But for a few minutes, I was thinking, "You know what?
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:04.160]   Just let them spy on everyone."
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.720]   I give up.
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:13.200]   If there's a modicum of a fraction of a percent that it will help, let them do it.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:16.200]   And then I had to remind myself that it actually...
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.200]   It's tempting.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.200]   It doesn't matter.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.200]   It just doesn't matter.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.840]   So imagine people who don't know.
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:22.000]   Here's what...
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   It's not Benjamin Bratton.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   He's an actor.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.960]   It's Bill Bratton, Chief New York Police Commissioner, said this morning on ABC this week with George
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:36.280]   Stuff, an op-less ISIS, taking advantage of the technology that the head of the FBI has
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:37.360]   been complaining about.
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:40.040]   I've been complaining about going dark.
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:44.080]   The ability to go dark, I think you're going to see that playing a significant factor in
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.080]   this event.
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:48.880]   I'm very interested to see what types of phones they were equipped with, what types of apps
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.360]   they had on their phones.
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:55.000]   Were they in fact, even in communication with each other at all?
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.400]   And then on Face the Nation, I guess he was making the rounds, he said, "These apps, these
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:05.240]   devices that now allow these terrorists to operate without fear of penetration by intelligence
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.240]   services.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.800]   This is the first example of this."
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.600]   Which, of course, is not true.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:14.840]   We have gone blind as a result of the commercialization and the selling of these devices that cannot
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:20.360]   be accessed either by the manufacturer or more importantly by us in law enforcement,
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.400]   even equipped with search warrants and judicial authority.
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:26.840]   This is something that is going to be needed to be debated very quickly because we cannot
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:30.640]   continue operating where we are blind.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.880]   So I think you're going to see the drumbeat once again.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:40.240]   In Great Britain, apparently, David Cameron has backed down on his plan of enforcing back
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:45.360]   doors in encryption realizing it would harm the economy if nothing else.
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:50.560]   But then these things happen and people get the political wherewithal to pursue this once
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:51.560]   again.
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:54.280]   So I wouldn't be surprised at all.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:35:01.400]   I think this is why these shows like this one are so important and it's so important that
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:09.560]   the audience of our shows is informed and also informs people around them.
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:10.960]   Not in an aggressive way.
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.600]   You don't have to go all snow day before you go.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:14.600]   What do you say?
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.040]   Okay, let's give us some ammunition.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.040]   What do you say?
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.080]   And I think this is just as you experienced a very real concern.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.560]   Yeah, but how do we catch these guys?
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:28.840]   What do you say to somebody who says, "We've got to give them these powers.
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:31.080]   If we make it, they have to get a warrant.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.720]   What's wrong with that?"
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.240]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.840]   The problem is when they don't have to get a warrant, which is what is happening in France
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.000]   now.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.160]   It's unwarranted.
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:48.000]   There's some kind of weird shadow, not shadowy, but weird organization that is supposed to
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.480]   have some oversight, but it's nominated by the presidency or the government itself.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.280]   There's no counter power there.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:36:02.560]   They are able, in theory, to absorb all of the information and to basically do what the
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:08.280]   NSA and other intelligence organizations have been doing in the US, and that has been exposed
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.760]   by Snowden.
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:16.640]   What we can say, I think, is what needs to happen is police work on the people that are
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:30.280]   already in the view field, the field of view, of the information agencies, and bringing
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:35.600]   everyone in the country into that field of view is actually not going to help.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.520]   These are two separate issues.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:45.040]   Again, I think it's very important to understand whether or not the people who made those attacks
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:50.120]   had crossed the paths of the intelligence agencies at some point.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:54.960]   It seems that the first elements of the investigation seem to indicate that that is the case.
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.200]   They were people who were very prepared.
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.200]   There were professionals.
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:03.680]   They had gone to Syria and probably they had been there and had come back.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:06.240]   That's the first elements that we've seen.
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:11.880]   Really, when you're expanding the power of these agencies to gather information from
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:18.640]   the entire country and people who have no relationship with these specific people, you're not helping
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.640]   at all.
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:22.480]   You're just making everyone's life, everyone's...
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:25.840]   You're just attacking everyone's privacy.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:31.480]   If the issue is that you have to be able to get access to information faster and more
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.800]   efficiently, that's not a problem.
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.080]   I think we're all in agreement that that should happen.
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:42.200]   If you have someone that you're gathering information on that calls someone else or that has some
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:47.400]   kind of contact with someone else and you want to have information on that person, sure,
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:52.320]   just get a warrant or even get a special powers or something and get their information very
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.320]   quickly.
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.320]   That's fine.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:57.640]   Well, and we've talked about this, and Dvindra, you probably can comment on this.
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:02.640]   It's also dangerous to put back doors in this stuff for other reasons, right?
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:08.800]   I mean, for sure, other hackers could get access to those back doors as well.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:13.800]   It opens up all sorts of interesting doors and dangerous doors for our software and it
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:17.080]   defeats the purpose of having decent encryption anyway, too.
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:25.000]   I often though wonder, especially in the wake of the passage of SISA, if how committed companies
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.640]   like Apple, Facebook, and Google are really...
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:34.920]   I know that they very prominently and publicly said, "Oh, SISA is a bad idea," but at the
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:38.320]   same time, I feel like in the behind the scenes, they were saying, "Yeah, but you wouldn't
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.240]   be such a bad thing if you passed this."
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:45.840]   SISA was, of course, the cybersecurity law that allows companies to share information
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:53.440]   about attacks, cyber attacks, with each other and with the government, without warrant, and
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:57.080]   most importantly, I think for these companies, without liability.
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:59.680]   They can't be sued if they give your information.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:04.160]   I love it that Apple says, "Your stuff is on this iPhone is encrypted.
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:05.260]   No one can get it.
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:06.560]   We can't even get it.
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:08.320]   We can't give it the law enforcement."
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:15.800]   But I wonder, I wonder if that's just lip service and if behind the scenes, Apple is saying,
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.680]   I mean, they have to adhere to US law, right?
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.200]   Do you trust your iPhone to vendor it?
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:24.160]   Do you feel like no one can spy on what you're doing on your iPhone?
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:27.160]   I mean, it's stuff.
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:31.120]   Somebody in the government really wanted to get access to something they could, but I
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.520]   also have a corporate profile on my iPhone.
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:38.320]   So I can access my enterprise mail and my IT department, I know, can do a lot of things
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:41.680]   on my iPhone, but I do it because I need to get access to my work mail.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:45.160]   We make these concessions all the time, but the scary things are, "Yeah, what can the government
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:50.080]   do that maybe Apple or other companies aren't telling us about?"
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:55.800]   Here's the information that you were talking about, Patrick.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:02.760]   How Paris, ISIS, let's call them Daesh, terrorists may have used PlayStation 4 to discuss and
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:06.440]   plan attacks.
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:13.360]   This information comes from Belgium, the Federal Home Affairs Minister, Jean-Gembon.
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.960]   Does that mean ham?
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:20.480]   Okay, you know those Belgians, they're weird.
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:26.280]   Jean-Gembon said that the PS4 is used by ISIS agents to communicate, and it was selected
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:32.360]   due to the fact that here it comes again, it's notoriously hard to monitor.
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:37.120]   He said, "It's even more difficult to keep track of than WhatsApp."
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:39.280]   So let's ban PS4s everywhere.
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.280]   Yeah.
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:44.600]   It's Sony's problem, Sony's fault.
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.600]   What do they do?
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:48.200]   They go into a World of Warcraft game?
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:53.600]   I think they might, according to documents leaked by Snowden in 2013, the NSA and CIA
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:41:02.360]   embedded themselves in World of Warcraft to infiltrate virtual terrorist meetups.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.160]   And I think that's what you have to do.
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:06.000]   You have to have people actually.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   What are you going to do?
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.720]   Are you going to actually monitor everything?
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:15.640]   I think one of the pieces of information that came out of this was that obviously they don't
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:19.120]   want to admit to it, but they have so much information, they don't know what to do with
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:20.120]   it.
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:23.400]   I guess it's for reviewing after the fact if something happens.
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:27.800]   If I were a terrorist, I probably wouldn't be in World of Warcraft or Call of Duty.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:30.080]   I'd do something like Super Mario Kart.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:35.000]   It seems less likely that anybody looking for me there, right?
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   I think they're going to continue to find ways to innovate, right?
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:44.400]   They're going to try to, they understand now a bit of what the government's doing in terms
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.520]   of monitoring them and they're going to get creative.
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:47.520]   They have to.
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:53.200]   Whether it's going on PlayStation or finding a different way or trying to stay off the internet
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:55.280]   as much as possible, they're going to do it.
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:42:03.560]   Bottom line, it's not okay to weaken privacy, to weaken encryption, to give bad guys back
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:09.320]   doors to our stuff because you have a hard time following these terrorists.
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.320]   It doesn't matter.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.000]   You're still going to have a hard time anyway.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.360]   I think they're just going to go back to phones.
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:15.800]   They're going to call each other on the phone.
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:17.400]   Yeah, for crying out loud on the wire.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:18.400]   When was the wire?
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:22.440]   Even the bad guys on the wire knew you don't talk on the phone.
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:24.480]   Cry all loud.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.720]   They use Windows phones.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.720]   Nobody would ever else.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:34.280]   Or maybe that Blackberry Prive.
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:38.080]   See if I were terrorists, there's where I'd go with Blackberry Prive.
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:39.080]   No one would suspect.
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.240]   No one would suspect.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:44.480]   Not in a million years.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:48.480]   I don't want to belabor the point, but I think there are a lot of great and interesting
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:52.800]   tech angles and I'm glad that we could get you in here, Patrick, to give us the first
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.240]   person experience.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:58.600]   What's it like in Paris tonight?
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.920]   I just came from the airport.
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:03.600]   Was it difficult to get into and out of?
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.640]   No, no, it was fine.
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:11.240]   I think it's going to be relatively normal.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:15.560]   I think there's a lot of people who are...
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:17.560]   My concern is not with Paris itself.
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:19.080]   I think Paris is going to be fine.
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:24.600]   We already had Parisians back in the terraces yesterday.
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:27.120]   We were flipping people off when they were...
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:33.120]   I think BuzzFeed is an article going to terraces asking what do you have to say to terrorists?
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:38.760]   How are you living your life and they were giving virtually terrorists the finger and
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:43.320]   they were enjoying their coffees and beers at the terraces?
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:48.520]   The real concern is more on the policy side of things, obviously the privacy things and
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:55.720]   how things are going to evolve with Assad and the military and the privacy options and
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:56.720]   things like that.
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:00.320]   But no, Paris seemed relatively normal.
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:01.960]   It was easy to get in.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:04.920]   There weren't any issues at the airport.
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:06.920]   That's not normal at all.
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:09.680]   It's always difficult to get into the airport.
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:10.680]   Yeah.
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:11.680]   Yeah.
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:12.680]   So...
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:14.680]   You know what's fascinating to me is that...
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:17.600]   And this actually raises an interesting question for BuzzFeed.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:25.600]   How do you simultaneously do viral listicles and real news?
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:27.880]   And they're trying to do both.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:32.920]   And actually, I can't remember if it was there that I saw that article.
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:35.560]   But there are absolutely articles like that.
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:36.560]   Yes.
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:42.280]   And there was one about the rumors and it was great and not semi-invasive.
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:48.320]   And basically they've worked where they were saying, making a list of all of the rumors
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.280]   that were floating around and why...
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:51.800]   Well, here's what I fell for.
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:45:11.480]   The I-
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:13.480]   Was he full?
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:15.480]   Let's hope he was full.
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:16.480]   No, he was...
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.840]   So they got pawned by a pawner.
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:20.640]   Oh, that's terrible.
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.640]   Geez.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:22.640]   That's terrible.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.440]   Washington Post forgot to do that.
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:25.440]   Actually, this is good.
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:26.440]   This is...
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:28.280]   Okay, I'm gonna take it back.
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:29.280]   You're right.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.440]   This is a great listicle from BuzzFeed.
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:35.960]   The things that people believe but didn't happen.
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:39.320]   I think that's actually kind of an appropriate place for them to...
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:41.560]   It's more useful than some of the other listicles.
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:47.200]   But yeah, it's weird when you go to the BuzzFeed homepage that they're still highlighting.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:50.480]   They're really virally types of articles and you have to click another button to go to
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:51.480]   BuzzFeed News.
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:52.480]   The news part.
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:53.880]   I feel like, yeah, after a certain point, maybe you just want to...
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:57.120]   Let's just call BuzzFeed News something else because it really is something totally different
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.040]   than what BuzzFeed ever was.
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:00.040]   I agree to better.
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:02.120]   They really are getting more serious though.
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:07.200]   I was just thinking that the other day that I feel like BuzzFeed to start was always just
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.200]   listicles and things like that.
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.200]   Right.
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:14.160]   Maybe three years ago sharing 20 things to do and you're under 30 and things like that.
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.160]   And now I don't even...
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:19.320]   I really think I go to BuzzFeed more for the news.
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:20.320]   We got...
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:21.880]   Is that Jennifer's mic?
[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:23.920]   It's kind of starting to crackle.
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:24.920]   I don't know.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:25.920]   Maybe unplug it and plug it back in.
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:27.600]   Sometimes that happens.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:28.600]   I think...
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.800]   Okay, admittedly this isn't really good news but it does...
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:34.280]   It's actually a perfect listicle because it's timely.
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:38.400]   It's about the news and informs you and you can mock somebody which is really what it's
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.000]   all about, right?
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.680]   This picture doesn't show a March in Germany expressing solidarity with a French like DJ
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.560]   V-girl tweets.
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:51.040]   It's actually from an anti-immigration event in January.
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:53.840]   Hey, one March looks much like another.
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:57.600]   I don't blame her for getting that wrong.
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:58.600]   Were the terrorists...
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:01.000]   Do we know using Twitter and Facebook?
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:07.600]   I know that there was some jubilation from various Daesh accounts on Twitter.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:10.760]   No, I don't know that they were.
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:20.560]   I think it's taken a little bit, I think, a day for Daesh to actually claim responsibility
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:21.560]   for those attacks.
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:23.760]   I don't think there's been a huge amount of activity.
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.760]   I think actually a lot of...
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:33.120]   We didn't have a lot of information on the terrorists which led to some pretty ethical
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.480]   work by the journalists.
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:40.400]   My first fear was that they weren't going to plaster the airwaves with their faces and
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:43.560]   names in the way that is the most harmful to...
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:44.560]   Yes, let's not do that.
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:45.560]   Let's not do that.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:46.560]   Exactly.
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:49.400]   But since we don't know, basically most of them...
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:52.360]   It's terrible, but most of them blew themselves up.
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:59.040]   So we really didn't know anything and we still don't know much at this point.
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:04.040]   I don't think they used social media a lot.
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:08.760]   My theory, and this is completely personal, I'm not even sure how much all of this is geared
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:10.480]   towards the West or towards France.
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:16.240]   I think Daesh is currently in a relatively tight spot.
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:21.200]   They're losing ground to some of their enemies locally.
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:27.600]   This is a recruitment tool that they made to distract the world from the fact that they're
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:36.360]   not as powerful as they were a few months ago and to get people to join them in some
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:40.480]   parts of the world that are more susceptible to these kinds of things.
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:43.280]   Nice thing is you can recycle when these events happen close together.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:47.920]   A lot of these tweets and images are from the Charlie Hebdo attack, including this one
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:50.040]   which I saw quite a bit of on Twitter.
[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:52.240]   That's from January.
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:53.240]   That's not recent.
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:55.560]   Although the sentiment still applies.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:57.560]   Uber did not...
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:03.840]   You guys got the New York Times update, push update today about France attacking Syrian
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.840]   ISIS targets in Syria.
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:06.840]   That was kind of...
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:09.400]   Yeah, that was a little chilling too because it felt like, "Oh, of course.
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:14.320]   If this were a novel or a movie, this is the plot point advancing very quickly."
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:17.840]   And that was kind of scary because it seemed also very typical.
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:24.120]   The news is a video game now and we're all players, which I don't think is necessarily
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:25.920]   a good thing.
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:26.920]   Let's take a little break.
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:30.080]   We can talk about things, nice things.
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:35.680]   iPad Pro, a four-inch iPhone, things like that.
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:38.640]   The Steve Jobs movie, bombing.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.440]   Which was great, but it bombed.
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:41.680]   Did you like it, Devindra?
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:42.680]   I loved it.
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:43.680]   Really?
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.680]   Really?
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:48.440]   The fuck world doesn't, and I wrote a long article and I got it about why a lot of people
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:49.440]   are wrong.
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:54.920]   But I thought it was a tremendous film, but it's not completely accurate, but most biopics
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:55.920]   aren't.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:56.920]   Right.
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:50:01.800]   But you enjoyed it as a work of art.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:03.600]   As a piece of art, yeah.
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:08.000]   It's much more interesting than just trying to rehash Steve Jobs' life from beginning to
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   end.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.320]   It's a really artistic, dramatic, almost experience-take on that story.
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:13.560]   It felt very sh-experient.
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:14.560]   Yeah.
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.560]   I'm delighted it has- Me too.
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:18.400]   That is out of the theater.
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:19.400]   Me too.
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:20.400]   I think it was a piece of junk.
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:22.560]   So we can disagree about that.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:27.600]   Well, it kind of comes down to, and I think that reasonable people can disagree, comes
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:30.520]   down to whether you like Aaron Sorkin or not.
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:31.520]   Yes.
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:33.280]   You know, I like early Aaron Sorkin.
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.120]   Less fun of late Aaron Sorkin.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:36.120]   Yeah.
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:37.120]   A little bit of a newsroom.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:39.120]   A little bit of a start over in the newsroom.
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:43.400]   See, the newsroom is a lot of fun, but it's not like the most accurate portrayal of the
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:44.400]   news.
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:47.080]   It's even close, and it's sexist to boot.
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:49.880]   The social network is dreadful.
[00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:53.720]   Yeah, the social network was a much bigger problem.
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:59.840]   The social network Oscar nominee and Oscar winning in many respects was far more fantastical
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:05.080]   about its story than Steve Jobs was, whereas Steve Jobs kind of took real events and just
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:07.440]   mashed them all into very tight timeframes.
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:12.160]   It was a lot more true to Steve Jobs than the social network was, to Zuckerberg or that
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:13.320]   whole story.
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:17.560]   It's funny that you mentioned Shakespeare and you say, you know, Julius Caesar was, you
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:19.920]   know, because I said the same thing to Danny Boyle.
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:24.960]   We interviewed Danny Boyle a couple of weeks ago, and I said, I imagine the family of Richard
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:28.760]   III wasn't too happy about that portrayal either.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:32.800]   But at least Shakespeare had the good sense not to write about people who were recently
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:36.560]   alive and many of whose friends were still alive.
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:38.520]   That's always a risky thing to do.
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:40.520]   History is moving too quickly.
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:45.280]   I could understand the inherent pushback against doing Steve Jobs' biopicos.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:51.360]   I would have enjoyed it as a Ramazah clef if they had kind of thinly veiled it as Steve
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:52.840]   Jobsky or something.
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:53.840]   Steve Mobs, yeah.
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:54.840]   Steve Mobs.
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:52:00.200]   I wouldn't have minded that much, but I, gosh, you know, and I'm sure you also, David
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:05.640]   Rimmel, I mean, we know a lot of these people and I feel bad for them.
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:11.360]   I think what was most interesting is that, yeah, Lisa Brennan Jobs actually helped out.
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:13.600]   She talked with Aaron Sorkin.
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:17.320]   This movie has her perspective, whereas, you know, I've read all the Steve Jobs biographies
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:22.680]   so far, and she has refused to talk to anybody, including Walter Isaacson, who's made probably,
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:26.920]   you know, that's the apple approved, the Steve Jobs approved biography, and she didn't even
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:27.920]   talk to him.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:30.520]   So I think the film has other things to say.
[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:32.320]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:37.680]   And I have to admit that that is one of, that is probably the most reprehensible story in
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:43.200]   anecdote, Steve Jobs life is how he denied his daughter for so long.
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:46.040]   The one, the movie doesn't show that they don't live in.
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:47.040]   He's married.
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:48.040]   I know.
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:53.480]   And I mentioned this before in '94, I spent a long weekend with Steve Lorraine.
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:57.920]   Reid had been just been born and Lisa and they were a loving family.
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:02.240]   And this is, of course, you know, it's very different from the portrayal in the movie.
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:05.280]   On the other hand, Jobs is so venerated.
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:09.400]   Very few people ever bring this, you know, really want to talk about this issue.
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:11.920]   And it is pretty reprehensible.
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:13.440]   So I don't know that that's the case.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:18.520]   I think a lot of, well, maybe nothing the general public right doesn't it?
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:20.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.120]   I feel like everyone, we all know it, but we don't want to talk about it.
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:29.560]   You know, we want to talk about his successes and, you know, how he was tough, but fair,
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:30.560]   or whatever.
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:33.160]   It's all, you know, it's all mythos.
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:35.920]   It's all made up.
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:40.600]   Human being is far too complex, especially a genius like Jobs, far too complex to portray
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:45.600]   in a movie or a book or anything, I think.
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:52.720]   I don't feel like I'm any closer to understanding Steve than I ever was, frankly.
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:55.720]   Let's take a break.
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:58.040]   How about that?
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:00.280]   I was trying to manage my manager time.
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:02.640]   I have so much to talk about today.
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:09.080]   I want to talk about the FBI paying a million dollars to Carnegie Mellon to break tour for
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:13.200]   months, months.
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.720]   Talk about it.
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:17.640]   Overreach.
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:21.600]   But first, let's talk about my mattress because that's much more peaceful and restful and
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:22.600]   nice.
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:25.600]   And I have a very nice mattress.
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:27.240]   His name is Casper.
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:29.120]   The friendly mattress.
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:36.080]   Actually, Casper is a site, CasperCASPR.com, where you can go and get American made mattresses,
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:40.360]   premium mattresses for a fraction of the price you'd pay if you went to a mattress store.
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:43.360]   And that's because they eliminate the middleman.
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:47.080]   The mattress store markup is massive.
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:48.560]   You can do better.
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:52.200]   Casper's mattress is obsessively engineered.
[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:56.240]   They use latex and memory foam to give you a great support.
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:01.400]   See, I like a firm mattress, but they give too because Lisa likes it to give a little
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:03.560]   bit.
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:06.360]   We both love our Casper mattress.
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:08.680]   And I think you will love yours too.
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:13.960]   Now the challenge, of course, is how do you sell direct from Casper?
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:15.640]   Because people want to try before they buy you.
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:19.080]   We're all used to going to the mattress store and lying uncomfortably on a mattress with
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:20.480]   our shoes on.
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:23.960]   And the sales girl giving us the stink eye, trying to imagine what it would be like to
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:26.960]   sleep on this every night for the rest of our lives.
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:29.240]   It's not a good system at all.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:32.480]   The way the Casper works, you order it.
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:36.600]   It comes in a box, surprisingly compact box.
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:37.600]   You open it up.
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:39.800]   Oh, it's so comfortable.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:41.920]   Now you have 100 nights to decide.
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:43.960]   This is the trial period.
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:48.560]   100 nights, if any time in those first 100 nights, you say, yeah, it's not for me.
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:51.840]   They'll come and get it and refund you every penny.
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:54.520]   So you can try before you buy for 100 nights.
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:57.120]   Really the best way to do it.
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:00.520]   Lying in a show and a bed in a show has no correlation to how you're going to like that
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:01.520]   mattress.
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:03.240]   I was talking to my son Henry.
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:05.520]   We sent him a Casper when he was last year.
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:07.680]   I guess he was a sophomore in college.
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:11.280]   And he lived on the third floor and it came in a nice compact box.
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:12.680]   He could get up there.
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:13.680]   He loved it.
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:15.320]   He moved it to his new apartment.
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:16.480]   And I said, you're going to take it with you?
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:17.480]   Because he's moving again.
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:19.400]   He said, yeah, it seemed a little action.
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:20.680]   I think I might get a new one.
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:23.440]   And I think that's probably a good idea.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:26.200]   And the nice thing about Casper is it's easy.
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:29.760]   It's affordable, $500 for a twin, $950 for the king size.
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:34.400]   I mean, just compare that even to the best sales at the mattress store down the street.
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:38.600]   And you're going to save an additional $50 just by using the promo code TWIT.

[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:50.160]   your health, your well-being.
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:52.080]   Get a better night's sleep.

[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:03.280]   How are you feeling, Jeff?
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:05.080]   You getting a little woozy, a little tired?
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:06.320]   I'm doing all right.
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:07.320]   All right.
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:09.080]   Patrick, you're okay?
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:12.520]   I'm, yeah, you know, I was in Finland.
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:17.080]   What were you doing in Helsinki?
[00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:22.080]   I was a very sad event.
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:26.080]   It was a death in my wife's family.
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:27.080]   Oh, sorry.
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:30.080]   You know, grandmother longed in happy life.
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:31.080]   It was okay.
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:33.080]   Is your wife finished?
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:34.080]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:35.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:38.080]   She's a Swedish-speaking Finn.
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:46.080]   So they actually have a Swedish-speaking minority and Finland has two official languages.
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:51.240]   The festival, which has become a very big tech event in Finland.
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:55.160]   It's one of the biggest, if not the biggest in Nordic region.
[00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:56.160]   And they call it slush.
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:59.600]   They have a lot of, you know, because of the snow and the lovely weather.
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:00.600]   It's really appealing.
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:03.000]   I can't wait to go to the slush.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.480]   Slush2015@slush.org.
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:06.480]   Wow.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:07.480]   Yeah.
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:13.240]   I guess if you live in slush, you got to celebrate the slush.
[00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:14.240]   Exactly.
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:16.240]   It's becoming a thing.
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:18.960]   Oh, look where they had.
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:19.960]   Wow.
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:20.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:23.240]   What a great panel.
[00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:25.920]   Were you invited to that, Mr. Jarvis?
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:26.920]   Seems like this.
[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:27.920]   Oh, no.
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:28.920]   I saw a calorita before.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:30.000]   My calorita lives half the time in Finland now.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   She does.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   Oh.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   Yeah, she's learning Finnish.
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.760]   That's an interesting pursuit.
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:36.760]   It's a difficult language.
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:37.760]   It's kind of a turkey.
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:39.920]   There's nothing to grab onto.
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:41.280]   Nothing at all.
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:43.280]   And only like four or five million people speak it.
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:46.280]   So why not?
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:47.280]   Why not?
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:51.200]   The nice thing about Finland and Sweden, everybody speaks perfect English.
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:52.200]   Yes.
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:53.200]   It's kind of remarkable.
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:57.720]   It makes me feel like a slacker, to be honest.
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:01.200]   Maybe that's why a calorita is learning Finnish.
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:03.560]   No one can call you a slacker if you learn Finnish.
[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:08.520]   So Carnegie Mellon, this is crazy, crazy.
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:09.840]   I'm going to try to get this right.
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:14.280]   Correct me if I got the details of the facts wrong.
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:22.000]   According to the TOR project, the FBI wanted to uncloak users of the TOR network.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:27.840]   An anonymizing network we've talked about, often the onion router, used by the Silk Road.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:31.640]   Apparently that was one of the people they wanted to catch, was one of the people involved
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:33.720]   with a new Silk Road.
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:36.920]   They were also going after a child pornographer.
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:38.760]   Nothing wrong with that.
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:45.800]   So they went to Carnegie Mellon researchers to crack TOR's anonymizing network.
[00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:52.880]   And according to the TOR project, paid CMU a million dollars.
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:55.200]   So they, I guess they wanted to know how to do it.
[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:56.360]   The FBI wanted to know how to do it.
[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:57.760]   So they paid CMU a million dollars.
[00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:00.320]   Of course, the issue is, yeah, this is great.
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:01.800]   They caught the bad guys.
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:08.640]   But during the period in which TOR was de-anonymized, many thousands of people used it.
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:13.160]   And their privacy was non-existent.
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:17.520]   There was no warrant or there's no indication that there was a warrant.
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:21.560]   According to the TOR project, there was no oversight, institutional oversight by Carnegie
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:27.240]   Mellon's institutional review board.
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:33.360]   They were paid by the FBI to attack hidden services, then sift through the data to find
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:35.720]   people they could accuse of crimes.
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:40.320]   So that's another issue, which I'm not sure about, but the other issue would be, was it
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:41.320]   a fishing expedition?
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:46.160]   Hey, just see what you can find in there, or were they actually going after this Brian
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:48.600]   Richard Farrell.
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:53.080]   What's changed since?
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.000]   Is this an expert that's still possible?
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.760]   Ah, that's a good question.
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:00:59.760]   That's a good question.
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:02.240]   I don't get the impression that it's ongoing.
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:06.720]   The TOR project noticed in July a group of malicious relays, that's the best way to crack
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:07.720]   TOR.
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:10.800]   We're trying to pick out people who were looking for hidden services.
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.720]   Sites hosted on TOR, like Facebook.
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:19.600]   They used a mix of nodes and exit relays along with some vulnerabilities in the network
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:24.480]   protocol that allowed for users' real IP addresses to be discovered.
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:29.120]   Those relays were subsequently removed by the TOR project.
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:36.720]   But how is this different from the FBI or anyone else, exploding a flaw in a protocol
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:39.680]   to peek into a secure network?
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:44.040]   Huge difference, because if the FBI is going after somebody and trying to gather evidence
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:49.160]   and does, in fact, as we know this does happen, use exploit zero-day flaws and stuff to do
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:53.000]   after that person, they're presumably doing that with a warrant.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.240]   It's a kind of wiretapping.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:57.040]   And B, it's targeted.
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.800]   This is more like a fishing expedition.
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:02.920]   This net caught anybody who used those relays.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.920]   It was run for a period of, I think, four or five months.
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:10.600]   I feel like this is the typical fallout of governments surveillance general.
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:12.280]   You're always going to have people...
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:16.360]   The government's always going to say that innocent bystanders are going to be byproducts
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.280]   of what they're trying to do.
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:20.280]   Collateral damage.
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:25.160]   Matthew Green, who's a really great cryptographer, one of the really the thought leaders in this
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:31.320]   field, he's a professor at Johns Hopkins, wrote an article about why the tour attack
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:34.400]   matters on Wednesday.
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:37.320]   And that's the point he makes, is the collateral damage.
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:42.520]   I mean, nobody's going to argue that you shouldn't go after somebody possessing child
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:49.760]   pornography or staff members at Silk Road 2.0.
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:54.200]   But he says, "There's no reason to believe the defendants were the only people affected."
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:03:01.480]   If the details are the attack are as we understand them, a group of academic researchers deliberately
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:07.720]   took control of a significant portion of the tour network without oversight.
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:12.320]   This attack ran for five months, potentially de-anonymized thousands of users who depend
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:16.680]   on tour to protect them from serious harm.
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:17.680]   And they took $24.
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:20.960]   And they took a million dollars for it.
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:27.240]   This is similar to RSA taking money from the NSA, or was it the NSA paid NIST?
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.240]   Who was it?
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:34.600]   To recommend a broken protocol.
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:35.600]   That's a story.
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:40.080]   This is an old story, but that's a story.
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:45.960]   It's a NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Time, is that it?
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:56.600]   And the NSA were in cahoots to promote a weak crypto standard, hoping that bad guys would
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:01.880]   use it.
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:02.880]   You know, it's...
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:03.880]   Go ahead.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:08.560]   I was going to refer to something you said in passing.
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:14.120]   At the beginning of the show, you mentioned the wire, the TV show.
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:24.440]   And I think it can put a little bit of focus on something that seems like a completely
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:28.840]   foreign subject or right to us now.
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:35.640]   You know, go watch the wire again, and you'll see how difficult it is for police.
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:36.640]   Right.
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:37.640]   For some people.
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:38.640]   It should be.
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:39.640]   Yeah.
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.840]   And that's what I don't understand.
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:42.960]   When did we go?
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.280]   Was it 9/11?
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.280]   I don't know.
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:46.760]   When did it go from?
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:47.760]   Yes.
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:50.760]   It has to be difficult for...
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:52.080]   Because it's not like in the wire.
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:55.440]   I know it's a work of fiction, but it used elements of reality.
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:05:00.400]   It's not like the people they were spying on were evading tax.
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:03.600]   They were actually selling drugs that were killing kids.
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:04.600]   It wasn't...
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:05.600]   And it probably...
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:10.240]   I'm going to say something a little bit controversial, but I think factually it's probably true.
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:15.160]   They were probably making more damage to American society than the terrorists.
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:16.160]   The terrorists.
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:17.160]   Yes.
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.160]   It's actually did.
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:19.760]   If you count in a cold manner, the number of dead.
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:25.600]   So how did it work that we actually went from...
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.080]   It has to be somewhat difficult.
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:33.960]   You have to have protections for people and make that job reasonably difficult.
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:37.400]   You have to have a warrant to...
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:46.320]   We can inject bad certificates or we can pay Carnegie Mellon to de-anonymize the tour network.
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:49.480]   I don't understand how we jumped that shark.
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.200]   This is as a society.
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:54.280]   It felt exactly like that feeling you had Patrick, right?
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:55.280]   That you okay?
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:58.000]   Maybe let the government surveil everything, right?
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.400]   Because maybe that would help prevent another attack.
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:04.280]   And yeah, after 9/11, I was in college when that happened and my college experience was
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:07.720]   basically colored by our response to 9/11.
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:13.520]   And it's crazy to see how this entire country went from a place where police had to go through
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:18.800]   a lot of legwork to get surveillance done to where it was basically like our first response
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:21.680]   was to just do whatever it takes to catch people.
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:25.400]   And I'm worried now, especially after the Paris attacks that we're going to see something
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:27.080]   similar happening.
[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:32.560]   Jeff Jarvis, if anyone would have standing to say, "Hey, go get those bad guys.
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:33.560]   It's you."
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:38.320]   You came very narrowly close to being killed in 9/11 yourself.
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:41.080]   And I know that you know people who were.
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:45.800]   And you in fact have suffered health problems that might be attributed to 9/11.
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:50.160]   Do you feel like never again, whatever it takes?
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:51.160]   Let's go get those guys.
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:54.600]   No, and I confess I did go through a bit of that afterwards.
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:58.160]   I went from being a pacifist to a hawk.
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:01.600]   But we have to have standards of a democratic society.
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:02.600]   And we have to stand by those.
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:06.240]   And we can't be run by just the exceptions.
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:15.080]   And being able to keep secrets and have privacy and to encrypt is part of what we need to
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:18.240]   be able to have in an open and free society.
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:22.800]   If you cannot presume that something is secure, then nothing is secure.
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:25.040]   So we need that as a society.
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:30.280]   And then, yeah, we have a system of warrants that enables the government to go after the
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:32.280]   bad guys.
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:36.880]   You know, when the New York Times first started working on the warless wiretaps that Snowden
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:41.640]   ended up revealing so much, I thought wrongly at first, well, this perhaps is just to get
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:45.520]   the base data to see the exceptions.
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:48.080]   But no, it was it was tapping into our very internet.
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:49.080]   It was tapping into the core.
[01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:50.840]   It was lying to us about what was happening.
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:53.040]   We have no faith in our government right now.
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:59.000]   But whatever it is brought, I joke about apologizing for the NSA.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.600]   These days now I apologize for Donald Trump, but that's another story.
[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:07.840]   It has a negative effect too on our own security.
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:15.760]   You know, this when the when the NSA co-opted the RSA with a $10 million payment to promote
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:20.960]   a weakened crypto standard, that crypto standard is still in our browsers.
[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:28.320]   And still to this day, years later is a weakness, a weakness that companies like Microsoft
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:32.840]   and Google have been trying very hard to banish from the browsers.
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:37.920]   That's there because the RSA took $10 million from the NSA to put it in there.
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.280]   A moral hazard of the river was one.
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:41.280]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:49.560]   Now, here's one that's a little harder to justify, but I think we can make a strong case.
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:59.320]   According to the intercept, 70 million prisoners phone calls have been tapped.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:03.760]   An anonymous hacker believes that securuses violating constitutional rights of inmates
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:11.360]   has released information that says 70 million phone calls placed by prisoners in 37 states.
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:13.520]   Now, you might say, well, they're prisoners.
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:14.520]   Screw them.
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:17.520]   But many of those phone calls were to their attorneys.
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:18.520]   That's the key.
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:20.520]   I don't know if they'll protect it.
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:21.520]   I don't know if they'll protect it.
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:24.800]   And phone calls to general phone calls to attorneys are privileged.
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:25.800]   Period.
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:26.800]   Full stop.
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:27.800]   Yeah.
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:34.440]   And this is by the way, another whistleblower who said, hey, this is not right.
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:39.120]   I'm going to talk about this.
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:43.240]   It feels there are so many things that don't feel right.
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:50.000]   You know, ever since we've started to have serious problems with all of these consequences
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:56.880]   of the terrorist attacks, I've been thinking a lot about master Yoda, all people.
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:57.880]   You know what he says?
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:04.800]   He says a bunch of things which conclude which with I think fear leads to the dark side.
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:10.400]   And it's a pop culture reference, which as with many pop culture references have a lot
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.360]   of truth, right?
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:17.000]   These terrorists cannot defeat us militarily.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   They can't.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.240]   They don't have the resources.
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:21.880]   They cannot kill enough of us to make an impact.
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:28.560]   They can what they can do is make us afraid so that we will change who we are.
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:34.160]   And that's exactly what the venerable and fictional master Yoda was saying.
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:35.680]   Fear leads to the dark side.
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:37.400]   And I think that's what we're seeing.
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:46.000]   We're afraid so we're making decisions that is making us, you know, changing who we are
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000]   and I think not for the better.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.000]   And you've been seeing that happening constantly since 9/11.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:59.880]   And people are so quick to just want to say that surveillance should be the end all because
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.840]   you know, that's how we protect ourselves.
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:03.920]   But you do have to have some kind of standards there.
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:08.560]   And after what happened in Paris, it's I'm sure a lot of people are going to, you know,
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:10.040]   come back on that a little bit.
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:15.760]   But like you said, it's important to remember that terrorism instills fear.
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:16.760]   Terror.
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:17.760]   That's what it is.
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:18.760]   Yeah.
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:21.600]   Remember that when the knee jerk happens because it's about to.
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.160]   But we already see.
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:27.200]   I'm always interested in how pop culture responds to like real world events in the, you know,
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.960]   the state of the culture right now.
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:33.760]   And it's funny how surveillance is like one of the prevailing plot points in movies,
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:38.160]   in TV shows these days and not just like, you know, things related to spying.
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:43.360]   Even the latest like, yeah, James Bond is all about the whole global surveillance network
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:45.320]   and how that could be used badly.
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:48.000]   And it's almost to the point where we're getting sick of it, where it feels like all
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000]   these movies are just recycling the same idea.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.280]   But it also feels like as a culture, we have something to work through because like we're
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:58.560]   feeling this and, you know, we don't know what's going on with all the surveillance around
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:11:59.560]   us.
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:02.560]   I don't expect there was interesting getting on James Bond.
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:03.560]   It's a terrible movie.
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:04.560]   It's not good.
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:05.560]   It's not good.
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:06.560]   Wait a minute.
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:10.080]   You like the Steve Jobs movie, but you hated the James Bond movie.
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.080]   Oh, you're crazy.
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:12.080]   You're crazy.
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.520]   Because I love Skyfall and Spectre was so boring.
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:15.520]   I hate it.
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:16.520]   Skyfall.
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:24.440]   But I'm not that it was a good portrayal though of how government surveillance gone bad.
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:29.160]   And they, you know, they had people at the highest levels of government trying to spy
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.520]   on people for the greater good.
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:36.080]   And it just showed, you know, maybe it maybe in not the best way, but it made its point
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:39.080]   that that's not a necessarily good thing always.
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:40.640]   Yeah.
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:42.120]   So should I see it?
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:43.120]   Spectre.
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:44.120]   Yeah.
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:46.080]   You should see it.
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:49.640]   It's for very pretty, but I've seen every James Bond movie.
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:51.040]   I guess I should go see that one.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:54.680]   It feels like, you know, so I'm not a big Daniel Craig fan as James Bond.
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:55.680]   Me too.
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:56.680]   Me too.
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:02.120]   I'm on all the way back to like Prius Brosnan, the not so great bonds because all the camp
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:06.480]   is back and none of the like great tension or like psychological drama that Daniel Craig's
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.840]   movies have had except for Quantum Solace.
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:09.840]   It's funny.
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:12.440]   The British papers love it, but the Americans hated it.
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:13.440]   Yes.
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:16.200]   Two and a half hours of entertainment.
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:17.520]   That's what you have to understand.
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:21.440]   I'm told that the opening sequence, you know, all James Bond movies before the credits begin
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:23.760]   with a chase scene or something.
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:25.920]   And I'm told that that's a really good one.
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:31.080]   Yeah, I have a lot of feelings on that, but yeah, it's it's pretty.
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:32.280]   Devendra, come on.
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:33.280]   Let it out.
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:34.640]   It's a helicopter fight that's boring.
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:36.040]   How do you make a James Bond helicopter?
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:37.240]   You were actually bored.
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:38.240]   Wow.
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:39.240]   Yeah.
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:40.240]   I keep believe you thought that was a board.
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:41.240]   I don't know the video.
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:42.240]   You like the music.
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:45.600]   I like I like good action movies.
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:50.840]   That one felt like it was a helicopter fight that felt like it went on for maybe a minute
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:52.040]   or two minutes too long.
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:56.080]   It's a great chase or there's a chase scene in that movie where they're driving supercars
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.360]   on the streets of Rome or something.
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:00.520]   And even that's like very slow and very boring.
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:02.440]   I'm always bored by car chases.
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:05.280]   I think you could do car chases badly.
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:06.560]   They feel so obligatory.
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:07.560]   Yeah.
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:10.800]   The only good one that I remember at all was the one where they had all the all the mini
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:11.800]   coopers.
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:14.760]   Was it the Italian job or the Italian job remake?
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:15.760]   Yeah.
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:16.760]   It was the Italian job.
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:17.760]   That was common.
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:18.760]   Yeah.
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:21.480]   The born Supremacy's car chase, the one with the taxi.
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:22.480]   And the motorcycle.
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:23.480]   Yeah.
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:24.480]   Yeah.
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:25.480]   Yeah.
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:26.480]   Well, there is the taxi versus the SUV.
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:27.480]   But yeah, that's also.
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:28.480]   I don't remember that one.
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:29.720]   Listen to my film podcast for that.
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:30.720]   Oh, that's right.
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.040]   No wonder we're talking about this.
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:33.040]   You do a film podcast.
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:34.040]   That's what I do.
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:35.040]   Yeah.
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:36.040]   Slash film.com.
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:37.680]   That's what you do.
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:38.680]   As a side side.
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:40.080]   Are you giving up in gadget?
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:41.080]   Oh, okay.
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:42.080]   I have many.
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:43.080]   I have my fingers and many pies.
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:44.080]   Yeah.
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:47.120]   Well, what Jennifer does is cover finance at market watch and tech.
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:48.120]   You're the tech reporter.
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:51.400]   But I imagine you have some thoughts about this.
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:58.360]   Mark Andreessen, who was, I didn't know this, but an early investor in Facebook, is selling
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.360]   70% of his stock.
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:01.360]   Was that?
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:04.520]   Yeah, sold it over the last two weeks.
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:07.320]   I know he's been unloading his shares.
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:10.200]   You know, no one could say why he's doing it.
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.800]   Facebook's up 30% this year.
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:14.720]   So maybe it's a little bit of profit-taking.
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:19.080]   You don't think it's a lack of confidence in Facebook?
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.640]   People are going to say it's a lack of confidence.
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:25.200]   And either way, if you're pulling that much of your money out of Facebook, one of, and
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:29.560]   you're an early investor and he sits on the board also, I believe, then yeah, that's
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:31.080]   going to raise some eyebrows.
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:36.920]   But it's also Facebook that hasn't really shown many indications of trouble ahead.
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:39.920]   So it's, you know, it's an interesting situation.
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:45.240]   And you could say some of it is profit-taking, but it does, for a lot of people, kind of
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:49.040]   raise some questions as to why he would be doing that right now.
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:51.240]   How much else have I got to return money to investors, right?
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:52.600]   He's got a fund.
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:53.600]   And so they have a little presence.
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.600]   Oh, was it a fund stock or was it his personal stock?
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:57.240]   Oh, I don't know which one it was.
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:59.080]   But in any case, he reinvests.
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:03.880]   So to me, the more interesting question is, where will Mark Andreessen put $160 million
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:05.440]   next?
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:06.440]   That's what's far more interesting.
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:11.240]   Yeah, he did well in it, and at some point, you turn the money around.
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:12.760]   Yeah, that's what he's doing.
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:15.840]   Yeah, the stock is doing better now than anyone could have possibly.
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:20.400]   I wrote a story earlier this week about how, you know, all of the haters now are telling
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:24.160]   us, talking about how great Facebook is, because remember when it went public, it had
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:27.920]   that botched IPO and people were really kind of questioning.
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:31.640]   There were some analysts that were saying, "Oh, we don't know about this stock."
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:33.880]   And here we are two years later.
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:35.640]   And it's doing so well.
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:36.720]   It's hitting all the time has.
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:41.880]   It's one of the most valuable companies in the US right up there, not too far behind
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:43.720]   Google and Apple.
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:48.960]   So I think, you know, why not go out when you're on top and, yeah, reinvest that money
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:51.480]   in somewhere else that may need it.
[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:54.320]   Yeah, I know Facebook's doing well.
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:57.560]   I don't allow myself to buy tech stocks, but my wife does.
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:00.800]   And she's continually rubbing it in my face.
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:05.800]   How well her Facebook stock is doing.
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:09.840]   Maybe Mark and Driesen are just going to reinvest in Twitter or something, because boy is he
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:10.840]   a great Twitterer.
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:12.840]   He loves those tweet storms.
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:13.840]   He loves Twitter.
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:18.360]   Twitter and Powerscopes all over it.
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:20.120]   I don't understand tweet storms.
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:24.240]   I think surely you could write a Medium post.
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:25.920]   It seems like such a bad way.
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:26.920]   It's not the same.
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:29.600]   I think Twitter is very different.
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:35.800]   I think they're going to be doing something to allow these kinds of posts to exist on Twitter.
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:38.520]   I think they need to.
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:42.200]   I keep and reason is as a column on tweet deck.
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:43.200]   Oh, how funny.
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:46.000]   It's the only way to keep it with him.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.800]   I was at the four square conference, not that four square, but the other four square
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:52.280]   conference in New York, which is on the record.
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:55.520]   But a certain entrepreneur asked how he keeps up on things.
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:57.920]   He said, I just watched Mark and Driesen's Twitter feed.
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:00.160]   That's why I keep up on everything.
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:05.720]   You don't think that the constraint of 140 characters lends itself to misunderstanding
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:06.720]   and.
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:08.320]   Oh, for sure.
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:09.320]   You know, statements.
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:10.320]   Sure.
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:11.320]   What does that?
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:12.320]   That's why they tweet storm.
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:13.400]   That's why they tweet storm.
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:14.760]   It's intentionally cryptic.
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:15.760]   Right?
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:22.880]   I think it's been around long enough where you understand how to navigate the word limit.
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:27.360]   And yeah, then you have people doing the multiple tweets in or out to tell a story.
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:30.960]   But I think a lot of people actually are pretty good at being concise nowadays.
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:32.840]   Well, he numbers him.
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:33.840]   Doesn't he?
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:34.840]   Yeah.
[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:37.000]   When he has the tweet storms, he'll have number one or two.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   So maybe 15.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000]   Right.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000]   A blog post.
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.280]   What is I don't I think that's just I don't get it.
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:46.160]   I think it's a way to call people detention because then you're getting immediate feedback
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:49.600]   to every, you know, the next tweet in your series or something.
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:53.600]   What's interesting about interesting is that he doesn't just like shout to the boy that
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:58.520]   he is interacting with people he replies to people and not just, you know, starred,
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:00.400]   you know, popular people on Twitter or something.
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:01.520]   Well, but that's okay.
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:05.200]   So that's exactly what Twitter is for and good for.
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:13.960]   It seems to me writing a long screed on Twitter numbered tweets is crazy.
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:16.240]   Crazy.
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:19.840]   And now I'm sorry search for tweets terms and a finding articles on how to create and deliver
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.840]   tweet storms the easy way.
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.840]   I got vault.
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:24.840]   Not what we want.
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:30.440]   No, but I think, you know, it speaks to the specificity of the ecosystem of Twitter.
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:38.240]   I think there there hasn't been a social network that is about immediate interaction in the
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:43.200]   way that Twitter is obviously Google plus is not as successful as Google would have wanted
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:44.200]   it to be.
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:49.160]   And Facebook has sort of returned a little bit to their more, you know, intimate chat
[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:55.800]   with your circle of people, origins after having tried to make everyone public and,
[01:19:55.800 --> 01:20:00.680]   you know, sharing things publicly to sort of and chase Twitter.
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:05.640]   But it didn't really work out and now Twitter is left alone in that sphere of very public
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:08.760]   interaction with people you don't actually know.
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:14.240]   And there's nothing else that does that Dave Weiner is apparently I didn't realize this
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:15.720]   written an app.
[01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:19.000]   Oh, I'm not authorized to use it.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000]   What the hell?
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.720]   Leo, the port is not authorized to use it.
[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:24.720]   What did you do?
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:32.560]   Dave has written an app called Little Pork Chop that you design for making tweet storms.
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:38.000]   But apparently I'm on the do not tweet list.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000]   That is weird.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.400]   Dave, if you try to use it, Leo, why do you think who is it?
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:44.400]   Too many followers.
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:46.200]   Yeah, who's maybe that's it.
[01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:47.200]   Maybe that's it.
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:49.800]   Maybe there's a limit to the number of followers you can have.
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:50.800]   Yeah.
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:54.240]   But the thing about like tweet storming versus like writing a blog post or something, you
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:55.360]   know, you could do it from anywhere.
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:21:00.560]   Like, I don't know how Andreessen tweets so much and where he does it, but you can tweet
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:01.560]   anywhere.
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:02.560]   You could tweet on the toilet.
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:06.000]   In the can, of course, that's exactly it.
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.000]   Yeah.
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.160]   Update, not Patrick is not authorized to use the app either.
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:12.480]   Oh, it's not just you, Leo.
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:14.280]   Well, who is?
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:19.800]   I wonder what's going on there.
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:21.040]   So all right, here it is.
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:22.600]   This is ridiculous.
[01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:24.600]   The world's largest iPad.
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:26.000]   We'll talk about it.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:31.600]   And Tim Cook's desire to basically get you all to stop using computers and start using
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:33.640]   iPads, please.
[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:37.440]   The end of the PC era or just ridiculous.
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:39.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:42.800]   But first a word from carbonite.
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:46.760]   You never know when disaster will strike at work or at home.
[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:50.320]   I had a call on the radio show today.
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:55.880]   A guy was in his house, but he had a visitor who'd left and didn't close the door behind
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:56.880]   him.
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:59.120]   So a homeless couple came in and stole his laptop.
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:00.800]   He didn't even see him do it.
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.760]   I guess he found out later, a homeless couple.
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:06.240]   And he said, Hey, can they do anything with my laptop?
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:09.120]   And I said, well, I just hope you have it backed up.
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:13.400]   With carbonite, see weird stuff happens.
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:18.800]   Hard drives die, fires, flood, homeless people steal your stuff.
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:22.320]   And then, especially if you're in business, you might be out of business.
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:28.240]   If your accounts receivable and your client list and your, your, your, your, your suppliers
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:30.720]   lists are all there on your hard drives and you lose that data.
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:33.160]   But it'd be hard to get that back.
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:35.000]   Now you may be saying, well, that's not a problem.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.960]   I have Joe and accounting go down every week with a external hard drive.
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:40.000]   He backs the whole thing up.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000]   We put it in a closet.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000]   Yeah.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.720]   See, that's not it.
[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:48.120]   What if there's a fire, then you lose everything, including the backup in the closet.
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:50.920]   Carbonite's great cause it takes your data all the time.
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:55.200]   Whenever you're online, it's continuously backing it up to the cloud encrypted channel,
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:57.160]   encrypted at rest.
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:58.160]   It's there.
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:01.680]   It's in the carbonite data center air conditioned.
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:03.440]   Your data is relaxing.
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:07.280]   It's enjoying a vacation, but the minute you need it, boom, you get it back.
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:10.440]   You can log on to your carbon and account on any computer.
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:13.440]   They have free apps for the iOS and Android.
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:14.640]   You get your stuff.
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:15.640]   You can see if it's there.
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:17.720]   You can even email it to somebody else.
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:18.920]   Prepare for the unexpected.
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:22.400]   Protect your data with secure automatic.
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:23.400]   That's really important.
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:25.240]   Cloud backup from carbonite.
[01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:29.280]   No wonder a million and a half homes and small businesses trust carbonite to backup their
[01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:32.960]   computers and their servers and keep them in business.
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:34.480]   It's like fire insurance.
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:36.320]   You can't buy it after you have a fire.
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:38.040]   You got to do it now.
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:41.280]   While you're listening to the show, go to carbonite.com.
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:42.280]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:43.280]   You'll get two free bonus months.

[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:54.480]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:57.600]   Did any of you get a iPad Pro?
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:59.360]   Did you rush to the store?
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:00.360]   No.
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:01.360]   I played about it.
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:03.360]   I had a Pixel C.
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:10.160]   I want the Pixel C. But I got the iPad Pro because they put it on, Apple put it on sale
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:12.720]   Wednesday and they said, "You know, you could pick it up at the store."
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:13.720]   I said, "Oh, I'll take it."
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:15.920]   Nobody else is running to get it in line for it.
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:19.720]   Apparently, there wasn't a long line.
[01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:20.720]   This thing is mad.
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:21.680]   It's like a tea tray.
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:25.320]   You could actually serve drinks on it.
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:31.120]   And then the weird thing is Apple's pencil was not available until next month.
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:36.720]   So it seems the whole thing about the iPad Pro, which is drawing on it, is kind of something
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:38.480]   we're just going to have to wait for.
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:39.480]   I know.
[01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:40.480]   That seems very odd.
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:45.040]   I feel like you need the keyboard and the Apple pencil for it to be a whole package.
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:46.520]   Well, I got -- okay.
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:50.440]   So I bought -- call me crazy.
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:53.600]   But I bought -- this is a keyboard and cover.
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:55.400]   Apple was selling this at the store from Logitech.
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:56.640]   It's called the Create.
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:00.640]   Apple's own keyboard is 170 bucks.
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:02.800]   And it doesn't have any dedicated iPad keys.
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:07.960]   This keyboard case was 20 bucks cheaper and it has a home key, a search key.
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:09.600]   Oh, well, then it's a bargain-ly.
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:12.760]   It's a bargain and only 150 bucks.
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:13.760]   And they --
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:14.760]   People also look a lot better, too.
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:15.760]   Yeah.
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:16.760]   Well, you know what?
[01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:17.760]   Look at this.
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:22.600]   This thing is -- it's heavier than a MacBook, like a lot, thicker than a MacBook.
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:26.400]   I don't know why you would use this instead of any laptop, frankly.
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:31.480]   I mean, I guess because of the touch, right, and Apple steadfastly refuses to put touch
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:33.560]   on its OS X stuff.
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:34.720]   So that's the big difference.
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:37.160]   You got touch and you got a fingerprint reader, which is --
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:38.560]   What's the battery life like?
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:40.280]   Oh, it's basically permanent.
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:41.800]   It's a forever battery life.
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:43.920]   It's -- the thing is so huge.
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:49.440]   But now, Devindra, I think you gadget said that despite Apple calling the A9X, the processor
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:53.280]   in here, a desktop class, you guys said it's not.
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:56.880]   Yeah, as far as I could tell, I actually haven't read that piece yet.
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:58.080]   Oh, well, I did.
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:59.560]   It's from our UK folks.
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:00.560]   Oh, okay.
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:04.160]   Yeah, but it's just from what we've seen and what I've been reading, you know, all
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.600]   around the web, it's nothing too special.
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:10.680]   And there are some benchmarks that have been comparing it to things like current Intel
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:11.840]   chips or something.
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:12.840]   Right.
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:16.160]   But they're not like Apple -- it's sort of like an Apple's and Orange's comparison,
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:19.720]   because they're comparing, you know, mobile code versus desktop code, and it's very different.
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:20.720]   Yeah.
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:21.920]   I mean, this is an ARM processor.
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:28.240]   Apple, it's very aspirational for them to say, "Oh, that's the post-PC future, and now
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:32.440]   you can -- who needs a PC because you've got this?"
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:33.800]   I like touch.
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:36.840]   I really like my Surface Book because I can use a pan.
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:39.840]   I can touch, but I can also use it as a real laptop.
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:43.000]   It's a great -- I have to say, and Patrick, you'll appreciate this.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:47.480]   It's a great gaming platform, except that so far, nobody's designed games to take advantage
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:50.040]   of the real estate, so all you get is a blown up game.
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:53.480]   But I think, you know, for Goats Simulator, this is awesome.
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:55.720]   Well, is it worth it?
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:56.720]   Yeah.
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:57.720]   It's definitely --
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:26:58.720]   Yeah.
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:26:59.720]   It's definitely a goat.
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:00.720]   I think they're way less after this.
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:01.720]   Yeah.
[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:02.720]   Yeah.
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:06.760]   I think the great gaming platform, great gaming platform, you're playing a little bit fast
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:09.240]   in loose with that term there, Leo.
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:12.520]   Well, it's a pretty screen.
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:14.320]   You can't deny that.
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:15.320]   Touch is not --
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:16.320]   Yeah, you know it's --
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:17.320]   Oh, it's great.
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:18.320]   I mean, you want to play Clash of Clans?
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:19.320]   Come on.
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:22.920]   I thought we were talking about actual games.
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:24.720]   I'm sorry, I missed it.
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:25.800]   Oh, I did this.
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:29.200]   I got in trouble for saying Clash of Clans wasn't a real game.
[01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:30.200]   No, I know.
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:31.800]   It's actually a pretty fun game.
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:33.040]   I've played it for a few months.
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:34.600]   You don't work at Blizzard anymore, do you?
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:35.600]   Did you leave?
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:36.600]   Yeah.
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:40.040]   I actually left about a year ago to become a podcaster.
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:41.040]   Oh, a year ago.
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:42.040]   Okay, never mind.
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:43.040]   Yeah.
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:45.040]   But Patrick comes from a gaming background, so that's all.
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:46.040]   Yeah.
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:47.040]   Bring it up for that reason.
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:52.480]   Yeah, of course, I've worked at Blizzard for five years and I'm a big gaming fan.
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:54.120]   But the sound is good.
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:55.520]   The sound is good, though.
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:56.520]   It's got four speakers.
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:59.120]   It's very nice, rich sound.
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:00.160]   I can't really see.
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:03.520]   This was $1,000 minus the keyboard.
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:04.520]   Ish.
[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:05.520]   Ish.
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:11.600]   It's -- you know, I think a lot of people in our circles are looking at this and sort
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:17.960]   of bewildered by basically the target for it, including me.
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:20.080]   Honestly, I'm not sure who it is for.
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:23.440]   But I think you were talking about aspirations.
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:29.040]   I think these devices and that includes the Pixel C are very different from the Surface
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:39.920]   Pro because they're trying to bring the strengths of a mobile OS, of iOS to a more work-like
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:40.920]   environment.
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:49.320]   The strengths are simplicity and ease of use and things that aren't as obvious for -- you
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:52.120]   know, that don't really exist as much in a desktop OS.
[01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:57.120]   And that's why I don't think they will ever merge iOS and Mac OS.
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:58.840]   These are two different approaches.
[01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:10.280]   The game is to try and make iOS capable enough that it will be able to accomplish a lot of
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:17.520]   work tasks without making it as complex as a classic desktop OS.
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:19.200]   And that's the ultimate goal.
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:23.880]   If they manage to do it, I think there might be a lot of people who are interested in getting
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:29.560]   an iOS device, a big iPad Pro, for example, so they don't have to worry about managing
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:30.960]   a full desktop OS.
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:36.000]   I'm not sure the current iPad Pro and iOS 9 aren't quite there yet, though.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.600]   This feels almost like a prototype of an idea, right?
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:41.480]   Like the iPhone 6C.
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:46.360]   Let's get another iPhone out there that's plastic and maybe a little cheaper to make
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:49.280]   and maybe market it to some folks and see if anybody bites.
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:50.800]   Nobody really bid on that.
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:52.960]   This feels similar in a way.
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:57.160]   But yeah, the idea of tablets ultimately becoming more productive, which by the way,
[01:29:57.160 --> 01:29:59.600]   something Microsoft has been touting for a long time.
[01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:03.080]   I actually really like the new Surface Pro 4 and the Surface Book.
[01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:04.800]   I love my Surface Book.
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:05.800]   It's so good.
[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:10.720]   It makes me feel like I wish Apple would just do a MacBook with touch because I think that's
[01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:11.720]   perfect.
[01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:12.720]   Yeah.
[01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:14.560]   But I think this is Apple so far down.
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:16.200]   Yeah, they're just in too deep, right?
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:18.240]   iOS has been all their touch innovation.
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:24.360]   OSX, honestly, as great as it is, I use it on my work computer, it still looks basically
[01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:27.400]   the same as it did when it came out in 2001.
[01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:30.520]   Like they're like really dedicated to this desktop interface.
[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:35.320]   I'm wondering if like we'll even ever see another full fledged desktop OS.
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:37.720]   It doesn't look like anything from OSX or Apple.
[01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:43.680]   Or is the goal to just push iOS to eventually be that thing and keep this OSX design as
[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:47.680]   their main desktop interface going forward?
[01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:54.480]   I think imagine if iOS was pushed enough, as I was saying, that it could do everything
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:57.160]   you need because I'm guessing you can do everything you need.
[01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:58.160]   Except for it to be passed.
[01:30:58.160 --> 01:30:59.600]   There's no file system.
[01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:00.600]   There's no...
[01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:01.600]   Exactly.
[01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:04.520]   Well, I mean with the cloud, there is kind of a simile.
[01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:07.880]   It's better now than iCloud was three years ago.
[01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:09.400]   And I didn't see this what we did.
[01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:10.560]   I'm doing the split screen.
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:15.840]   So it has a very primitive form of windowing, tiling.
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:22.240]   So if it could do everything you could, while retaining a lot of the simplicity of iOS,
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:29.000]   couldn't you imagine using this rather than a full fledged desktop OS, which is complicated
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.280]   to manage and to update and tear?
[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:32.280]   For my mom.
[01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:34.280]   She didn't say that's sexist.
[01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:36.480]   For my dad.
[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:38.120]   For people whose needs are few.
[01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:39.120]   Now it's age-ish.
[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:40.040]   Now it's age-ish.
[01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:44.120]   For my four-year-old, I don't know.
[01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:45.120]   It's still age-ish.
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:46.120]   But yeah.
[01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:48.400]   Either way though, it's not there yet.
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:49.400]   It's not there yet.
[01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:53.200]   So Jennifer, you don't look at this and go, "Oh, gotta get one."
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:54.200]   No.
[01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:55.200]   Not yet.
[01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:58.680]   Well, I think part of the...
[01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:02.320]   I believe you can't have more than one of the same app open.
[01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:06.760]   So I feel like that could be annoying.
[01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:12.040]   And also I will say though that WSA has joined us during review day and she said she was
[01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:17.120]   able to export video faster on the Pro than she was on a MacBook.
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:21.160]   But for the most part though, I still think you're more efficient.
[01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:28.040]   At least I feel like I would be more efficient having a full laptop rather than how that
[01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:30.120]   set up with the mobile operating system.
[01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:31.120]   Yeah.
[01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:35.800]   See, so I have Word open over here and I now can't go back to Word over here.
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:36.800]   So I think you're right.
[01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:39.600]   You can only have one instance of any program.
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:40.600]   This is...
[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:42.600]   Jennifer, they'll work on that.
[01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:47.840]   But Jeff, you know, I mean, I feel like there's a certain masochistic thing where I see people
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:52.320]   like Christina Warren and Joanna saying, "I'm gonna use this as my only computer for
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:55.400]   a while and yeah, of course you could do that."
[01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:56.800]   But it's a little masochistic.
[01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:59.400]   It's like, "Yeah, but it's gonna be a little bit of a struggle.
[01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:01.160]   Why not just use a laptop?"
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:03.440]   But you're doing that with a Chromebook, Jeff, and you're very happy.
[01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:06.920]   Well, that's a real laptop and it has a real file structure and I can get to documents
[01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:07.920]   and I can use it offline.
[01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:08.920]   Yeah.
[01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:12.440]   And I can open multiple things in it and it's just, you know, the browser works well.
[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:16.480]   Yeah, I mean, I'm gonna try the Pixel C but I'm kind of dreading that.
[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:17.480]   I just...
[01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:25.120]   Finally, I didn't want to take my new Pixel 6P to Africa with me in case I've, you know,
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:26.120]   dropped it in the mirror.
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:27.120]   Yeah.
[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:28.120]   Next, I'm sorry.
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:32.360]   So I just got it going this weekend and then trying to find where the heck the screenshot
[01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:33.640]   goes and this and that.
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:35.640]   It's a pain on mobile app OS.
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:36.640]   It is.
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:37.640]   It is.
[01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:38.800]   It's so much a desktop.
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:39.800]   I don't think...
[01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:44.880]   While I've said many times we are in a post-PC era, I want to revise that.
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:47.160]   Not everybody, not all of us are.
[01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:49.120]   I really like having a computer.
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:50.120]   Yeah.
[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:52.720]   We're in a transition phase right now and all these companies are trying to figure it
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:53.720]   out.
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:56.080]   But yeah, I guess it'll be interesting to see.
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:57.920]   I really like the Surface Pro 4.
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:00.760]   Like I liked the Surface Pro 3 but they had some issues.
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:02.400]   Pro 4 is just like...
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:06.600]   It's incredible like what Microsoft packed into something that's under two pounds.
[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:10.040]   I only hope like eventually they can figure out the pricing and get the keyboard in that
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:12.480]   Surface pricing because right now it's still kind of...
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:14.520]   It feels like a rip-off in a way.
[01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:20.040]   I love Woz, Steve Wozniak who never wants to say anything bad about anybody or anything.
[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:24.080]   They asked him at the New Relic conference what he thinks of the iPad Pro.
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:28.000]   He just said, "I'm more of a laptop-based guy."
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:33.520]   But you know, I think that's the case for all of us.
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:35.160]   And you said I love my computer.
[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:37.160]   I love my Facebook.
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:38.160]   We do.
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:41.360]   I would never give up my PC for anything in the world.
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:43.080]   Most people hate computers.
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:44.080]   They're foreign.
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:45.240]   They don't know how to use them.
[01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:49.800]   They're confused when there's an update that comes up and then Windows gets updates...
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:53.440]   They're updated to Windows 10 when they didn't ask it to do that.
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:58.360]   It's very complicated to use, but they love their phone because it's simple.
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:34:59.360]   They don't have to worry about it.
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:07.080]   And having just come from time in two countries in Africa and to Latin America, it just really,
[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:09.000]   really hits you how much mobile is it.
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.520]   And they suffer because it's 3G and it's slow.
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:16.040]   You look at things like Google AMP and instant articles will speed things up.
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:17.960]   But the phone is that future.
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:21.200]   You go to Google, the last two years at Google, I tried to complain about things that weren't
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:22.200]   in the web.
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:23.200]   They said, "Web?
[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:24.200]   Web?
[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:26.080]   What are we bothering with that?"
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:27.080]   The future is mobile.
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:32.880]   And I think perhaps we in the US are just kind of hanging on to an anachronistic past
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:33.880]   of the PC.
[01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:39.120]   I also think it depends what you use it for because I mean, if you do a lot of work on
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:43.880]   your PC and I do a lot of writing, obviously, and research and I like to have multiple things
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:47.800]   open, even multiple screens if possible.
[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:50.320]   And that's just easier on a desktop right now.
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:55.120]   And I definitely understand the need to have a mobile experience.
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:36:01.360]   And even when I go to events, I bring my laptop, but it can be cumbersome and just takes longer
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:05.080]   to boot and there's various or eats battery.
[01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:07.040]   But right now, you're right.
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:10.760]   Maybe I am holding on to it, but I do find it more efficient.
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:13.080]   It's great for trucks.
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:15.160]   It's full out shelter.
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:16.160]   Yeah.
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:18.080]   And it really makes it shine.
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:25.920]   But one great Steve said a while ago, he sees them as the PCs as trucks.
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:26.920]   They're not going away.
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:28.280]   And I don't know if it's going to happen.
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:29.280]   I'm joking, obviously.
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:35.400]   But that's, I think, what we're kind of saying here, we all, all of us here and people who
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:42.480]   actually need those more heavy-duty devices are going to stay on full desktop OSs, but
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:44.280]   maybe not everyone needs them.
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:47.200]   There are some specialized uses.
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:53.000]   By Lisa wants to use this as a second screen, which an iPad does quite well on a Macintosh.
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.640]   And this is big enough.
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:58.400]   You actually would make sense as a second screen, 12.9 inches.
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:00.000]   And it's a good screen.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.520]   I mean, they've, I just also feel like, though, Apple didn't do a whole lot to accommodate
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:05.520]   this larger screen.
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:08.680]   These icons, look how spaced out they are.
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:15.560]   It feels like it's just a blown up user interface that not really taking great advantage of it.
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:16.560]   Yeah.
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:18.160]   It feels really rushed, honestly.
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:22.760]   Like Apple didn't sit down and make the software changes that would really make advice like
[01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:24.760]   this shine.
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:29.120]   Speaking of this whole crossover between desktop and mobile, I'm really interested in seeing
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:34.520]   how Microsoft's Windows 10 phones handle that continuing feature, which lets you plug in
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:37.080]   the phone to monitor and use as a full desktop.
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:38.080]   That could be a big thing.
[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:44.160]   Because yeah, I think single phone could be a lot more useful to people than a giant freaking
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:45.160]   tablet.
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:53.320]   I disagree with you, though, DaVinja, that Apple brushed the interface.
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:58.760]   I think everything that we've seen in split view and slide over and all of this was done
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:01.160]   for this device.
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:05.560]   It's been integrated in the previous devices, so we sort of know them already.
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:07.080]   But I think everything was done for this.
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:13.520]   And the apps you've blown out and not making use of the real estate, that's exactly how
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:15.720]   I felt about the first iPad.
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:16.800]   And I kind of got used to it.
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:22.320]   I thought the icons for the apps were very small.
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:23.800]   Yeah.
[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:25.360]   I think we'll get used to that.
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:33.280]   The simplicity in this case might be a feature that is willfully designed.
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:34.440]   It might evolve as well.
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:39.360]   I don't see this thing selling well by any kind of user, to be honest.
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:42.160]   I think I just sold it to a bunch of classic planees.
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:45.880]   So you're over here playing games.
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:51.400]   And I just don't think that gamers, a lot of gamers, are going to go out of their way
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:53.640]   to spend all this money on the pro.
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:59.960]   I feel like Apple at least was thinking that it would be, you know, for more creative people
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:04.720]   that will take advantage of the stylists or, you know, other many people in the enterprise
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:05.720]   or whatever.
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:11.200]   But I just wonder gamers, the people playing those games are going to spring for the most
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:16.040]   expensive iPad on the market just for games.
[01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:18.040]   I am.
[01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:19.040]   I'm sorry.
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:23.600]   I should stop because I'm not paying any attention.
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:28.000]   Perhaps the price you can get the other, you know, the normal full-sized iPad with a keyboard
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:29.000]   thing.
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:35.320]   I tried them both side by side and it doesn't feel like a big enough difference on the gaming
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:36.320]   game.
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:37.320]   No force does.
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:38.320]   It just keeps things up in mind.
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:41.280]   And do you think it's a gaff, a blunder that they didn't have the pencil ready at the same
[01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:43.000]   time as they had the tablet ready?
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000]   Yeah.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.000]   That's surprising to me.
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:52.800]   It's the first time I think that we've seen Team Cook, which is a master wizard at supply
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:58.080]   chain, sort of not managed to get things out at the same time.
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:00.840]   I don't think it's ever happened before.
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:02.800]   But, you know, it's a few weeks.
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:05.240]   I wonder, you got to wonder if something happened.
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:09.440]   Something went wrong and they said, oh crap, the head, you know, the top falls off or something
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:11.040]   and we got to go back to the drawing board.
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:15.240]   Yeah, because you would have thought they would have made an amount enough to worship
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:18.080]   with how many iPads they thought they were going to sell.
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:19.080]   Yeah.
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:20.080]   It's weird.
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:24.680]   And the difference between this one and which is great, a big deal in productivity between
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:30.120]   this one and the iPad Air 2, which is the only other one that can do the split view
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:31.120]   currently.
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:37.600]   So two apps side by side is that the screen real estate isn't big enough for the iPad Air
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:42.160]   2 to have iPad mode apps side by side.
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:48.040]   What I mean by iPad mode is that, for example, on the, let's take the example of the mail
[01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:56.880]   app, you'll have the list of emails and in a column on the left and then your email that
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:00.960]   you have selected to read on the right of that screen.
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:06.520]   And if you switch that to side by side mode, if you do half and half, you're going to be
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:12.400]   in iPhone mode, which means you can either have the list of emails or the email you have
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:18.400]   selected and the iPad Pro can run two full iPad mode apps at the same time.
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:24.160]   So that what it actually means is that on the iPad Air 2, you can't really use it for
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:25.160]   productivity.
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:32.200]   That split mode robs you of the big attractive feature of the UI.
[01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:33.200]   Yeah.
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:34.200]   Yeah.
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:35.200]   Yeah.
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:38.240]   So if you want touch, get a surface.
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:39.240]   Seriously.
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:40.240]   I like touch.
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:43.240]   Or get a pixel, get a Chromebook pixel.
[01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:45.680]   Jeff, did you, did you say you're going to buy a pixel?
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:46.680]   Yeah.
[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:50.240]   If it ever goes on sale, it's supposed to be ready before Christmas.
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:52.880]   They said, yeah, we're getting pretty tight here, folks.
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:53.880]   Yeah.
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:54.880]   I'm wondering.
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:55.880]   I'm wondering.
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:56.880]   I'm going to keep either.
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:57.880]   Is it, do we know what the price is?
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:41:59.520]   Oh, yeah, they said, I think.
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:04.680]   Do you know, Jason Howler, host of all about Android is just a lot.
[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:05.680]   Yeah.
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:06.840]   I'm loving it.
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:12.600]   I feel like the Pixel C is maybe the first look we're going to get at what could be Android
[01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:14.400]   meets Chrome OS.
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:18.600]   It's a stencil be an Android device, but it also, when you look at it, it looks a lot
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:22.760]   like a surface or an iPad with the keyboard case.
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:24.920]   The Pixel C, by the way, is $4.99 for the 30.
[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:25.920]   Oh, that's not bad.
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:26.920]   That's not expensive.
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:27.920]   Not bad.
[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:28.920]   Another $150 for the keyboard, so.
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:29.920]   Oh, that's expensive.
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:30.920]   That's a microsoft.
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:33.360]   That's a still cheaper than another two, though.
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:34.360]   Yeah.
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:35.360]   Yeah.
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:36.360]   Definitely.
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:37.360]   That's an interesting thing, right?
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:38.360]   Yeah.
[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:41.200]   But we're also seeing like, the surface.
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:44.360]   Isn't the surface, the first price is 500 bucks, I think.
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:46.280]   Yeah, I think this is now the.
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:48.720]   The plane, the, yes, the lower end surface.
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:49.720]   Yeah.
[01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:50.720]   Not the answer.
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:51.720]   Yeah, but that's true.
[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:52.720]   And I'm talking about the most recent.
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:56.440]   Microsoft is not trying to make the surface an affordable, particularly affordable, because
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:43:01.280]   I think they don't want to get in the way of their lower end OEMs, right?
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:04.240]   They're making a premium device.
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:05.240]   That's not good.
[01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:06.240]   Yeah.
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:11.240]   So, a lot of Microsoft reps about, you know, what is the deal with the surface keyboard
[01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:12.240]   pricing?
[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:15.200]   Because it seems, you know, when you get to the point where the Surface Pro 4 is 899,
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:17.680]   you have to spend another 130 for the keyboard.
[01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:21.360]   A student, somebody who's been saving up for the surface might not realize that.
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:23.680]   It feels a little disingenuous.
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:27.040]   What's interesting is that the surface competitor is coming out from Lenovo.
[01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:31.120]   I think HP and Dell as well, like they're going to be including their keyboards, you
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:34.080]   know, at prices cheaper or the same as the Surface Pro.
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:35.960]   So, again, now it's getting a little weird.
[01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:40.160]   Yeah, Microsoft's getting careful to, you know, not step on their dance partners toes
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:41.160]   too much.
[01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:46.920]   So, let's keep it at arm's length.
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:47.920]   Let's take a break.
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:53.160]   When we come back, I want to talk about what at first everybody was all excited that T-Mobile's
[01:43:53.160 --> 01:44:01.480]   offering free streaming, binging on video, and then T-C Sotek writing in the Verge took
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:04.400]   all the wind out of my sales.
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:11.480]   B-Mobile, he writes, is writing the manual on how to F up the Internet.
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:12.480]   Is it an editorial problem?
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:13.840]   We'll talk in just a sec.
[01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:15.640]   But first a word from our friends at Citrix.
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:19.320]   And Citrix go to meeting.
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:25.720]   It is so true nowadays that people are businesses, companies are distributed all over the place.
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:31.520]   You know, we're doing app design with people in India and Canada.
[01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:34.120]   We're doing web design with people in Austin.
[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:38.480]   And it's really important when you're doing that that you're able to have these meetings.
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:43.080]   This is where you get together, resolve problems, you have a rule, no more than three emails
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:44.080]   back and forth.
[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:46.720]   But then if then you got to have a meeting, then you got to talk.
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:50.480]   It's a way to cut through the Gordian knot and get stuff done.
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:51.720]   It's also a great way to brainstorm.
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:53.200]   A great way to meet people.
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:55.440]   And they might say, well, you can't meet people and go to a meeting.
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:57.120]   Yes, you can.
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:02.120]   Because go to meeting not only shares screens, but it also shares video, HD quality webcam
[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:05.520]   video that makes it really feel like you're in the same room.
[01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:10.080]   It really is an experience of being together.
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:15.160]   And you can do it from any computer tablet, smartphone, no travel, no traffic.
[01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:16.160]   You get things done.
[01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:17.160]   You're fast.
[01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:18.160]   You're efficient.
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:19.160]   Go to meetings.
[01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:20.160]   Awesome.
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:23.440]   And the nice thing is you can get it going before I'm done talking.
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:24.560]   Try it free for 30 days.
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:27.400]   Go to the website, go to meeting.com.
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:29.400]   Click the try it free button.
[01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:34.080]   Honestly, you can have your first meeting up and running in minutes.
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:35.080]   It's just that great.
[01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:38.720]   And by the way, not hard for your clients to use either.
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:39.720]   And that's important.
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:42.000]   You don't want to, if you're doing a sales presentation, you don't want to make your
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:43.680]   client jump through hoops.
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:45.080]   They get an invite in the email.
[01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:46.080]   They click that.
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:47.640]   The software downloads instantly.
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:48.640]   Boom.
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:49.640]   You're seeing them.
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:50.640]   They're seeing you.
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:51.640]   You're on the same page.
[01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:52.640]   They're seeing your PowerPoint.
[01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:53.640]   It's great.
[01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:54.640]   Go to meeting.
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:55.640]   Try it free today.
[01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:56.640]   Go to meeting.com.
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:46:09.800]   John Ledger, the CEO of T-Mobile, had another big event, their Uncarrier X event.
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:10.800]   Anybody go down to that?
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:11.800]   Was it in Los Angeles?
[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:13.800]   I was invited.
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:18.000]   But I decided to pass it.
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:21.040]   Actually, I guess I'm glad I did.
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:24.440]   They announced Bingjong.
[01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:30.080]   So T-Mobile for, and I'm a T-Mobile customer, one of my phones on my Nexus.
[01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:32.320]   No, no, that's a Google Phi phone.
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:34.840]   Now I don't remember.
[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:38.280]   You know what's annoying?
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:44.120]   Google Phi uses T-Mobile, but you don't get the benefit of these music stuff and the
[01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:45.440]   Bingjong stuff.
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:47.640]   You do get the international travel benefit, right?
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:48.640]   So I like T-Mobile.
[01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:51.320]   My iPhone's not T-Mobile.
[01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:54.720]   And at first I thought, "Oh, this is great," because, "Well, I've already been using..."
[01:46:54.720 --> 01:47:00.200]   When you listen to Spotify or Google Music or Apple Music on your iPhone, it doesn't
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:02.520]   count against your data cap, right?
[01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:03.920]   You don't have to pay for it.
[01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:10.320]   Now they're doing the same with Netflix, HBO Go, ESPN, Showtime.
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:13.040]   Everybody but YouTube and us.
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:17.160]   And at first I thought, "Oh, that's great."
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:21.280]   But then I thought a little harder and I realized, "Isn't that basically fast-length
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:22.280]   thing?"
[01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:23.280]   Mm-hmm.
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:30.960]   The scheme is called zero rating and it really is a threat to the open internet.
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:35.440]   So this is hard because when you're a consumer you go, "Yeah!"
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:41.960]   But what you forget is that favors and it's making T-Mobile the judge and jury on this,
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:46.680]   favors certain incumbents over the other guys.
[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:53.880]   Now I think what we should do as an experiment is apply, say, as Twit, right?
[01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:55.520]   And say, "We'd like to be part of Bin John."
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:56.520]   Oh, yes.
[01:47:56.520 --> 01:47:59.520]   Because that's how they're getting around it, right?
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:02.560]   By saying that anyone, any streaming could be on it is the other.
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:04.800]   They say anybody can do it.
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:06.000]   If you follow their rules.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:07.000]   If anybody can...
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:08.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:13.080]   If anybody can do it, then why don't they just do it for everyone from the get-go?
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:14.080]   From, you know, from...
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:20.000]   Are you able to send unlimited data plan for $15 more a month now because of this?
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:23.160]   So what are the rules?
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:24.160]   I don't know.
[01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:25.160]   I guess we'll have to apply.
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:28.200]   One of the things I know they do is they down sample it to 720p.
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:29.520]   It's not 1080p.
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:30.960]   So the file sizes are smaller.
[01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:34.240]   T-it's not as high quality.
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:36.680]   Yeah, but 720 is fine, right?
[01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:38.240]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:39.240]   It's not 720p.
[01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:40.800]   It's DVD quality.
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:41.800]   It's 480.
[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:42.800]   Oh!
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:45.480]   What's your phone?
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:46.480]   So...
[01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:47.480]   Maybe.
[01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:48.480]   I'm...
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:49.480]   I'm...
[01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:51.480]   Do I have to pay him?
[01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:57.080]   I should really apply because if it is really neutral and anybody who streams can apply,
[01:48:57.080 --> 01:48:58.720]   I would want to be on that.
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:04.120]   That's the whole net neutrality issue that T-Mobile gets to be the decider on Netflix.
[01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:05.120]   You're okay.
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:06.120]   Twit.
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:07.520]   No, you're not so okay.
[01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:11.760]   And if you're a T-Mobile customer, you're going to watch a lot more Netflix than you're
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:12.760]   going to watch Twit.
[01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:15.480]   It's the antithesis of net neutrality.
[01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:17.840]   All bits are not equal.
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:21.360]   But good luck convincing anybody of that.
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:25.920]   So there's zero rating in some countries is necessary.
[01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:30.120]   You know, it's the whole Facebook's internet order.
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:32.120]   In order, right.
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:33.120]   Right.
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:40.320]   And I think in those cases, there is a heavy debate on whether or not zero rating is okay.
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:44.200]   And if we can make an exception to net neutrality in those cases.
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:50.040]   And I have a much harder time accepting it in the case of T-Mobile.
[01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:56.120]   Well, and listen to one of our chatters, little Bobby Salsa, writes, "The opposition to Ben
[01:49:56.120 --> 01:50:01.480]   John just shows that net neutrality advocates don't actually care about consumers.
[01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:04.240]   They just like criticizing ISPs."
[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:05.240]   And that's the problem.
[01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:10.160]   It's hard to explain to people who are getting free stuff why that's a bad thing.
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:11.160]   It's very easy.
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:16.080]   It's like a free speech argument almost in the sense that you're defending something
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:20.080]   that doesn't sound right at the first but is necessary as a principle.
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:21.080]   Yeah.
[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:23.040]   And everything's going on in universities right now.
[01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:24.680]   Well, that hurts our feelings.
[01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:27.080]   Well, okay, but debate is part of democracy.
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:29.600]   Well, how could you let everybody hurt our feelings?
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:34.160]   Well, because that's that's been in free speech and it becomes a paradoxical argument.
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:35.160]   Yeah.
[01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:36.160]   And the same for this.
[01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:39.840]   It's a paradoxical argument to say that yes, you may not get that Netflix movie for
[01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:43.160]   free, but you're defending a much higher principle.
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:46.640]   Well, and if you want the next Netflix.
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:47.640]   Exactly.
[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:48.640]   Yeah.
[01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:54.320]   It's basically if those kinds of rules had been put in place at a time when video wasn't
[01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:58.040]   common on the web, YouTube would just not have existed.
[01:50:58.040 --> 01:50:59.040]   Right.
[01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:05.000]   At all, and very likely, you know, it lets imagine a world where this is the norm, it's
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:10.000]   very likely that video streaming on the web would have made being made incredibly more
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000]   difficult.
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:17.880]   And we wouldn't have Netflix Netflix today because as we've seen, the ISPs are brought
[01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:24.960]   into this level of consumption that the video streaming requires kicking and streaming,
[01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:30.200]   not streaming, which would be more appropriate kicking and screaming.
[01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:36.160]   And they have done now it's sort of, you know, they've given up kind of, but they really
[01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:38.120]   don't didn't want this to happen.
[01:51:38.120 --> 01:51:43.400]   They've been fighting Netflix and YouTube and everyone else to not upgrade their infrastructure
[01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:47.520]   or to make them pay for those upgrades.
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:52.600]   And I can guarantee you that if that that would have been almost impossible.
[01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:59.640]   And to those students tell them, if you enjoy Netflix, it's probably because the open Internet
[01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:04.840]   and some level of net neutrality has made it possible for an incumbent like Netflix
[01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:05.840]   to exist.
[01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:10.880]   Well, I know they're going to pull up the ladder because they made it.
[01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:14.280]   And it's very, I think it's going to be very hard to, you know, one of the interesting
[01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:16.720]   FCC has rules against this.
[01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:24.720]   It'll be very interesting to see if they see it this way and if they enforce those rules.
[01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:29.120]   And I think this is a little, an interesting, okay, you really want a conspiracy theory,
[01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:35.200]   a very interesting play to put the FCC in a spot.
[01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:36.200]   Yes.
[01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:41.440]   If they enforce this, consumers like little Bobby Salza will say, hey, I want the free
[01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:43.240]   Internet stuff.
[01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:49.200]   You're not looking out for my interests because it's harder to understand the deeper principle
[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:55.080]   and the deeper hazard if you don't enforce net neutrality.
[01:52:55.080 --> 01:52:59.680]   I think we should ask, what's his name again?
[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:01.080]   Damn it.
[01:53:01.080 --> 01:53:06.280]   The newsroom man and Will McAvoy, Aaron Sorkin.
[01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:07.280]   Aaron Sorkin.
[01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:08.280]   Aaron Sorkin.
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:12.880]   The face of Aaron Sorkin, Will McAvoy.
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:13.880]   Yeah.
[01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:14.880]   There you go.
[01:53:14.880 --> 01:53:17.120]   He's his mouthpiece.
[01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:21.640]   You could make him write a beautiful speech about why, you know, it's just like, why to
[01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:29.880]   defend, but to defend the guilty in a court of law so that the innocent can be protected.
[01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:36.240]   That is exactly the kind of argument like working a bad example for the greater good.
[01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:37.240]   That's and I think Aaron Sorkin.
[01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:40.040]   That's one speech Aaron Sorkin will never write.
[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:41.040]   I can promise you.
[01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:42.040]   He hates the Internet.
[01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:48.040]   You know what I think is scary about this also is that a lot not to be, not to subject
[01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:49.040]   people to ageism.
[01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:54.360]   But a lot of younger people grew up with not as open of a web.
[01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:59.720]   And those are the people that are utilizing a lot of these sites, especially YouTube and
[01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:00.680]   Netflix and Hulu.
[01:54:00.680 --> 01:54:03.280]   So that's what they're used to.
[01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:08.320]   Maybe they don't really remember a time when it was as open of an Internet and maybe they
[01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:09.800]   aren't really bothered by it.
[01:54:09.800 --> 01:54:10.800]   Yeah.
[01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:11.800]   Yeah.
[01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:15.680]   But they're basically reaping the rewards right of that past of life now before the broad
[01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:22.240]   band era really took off like it took us getting a rid of you know, minute fees for
[01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:26.880]   Internet access and broadband becoming basically unlimited for a lot of people for this innovation
[01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:27.880]   to take off.
[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:30.960]   And we're seeing history sort of repeat itself in mobile right because mobile still dealing
[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:32.680]   with these bandwidth caps.
[01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:37.040]   We've pretty much lost the whole dream of unlimited bandwidth on mobile even T-Mobile
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:39.280]   because of this on carrier move.
[01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:44.960]   They quietly raised the price of their unlimited plan by $15 now to $95 a month.
[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:49.000]   So that's the sort of like price you're paying for something like this to happen.
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.720]   You know, it's just it's kind of scary and I don't know what it's going to mean for like
[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:54.280]   the future of the mobile web.
[01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:56.080]   Jennifer, you wrote about this.
[01:54:56.080 --> 01:54:57.240]   You're in New York City.
[01:54:57.240 --> 01:55:01.840]   Do you play a lot of fan dual or draft Kings there?
[01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:03.360]   You're big in the fantasy.
[01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:05.360]   Personally you don't.
[01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:08.080]   But no, I did write about it.
[01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:15.760]   So the attorney general of the state of New York Eric Schneiderman has said that's gambling
[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:21.360]   and it's illegal and has shut down fan dual and draft Kings.
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:28.480]   Fan dual and draft Kings both have implemented geo fencing technologies that prevent users
[01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:34.720]   in the it's a handful of states now that have banned this kind of including Nevada, this
[01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:38.000]   kind of fantasy football betting.
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:42.320]   But I've also seen articles that say it's really easy to use a proxy and just go right
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:43.320]   around them.
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:44.320]   They're not trying all that hard.
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:47.680]   I don't think they're trying their hard at all.
[01:55:47.680 --> 01:55:48.680]   You can't blame them.
[01:55:48.680 --> 01:55:50.480]   I mean, it's a big it's a big business.
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:52.640]   Yeah, they're pretty upset about it.
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:54.080]   Well, they're suing.
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:58.800]   They've gone after Schneiderman.
[01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:01.120]   He sent out CC to assist letters on Wednesday.
[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:05.520]   They've gone to the Supreme Court to throw those letters out.
[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:07.280]   I'm not sure what the grounds are.
[01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:12.440]   I guess the debate is does daily fantasy sports qualify as gambling?
[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:13.440]   Right.
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:17.280]   Well, their argument would be well, well, this was their, well, this is a fandals argument
[01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:21.400]   was that it's a game of skill rather than a game of chance.
[01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:24.840]   So when they go to the Supreme Court overnight, when they present their case, they're going
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:30.400]   to present it under the premise that all of these people who win more often have more
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:34.040]   skills and they're going to prove that in various ways.
[01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:40.400]   It was interesting though, because on the conference call, before the operator started,
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:41.400]   it was only supposed to be pressed.
[01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:47.440]   And before the operator stepped in and cut out regular people from taking calls, they
[01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:55.960]   had to answer three calls from fans who weren't the most educated questions or things like
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:56:56.960]   that.
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:57:02.840]   Like it kind of played into their argument, played against their argument a little bit.
[01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:07.240]   I get every time we talk about this, I get email from people who say, you don't understand
[01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:10.400]   this at all.
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:12.520]   And I make a lot of money on it or whatever.
[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:15.280]   I don't know what I actually don't understand their point.
[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:21.240]   I think I understand fantasy football and daily deal.
[01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:29.880]   I mean, I understand that and it's betting, like horse racing is betting.
[01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:34.360]   But I think Jeff, you're a good guy to comment on this.
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:41.160]   Is this debate over as a gambling or is it a game of skill really underlie the basic failure
[01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:44.200]   of kind of legislating morality in general?
[01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:47.960]   Should there be laws against gambling of any kind at all?
[01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:49.880]   Well, well, a few things there.
[01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:54.120]   I think to me, the most important form of gambling is lottery.
[01:57:54.120 --> 01:57:56.880]   States, states, and the poor.
[01:57:56.880 --> 01:58:00.440]   I think it's you know, you watch who buys lottery tickets near me and they're poor people
[01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:01.440]   who can't afford to do that.
[01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:02.440]   That's one level.
[01:58:02.440 --> 01:58:05.880]   The other level is now I'll get myself in real trouble, but hey, I think that's why
[01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:06.880]   I'm here.
[01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:13.040]   You know, after the revelations about FIFA and the revelations about the Russian sports,
[01:58:13.040 --> 01:58:17.560]   how much do we really believe that sports aren't rigged every rich way?
[01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:19.560]   Okay.
[01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:22.760]   Now you, well, now you throw a monkey wrench into the whole thing.
[01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:23.760]   Yeah.
[01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:28.440]   That's why it should be made illegal to bet on horse races or.
[01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:32.400]   No, it's just, it's just, I think we have this presumption that there's some, you know,
[01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:36.440]   the great American pastime that there are some great oral standard around sports.
[01:58:36.440 --> 01:58:37.440]   Well, that way.
[01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:38.840]   I don't think I, oh, come on.
[01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:41.440]   I don't think the NFL is rigged.
[01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:42.440]   Is it?
[01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:45.520]   Well, how much do you get in that?
[01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:50.840]   How many, how many, oh yeah, bicycle racing was a pure thing rigged by one way rigged,
[01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:55.440]   not by, remember, but also by drugs by, by other means.
[01:58:55.440 --> 01:59:00.240]   And I think you're mixing a lot of different issues there though.
[01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:04.360]   If, if, if, and by the way, as gustal points out, there's nothing more rigged than the
[01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:05.360]   stock market.
[01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:07.960]   It's not illegal last time I checked.
[01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:08.960]   Right.
[01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:09.960]   Is it though?
[01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:10.960]   It's rigged against you.
[01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:11.960]   It's a conspiracy to conspiracy.
[01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:14.760]   You cannot make money on the stock market.
[01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:17.120]   Unless you're a professional.
[01:59:17.120 --> 01:59:18.520]   Read flash boys.
[01:59:18.520 --> 01:59:19.520]   Exactly.
[01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:20.520]   It's rigged.
[01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:23.200]   Let's break to all the computers and robots that are traded.
[01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:26.560]   It's as rigged as it can be.
[01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:31.520]   And what's the sad thing about the stock market is it's fueled by this imaginary notion that
[01:59:31.520 --> 01:59:36.040]   you as an individual can play a stock and win by skill.
[01:59:36.040 --> 01:59:37.040]   Right?
[01:59:37.040 --> 01:59:40.720]   And that's the argument that Fandal has is that it's skill.
[01:59:40.720 --> 01:59:45.800]   But I actually think that winning on the stock market does require a bit more skill
[01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:48.600]   than picking horses or something like that.
[01:59:48.600 --> 01:59:53.400]   I don't think, I don't think, I don't think it would be if you could have perfect knowledge,
[01:59:53.400 --> 01:59:54.400]   but that's the problem.
[01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:57.600]   That's what, that's what flash boys shows is you can't have perfect knowledge.
[01:59:57.600 --> 02:00:01.240]   Somebody who has a faster connection to the internet can have perfect knowledge.
[02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:02.240]   I know a second.
[02:00:02.240 --> 02:00:03.760]   And, and it's just hopeless.
[02:00:03.760 --> 02:00:07.240]   And so, but I, but I don't think I'll be honest.
[02:00:07.240 --> 02:00:09.000]   I don't think any gambling should be regulated.
[02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.400]   I don't think it should be, I don't think it should be regulated at all, especially since
[02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:13.920]   the state's already doing it with the lottery.
[02:00:13.920 --> 02:00:17.080]   Well, that's, that's, that's the reason the state is doing it.
[02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:22.920]   And in, in socialist France, and in most, I think European countries, the lottery is
[02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:26.040]   regulated and gambling is regulated.
[02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:30.120]   And the only, it's kind of, it's kind of like smoking.
[02:00:30.120 --> 02:00:36.640]   You don't want to do some kind of prohibition because we know how these things go.
[02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:40.800]   You know, we've seen many examples, but you still want people to have access to it, but
[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:44.000]   you want a relatively controlled environment for it.
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:45.640]   And I think that's what it's about.
[02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:52.040]   If, if you completely outlawed gambling, there would be a lot of, it would go underground.
[02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:53.040]   Right.
[02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:54.040]   So.
[02:00:54.040 --> 02:00:56.200]   But I don't think you should, you can regulate it in the same way that you regulate driving
[02:00:56.200 --> 02:00:57.800]   or whatever you have to be 18.
[02:00:57.800 --> 02:00:59.400]   I don't, I don't care about that.
[02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:01.880]   But I think it's like, it's like marijuana laws.
[02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:07.760]   It's a vice law that comes from a Puritan point of view that just doesn't, it doesn't.
[02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:11.280]   And what you're seeing, this argument shows how it doesn't hold water.
[02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:12.280]   Is it a game of skill?
[02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:13.280]   Is it not a game of skill?
[02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:14.440]   If it's a game of skill, it's legal.
[02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:16.120]   If it's not a game of skill, it's illegal.
[02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:17.320]   How do you even decide that?
[02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:18.320]   Yeah.
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:24.920]   And I just got back from Lagos and, and in the hotel lobby there, they've got slot machines
[02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:27.400]   and you don't see anybody rushing during you go to Vegas and everything.
[02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:28.400]   Right.
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:29.400]   Or all these things.
[02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:30.400]   It's huge because we make this scarcity around.
[02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:34.080]   Because Puritanists will roll around it and you go to other places and there's a casino
[02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:37.440]   is a little over and nobody really has slot machines in every cafe.
[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:38.920]   Oh, right.
[02:01:38.920 --> 02:01:41.960]   I don't think they have.
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:50.280]   How, how, how, how is something like playing a lottery, a state lottery or using machines
[02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:52.480]   at a casino?
[02:01:52.480 --> 02:01:59.840]   How is that legal and not using your brain to at least try to beat the market or pick
[02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:01.240]   the courses because of their stats?
[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:05.840]   Well, I think the mark, well, this is a longer conversation and I think a good one.
[02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:11.640]   But I feel like the stock market is perfectly well known that the stock market is rigged
[02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:15.440]   and that people who have inside information and there are lots of them have a much have
[02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:18.240]   a, have a, or the only people who have a shot at it.
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:22.000]   But they've got to encourage people to think it's the American way that you can invest
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:23.720]   a buck and make 20.
[02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:27.400]   And so that, I mean, that's really that that talk about the con game.
[02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:31.080]   That's the con game because if those people don't put the buck in, then the other guys
[02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:32.680]   don't make the buck.
[02:02:32.680 --> 02:02:36.080]   So I mean, the stock market, that should be regulated.
[02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:37.320]   Well, it is.
[02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:39.560]   Yeah, not very well.
[02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:41.120]   It's regulated by the people who run it.
[02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:42.120]   That's the problem.
[02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:43.120]   All right.
[02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:46.400]   I'm going to wrap this up with one last sad note.
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:49.800]   But I, you know, I was kind of sad that this wasn't more publicized.
[02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:54.760]   One of the pioneers in mainframe computing, Gina Amdahl passed away this weekend at the
[02:02:54.760 --> 02:03:02.280]   age of 92, a legend, absolute legend and a name that those of us who've been using computers
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:05.400]   for more than maybe 20 years will know.
[02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:07.880]   But I think a name that a lot of younger people do not.
[02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:08.880]   Yeah, hold on.
[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:15.480]   Let's, let's do a poll who in the panel knows the name of that name ring a bell.
[02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:16.480]   Not very well.
[02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:17.480]   I've heard it before.
[02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:18.480]   Yeah.
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:20.480]   Did he invent the abstract?
[02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:21.480]   I don't know.
[02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:22.480]   You're a tribe.
[02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:23.480]   Yeah.
[02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:26.560]   How many of you heard of heard of Osborne?
[02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:32.960]   Well, you know, I know he's he's a character in the Marvel universe.
[02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:36.200]   Well, all right.
[02:03:36.200 --> 02:03:37.200]   All right.
[02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:38.200]   K pro.
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:39.200]   K pro.
[02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:40.200]   You had one.
[02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:41.200]   Didn't you, Jeff?
[02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:42.200]   I have an Osborne one.
[02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:43.200]   You have an Osborne one.
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:44.200]   We did.
[02:03:44.200 --> 02:03:47.160]   We had we had it out for the new screensavers yesterday because we were talking to a guy
[02:03:47.160 --> 02:03:49.320]   who sells floppy disks.
[02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:51.560]   How many of you have heard of floppy disks?
[02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:52.560]   Okay.
[02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:59.280]   That's why my favorite, my favorite anecdote from that was the what was it?
[02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:08.180]   I think it was Ian Thompson who mentioned that somebody had what was it had the had a
[02:04:08.180 --> 02:04:10.360]   disk, a three and a half inch disk.
[02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:15.760]   And his, and his little daughter came over and said, Daddy, you 3D printed the save icon.
[02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:20.400]   So that's what that's what's wrong with kids today.
[02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:27.400]   Anyway, Jean Amdahl who was responsible for creating the system 360, the most successful
[02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:31.200]   line of mainframe computers in IBM's history.
[02:04:31.200 --> 02:04:36.760]   I don't think even mainframe computers even, even know anybody knows what those are.
[02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:39.400]   He's had a downer show, you know what?
[02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:41.840]   Well, sometimes the world impinges.
[02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:46.000]   I think we got to, I think we have to end on the fact that the Google car got a ticket
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.000]   for going to.
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:51.680]   24 miles an hour.
[02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:53.200]   I love this.
[02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:56.320]   This was the self, the self driving car, right?
[02:04:56.320 --> 02:04:57.320]   Yep.
[02:04:57.320 --> 02:05:00.200]   A little one, a little, little new dicky one.
[02:05:00.200 --> 02:05:05.720]   They have it set so that it can't go more than 25 miles an hour.
[02:05:05.720 --> 02:05:11.600]   It was, it was, it was driving in a mountain view.
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:15.480]   And there was apparently a line of other cars behind it.
[02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:19.760]   So the Mountain View Police Department pulled them over.
[02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:21.240]   How do you pull it over?
[02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:23.080]   Well, there's no control.
[02:05:23.080 --> 02:05:27.280]   Interesting, as the officer approached the slow moving car, he realized that there was
[02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:30.920]   no one driving.
[02:05:30.920 --> 02:05:31.920]   There was a passenger.
[02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:38.160]   So the officer asked the passenger how the car was choosing speeds and informed the passenger
[02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:45.520]   about vehicle, California vehicle code 2,200, a about, you know, whatever, driving the
[02:05:45.520 --> 02:05:47.280]   right speed.
[02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:52.400]   The self driving car pled guilty to slow driving because they want them to feel friendly and
[02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:57.040]   approachable rather than zooming scarily through neighborhood streets.
[02:05:57.040 --> 02:05:58.040]   No ticket.
[02:05:58.040 --> 02:05:59.040]   A robot voice.
[02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:01.360]   But said, I am guilty, guilty.
[02:06:01.360 --> 02:06:02.600]   I am guilty.
[02:06:02.600 --> 02:06:04.720]   No ticket was issued.
[02:06:04.720 --> 02:06:11.320]   Not because there was no driver to give it to, but because the officer deemed no law had
[02:06:11.320 --> 02:06:12.320]   been broken.
[02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:21.000]   You know, I think it's good though, because he was telling Google that what them driving
[02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:25.920]   too slow was causing these traffic backups at least, you know, these Google's getting
[02:06:25.920 --> 02:06:28.080]   some real world feedback.
[02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:33.080]   What would have you done if there were no passenger?
[02:06:33.080 --> 02:06:34.080]   Call Google.
[02:06:34.080 --> 02:06:35.080]   What do you do?
[02:06:35.080 --> 02:06:37.440]   That's the new, what is it?
[02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:40.880]   The some of the founders of what was a Skype or doing little delivery bot.
[02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:41.880]   Yeah.
[02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:45.640]   If you try to steal it, it'll start yelling at you and saying, I'm calling the police.
[02:06:45.640 --> 02:06:46.960]   I'm going to police.
[02:06:46.960 --> 02:06:51.200]   I need one of those.
[02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:56.280]   Maybe you just put the ticket under the windshield wiper and hope that somebody gets it someday.
[02:06:56.280 --> 02:06:59.920]   You know this is going to be a scene in next year's Silicon Valley.
[02:06:59.920 --> 02:07:00.920]   Silicon Valley.
[02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:01.920]   Yeah.
[02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:04.640]   I've still been watching humans.
[02:07:04.640 --> 02:07:06.480]   Oh, I got to go back to that.
[02:07:06.480 --> 02:07:08.080]   I only saw the first few episodes.
[02:07:08.080 --> 02:07:09.080]   I really didn't know.
[02:07:09.080 --> 02:07:10.080]   Oh, yeah.
[02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:11.080]   Yeah.
[02:07:11.080 --> 02:07:16.760]   Hey, tomorrow on triangulation, Larry Wall, the benevolent dictator for life of the Pearl
[02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:23.040]   project, the man who created Pearl joins us in studio to talk about Pearl six, which
[02:07:23.040 --> 02:07:24.840]   is finally here.
[02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:27.680]   So Larry Wall, tomorrow on triangulation.
[02:07:27.680 --> 02:07:29.200]   That should be a lot of fun.
[02:07:29.200 --> 02:07:31.200]   I want to thank you so much for being here.
[02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:37.480]   Jennifer Booten from MarketWatch at MarketWatch at JBooten on the Twitter marketwatch.com.
[02:07:37.480 --> 02:07:40.720]   I hope this hasn't been too painful.
[02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:41.720]   Oh, that was good.
[02:07:41.720 --> 02:07:43.720]   We had a lot of fun.
[02:07:43.720 --> 02:07:45.400]   I was so glad to have you.
[02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:47.560]   We can't wait to have you back.
[02:07:47.560 --> 02:07:51.360]   Same for you, Devindra, Devindra, Harderwar from Engadget.
[02:07:51.360 --> 02:07:52.360]   Anything you want to plug?
[02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:54.480]   You're up to any, are you up to no good?
[02:07:54.480 --> 02:07:56.160]   I'm always up to no good.
[02:07:56.160 --> 02:07:57.160]   Good.
[02:07:57.160 --> 02:08:14.380]   Go to www.

[02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:52.080]   a

[02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:06.080]   fun.
