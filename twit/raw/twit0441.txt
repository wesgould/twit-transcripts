[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.200]   It's time for Twit this weekend tech to show the covers of the week's tech news.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.200]   A little tough.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.200]   Getting people on the show today because it turns out.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.200]   I don't know, there's a football game going on or something like that.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.200]   And John said, "No, I can't."
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.200]   And on and on.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   But so what we figured out is, oh, if we get people who speak French, they won't care.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.200]   So Miriam Jois is here.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.200]   Of course, we love Miriam.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.200]   A long time a friend of the show and she's currently working at Pebble.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.200]   But before that an Engadgett and is an expert on mobile communications.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.200]   And from Montreal, right?
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   Quebec.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.200]   I know you're in the city now.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.200]   And I'm not going to be able to speak French.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.200]   And I'm not going to be able to speak French.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.200]   I'm not going to be able to speak French.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.200]   Every loss them?
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.200]   No, I'm talking to you.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.200]   Oh.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.200]   Me?
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.200]   No, I'm not Canadian.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.200]   I mean, I'm a Canadian.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.200]   I'm not French Canadian.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.200]   But you're French French.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.200]   Yes, French French.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.200]   The south of France.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.200]   Oh, you're from the south of France.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.200]   From like East Congo.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.200]   Oh, beautiful area.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.200]   Oh, love it.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.200]   And then the Canadian part comes in with the English speaking.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.200]   I did not realize that.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.200]   You don't say a boot.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.200]   Not as much anymore.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.200]   You know, I think it's, I still have a bit of a French accent and a bit of a German because
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.200]   my mom is German as a German as well.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.200]   And then I got a possibly a little bit of Canadian, but I've lived in the US, you know, pretty
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.200]   much like 12 years now.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.200]   So I think the California English took over.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.200]   No, you sound French.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.200]   You have a beautiful French accent.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.200]   It's really sexy.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.200]   I love it.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.200]   You can speak with French accent.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.200]   It's really nice.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.200]   From more sexy for your show.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.200]   It makes me very hot.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.760]   Also from Paris, France, Patrick Beijon, not Patrick on the Twitter and a multilingual
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.200]   podcaster and a regular also on the network.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.200]   So thank you, both of you for being here this week.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.200]   It's nice to have you both.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.200]   I did either of you watch the president's address on Friday.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.200]   I'm just curious.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.200]   I don't, I wonder if there was great in.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.200]   I don't watch it, but I read about it.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.200]   Yeah, Patrick.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   Yeah, I heard about it too.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:25.200]   I watched our own president's address who had two sidestep questions about, you know, his
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.200]   affairs and scooters and stuff like that.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.200]   So in France, they're talking about his love of life.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.200]   And in the US, we're talking about our spying life, but they combined beautifully because
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.200]   we've been spying on his love life.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:49.200]   It's, it's, President Obama took to the podium to talk about, of course, the NSA spying and
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.480]   did in fact say, you know what, we want to strike a balance between our surveillance policies
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.440]   and civil liberties.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.560]   The NSA, of course, is collecting and it has admitted to, I guess at this point, it's
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:09.640]   accepted has been collecting all the phone data of every call going on in the United
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.840]   States illegally.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.840]   All the things.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.120]   All the, all the things.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.800]   So he addressed that saying not that the program would end, but the, this, this actually
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.960]   worries me.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.640]   The information that the NSA collects will no longer be held by the NSA that they will
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:33.880]   have to go through the federal FISA court to get access to the materials.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.440]   In other words, I have to go to a judge say, this is what we want.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.720]   This is why we wanted.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.720]   I don't know.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.720]   Did he propose?
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.160]   No, he didn't propose anything.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.240]   He just said, we're not, they're not going to be holding the data anymore.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.120]   Who are they going to give it to a target?
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.760]   I mean, what do I don't understand why this is better?
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.760]   Well, we don't know.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.760]   We can only speculate.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.360]   Is there, you know, the, the telecom companies that are going to hold them or a third party?
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.360]   Good luck with that.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.040]   That's, that's going to be, but you know, the, the thing that, that's my first rant of
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.040]   the show.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.480]   They, there might be another one, but the thing that's really mind-boggling, there are two
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.480]   things.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:20.200]   First he didn't, he talks about phone metadata, which is important for sure.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.200]   That's what they're collecting.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.200]   They're collecting.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.200]   Interesting.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.200]   Who's, who's calling whom?
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.280]   It dropped calls, missed calls, wrong numbers.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.080]   Apparently they're collecting texts and other things as well, but mostly it's focusing not
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.880]   on content, but on transactions.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:34.880]   Exactly.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.360]   And they're saying, I think somewhat disingenuously, oh, that meant it's just metadata.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.440]   Don't worry about it.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.440]   But everybody who's in our business knows that that data is extraordinarily valuable and
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.800]   in fact can, can tell them all sorts of stuff that invades our privacy.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.800]   Of course.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.040]   But you know, he addressed, he addressed this.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:07:01.120]   He also said that there will be better representation of public interest on the FISA court, which
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:08.560]   is important, but only in cases when new questions of, questions of new technology would
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.560]   arise.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.800]   So when there's something new, they haven't ruled on before that there would be some public
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.040]   interest representation.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:22.200]   So that, that's good as well, but it's not as good as having public representation period.
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:27.560]   And he also reduced the number of hops for that metadata that you can validate that
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.800]   validates your collection.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:37.360]   So you can only now collect metadata on someone two connections away from the person you suspect
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.480]   is doing illegal activity.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.040]   And before it was three hops.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.440]   So that's a little bit better.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:49.560]   But what was not addressed at all was the question of that, that really blew up was the
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.360]   question of prism.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:58.640]   And the NSA collecting data from, well, the internet, that was not even mentioned from
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.640]   what I understand.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.520]   No, in fact, this is the stuff they're getting from the telcos.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.680]   The telcos say, we don't want to have to hold on to this.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:12.360]   The president says that the attorney general and the director of the national intelligence
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.560]   will have to come up with a plan by March 28th.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:20.680]   Do remember that the law that authorizes this bulk collection, it is legal, expires
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.040]   next year.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.680]   And pretty much everyone agrees that after the revelations of Edward Snowden, it's not
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.120]   going to get renewed.
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:33.140]   But there's the other side of this, which is that no one wants to be the person who
[00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:38.720]   say, in fact, it's interesting to watch members of the US Congress talking about this on television
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.720]   this morning.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.200]   Nobody wants to be the one who said, Oh, let's stop collecting this.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.800]   And then there's a terrorist attack.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.800]   Of course.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.080]   And they're the, they're on the hook for this.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.280]   And that's why this is so difficult.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.280]   I don't know.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:59.400]   I mean, it seems to me like the, like basically Obama just, I don't think he really said anything
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.400]   actually.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.400]   I mean, he's quite adept.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.400]   I think he'll do it well.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.960]   But the NSA can do whatever they want.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:05.960]   Right.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.080]   Like we have no proof whatsoever that they're not going to continue hanging on to this data
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.560]   and do anything.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.960]   And so I don't, I have a hard time believing any of this.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.000]   I think it's just a political move saying we're acknowledged that there's something going
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.280]   on that is bothering you, the people.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.760]   And we're going to look into it and do something about it.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.280]   But I really don't think, I think I don't think it's going to happen.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.040]   I don't think that's going to do anything.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:34.000]   And furthermore, it's also now clear that much of this information is shared with, for
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.840]   instance, the British GCHQ and they have no restrictions on how they can use it.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.440]   So, and there's also, and the reason this is a tech story besides the fact that it's
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:48.760]   about stuff happening on the internet is that American technology companies are really
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:54.420]   devastated by this because no one wants to buy American gear anymore because the presumption
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:10:00.680]   is that it's just giving the spies a beachhead in your business.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:07.440]   So it's really a disaster for Silicon Valley among every, among all the other implications.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:12.080]   This is a big story for technology, I think.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.320]   Oh, sorry, go ahead, Miriam.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:21.680]   No, I was just going to say, yeah, I think the, I think if there's any good to come out
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.440]   of this, it's going to be that the very strong Silicon Valley companies are going to get
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.440]   together.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.600]   And finally, they have an enemy besides each other.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.640]   I mean, they have been kind of anti-law, and I hate, I hate lobbies.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.920]   I just think the whole thing is screwed up.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.880]   But this seems to be the way the government operates in the US.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:42.360]   And so, you know, perhaps they can lobby in another way.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.920]   And you know, and it ties into the other big thing that's been going on, which is, you
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.600]   know, I think is very big deal is the net neutrality stuff.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.920]   Yes, we will get to that too, believe me.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.040]   There's a lot to talk about.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.680]   That will be probably my second.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.480]   I had a feeling that's what you were going to talk about.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:04.560]   But you know, what I'm not as cynical as you, Miriam, I think that the things that Obama
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.200]   did address were kind of addressed in the proper direction.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:14.760]   Certainly, there's no, he wasn't going to, you know, let up on everything.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.040]   What worries me is what he didn't talk about at all.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:21.360]   And if you say, you know, the NSA is going to be doing whatever they want anyway, then
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.720]   there's no point legislating anyway.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:28.800]   So maybe I understand the feeling, but I think it might be a little bit extreme.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:36.360]   That being said, going, supporting your view is that story that congressional reps had
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.320]   to ask Bruce Schneider.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:44.160]   Bruce Schneider, yes, he's doing because the NSA won't tell them.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.600]   So Bruce Schneider, who's the greatest security blogger of them all.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.600]   We just love everybody.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.600]   He's been on the show.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.600]   Everybody loves Bruce Schneider.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:56.480]   The Congress says, could you tell us because we don't, the NSA is not talking to us.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.240]   That's really where the failure is.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:03.840]   But I recognize that in order to be secure, we need to do something.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:10.760]   I mean, after 9/11, there was absolutely a mandate from the American people as well as
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:16.200]   the government for these spy agencies to get going and protect us from future attacks.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.320]   And I understand the need for that.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:23.520]   Of course, the acknowledgement was we can't tell the American people what we're doing,
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:30.560]   but by law, we need to tell Congress, we need to inform Congress, and they need to, on behalf
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.000]   of the American people, have oversight of what we're doing.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.160]   And that's where it's really fallen apart.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.760]   There is no oversight.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.720]   And there has to be a way to balance the safety.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.360]   Now I admit this is a very American point of view.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.840]   It was one of the reasons I like having you guys on this show is that from the very American
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:54.640]   point of view, we want to protect ourselves against terrorist attacks, but ask Chancellor
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:59.040]   Merkel of Germany how she feels about it, because in that process, we're listening in
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.200]   on her cell phone calls.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.560]   That was interesting.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.480]   One of the other things he said was we're going to stop listening to foreign leaders.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.480]   About time!
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.480]   All right.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:14.400]   But he also said that non-US persons would be afforded the same rights as US persons,
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.440]   which apparently they're spying on Americans anyway.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.440]   I'm not sure what that does.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.680]   You get the same right to be spied on.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.680]   Congratulations.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:28.280]   But I wonder if, let's, I'm going to try and get out of my comfort zone or my camp for
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:29.440]   a second.
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:39.600]   And is there a chance that these things, all this spying is actually getting them results
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:44.240]   and they have stopped attacks and they actually can't communicate on that?
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:51.800]   And Obama did say success goes unmentioned and failure could be catastrophic.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.880]   And the success goes unmentioned is kind of important there.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:14:01.800]   It's obvious, but maybe they are actually, they see the results of these actions and they
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.080]   just can't talk about it.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:07.120]   And maybe in 50 years, we're going to have declassified documents that are going to show
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:12.960]   that, you know, three attacks were stopped in the last 10 years and Obama is seeing those
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:18.680]   things and he has to just take it and take the public opinion being very much against
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:23.600]   him and saying, you know what, we have to do it and that's the way it is.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:28.760]   Did Francois Harlan in his press conference, did the Prime Minister of France talk at all
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:34.240]   about this and about the US spying on France and what his reaction is?
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.720]   I honestly, I can't remember.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.080]   I'm not sure he...
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.920]   He's busy with his own scandal.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.040]   No, well, obviously he tried to do it.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:48.400]   He's busy with his approval rating, which is the lowest that anyone has ever had in the
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.400]   country.
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:54.600]   It was in the 15, the teens and now it's a little bit above, but he's trying to get
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.040]   the economy back up.
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:03.640]   But yeah, it did make a little bit of a stink, but it's sort of forgotten now, especially
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:09.080]   because the government had to pass a set of laws which were controversial in their own
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:14.440]   right in France and that were kind of in the same vein as what we've seen in the US.
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:18.520]   So I don't think he wants to bring too much attention to that again.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:24.120]   Well, he must be gratified by the fact that we've decided not to spy on him anymore.
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.920]   Yeah, I'm sure he is.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:33.200]   So maybe there's one last thing I wanted to mention on this topic and it's sort of the
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:42.320]   contradiction of them and them, you know, it's the forever them, they, basically the
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:50.440]   government and the NSA saying what Snowden did was wrong and we are not doing anything
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.440]   wrong.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:55.560]   And now obviously Obama had to announce some pretty...
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.880]   A number of changes because of these revelations.
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:08.280]   So I'm wondering how they can hold that dichotomy in their arguments of, you know, if actually
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:14.600]   he did reveal secrets that if what he revealed was not...
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:20.160]   There wasn't anything wrong in this, why are then they now changing it to much acclaim?
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.600]   That's something that I haven't seen addressed anywhere which is...
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.680]   Snowden is a traitor.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.080]   We don't want to talk about this.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.880]   We did nothing wrong to...
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.200]   Okay, we should talk about this.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.200]   Yes, we did something wrong.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.280]   But Snowden, he's still a traitor.
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:37.880]   Well, see, my biggest problem, my whole approach on this is that perhaps if we didn't go out
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:43.720]   there, fight wars and piss people off, they wouldn't try to terrorize us and then we
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.160]   wouldn't have to do all this.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:49.720]   I mean, that's a much larger conversation about why terrorism happens.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:54.720]   Yeah, my point is right now the NSA is doing stuff against US citizens, Canadians and
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:01.160]   French people like me and Patrick and people all over the world that are just completely
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.160]   insane.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.880]   I mean, I don't know if you're familiar with the big hacker conference that explains
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:07.880]   between...
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.880]   RSA is kept.
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.880]   Oh, oh.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:15.000]   Every year in Germany and this year was in Hamburg and I watched Jacob Applebaum's talk
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:23.240]   for an hour and it is very technical but it outlines some of the craziest malware and
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:28.360]   other virus-like activity that the NSA is putting into people's computers sometimes
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.120]   at the hardware level.
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.480]   And to me, that is just unacceptable.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.600]   Like, that is just goes beyond...
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:41.800]   I mean, as you said earlier, it threatens our economy and I still believe in competition,
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:47.280]   I still believe in people making money and I think that this is a big issue.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.480]   This is a much bigger issue and I think that maybe we got some results.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.480]   You know?
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:59.440]   Applebaum was talking at the KS computer conference about all of these NSA ant spying thing.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:03.080]   Der Spiegel then did the full article and we've talked about that quite a bit.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:09.000]   50 page catalog of things you can buy from the NSA.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   You know what?
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.840]   Those don't bother me as much, Miriam, because those are targeted.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:13.840]   Exactly.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:14.840]   Those are...
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.000]   We want to find out what this bad guy is up to so we have a technology that admittedly...
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.400]   But how do you know they don't use that against people that...
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.400]   Well, they're not...
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.160]   No, you're not right.
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.440]   Of course, but you never know.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.440]   That's always...
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:31.680]   Since James Bond has been using little microphone pens, you've never known if he wasn't using
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.920]   to spy on people he shouldn't be spying on.
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.920]   I mean...
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.000]   So there's two different arguments there.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.880]   One is that we shouldn't be doing any of this at all and I think that that's an extreme
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.720]   that a lot of Americans wouldn't support.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.600]   They want to be protected a little bit.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.680]   So they don't want to take away all of law enforcement's tools.
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.600]   In fact, we're happy that law enforcement has some tools.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:57.400]   So if there is an al-Qaeda operative in the United States, we can capture him.
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:02.520]   But on the other hand, the NSA has gone far beyond that to collect data about every single
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:08.080]   American citizen well beyond what their charter allows them to do.
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.840]   And I don't think there's any argument that that's going too far.
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.680]   So you can argue, Miriam, oh, we shouldn't...
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.680]   No, no, I...
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.480]   We created terrorist states and certainly can make that argument.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.640]   At this point, we got some bad guys out there, bad actors.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.200]   They're not going away.
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.200]   I don't know...
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.200]   Sure.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.680]   I agree with you about what I'm saying is that I'm concerned that the NSA is actually
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:33.440]   actively withholding bugs in commercial code.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.440]   Backdoors it.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.840]   Oh, we know that.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.840]   Right?
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.120]   The conference I thought you were talking about, the RSA conference is coming up.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:44.440]   A lot of people have said we're not going to the RSA conference because it was revealed
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:54.680]   that the NSA paid RSA $10 million to put subverted encryption code out and recommend
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:55.760]   it.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.840]   Some code that gives a backdoor to the NSA.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.840]   So you're absolutely right.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.200]   It's the kind of problems I have.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.200]   This is...
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.480]   To me, it's a technology problem.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.080]   It's not just a political problem.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:10.000]   It's that we have technologies being screwed with basically.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   By that Silicon Valley and the entrepreneurship and the capitalism that happens around technology
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.920]   is being screwed with by this majorly, I think.
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:19.920]   That's the blowback.
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:20.920]   And there's deaf...
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.440]   And that's, of course, you ask Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, all these companies.
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.440]   That's Cisco.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:31.320]   A lot of the targets of these AMP protocols were Cisco routers.
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.320]   There's blowback.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.040]   It really, really hurts us.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.120]   But I don't think the answer is completely obvious or do you?
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.520]   No, I don't.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.720]   I think it's difficult.
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:47.600]   The one thing I will say is that on the topic of Americans going to war and pissing people
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:54.080]   off, my country, having been a recipient of the American's help, I will probably abstain
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.080]   from commenting.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:21:00.480]   Yeah, I mean, we're all pretty guilty on the Western Wall pretty much right now, right?
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.480]   I mean, so hard.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.800]   I don't really know what the answer is.
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:10.560]   Let's talk about the rules of the road for the internet and net neutrality.
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:13.720]   Some people this week said it's dead.
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.720]   Well, maybe not.
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.720]   We'll find out about that.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.720]   And we'll give Patrick a chance to rail on over this.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.160]   Google buys nests.
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.880]   AOL kills patch.
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.800]   A big firing at Yahoo.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.320]   Lots more to talk about in just a little bit.
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:33.720]   We've got a great cast of non-football lovers on the show today.
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:37.040]   Gary M. Joar from pebble, get pebble.com.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.080]   And are you going to Mobile World Congress?
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.880]   I bet you are.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:42.880]   Yes, I am.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.960]   I'm not quite sure exactly what I'm doing yet, but there's some stuff up in the air.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:51.520]   So I'm going to come on and help us cover that.
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.320]   Are you going to go?
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:57.960]   No, I've always every year I say this is this event in Barcelona, which is coming up
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.160]   in a month is the place now where we're all the fun.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.800]   You like the Galaxy S5 will probably announce they're all the new phones.
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.440]   And it really has become the show.
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.440]   Plus it's in Barcelona.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.400]   But maybe we'll send Mike Elgin.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.400]   I can't go.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.400]   I wish I could.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.400]   I'd love to.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:17.200]   But if you're going to be there, please call us and tell us what's going on.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.200]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.240]   Be our eyes and ears at the Mobile World Congress.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.240]   Patrick, do you go?
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.880]   I mean, it's just down the road at peace.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:31.120]   No, it's really-- I mean, those big shows, it's so much wulking and you can see everything
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.320]   on the internet anyways.
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.640]   I didn't go to CES, so I understand I'm a believer.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.480]   But this one seems more fun.
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.880]   I think Mobile Congress is more about business.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.040]   You go there to discuss partnerships, to work out deals.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:48.880]   All the big deals you see happening later in the year are gelled at Mobile Pops.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.880]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.400]   So it's why it's very important to be there because you kind of hear some interesting
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:58.240]   stories and rumors and meet some interesting people.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.360]   When I was at Engadget, obviously, there are news, but nobody's launching big things
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:03.360]   anymore.
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.640]   They launch kind of second tier things at Mobile Congress.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.120]   All the big tier devices are now.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.760]   The first tier devices are launched separately with their own events.
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:15.680]   They'll be an event for the Galaxy, at some point, and HTC will have something for their
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.160]   phone, et cetera.
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:22.040]   I think we're Mobile Congress shines as if you're a company like us, Pebble, and you
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.840]   want to have discussions and meetings with people.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.840]   This is where you want to be because this is where everybody is.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:28.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:30.840]   But I agree with you.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.120]   Trade shows now are not as appealing to the big companies.
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.520]   Apple left, Microsoft left CES because they can do it themselves.
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.520]   What do they need?
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.360]   They don't want to be in the mass of announcements.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.120]   They want to have their own attention.
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.120]   We'll talk about that.
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:43.280]   In fact, I haven't asked you guys.
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.160]   I'd love to know what you thought of CES.
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.760]   But before we do that, let's talk about getting out of the post office.
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.800]   Why should you be going to the post office?
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.280]   Postage rates are going up.
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.120]   That means there's going to be a traffic jam.
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.320]   Everybody's going to go to buy stamps, except for you.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.800]   Because you don't need to buy stamps because you print your own stamps.
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.760]   That doesn't even sound legal.
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:02.840]   But it is.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.440]   We're talking about stamps.com.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:10.200]   You literally can buy, print, and use legal US postage.
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.360]   With your computer, your printer, you don't need a special postage meter or a special
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.360]   ink.
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.360]   You just need stamps.com.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.560]   It's not just buying postage.
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:23.280]   So stamps.com does everything you'd need to do at the post office right from your desk.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.040]   The rates are automatically updated.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:29.320]   I've been told that some postage meters charge you to update the rates.
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:32.000]   I don't know how they get away with this.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   Not stamps.com.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.440]   You never have to go to the post office.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.040]   They were just included, by the way.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.040]   Congratulations.
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.720]   And software magazines, annual 500 list.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.840]   Top software companies.
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:48.480]   Stamps.com, we've been using it here for years to print our own postage, to print right
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.480]   on the envelopes.
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:54.440]   So if you do mail out bills or flyers at your business, it'll take the data from your
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.600]   QuickBooks or from your address book.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:00.640]   Automatically add the return address, your company logo and the postage.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.000]   Print it right on the envelope.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.440]   If your mailing package is used at USB scale, it's awesome.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.680]   You plop the package on there automatically.
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.920]   Prints the mailing label.
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:14.000]   If you sell on Etsy or eBay or Amazon or PayPal or any of those sites, stamps.com will
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.520]   do all your printouts for you automatically.
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:20.720]   It pulls the address from the website, even if you're using a priority mail or express
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:25.320]   mail, it'll send out a confirmation email to the recipient automatically.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.120]   It is true fulfillment.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.120]   It turns you into a fulfillment house.
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:33.240]   Now, if you visit stamps.com, you'll see an $80 no risk trial on the front page.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.920]   But don't do that.

[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:39.920]   TWIT.

[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.240]   I think it's like $5.
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.120]   There's a $5 supply kit to make up for that.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:57.960]   And of course, a four week free trial of stamps.com.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:05.200]   Stamps.com, use the offer code TWIT and stop going to the post office today.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.200]   What did you think, guys?
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.720]   Did you see anything at CES that was of any interest?
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.720]   Were you there for Pebble?
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.840]   Because Pebble made the steal announcement there, right?
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.000]   Well, you know, that's what my thing was.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.240]   I was very busy with Pimping Pebble and Pebble Steel.
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.240]   So how was that for you?
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.800]   Because last year, you went as in gadgets, so you were covering everything.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.040]   This year, did you have to stay at the Pebble booth?
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.360]   No, we didn't have a booth.
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.960]   We had a suite with invitation only kind of thing.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:34.320]   We obviously briefed the big media, the big important ones, you know, all the way.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.920]   I mean, it's hard.
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.320]   That's one thing I discovered.
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:42.960]   It's hard to pick and choose who you can brief ahead of time, ahead of your launch,
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.600]   because you only have so much time and so many time slots to do so.
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:47.600]   So how do you do that?
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.520]   Because I mean, I do see some discrepancies.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:55.920]   A lot of times, new media like us or websites don't get the attention that old media like
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.880]   Wall Street Journal or USA Today gets.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.760]   I'm sure you're more savvy than that in that respect.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:06.520]   I tried to prioritize the ones that I know will have the most impact directly.
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:11.240]   And then, you know, immediately after the announcement, we, you know, so there were kind
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:15.480]   of three tiers, you know, the people we briefed ahead of time, the people that got an embargo
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:19.560]   but didn't get briefed and then the people who got it afterwards.
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:24.120]   And afterwards meant that a lot of people just kind of reached out to us and say, hey,
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.080]   we want to take pictures and see it and play with it.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:30.840]   And so I had to kind of like, from Monday onward, basically accommodate all these folks
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:31.840]   till Friday.
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:32.840]   It was a lot of work.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.760]   It was very exciting.
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.320]   It's got to be a very different experience of CES though.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.480]   You flipped sides.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.480]   Yeah, it was.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:43.640]   But you know what's cool is that I still got invited to all a lot of the press conferences
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.760]   and I managed to actually go to one of them.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.840]   I didn't just had enough time for one.
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:52.480]   And it was the T-Mobile press conference, which I live tweeted.
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:53.840]   Boy, John was here.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:54.840]   What a character he is.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:55.840]   I know.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:56.840]   I mean, the guy is amazing.
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.400]   So I, I live tweet.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:03.060]   I had a DSLR plugged into my laptop and I would take pictures and they would go, I get
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:08.480]   resized and watermarked and sent out to the internet on Twitter live.
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:15.720]   And basically between me and the Verge, we became the two live feeds of T-Mobile's press
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.400]   conference because people really loved it apparently.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.280]   I know we weren't the only ones live blogging, but apparently they liked our pictures the
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.280]   most.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.880]   So that was a very rewarding experience.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:32.320]   I got to play journalists for a bit and I got to get John Ledger say to me live on stage
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.720]   that I could have anything I wanted.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.320]   So I'm going to take him up on this.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.320]   Right?
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:40.680]   What do you say Miriam Jwar, you can have anything you want.
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:44.560]   Well, you know what happened was, you know, I, I, he actually, it was my birthday that
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:49.200]   day and he, you wish me happy before, before the press conference and at the press conference,
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:53.960]   I was the first person to ask a question at the Q and A. And I said to all this is fantastic,
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:57.200]   but I've been a T-Mobile customer since the voice stream days.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:01.160]   So what kind of awesome, you know, thing can you do for me?
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:04.480]   Like obviously I'm very happy, but like, you know, you're making a lot of people switch
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:09.120]   now and you watch, you have in store for me and he answered, you know, the question.
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:13.440]   And then at the end he says, besides, you know, for you, you can have anything you want.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:17.560]   So I was like, I need to try to take him up on this because he said it live, you know.
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:25.120]   He's, you know, so he was the CEO, I think of global crossing button down crew cut practically.
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:28.480]   And all of a sudden he's like the anti CEO.
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:34.400]   He's got long, he's got a mullet for crying out loud and a leather jacket, a leather jacket.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:38.560]   They actually, the Washington Post said basically he's become a troll.
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:42.000]   And he told me trolls, other CEOs.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.080]   He's the other CEOs.
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.080]   He's awesome.
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:49.920]   He wear, you know, on Wednesday at CES he was wearing a T-shirt that talked about him
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:50.920]   crass.
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:56.360]   He crashed the AT&T event and had to get it got thrown out.
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:00.240]   Is this a, is this an act he's playing or is this the real John Ledger?
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.640]   By the way, I pronounce it Leger, but it's Ledger.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:06.920]   So he too, I always said Leger and now I have to correct myself because actually to hurt
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.760]   him say his own name is Ledger.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:09.760]   Yes, Ledger.
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.880]   So, so he has a T-shirt says, I just wanted to hear Macklemore.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:13.880]   Yeah.
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:17.080]   I mean, he's a very savvy at marketing basically.
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.480]   You know, he took the offer.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.320]   I'm pretty sure he crashed this on purpose for the publicity.
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.640]   But you don't get thrown out.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.480]   He was invited by Macklemore's agent.
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.080]   So it's not like he was there just crashing.
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.640]   He was actually legitimately there.
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.160]   And I don't think AT&T handled that very well.
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.560]   I mean, come on.
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:38.080]   Seriously, you just, it's a, you know, this is how you deal with competition.
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:41.040]   You're all friends and, you know, make, you make the best of it.
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.160]   I'm sure he was well behaved.
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.160]   He, he tweets.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.160]   Is it him?
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.160]   Do you think that's tweeting?
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.160]   He's not his people.
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.160]   Yeah, he, he, no.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.160]   He's real.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.160]   He's also obsessed with Batman.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.160]   Do you know this?
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.160]   No.
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.800]   You see, he's completely obsessed with Batman.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.840]   So that would explain his Twitter background.
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:05.000]   He's making fun of other carriers and Batman when you read his Twitter feed.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   This has to be him.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.640]   This can't be any corporate shill because it's just too, it's too real.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:15.240]   I think the guy just decided, you know what, let's go, let's roll with this and see how
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.640]   far we can go and it's working, you know.
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:20.200]   And, and so, so that was a big deal.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:24.160]   Like the Macklemore, you know, the king, him getting kicked out of AT&T and then the press
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.160]   conference.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.760]   So I'm glad I was able to attend as a journalist for that.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:34.440]   And then the other big deal was, you know, the guy walking off on stage at the Samsung
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.440]   conference.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.440]   Michael Bay.
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:37.440]   Yeah.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.440]   Michael Bay.
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.200]   So this is what CSS come down to now, you know, through the technology.
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.480]   It's all about, you know, social media and, and circus.
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:44.480]   It's a circus.
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:45.480]   Yes.
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:46.480]   It's a circus.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.480]   It's been a circus for a lot of time.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:48.480]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.720]   Patrick, you didn't go to CES, did you?
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.520]   No, I didn't.
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:59.160]   But I mean, it, I have to say, CES has not been super exciting for a long time.
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:05.240]   But I think this time was a little bit more, I mean, except for the, the Michael Bay thing,
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:11.520]   which was both hilarious and super cringe worthy at the same time.
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:16.760]   But apart from that, there were a few things that were, I couldn't say what specifically,
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:21.720]   but the Internet of Things and wearable computing seemed like they were getting a little bit
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:26.680]   more real and a little bit more accessible.
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:33.960]   We're not quite there yet, but I think this is, this, this is really the time where we're
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:42.000]   starting to see that this is not just a sort of buzzword that dies after a couple of months.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.160]   That's probably the one thing.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:49.800]   Comdex before CES and now CES, the big trade shows are good for is seeing the manifestation.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:53.720]   I remember, you know, convergence was the watchword for 10 years.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:57.600]   And finally, you started to see it at CES a few years ago with a convergence of digital
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:01.200]   technology and television in Hollywood.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:08.960]   The idea of tablets, you first saw tablets in CES at Comdex 10 years ago with Microsoft
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.640]   and it slowly evolved and you could see that happening and you knew when it was really
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:15.280]   taking off because it became the issue.
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:19.680]   E-book readers at CES three years ago, everybody had an E-book reader.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:23.800]   And so this year it's wearable tech and you're in good position for that, Maryam.
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:26.680]   It's wearable tech and the Internet of Things.
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.760]   Yeah, it seems so.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:32.840]   And obviously, it's probably going to keep evolving and the things that are, that we're
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:37.400]   going to be, if it actually takes off, takes off, the things that we're going to be seeing
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:42.200]   in two, three years are probably going to be a little bit different from what we're seeing
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:47.720]   at CES but just in the same way that the actual tablets we're all using now are different
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.840]   from the ones that we were seeing 10 years ago.
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:55.080]   So I think, you know, and also there were a bunch of French companies that were doing
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:34:01.200]   some, that were presenting things, you know, essential Internet of Things items like the
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.200]   connected toothbrush.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:05.840]   There's a lot of that crap.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.040]   There is a lot of that stuff.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:13.320]   There are things like the, I think that's what, but that's kind of the point I'm making is
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:18.080]   you don't see, you just can see that it's going to happen because everybody's throwing
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:22.840]   stuff up against the wall that are, in most cases, dumb and stupid.
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:26.400]   Like, remember the COBO and all those readers we saw a few years ago?
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:30.240]   But you knew, well, this must be a big thing because everybody's trying it and everybody
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:34.120]   had watches, Internet connected, everything refrigerators.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:38.000]   There's one that was actually pretty interesting in the concept.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.600]   A friend of mine, another French podcaster, alerted me to it.
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:46.040]   It's called Mother by a company called Sense.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.160]   It's a French company as well.
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:49.760]   The guys who did the NABAS tag connected by the thing.
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:50.760]   Oh yeah, I liked the NABAS tag.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:51.760]   That was fun.
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:52.760]   Yeah.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:59.160]   And so it's a base station with, I can't remember, like maybe up to 20 little sensors
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:04.720]   that are, they're called cookies, they're tiny sensors, very flat and like this, they're
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:05.720]   colored.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:08.400]   And you can put them and use them anywhere.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:12.640]   And they're going to be interpreting the data depending on where you put them.
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:16.480]   So you could put one in your kid's backpack and you know where they are.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:22.280]   You could put one, for example, on your fridge door and you would know how many times things
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:23.400]   are being opened.
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:32.160]   Or on your coffee machine and it knows how many times you've had coffee.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:34.800]   And then you also have one, for example, under your bed.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.880]   So it knows if you sleep well or not.
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:45.720]   And then it can correlate the data and tell you, you know what, these five days over the
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:53.360]   last month where you didn't sleep very well, you also had a coffee two hours before you
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.440]   went to sleep.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.880]   So now obviously that's an obvious one.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:02.560]   But you know, it's the kind of self, I can't remember the word sorry.
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.800]   Quantified self.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.040]   Quantified self.
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:06.040]   Thank you.
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.040]   That's cool.
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:12.280]   And by having all of that data, we can learn more about everything we do and maybe make
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:17.920]   you have to eat one of them for it to know what I, you can try.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.320]   I'm sure you can try.
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.560]   My takeaway from CS was it's always nice to see people in person.
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.560]   Yes, that's what it's really awesome.
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:26.040]   That's exactly what it's really nice.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.880]   And then the other thing was, you know, I mean, I feel the same way as you that didn't
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.480]   really see anything that blew my mind.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:35.080]   I mean, it was obviously a very good CS for us, but I worked really hard to make that
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.080]   happen.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:39.280]   And then, you know, the TVs, those curved TVs are pretty gorgeous.
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.560]   I mean, you know, of course, I'm very expensive.
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:43.240]   They always start out very expensive.
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.240]   You know, I have one.
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.240]   They trickle down.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.240]   You know, I own one.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:47.240]   You have a curved one.
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.240]   I have the curved Samsung OLED.
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.240]   Oh my goodness.
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:53.440]   But now Samsung, see now I need a new one because Samsung announced at the show one that you
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.840]   can uncurve with a remote control.
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:56.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.440]   Flats just stupid.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:02.120]   You press a button.
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:03.120]   It goes.
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.280]   It's a party trick.
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:07.400]   It's, you know, it's all about depressing your neighbors.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.880]   That's all it's all about.
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:13.480]   When people come in the house, they go, Oh, your TV's curved and they go, yes.
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:14.880]   I was very excited.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:18.040]   I went to the show floor for about all half an hour.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:20.440]   It's about the amount of time I spent on the show for.
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:25.480]   And they had this at the LG booth, this gigantic washing machine, fake washing machine.
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.040]   And everybody was getting their picture taken in front of it.
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:29.440]   That was that was a shit.
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.520]   That's how excited I got about things that see us.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:32.520]   What?
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:33.520]   I know.
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:34.520]   Why?
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:35.520]   The giant washing machine?
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:39.320]   Because it looked like, you know, they were trying to sell some kind of smart washing machine,
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.840]   connected washing machine, whatever.
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:45.480]   And they had this gigantic one where you could basically, it was an invitation to make fun
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:46.480]   of things.
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.480]   So what do you like?
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:50.120]   What do you, so the big, the really the big story didn't happen.
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:52.760]   It's he yes was Google buying the, the Nest company.
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:58.600]   Tony Fadel, of course, former Apple vice president who oversaw the production of the
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:59.800]   iPod.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:00.800]   People say he designed the iPod.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.400]   He did not design the iPod.
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:06.680]   However, he hired about a hundred great designers from Apple and other places.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:07.680]   The Nest is beautiful.
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.080]   It's got intelligence.
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:10.240]   It knows when you're home.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.240]   It has on the Wi-Fi.
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.320]   So it can also tell what the weather is.
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:18.120]   And it's supposedly smartly conditions your home, heat or cold.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:22.640]   I, I had one, I, I didn't bother reinstalling it when we moved because it's like big deal.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:27.120]   And then now they do a talking smoke detector that goes, I'm not sure.
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:28.120]   I don't know what it says.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:29.720]   Your battery is low.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:32.880]   You go, or you can look on your iPhone and it'll say, Hey, there was no fire last night.
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:36.520]   Oh, that's good news.
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.000]   It's an interesting company.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.800]   I don't know if it's worth 5.8% of Google's total cash position, 3.2 billion dollars.
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:44.800]   Why?
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:45.800]   Where here's my theory.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:46.800]   Okay.
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:47.800]   Do you want my theory?
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.800]   I want to know why Google bought this.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:54.200]   Honeywell, Honeywell, the big traditional thermostat and fire detector maker was about
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.200]   to sue them.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.200]   Yes.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.200]   For a lot.
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:58.200]   Yes.
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:02.440]   And they, somebody thought, Hey, look, we can have a whole bunch of cool patents and,
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:06.880]   uh, and, and you know, there you go.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:07.880]   I don't know my theory.
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:12.200]   So, you know, it's interesting because Google paid half as much for YouTube, 1.6 billion.
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.840]   And at the time we thought it was insane.
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.640]   And that time it seemed nuts.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:20.440]   And, and, and YouTube was about to get sued out of existence, remember?
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:25.160]   I mean, there was some question whether YouTube could continue because they were really raising
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:27.840]   the ire of content creators having Google.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.840]   I think one of the reasons they sold is because Google, you got to think that there's
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:35.320]   some, some relationship there that, that Tony Fadel getting sued or threatened lawsuits
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:38.920]   from not just Honeywell, but first alert.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:42.720]   And others, I think, was a little nervous about the future.
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:47.160]   Um, and, and as Tony said, Google can get, I don't know, I completely understand why
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.440]   Tony Fadel took 32, 3.2 billion.
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:52.680]   That's not a question mark, but what is Google planning?
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:55.680]   Are they planning to make a big connected home initiative?
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.480]   Well, it's goes back to the small announcement, right?
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.880]   Like that it's like you have sensors all over the house.
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:02.880]   They give you data.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:05.840]   People want more data, they want to know more about you, right?
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:09.000]   Well, they know when you are sleeping, they know when you are awake.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:16.120]   Well, it seems pretty clear that the next, well, one of the, the next directions that
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:22.520]   all of this, uh, computers everywhere, uh, thing is going to take is the Internet of
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:25.120]   Things as we were discussing just now.
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.440]   Does it solve a problem though?
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:27.880]   Or is it used a lot of crap?
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.880]   Well, it's, you mean the Internet of Things in general?
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:31.880]   We don't know.
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:34.680]   We don't know yet, but there is a possibility.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:38.880]   Every, everything seems to be going in that direction and it seems like it could bring
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:39.880]   a lot.
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:40.880]   You know what happens though?
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:41.880]   Intelligence.
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.360]   We hear in the tech industry say, well, everything is going in that direction.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:48.320]   Let's follow that train and then consumers go, yeah, I don't know.
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:52.640]   Maybe that's possible, but on the other hand, Nest is doing pretty well.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:59.920]   And what, what they know how to do is design in that area, in that, in that industry.
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:04.000]   And Google is getting better at design all the time as is now famous.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.200]   Google, you know, that phrase, Google is getting better at design quicker than Apple
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.840]   is getting better at the Internet.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:13.040]   And they're getting better very, very fast.
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:18.600]   And the thing is the, the Nest appliances, and maybe they had others in, in, in the,
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:23.880]   you know, on the, on the drawing board, but the Nest appliances are extremely well designed.
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:29.160]   And as everyone knows, design is, is not just the way it looks, but the way it works.
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.960]   And they are doing extremely well in that area.
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:36.760]   So it might be that exactly in the same way that they bought YouTube, they, they could
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.960]   feel that something was going to happen there.
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:41.600]   And they were thinking, you know what, let's get these guys.
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:47.120]   Let's give them the, the, the free range to do the things they want to do.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:50.680]   And this is obviously going to become something.
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:55.280]   So we have a head start and on top, on top of it, they can help with the design of other
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:58.800]   Google products in general, which is not a bad thing either.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:02.760]   So I think I don't know if the price is right, but I certainly understand why they would
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:06.040]   want to buy the company like this.
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.360]   I agree with Patrick.
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:12.400]   I mean, it's, it's obvious to me that they are, they have all this design and hardware
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:16.640]   manufacturing expertise and Google definitely wants more of that.
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:21.760]   And then of course, you know, the patents, the data, and they were Google ventures, you
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:24.240]   know, they was already in, they had already invested in it.
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:27.720]   And you know, you don't want to see something you've invested into that's doing well that
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:33.960]   it can return you a lot of data and a lot of perks, like the ability to do hardware
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:39.400]   and does good design and have that, you know, a bogged down by some gigantic lawsuit that
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:40.880]   they can't afford to fight.
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:41.880]   Right.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:42.880]   So I think to me that makes sense.
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:43.880]   It could have been a white knight.
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:46.320]   You're saying they swooped in to save them.
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:47.320]   I think so.
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:51.200]   And partially as part of the story, but I think what was more interesting to me is
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:55.840]   the reaction of this acquisition to this acquisition by the media and people thought
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:58.120]   it was Google spying on us.
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.440]   Are you kidding me?
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:01.880]   Google has a little red eye now in the living room.
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:04.200]   There's a potential for this to happen.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:10.240]   But I do really think it's that big of a deal that Google can, in fact, that Nest already
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:14.600]   has access to things like your temperature over time in your house when your furnace
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:16.840]   kicked in and out.
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:18.440]   And you know, other stuff with the fire detector.
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:21.680]   I mean, seriously, like, well, that's that's a lot of data.
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.480]   You've already signed a life away.
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:24.880]   But yeah, that's the thing.
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:28.640]   If you're worried about Google spying on you, then you probably should be worried about
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:30.160]   Google spying on you already.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.240]   Stop using Facebook.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:34.240]   Okay.
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:41.800]   So I had a nest and you get a nest energy report, which is kind of cool that tells you,
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:45.480]   well, stuff, not useful stuff, but stuff.
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:48.120]   For instance, all nest thermostat schedules have saved.
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:52.480]   They say 1.4 billion kilowatt hours.
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:57.400]   That's enough energy to power all the tablets in the US for a year.
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:00.920]   And then actually this is, I haven't, I haven't used my nest in a while.
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:06.440]   Let me go back and look at a an older nest energy report because I, as I said, I didn't
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:08.080]   reinstall it.
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:13.440]   This shows you this month, you use two hours more than last month.
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.440]   Wow.
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:15.440]   Wow.
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:22.440]   This is not, this is not incredibly interesting or useful.
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:30.480]   It's not very useful information, but once everything becomes data and Google can study
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:36.560]   it and get you some value out of it, it can become interesting.
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:38.360]   It's easy to make fun of it now.
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:44.000]   But when the home becomes, let's create a new buzzword, when the home becomes the quantified
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.920]   home and when everything is quantified, then I'm sure you can, well, I'm speculating, but
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:51.440]   I'm sure you can extract value out of it for your new one.
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:54.600]   There's some data, I don't feel like it's a privacy invasion.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:58.760]   And I mean, does Google really care when I'm home and when I'm not home?
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:44:59.760]   I don't know.
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:00.760]   I don't know.
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:01.760]   I think you're right.
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:02.760]   That became the story though, Mary.
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:03.760]   I'm definitely in school.
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:05.320]   And they're overreacting in school.
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:07.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:08.320]   All right.
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:09.320]   Let's move along.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.960]   Oh, by the way, in July, I earned 31 leafs.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:16.320]   That's a leaf a day that put me in the five, top five percent of nesters.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:21.720]   And I've earned in the year 2006, 206, leafs.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:23.800]   I don't know what a leaf is.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.720]   Can you exchange them for?
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:26.720]   Nothing.
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:27.720]   No.
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.720]   Oh, yeah, that's an idea.
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:31.320]   I wouldn't mind that.
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:32.640]   By the way, good news.
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.320]   People with piercings and tattoos can now work in the T-Mobile store.
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:37.480]   You must be pretty happy about that, Mary.
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:38.480]   If this pebble thing--
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:40.960]   Yeah, well, you know, it's actually, I have something interesting to say about that.
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:48.080]   When I first moved to the West Coast, from Toronto to Vancouver, it was like the mid-90s.
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:54.760]   And it was a time when, you know, body modification was starting to become a big thing, I guess.
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:46:01.160]   And so I remember for a while there, you couldn't get a job if you had a tattoo or a piercings.
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:04.680]   And Seattle was really the first place that changed that.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:06.280]   Eventually they got to a point where--
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:10.200]   Someone told me that eventually they got to a point in the late '90s where so many people
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.360]   had tattoos and piercings.
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:15.160]   They couldn't find anybody to do the job, like work at the cashier at QFC.
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:17.280]   So they just had to break down and do it.
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.760]   So they had to break down and accept it.
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:24.320]   And I remember noticing that really obviously when I first visited Seattle in the late '90s
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:26.440]   and eventually I lived in Seattle.
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:27.600]   And you know, it doesn't surprise me.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:31.560]   I mean, actually what surprises me about this T-Mobile thing is that you mean just only
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:33.440]   now this is happening?
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:34.440]   You know?
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:37.240]   So you go in, you've got a piercing, they go, "Sorry, we can't use you."
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:38.240]   Oh, that's a change.
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:39.240]   Right.
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:40.240]   I'm reading Brad's--
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:41.240]   Don't Adrian needs a tattoo now.
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:43.880]   I'm reading Brad Stone's book about Amazon, which is great, the Everything Store.
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:49.000]   And he says, "One of the things Jeff Bezos did is he--when they were hiring people for
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.760]   the fulfillment centers in '98, I guess this was, he told the temp agencies, "Send me all
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:57.840]   your tattooed, pierced people, all the people who can't get jobs.
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:59.560]   I will use them in the fulfillment center."
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:04.640]   So he might have been one of the reasons Seattle started to open up for that, is that people
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.200]   could get work.
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.720]   So credit Jeff Bezos with that of all people.
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:09.720]   Good.
[00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:12.360]   We're going to come back in just a bit and talk more.
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:17.880]   I guess the FCC net neutrality issue will be our next topic.
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:25.960]   So prepare your rank at the blood pressure up, start--hold your breath, blow out.
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.840]   Our show today brought to you by Go To Meeting.
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:32.200]   If you have a client that is holding his breath while you pitch him, Go To Meeting is
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:33.200]   very useful.
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:38.680]   Go To Meeting is the best way to meet online, not just with clients, with coworkers anywhere.
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:41.040]   In the world, you can share the same screen.
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:43.880]   You can see each other face to face with HD video.
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:49.360]   I got to tell you, Go To Meeting is a great way, just one use case.
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:53.480]   If you're pitching somebody and you've got a PowerPoint presentation, they can see your
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:55.280]   presentation.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:59.000]   They can hear you, of course, because you get a free conference call line with it and
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.600]   everything is part of the deal.
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.920]   But they can also see you, but more importantly, you can see them.
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:06.200]   And I'll tell you, if you're pitching somebody the body language, the reaction you're getting
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:07.720]   really is important stuff.
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:10.120]   You don't want to leave that out.
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:14.720]   It's great if you have coworkers all over the world, as we all do now.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:19.120]   I know teams that keep Go To Meeting running all day because you pay one low flat rate
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:22.760]   for as many meetings as you want, as long as you want, so it's very economical.
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:27.080]   You'll increase productivity, you'll improve communication, you'll eliminate wasted business
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:28.080]   travel.
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:29.640]   It's nice not to have to do that.
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:30.640]   Go To Meeting.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:32.400]   You can even use it on a mobile device.
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.560]   You could present from an iPad.
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:39.880]   You sign up for Go To Meeting on your computer mobile device right now by visiting GoToMeeting.com.

[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.760]   a promo code," and put it in Twit.
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:57.800]   That way they'll know you heard it about it on this week in Tech.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:00.440]   Go To Meeting from Citrix.
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:02.800]   They just make it better and better all the time.
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:12.560]   It's a great way to present to meet, to collaborate online.
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:18.600]   This is a complicated story, and I think a little bit misrepresented.
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:27.600]   A Federal Appeals Court told the FCC that no, Verizon had sued them saying the FCC cannot
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:32.480]   enforce net neutrality, and the court said, "Yes."
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:36.880]   I think all the headlines were, "The end of net neutrality.
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:37.880]   It's over.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:39.440]   Nut neutrality is dead."
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:44.360]   I think it was more nuanced than this, but Patrick, you say you have a rant.
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:46.520]   Well, who am I?
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:48.160]   Patrick's rant.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:55.640]   My rant is about the result probably of the judgment.
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:59.200]   Maybe you want to explain how it all went down?
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:04.160]   A Federal Appeals Court, there's a good example.
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:05.160]   What is that?
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:06.160]   The Verge?
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.160]   The wrong words.
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:11.160]   How the FCC lost net neutrality and could kill the internet.
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:16.080]   The headlines are a bit sensational, but I think Neil Eisarticole is dead on it.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:17.080]   Really?
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:18.080]   He's a lawyer.
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:21.840]   Showcase is what happened and how it went wrong.
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:26.200]   The risk is certainly, net neutrality is at a risk, but I wouldn't be quite as spectacular
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:29.160]   in my headline, but hey.
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:31.160]   This goes back, frankly, to the previous chairman.
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:34.320]   The Kermit Chairman, I'm not convinced as a fan of net neutrality, either.
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:38.200]   Tom Wheeler is a former lobbyist for the cable industry.
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:47.560]   The previous chairman, Julius Genakowski, an Obama appointee, apparently made a tactical
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:49.360]   mistake.
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:54.040]   They did not classify broadband providers as common carriers.
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:59.120]   A common carrier is somebody that just passes information through the internet without preference.
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:05.080]   The court said that since you haven't declared these broadband providers as common carriers,
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:07.240]   you have no jurisdiction.
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:12.600]   The FCC does not regulate, and so you cannot enforce these rules.
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:16.840]   In fact, the judge writing the opinion said net neutrality is right.
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:21.800]   These are the right rules, but we cannot, the law is very clear.
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:27.080]   Judge David Tatel said the FCC should have some authority to regulate service providers,
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:34.960]   but until you say that they're a common carrier, Congress has not given you that power.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:40.800]   In fact, that's Verizon, basically was Verizon's argument that says to be regulated by Congress.
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:47.880]   Congress did not delegate that power to the FCC.
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:53.640]   The judge wrote, "The commission is adequately supported and explained its conclusion that
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:58.080]   absent rules such as those set forth in the open internet order, the net neutrality rules,
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:03.560]   broadband providers represent a threat to internet openness and could act in ways that
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:09.520]   would ultimately inhibit the speed and extent of future broadband deployment."
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:15.040]   The judge even said the broadband companies have a lot of financial incentive to discriminate
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:22.880]   on the internet, but the FCC doesn't have jurisdiction here, and so they can't stop
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:24.480]   that.
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:27.640]   What that means is you basically, I don't think it's the end of the internet or end of net
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:33.120]   neutrality, but that merely the FCC does not have the right to regulate it.
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:34.120]   Congress does.
[00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:38.880]   Now, I think if you care about this and you should, because we're already seeing AT&T
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:44.560]   propose things that absolutely violate net neutrality, then you should go to your member
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:53.120]   of Congress and say, "We need either to give the FCC this power or you need to assert this
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:59.560]   and adopt this open internet order and enforce it."
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:04.000]   So in the current situation, there are probably a couple of things that can happen.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:12.480]   I think in order to prevent the nightmare scenario that a lot of people are putting forth after
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:14.480]   this decision.
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:28.440]   First, the FCC could try to reclassify the French word is coming to be the internet providers
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:32.560]   and classify them as common carriers.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:38.320]   They didn't do that in 2002, as Nili Patel's article explained, and that was probably a
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:44.920]   little bit of, they didn't want to fight what would have been a huge fight.
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:48.280]   But if they want to do it now, it's going to be an even bigger fight.
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:52.680]   And it's probably not going to, it's going to be extremely difficult at least.
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:57.640]   The other thing that could happen is that they could go on a case-by-case basis if things
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:08.200]   go bad and if some of the service providers start doing deals that are really hurting the
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:14.360]   internet and the public interest, then they could regulate on specific instances that
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:17.080]   has not been prevented.
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:24.760]   So either of those things could safeguard the internet as we know it.
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:33.880]   My strong reaction was to the arguments that came out after that decision was made from
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:39.480]   a lot of people who were saying, "Actually, we don't want the FCC to regulate the internet.
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:45.080]   It's one of those, "I don't want the government in regulating things because the government
[00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:46.760]   can't do anything."
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:52.520]   So first of all, the court said, "Actually, the argument is valid.
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:55.640]   There is a danger there and it probably should be regulated."
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:56.920]   So that's the first point.
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:55:07.760]   And the second point is it always irks me significantly when people say, "We don't want
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:14.720]   X to regulate Y because some things do need to be regulated.
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:18.360]   You need to regulate the roads need to be regulated.
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:22.760]   You can't do just anything you want on the roads because there is a public interest in
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:26.320]   making sure that things go well when you're in your car.
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:33.080]   And in my opinion, I think in everyone who's listening here's opinion, the internet is
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:35.400]   a public utility.
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:38.160]   There's very little question about this.
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:45.080]   It's the same as electricity or running water or it's infrastructure.
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:46.360]   There's no question about this.
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:52.480]   And this for infrastructure, we need to make sure that not everything goes.
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:56.640]   So there's the words socialism come up very often.
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:01.640]   And that might be taking it a little bit too far maybe, but I come from a continent where
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:07.640]   you have some countries which are socialist and where things work really well.
[00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:16.520]   So it's the kind of absolutism where you decide that regulation is bad everywhere and that's
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:18.640]   really for political gain.
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:20.320]   It's a political agenda.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:26.320]   If something shouldn't be regulated, I absolutely agree, but some things should be regulated.
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:32.840]   And the internet is clearly a thing that needs to be safeguarded.
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:33.840]   Yeah, but do you want?
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:35.960]   I mean, here you're a French person.
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:36.960]   Yes.
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:42.440]   Do you want the American government to regulate the internet?
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:45.080]   They've been doing a fine job until now.
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:47.000]   I'll tell you what, let's get Denise Howell on the line.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.280]   They did a very good, I thought this week in law did a very good discussion on the line.
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:56.920]   On Monday of this decision and having a lawyer who understands these issues on, I think,
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:59.280]   might be beneficial to us here.
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:00.280]   I don't know.
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:02.000]   We're going to try to get her on via audio.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.920]   She can give us just a few minutes.
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:05.920]   Are you there, Denise?
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:06.920]   No.
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:07.920]   Okay.
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:08.920]   Chad's going to get her on.
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:11.400]   That's part of the debate, by the way.
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:15.880]   It's not a minor part of the debate is do you really want a government, any government
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:17.160]   regulating the internet?
[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:18.800]   I can't continue your job.
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:19.800]   I can't do that.
[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:20.800]   We're going to try to get to the next.
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:21.800]   Denise, get on the line.
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:24.000]   There's a key point there.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:27.680]   It's really not about, when you say it like this, it makes it sound like they're going
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:32.360]   to go in and decide who can do what and who can, you know, this is all right.
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:33.360]   This is not all right.
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:34.440]   That's really not what they're trying to do.
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:40.640]   They're just saying the internet should work the way it's worked until now.
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:44.080]   Everyone's information should be treated equally.
[00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:47.720]   That's not a really strong regulation.
[00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:53.840]   It's not like you start enacting 10 million different laws and deciding who can do what,
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:55.840]   where, when and how.
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:57.240]   You just, I think it's a nice one.
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:58.240]   It's one specific issue.
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:00.080]   Yes, go ahead, Miriam.
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:02.120]   I want to agree with Patrick.
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:04.680]   Part of it is because I'm Canadian and French as well.
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:06.680]   Look, the reality is this, okay.
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:12.360]   If you have a, to me, the carriers and the cable providers, the internet providers,
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:14.680]   it should be dumb pipes, right?
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:18.360]   That makes them into utilities instantly, right?
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:26.400]   So if the FCC should have the power to slap them on the wrist, if they start slowing down
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:33.120]   Skype traffic or slowing down Netflix because they have invested interest some other place.
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:36.720]   And that's exactly what I mean, what I think about when I think of regulation.
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:40.200]   It's not so much saying, you know, we're going to control the internet.
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:46.160]   It's more like, if you mess with this, if you with this, we're going to mess with you
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:52.760]   back because we don't think you're taking into account the betterment of the US people.
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:54.560]   Yeah, but you both come from socialist.
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:55.560]   It's very important.
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:56.560]   It's very important.
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:57.560]   It's very important.
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:01.640]   Let me, let me, let me, let me, let's get to the sun because I have one question.
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:02.640]   Hi, Denise.
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:05.200]   How thanks for joining us, host of this week in law.
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:08.760]   I appreciate you're doing this on short notice.
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:16.080]   My first question is why doesn't the FCC simply declare broadband providers, common carriers,
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:19.640]   and then say, and by the way, these are the rules?
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:25.120]   Well, the common answer to that question is that it would be really, really politically
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:28.960]   difficult to on the FCC if they did that.
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:29.960]   Okay.
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:32.520]   That they would face a lot of opposition on that front.
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:33.520]   There is a perception.
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:36.040]   What are the, what are the implications?
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:38.200]   What, what happens if they're a common carrier?
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:39.880]   Why is, why is that tough?
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:46.280]   Well, some people think that there's a lot more onerous regulation that will follow given
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:47.280]   that definition.
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:48.280]   Got it.
[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:50.120]   So the Campbells knows under the 10th.
[00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:51.120]   Right.
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:56.240]   And some people think, no, no, no, no, that the, you know, the FCC can do plenty under
[00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:59.440]   the other designation and it really doesn't make much difference.
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:07.840]   So, you know, it's, it's a, people say that it's a political decision with that designation.
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:14.800]   Personally, I have a hard time thinking information service, telecommunication service.
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:18.960]   How do you call the internet or broadband services is what we're talking about here?
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:23.560]   Either one, you know, I mean, I, I just have a really hard time getting my head around
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:27.920]   that and, and putting it into either one of those boxes.
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:33.320]   It seems like if they're a common, if they're a common carrier, that means that like the
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:39.640]   phone company, they're not responsible for the data that goes over the line that, you
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:43.880]   know, you can't go through the phone company because somebody plotted on a telephone call
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:44.960]   to do something.
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:45.960]   It's not their fault.
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:48.360]   They're a common carrier.
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:50.840]   It seems to me the internet should be a common carrier.
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:56.800]   I don't see why AT&T would even want responsibility for the bits that go over their internet.
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:57.800]   Can it?
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:58.800]   Don't.
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:05.040]   You know, very much section 230 of the Communications Decency Act is, is a huge umbrella.
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:06.040]   Yeah.
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:07.040]   Right.
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:14.120]   Is a huge umbrella for, for all kinds of unlawful activity that ISPs could otherwise be held
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:15.120]   responsible for.
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:19.960]   So who doesn't want them to be called common carriers?
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:26.640]   I, I believe it's the, the telco industry in general.
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:29.240]   They themselves don't want to be classified that way.
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:30.240]   No, they, they don't.
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:32.440]   Well, because they'd lose, they didn't have to be met.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.400]   Because they don't mean their companies.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:35.400]   Right.
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:36.400]   Right.
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:41.360]   Because they, because if, if they were common, classified as common carriers, they would,
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:48.960]   they couldn't do that deal that we've been hearing about where they will ask certain service
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:52.960]   services to pay for the bandwidth.
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:59.040]   That was actually a great conversation on, on, on this weekend law, which I listened earlier.
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:04.240]   And there were excellent points on both sides of the, of the debate, but it seems very clear
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:10.440]   that the only reason that these telcos would not want to be classified as common carriers
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:14.360]   is that they want to treat different types of data differently.
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:16.240]   They want extract more money.
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.760]   They don't want net neutrality.
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:21.040]   They want to do like AT&T is doing with the sponsored data plan.
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:26.400]   They want to say to Netflix, you know, if you was to give us some extra money, we could,
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:30.480]   we could tell our customers that you don't cost anything and they'd use you more and say
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.360]   to YouTube or Twit.
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:34.120]   By the way, you didn't give us any money.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:36.320]   So you're going to cost more for the customers.
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.760]   That's exactly what we're afraid of happening.
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:39.760]   Right.
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:46.080]   But, but I, I got to say, I mean, I've always been a huge advocate of net neutrality.
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:53.080]   And I've always been sort of viscerally drawn to the concept that you, we need regulation
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:56.080]   to make sure that those deals don't happen.
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:01.920]   But having, you know, had the discussion that we had on Twill this week and having gone
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:09.880]   through a bit of the DC circuits decision and reasoning on this, there, there is something
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:16.920]   to be said for letting the market make a bit of the decisions on this.
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:19.400]   Is that what Judge To Tell was proposing?
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:28.000]   Yes, that's definitely, there was a huge emphasis on, you know, what you can do FCC,
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.080]   you know, under your mandate and authority.
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:39.040]   So less a question of, you know, laissez-faire, what is the market going to do as far as
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:40.560]   the court is concerned?
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:42.280]   But that's the impact, right?
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:49.600]   That we now have some opportunity to let this play out.
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:58.120]   And yes, I am, I am concerned that networks like ours or, or, you know, I mean ours, ours
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:00.360]   is pretty well established.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:09.240]   Having more fringe kinds of startups will be impacted by these sort of sponsored data
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:12.360]   deals.
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:19.640]   But the only way that that might end up having a really detrimental impact is if people jump
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:24.680]   on board and say, "Oh yeah, all I need is who's in the sponsored data plan and I don't
[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:27.080]   want access to the full internet."
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:31.440]   You know, it's really going to be consumer demand that drives this.
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:35.680]   And Leo, do you really think that people are going to turn their back on having full
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:36.680]   internet access?
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:43.920]   I mean, don't you think that people have been conditioned now that they want access to whatever
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:45.160]   they want on the web?
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:47.280]   I think it influences people's decisions.
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:50.120]   People are economic entities.
[01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:56.720]   And I think that if you as a user know that you could watch videos on Netflix and it won't
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:02.080]   go against your data cap or cost you money, but that if you watch the same video on another
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:03.480]   service, it will.
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:05.920]   You're going to choose Netflix every time.
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:09.680]   Now whether people will watch Twitter is not, and I said this last week, I don't think
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:15.080]   it affects Twitter particularly, but it very well might affect new companies coming into
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:20.120]   the business who would have to make that calculation, "Gosh, if I'm not willing to pay
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:25.360]   AT&T for sponsored access, am I going to be disadvantaged?"
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:27.560]   And a new company might very well be.
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:32.160]   You have to pay AT&T, and then you have to pay Verizon and all of them.
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:35.360]   I can guarantee you, I'm never paying nobody for nothing.
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:38.400]   I do think that there's plenty of opportunity.
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:40.800]   You're already paying for your business.
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:41.800]   Right.
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:42.800]   I agree.
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:46.400]   That if it winds up being a problem, there's plenty of opportunity and the court gave the
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:52.400]   FCC a roadmap for how it can write net neutrality rules that will be enforceable.
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:06:01.960]   And if it wound up being problematic and fringe players were being edged out, then I think
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:03.720]   that the FCC would step in.
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:04.720]   That's the key.
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:08.480]   So I think the court, that's why I don't feel like it's such, did you read Neil Eis article
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:09.480]   Denise?
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:10.480]   I haven't yet.
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:12.600]   No, and I'm glad to know that he looked at this in depth.
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:17.560]   He felt like it was a much more negative thing than I feel like you thought it was.
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:20.120]   Your panel thought it was on Twitter or I think it was.
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:21.440]   Which is, they gave him a roadmap.
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:23.480]   He said, "Look, if you want to enforce this, you can.
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:24.480]   This is how."
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:28.840]   Or maybe it's up to us writing to Congress and saying, "Congress needs to either empower
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:32.720]   the FCC to do this or write its own regulations."
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:36.280]   So you think that it's prudent just to say, "Let's wait and see if this becomes a problem
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:37.520]   and then act."
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:38.520]   I do.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:40.760]   I think this is a wait and see.
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:46.440]   And also, there could actually be some beneficial aspects to this.
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:49.280]   First of all, one thing to bear in mind.
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:50.720]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:55.560]   One thing to bear in mind is that wireless and wired are already treated differently as
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:07:00.880]   far as the FCC's authority to impose net neutrality limits.
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:03.600]   And for good reason, I think for good economic reason.
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:04.600]   Right.
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.800]   The technology is very different.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:07.800]   Right.
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:13.680]   So wireless is already sort of the Wild Wild West as far as what the telcos can do.
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:19.560]   And you notice that AT&T announced their sponsored data plan at CES before this decision ever
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:20.560]   came out.
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:21.560]   Right.
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:22.560]   They knew that they could make it do that.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:25.800]   But I want to jump in here because this is, wireless is the stuff I know the best.
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:28.560]   And I think you're right.
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:32.320]   I mean, on one hand, and this is why I'm not too freaked out about this, is net neutrality
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:35.080]   has never really officially existed on wireless.
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:37.480]   So and it doesn't seem to be a huge issue.
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.480]   Right.
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:41.840]   I mean, obviously, there are many issues with wireless carriers right now.
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:45.680]   I'd like them to all be dumbpipes and I'd like the prices to go down significantly and
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:48.000]   that's not being the case.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:53.200]   But there's a big, big, big, huge difference between internet service providers that are
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:08:01.240]   wired like Comcast or even AT&T, which provides fiber and DSL to the wireless companies.
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:06.000]   Because even though they're one of the same in many cases, the wireless spectrum belongs
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.600]   to the US people.
[01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:08.600]   Okay.
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:13.280]   Let's never forget that the FCC's job is to regulate that.
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:17.960]   And I don't like the fact that the FCC has no way to enforce anything.
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:19.200]   That's a very good point.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:20.760]   And that is my problem.
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:25.880]   And I think that this just reinforces the fact that the FCC is worthless in the US.
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:30.680]   Well, you make such a good point because this is our airwaves that the wireless providers
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:32.640]   are using.
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:35.040]   And it's and it is absolutely FCC regulated.
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:36.280]   They auction the airwaves off.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:37.880]   They give people the right to use.
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:43.080]   That's a why can the FCC approach it that way Denise, at least with the wireless carriers.
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:50.040]   The last mile for many people who are on like, I have a SP level like who get internet to
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:53.280]   their house is often wireless nowadays.
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:56.680]   So it means that users, these FCC's spectrum.
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:09:00.200]   And so like this is my whole argument about this.
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:01.200]   Yeah.
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:07.920]   And I think, you know, going forward, certainly wireless is the way things will be and that
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.800]   people want things to be.
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:13.080]   Wired is very, very important.
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:18.880]   Wired is libraries and businesses and homes and schools as we sit here today.
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:21.000]   And that's a huge chunk.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:29.160]   But as we move forward, all of those established wired internet access points are going to
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:30.840]   move more toward wireless.
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:36.560]   And I think that's something I am not the person to sit here and try and explain the
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:38.560]   FCC's authority in mandate.
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:42.040]   That's not something that's very much in my wheelhouse.
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:47.800]   And I encourage people to go check out our last episode of this week in law where we
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:54.720]   had two very good law professors on this point to, they didn't really address, I got
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:57.000]   to say, that particular issue.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:02.880]   But they are people who would be much more able to address that than I am.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:09.760]   But I do think it's a good point that the FCC's authority is certainly fluid.
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:17.240]   And that's why this decision has been so up in the air for so long and until the case
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:21.960]   was argued, it wasn't really clear how this particular federal court was going to rule
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:22.960]   on it.
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.760]   I mean, it's kind of an open question.
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:25.760]   Will there be an appeal?
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:28.640]   Will the FCC go to the Supreme Court on this?
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:32.320]   It's possible that there hasn't been any statement by the chairman that that's going
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:33.320]   to happen.
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:34.360]   And there's no guarantee how this would come down.
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:39.240]   It seems to me that the rule of law that the appeals court argued is pretty clear.
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:43.880]   And I would guess the Supreme Court would not overturn, would not review it, would just
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:44.880]   say.
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:49.680]   You never know what the Supreme Court thinks it's an important enough issue and that the
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:55.240]   district court has trot all over the authority of the FCC or that that's even a possibility.
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:56.720]   They may well take it up.
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:01.080]   Denise Howell, the host of this week in law, do listen to Friday's episode for much more
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:02.080]   on this subject.
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:04.600]   I'm so glad we could get you on in short notice.
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:05.600]   Thank you, Denise.
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:06.600]   Me too.
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:07.600]   Thanks, you guys.
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:08.600]   Have a great time.
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:09.600]   I appreciate it.
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:10.600]   Take care.
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.200]   Meanwhile, the world wrestling, what do you call it?
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.400]   WWE, what does that stand for?
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:16.360]   World Wrestling Entertainment announced at CES.
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:17.360]   Watch out, Netflix.
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:25.640]   We're going to stream for $10 a month unlimited wrestling on demand.
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:27.640]   And they're doing it with peering arrangements.
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:31.480]   So they're avoiding this whole issue, which is kind of interesting.
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:34.520]   I just think it's so technical and so interesting.
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:41.800]   But I did want to really kind of at least say it may not be the end of the world, folks.
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:44.240]   Despite all these headlines, net neutrality is dead.
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:47.360]   I think it's far from it's not dead yet.
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:51.680]   I think that's a point that this week in law makes very well.
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:59.520]   There are certainly other ways that if things go bad, the FCC could correct the course
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:00.520]   in other ways.
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:07.960]   And it's still, there's no, I'm going to launch back into the thing.
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:11.520]   Well, I think we have to defend the Internet.
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.440]   We all agree you have to defend the Internet.
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:14.440]   Exactly.
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:15.440]   And that's the thing.
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:23.040]   There's no good comes out of the service providers being able to treat bits differently.
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.040]   No good at all.
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:25.040]   I agree.
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:26.040]   There's no upside.
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:27.640]   So that's what upsets me the most.
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:31.200]   I think Denise brought some really interesting perspective into the discussion.
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:36.200]   And I think to me, it's like, because right now wireless is not net neutral, like there's
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:41.760]   no regulation on that on wireless, I'm not too concerned that they've upheld this on
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:42.760]   wired.
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:43.760]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:44.760]   Like, I don't think it's going to change too much.
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:47.080]   Like, I'm not alarmist about it.
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:50.520]   But I think my, it's kind of a wait and see attitude for me.
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:55.720]   What I do wish though, and it bothers me that this ruling happened the way it did, is
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:13:00.280]   that the FCC, like from years and years ago now just doesn't have any power in this country.
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:05.280]   And this goes back to what Patrick was talking about, you know, should the government have
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:06.280]   that power, right?
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.480]   I think they should if it owns the airwaves, right?
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:12.400]   If the people owns the airwaves, then the government should have that power.
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:13.800]   That was such a good point.
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.840]   And I'm really glad you made that point.
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:18.600]   That that is our own resource.
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:19.600]   That's the thing.
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:23.640]   If not the FCC, who is the representative of the people in the government, then who
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:25.520]   is going to say what you can do with them?
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:29.520]   If you don't want the FCC to do it, then sure, no one's ever going to say anything about
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:30.520]   it.
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:34.280]   I think anybody who has lived in America for any length of time knows that it is not the
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:38.680]   government that gets to decide these things, but commercial interests that politics are
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:41.600]   absolutely a balancing of the commercial interests.
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:42.600]   Yeah.
[01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:43.600]   If you talk to somebody like Sam--
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:44.600]   Which looks how fine, by the way.
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:49.480]   I don't want people to think that I'm this weird, you know, communist monster.
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:54.400]   I think it was out fine in many ways.
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:14:03.200]   It's just that in some, sometimes some specific instances, the free market can go as que a
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:04.200]   little bit.
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:05.200]   I absolutely agree.
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:09.880]   And there are some very clear places where government regulation, you know, and antitrust
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:13.440]   law, and I think frankly, internet neutrality is one of them.
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:14.440]   Yeah.
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:15.440]   Anyway, good discussion.
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:16.680]   Listen to that this week in law.
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:17.680]   Really fabulous.
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:19.480]   We're going to take a break coming up.
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:21.120]   Some interesting things this week.
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:24.840]   In fact, Amazon says it's going to announce a product that's bigger than the Kindle I
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:25.840]   will ask you guys.
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:30.080]   Give you a chance to think about it and I will ask you guys, Guy and Gao, what do you think?
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:32.320]   What could possibly be bigger than the Kindle?
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:36.120]   Before we do that though, let's see what Mike Elgin is planning in the week ahead, Mike.
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:37.880]   It's a big week for earnings reports.
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:41.680]   IBM and Verizon have a call on Tuesday, eBay and Netflix on Wednesday.
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:45.120]   Microsoft and Nokia on Thursday and Samsung on Friday.
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:49.760]   The North American Bitcoin conference starts Saturday in Miami, Florida and yes, attendees
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:52.880]   can pay for their registration using Bitcoin.
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:53.880]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:56.320]   How much Bitcoin do you have, Patrick Bezha?
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:00.000]   I have about 0.0 single Bitcoin.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.000]   How about you, Miriam?
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.840]   How much Bitcoin do you have?
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:05.120]   I miss that boat.
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:06.120]   I have seven.
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.120]   Seven.
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:08.120]   Wow.
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:09.120]   That's not bad.
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:14.080]   Because we put on the front page of the Twitter website, donate via Bitcoin and people have
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:16.360]   generously donated seven Bitcoins.
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:20.360]   I'm just going to hold them until they're worth 40,000 each, then I'm retiring.
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:21.360]   That's really smart.
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:23.160]   I'm going to put that up on my blog too.
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:24.160]   Yeah.
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:27.120]   That's the best way to get them because you don't have to really worry about all this stuff.
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:30.840]   By the way, it's absolutely impossible at this point to do any Bitcoin mining.
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:33.160]   I mean, it's just gotten out of control.
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:34.920]   You have to have a huge amount of power.
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:35.920]   I read an article.
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:38.120]   There was an article that was in the New York Times about Guy.
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:39.120]   He does this.
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.680]   This is all he does.
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:47.400]   His whole house is taken over with cooling, big ASIC computers.
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:49.600]   I mean, it's crazy.
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:50.600]   Crazy.
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:51.600]   Is that him?
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:57.880]   It's probably costing him more in electricity than he's going to be on Bitcoin's getting.
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:15:58.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:15:59.880]   It's basically crazy speculation.
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:00.880]   Was that the article maybe?
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:01.880]   Okay.
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:02.880]   It was Bloomberg Business Week.
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:03.880]   Yeah, I think it was.
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:04.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:05.880]   It was.
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:06.880]   You know why?
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:10.520]   Because it was written by Ashley and Brad.
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:15.240]   And we had Brad on and that's why I noticed it.
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:16.800]   It's crazy stuff.
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:18.440]   We'll talk about that in a lot more.
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.160]   And what is Amazon up to?
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:24.080]   But first a word from my favorite, favorite place for audio entertainment.
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:27.280]   No, it's not Twit.tv, although it's pretty good.
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:32.880]   It's audible.com, the best bookstore of audio books.
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:34.040]   It is such a lifesaver.
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:35.920]   I'm such a huge fan of audible.com.
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:38.880]   I first discovered them when I was a community of San Francisco.
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:42.760]   Spending two or three hours a day in the car going to tech TV.
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:47.320]   And Audible kept me from really probably kept saved my life, probably kept me from road
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:50.320]   rage, from crashes, from falling asleep.
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:55.320]   I have listened over 500 books on Audible and I can so heartily recommend audible.com.
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:58.680]   The Brad Stone book I just mentioned, the everything store.
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.320]   That's what I'm listening to right now.
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:04.440]   Really interesting book about Amazon, about Jeff Bezos.
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:08.480]   Did you know Jeff Bezos's biological father was a circus performer?
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:11.960]   Is it the number one unicyclist in all of New Mexico?
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:12.960]   That explains everything.
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:14.720]   It does.
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.520]   It does.
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:18.680]   It's just, but it's also a good business book.
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:22.360]   It talks about all the decisions that Bezos made all along.
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:23.720]   Look, here's why I'm mentioning this.
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:28.720]   First of all, obviously Audible is a sponsor, but if you go to audible.com/twit2, you can
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:31.000]   buy free two books.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.040]   It's not buying, is it?
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:33.920]   You can get two books for free.
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:36.320]   What we're going to basically do is set you up with the platinum account.
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:37.800]   That's two books a month.
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:39.080]   The first 30 days are free.
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:40.320]   Pay nothing in the first 30 days.
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.440]   Cancel anytime those two books will be yours to keep.
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:46.320]   The everything store be a great one to start with.
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:53.360]   My next listen, I think is going to be Dogfight, Fred Vogelstein's book about Google and Apple.
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:18:01.000]   If you're interested in tech, there has been in the last year a spate of great books
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:07.800]   about hatching Twitter from Nick Bilton, Leander Connie's Johnny Ive book.
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:09.280]   There's all sorts of stuff.
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:10.280]   There's fiction.
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:11.280]   There's nonfiction.
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:12.280]   There's science fiction.
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:14.880]   Really is no limit to the kinds of audio entertainment you can get.
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:18.920]   In fact, frankly, at this point, if a new book comes out, it's going to not only come
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:22.720]   out in paper in a bookstore, but it's going to come out on audible.com, which is really,
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:23.720]   really fun.
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:27.480]   I haven't read this, but the chatroom saying I should read Robert Gates' memoir, "Duty,"
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:35.920]   which just came out, talks about his experience as secretary of defense for both George Bush
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:39.360]   and Barack Obama.
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.360]   Should be very interesting.
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:42.120]   I'll put that on my list too.
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:45.240]   There's nothing like, I love this on the upper right here on my page.
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:46.240]   Two credits available.
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:49.520]   I love that feeling because I also have a platinum account.
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:52.600]   Two credits a month and man, I just, I just, what am I going to listen to next?
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:53.880]   What am I going to listen to next?
[01:18:53.880 --> 01:19:01.120]   I want you to get those two credits for yourself, audible.com/twit2 and do a little listening
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:02.840]   and audible.
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:04.760]   I think you're going to, I think you're going to like it, but you know what?
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:09.560]   If you don't know big deal, you cancel in the first 30 days, you'll pay nothing.
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:11.200]   Some scary books too.
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:12.200]   Look at this.
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:21.840]   This would be a young adult, Hollow City, Mrs. Peregrins, peculiar children.
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:25.320]   If you've got a teenager or a young adult at home, there's a great, it's a great way
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:26.520]   to get them into reading.
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:27.520]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:31.240]   Thank you Audible for your support.
[01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:34.080]   So Amazon's gotten a, are you going either of you?
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:35.080]   No, you're not going either.
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:36.400]   You're going to the Amazon event.
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:39.040]   I'm not going to the Amazon event.
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.400]   But they say it's some big announcement.
[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:43.400]   Twelve inch Kindle.
[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:46.360]   No, they did that already, didn't they?
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:47.960]   Oh, the DX was.
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:48.960]   DX was.
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:49.960]   And they killed it.
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:50.960]   Oh, it was only, it was too small.
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:51.960]   I don't know.
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:54.280]   I mean, okay, 15 inch Kindle.
[01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:58.080]   That's a little bit too big.
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:01.480]   I think it could be a smartphone.
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:04.120]   Do you think?
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:07.320]   So this is coming up Thursday.
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:09.920]   Wait a minute, no, that's the old one.
[01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:10.920]   When is the announcement?
[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:12.600]   I have to find it.
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:15.640]   I think it's coming up in the next week or so.
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:21.840]   They say the guy, they said it's going to be bigger than the Kindle.
[01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:24.640]   I'm waiting for this announcement.
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:29.880]   This, the smartphone announcement, don't you think that they could do a free smartphone
[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:31.720]   or a very, very cheap smartphone?
[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:32.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:35.800]   This has been a long last theory of mine.
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:39.400]   And Bezos is certainly ambitious enough.
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:41.120]   January 30th, that's the date.
[01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:44.120]   So we got a little time.
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:48.160]   It's called the V1 product.
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:50.840]   It'll be in Boston.
[01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:55.840]   It's from the KNI team, the Kindle new initiatives team.
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:58.680]   What if we're a Kindle phone?
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:03.280]   Kindle Watch, just kidding.
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:09.240]   So Kindle phone, I've had this theory that they could use whisper net to provide us up.
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:11.880]   Basically a free phone, like, you know, almost free.
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:12.880]   Right.
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:16.400]   So that's, but then again, it goes, it brings up this whole net neutrality discussion we
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:22.440]   had because my theory would be that they do this, but that you don't buy, you know,
[01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:23.640]   you can buy more, right?
[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:26.440]   In the same way as you can buy more with Kindle right now.
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:30.480]   So and the way you buy this subscriptions, you're like, I want all the books I can eat.
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:35.160]   So it's like 599 or 999 a month, right?
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:39.440]   And then you add, like it gives you basic data, you know, very simple, like 100 makes
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:43.800]   free or whatever, like Google does and T-Mobile does on their tablets.
[01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:48.320]   But then, you know, you basically don't pay for data amounts.
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.320]   You pay for like features.
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:51.800]   Do you want Amazon video?
[01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:53.640]   You pay five bucks.
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:58.080]   So that's, I think what I see them doing because it's, and unfortunately that goes against
[01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:02.240]   all the things we, we want as, you know, keeping things that neutral.
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:06.240]   And, and if anybody's going to destroy net neutrality, it's definitely Jeff Bezos.
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:07.240]   Right.
[01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:09.400]   I mean, no, Jeff's a good guy.
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:11.440]   I know Jeff's a good guy like Jeff.
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:14.240]   I'm just saying that, that I could see him doing it.
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:17.600]   Like I could see him finding a way to make it work.
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.640]   And then it sets an example that we don't really want to have.
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:22.240]   Well, they're in a unique position.
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:27.760]   And you know, you compare this to Apple, Amazon said, Ken Bezos said, we don't have to make
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:28.920]   money on the Kindle.
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:33.240]   We make money when you use the Kindle, which is very difficult for a company like Apple
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:34.240]   to compete against.
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:36.920]   They have to make money on the iPad on every sale.
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:39.800]   There's no, you know, they're make a little money afterwards on the iTunes store, but
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:42.920]   nothing, nothing like Amazon could make.
[01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:43.920]   And they could do this.
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:44.920]   I think they could do the same thing with the phone.
[01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:49.800]   It'd be probably an Android phone with Amazon unique skinning as they do with the Kindle
[01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:51.880]   because that's, that's Android.
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:53.760]   That avoids the cost of the operating system.
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:55.840]   They could probably make it fairly cheaply.
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:23:00.240]   And if it's a gateway to purchases on Amazon and not, and by the way, I mean, it's not
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:01.240]   just books anymore.
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:06.520]   It's movies, it's TV shows, Amazon streaming is fantastic.
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:07.520]   So I can see a deal where you know.
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:10.960]   How about they give you a phone with, with your prime subscription?
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:11.960]   Perfect example.
[01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:12.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:13.960]   Yeah.
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:16.720]   And then you, if you want the unlimited internet, you do pay more.
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:17.720]   Yeah.
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:22.160]   Because, because by default, all this is in, this is a window into Amazon's ecosystem.
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:26.760]   So when you get the phone, you get phone calls, you get X and you get, you know, access to
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:28.520]   maybe, you know, some basic internet stuff.
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:30.840]   And then you mostly get access to all the Amazon stuff.
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:31.840]   Right.
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:33.720]   I don't see them giving away the internet for free.
[01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:34.720]   No.
[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:35.720]   I think it's.
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:40.240]   But they, as you said, with WhisperNet, to people who don't know what that is, your Kindle
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:42.680]   is automatically forever online.
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:45.920]   I think it's Sprint they're using, right?
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:46.920]   Not anymore.
[01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:47.920]   I think it's 18.
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:48.920]   Oh, it's now 18 to you.
[01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:49.920]   Okay.
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:52.600]   And so, so you get, you know, there's no, there's a crappy browser.
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:55.680]   It's not like you could really use it for internet access, but you do get kind of.
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:56.680]   Yeah.
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:24:00.480]   Remember, you're, you're, you were talking about Kindle OS, which is on the Kindle Fire,
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:05.080]   but WhisperNet is only the syncing service for the e-reader.
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:06.080]   Exactly.
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:09.800]   So it's not like you get the internet for free on your Kindle Fire.
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:13.440]   It's really just, it's that you do, because it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:14.960]   do they have the L team one?
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:16.680]   XC doesn't have free data.
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:19.720]   And then if you pay more, you get a few hundred megabytes, something like that.
[01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:20.720]   Yeah.
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:21.720]   That's what I'm talking about.
[01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:25.400]   I call it WhisperNet, but to me, WhisperNet is anything that gives you basically free
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:28.080]   data to kind of hook you in.
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:30.120]   And of course, who's going to carry it?
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:31.120]   Team Mobile.
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:33.320]   I don't know.
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:36.000]   I think they have enough of a deal where they change the internet.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.920]   I just surprised to see them changing it.
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:38.920]   All right.
[01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:39.920]   And you know what?
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:40.920]   Here's my theory.
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:41.920]   Okay.
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:42.920]   You would never know which carrier they use.
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:43.920]   If they don't mention it.
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:44.920]   No, they don't mention it.
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:45.920]   That's right.
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:48.160]   If Bezos does it right, this is an Amazon ecosystem, fully integrated thing.
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:51.880]   You don't even know and they can change the carrier anytime they want, because they don't
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:52.880]   care.
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:56.120]   They don't, they want you to pay Amazon or part of your prime subscription or whatever.
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:57.120]   Yeah.
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:58.120]   And here's my theory.
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:01.360]   You'll see Apple do the same thing.
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:06.840]   What you'll see is Apple will walk to AT&T and Verizon with $10 billion in cash and say,
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:10.120]   "Year, give us all the data you can give us."
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:16.200]   And basically, so poor all this network-wise, and we will sell iPhones and iPads and other
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:22.360]   devices at the Apple Store that people pay through iTunes to get connectivity to the internet.
[01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:27.600]   And then they're going to, and then, you know, and then what's going to happen is if
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:32.520]   that's successful, if AT&T or Verizon makes money with this, I think it'd be AT&T, by
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:36.480]   the way, then they're going to say to Verizon, "Here's $10 billion.
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:38.320]   We also want you to be a provider."
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:41.760]   And we automatically switch based on what the signal is best.
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:45.320]   And then they'll talk to international carriers and then they'll be able to use your iPhone
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:46.320]   and iPad anywhere.
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:47.320]   Yeah.
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:48.320]   And that's all.
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:49.320]   Are you fantasizing now?
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:50.320]   This is fantasizing.
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:53.520]   You've been about this for a long, long time.
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:55.520]   I've talked about this on many podcasts.
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:57.080]   It's very possible.
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:02.800]   And if the only, we need a spark and the spark is Amazon doing it and doing it right.
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:07.320]   And if you have that, then basically what happens is the carrier really becomes a dump
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:10.720]   pipe because you pay Apple for your data service.
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:11.720]   And whether you pay-
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:14.120]   I'm not sure we want that either.
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:15.120]   But-
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:16.560]   No, no, but I'm not saying it's right.
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:20.240]   I'm just saying that I can see this happening because then Apple has full control of the
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:21.800]   user experience, right?
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:22.800]   Yeah.
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:25.960]   Because when you go to Europe, your phone just works.
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:26.960]   Wow.
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:28.440]   You have to do anything.
[01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:30.320]   It picks the best carrier.
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:34.120]   And then at the time, wherever you are, and you've paid for this as part of your iTunes
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:35.120]   subscription.
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:37.800]   I don't think people go into Europe.
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:42.280]   I don't think people going to Europe is a big enough problem for Apple to solve that
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:45.040]   they will need to go and to enter that incredibly-
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:46.040]   Hi.
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:47.040]   I don't know.
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:50.880]   I think all these companies understand that international is the next frontier.
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:54.480]   No, Timon will give it away international everywhere.
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:55.480]   Yes.
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:56.480]   Love it.
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:58.720]   It's only edge, but it's something.
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:26:59.720]   And it makes me-
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:00.880]   That's the phone I'm carrying.
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:03.360]   I'm never again paying AT&T for international roaming.
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:09.400]   Sure, but the answer is to reduce the roaming costs, which are ridiculously inflated.
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:11.440]   Isn't that happening now in the EU?
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:12.440]   Am I wrong, Patrick?
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.440]   Yeah.
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:14.440]   No, you're right.
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:22.800]   You know, one of the examples of regulation being positive, the EU is imposing on phone
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:30.200]   service providers all over Europe to, ultimately in a few years, they won't be able to charge
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:33.040]   for roaming more than they do in their local country.
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:37.600]   So basically, you will be one big region and you can use any carrier in the EU.
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:39.760]   But you see, you're missing the point, Patrick.
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:41.760]   There's no roaming with what I'm talking about.
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:44.240]   There's agreement with each country.
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:49.120]   So, just them, whatever is in your phone, is automatically switching.
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:54.080]   But the reason you need it now, Miriam, is that the roaming charges are really expensive.
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:55.600]   Oh, that's terrible.
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:59.840]   If you get the roaming charges down to a reasonable level, then you don't need that-
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:01.480]   I thought that was happening this month.
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:03.240]   So it's a slow rollout.
[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:05.200]   Oh, yeah, it's a slow rollout.
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:06.840]   And ultimately, I think it's-
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:11.320]   I'm not sure so I'm not going to say anything, but ultimately you'll be able to subscribe
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:18.640]   to any phone service provider from Europe, from any other country.
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:25.520]   And that's a very good example of the industry not being regulated for so long.
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:28.480]   For good reason, there's historical reasons for that.
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:37.840]   But the incumbents establishing prices, incredibly high prices, wherever they could, and getting
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:39.840]   away with it because there was no regulation.
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:44.520]   The only reason I might not agree with you, Miriam, is that Amazon has had historically
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:48.400]   very bad- not been very good internationally.
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:50.960]   Yeah, but no, but Amazon would not do the international thing.
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:55.520]   Amazon would be the spark that would give Apple or Google to do this big.
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:56.520]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:28:56.520 --> 01:29:00.400]   It'd be successful enough that they'd be looking at it and go, "We want an integrated
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:03.600]   vertical experience for our customer that does not involve a carrier anymore."
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:04.600]   And so-
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:06.640]   You want a crazy Amazon story.
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:12.400]   They have just patented the idea of shipping items before the customer orders them.
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:13.400]   I saw that.
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:14.400]   That's an interesting one.
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:18.840]   So they know that they have enough data about what you buy on Amazon that they know that
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:21.280]   you're likely to buy something.
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:25.400]   And so what they do is they pre-ship it to the nearest fulfillment center on the off
[01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:28.080]   chance you do order it.
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:29.360]   And that way they're going to see it fast.
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:31.000]   You before you even order it.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.360]   No, no, you don't get it.
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:35.040]   Although that would be very interesting if you got it ahead.
[01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:38.560]   There was a funny video about a guy who made-
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:44.320]   Yeah, it was Amazon tomorrow or Amazon yesterday that would send you the thing you were
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:45.680]   going to order on the name.
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:48.760]   Well, if you read this book, and I know I keep plugging this book, but if you read
[01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:53.760]   this book, it's because it's very clear that Bezos understands what Amazon's advantages
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:58.360]   and disadvantages are and the big disadvantage that they have over brick and mortar stores
[01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:02.880]   is it takes a day to get the product at least.
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:05.560]   And so if they could get it to you same day, that's why they're thinking about drones.
[01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:09.800]   That's not a stretch for them because they really want that product to be in your hand
[01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:12.680]   as fast as a brick and mortar could store can do it.
[01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:18.200]   So how about, okay, I'm going to use a sports metaphor here and show you how sporty I am.
[01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:21.560]   How about they come out of left field and announce a TV?
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:24.400]   Was that an appropriate Amazon TV?
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:25.400]   Amazon TV.
[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:26.400]   A Kindle TV.
[01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:27.400]   I could be interested.
[01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:32.360]   You have some kind with that because, you know, they're pushing a lot with the Kindle,
[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:36.520]   I'm sorry, the Amazon Prime Original Video Content.
[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:42.240]   I don't, honestly, we would have heard about, you know, there would have been leaks if something
[01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:43.560]   like that was going to happen.
[01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:49.320]   But maybe, you know, the Boston Globe says, no, it's just a hiring event.
[01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:51.320]   They're going to announce anything.
[01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:52.320]   So we'll move on.
[01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:53.320]   We'll see January 30th.
[01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:54.520]   That'll be the announcement.
[01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:58.520]   We shall see what what comes up.
[01:30:58.520 --> 01:30:59.520]   Let's take a break.
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:01.920]   When we come back a little bit more, we'll wrap it up.
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:10.960]   The first massively online master's degree program in computer science.
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:16.760]   We could talk about the target malware, the history.
[01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:21.000]   You know, there's a big 30th anniversary this week.
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.360]   We'll talk about that more in just a bit.
[01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:30.800]   Our guests, the only two people who are not following gridiron, Patrick Bejaw from France
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:34.800]   and Miriam Jois from wherever she lives, it's magic land.
[01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:36.440]   But San Francisco.
[01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:37.840]   Close enough.
[01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:41.280]   There's land where all phones will someday be free.
[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:43.840]   I like it.
[01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:47.160]   I like it from the land of milk and honey, Miriam Jois.
[01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:50.360]   We are talking today about carbonite online backup at Talia.
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:54.200]   If you are, you know, tax times coming, I bet you have all your financial records and
[01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:55.200]   your hard drive.
[01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:56.360]   Just think what's on your hard drive these days.
[01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:57.760]   Your whole life is there.
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:59.560]   If it were to die, would you die?
[01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:00.560]   Yeah.
[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:02.720]   You know, and if you're a small business, you might be out of business.
[01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:05.240]   Sure, you're backing it up next to your computer.
[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:07.080]   But what if there's a fire, a flood of tsunami?
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:08.960]   That could be even worse.
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:13.080]   Whether you have one computer at home or several at your small business, carbonite, backs your
[01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:18.720]   files up to the cloud automatically, continually, whenever you're online, you can access those

[01:32:54.680 --> 01:33:00.240]   Thank you so much for their support of this week in tech.
[01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:05.920]   Is it a big deal that's spotify?
[01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:06.920]   Here's spotify.
[01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:08.440]   Webstream has always been free.
[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:13.160]   But I think globally now, Patrick, it's free, right?
[01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:14.800]   On the web, it's always been free.
[01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:17.800]   It has been, right?
[01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:18.800]   Yeah.
[01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:25.560]   But, yeah, they're competing with the big thing there is the rise of services like
[01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:30.480]   RDO and RDO says, "No, it's free on the web for all US users."
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:33.080]   That's a big deal, right?
[01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:39.400]   So, yeah, they've had to do to change a lot of things to compete with these new services,
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:41.120]   which is probably good for the consumer.
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:42.840]   But I don't think it's a huge deal.
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:44.480]   Might be bad for musicians, though.
[01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:48.200]   God, it just can't be any money now in these businesses.
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:49.840]   I don't understand how it works.
[01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:53.240]   AOL has finally called it quits on patch.
[01:33:53.240 --> 01:34:00.360]   This was a local news service that Tim Armstrong, the CEO of AOL, really doubled down on local
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:03.440]   news with patch.
[01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:07.400]   And after spending more than $300 million over the last six years, they finally just
[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:10.720]   said, "You know what's really sad?
[01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:13.200]   I used to work at AOL since they own Engadget."
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:14.200]   Oh, that's right.
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:15.200]   And I never heard about it.
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:17.200]   You never knew about patch?
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:18.200]   No.
[01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:19.200]   That's a bad sign.
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:22.520]   That tells you how successful the product was.
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:23.520]   It's a very...
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:25.960]   Well, the idea wasn't bad, right?
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:26.960]   No.
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:33.800]   For those who don't know, patch was basically a series of bloggers creating very local
[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:34.800]   content.
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:37.400]   It was a try to crack the...
[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:43.760]   I guess the way of going at the hyper-local information that everyone's been talking about,
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:45.080]   unfortunately, it's not working.
[01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:51.320]   But I think if we had looked at it a few years ago and had thought, had been asked to evaluate
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:54.640]   it, I think we might have thought it could have worked.
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:57.400]   It wasn't a bad idea, per se.
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:34:58.400]   Yeah.
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:34:59.400]   What?
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:01.240]   Yeah, it sounds good to me.
[01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:03.240]   But you know, we never know.
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:05.200]   Obviously, lots of good ideas in the world.
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:06.200]   Yeah.
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:08.680]   AOL also selling Winamp and Shout Cast.
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:14.280]   They were going to shut the service down, but long comes Belgian company Radionomy.
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:18.360]   And they bought it for somewhere between $5 million and $10 million.
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:21.400]   And this might be bad for Radionomy.
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:28.480]   AOL takes a 12% stake at Radionomy.
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:30.480]   So what they're going to do with Winamp?
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:31.480]   Yeah.
[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:35.320]   Well, Radionomy, I think they were more interested in Shout Cast because they already are on
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:37.200]   internet radio play, right?
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:38.320]   And Shout Cast is great.
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:40.720]   And there's a whole directory and lots of Shout Cast stations.
[01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:41.960]   I'm really glad they saved that.
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:45.840]   Winamp, I don't care, but I'm really glad they saved Shout Cast.
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:46.840]   For sure.
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:52.600]   Big, big departure, probably a firing at Yahoo.
[01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:59.800]   When Marissa Meyer took over, she brought over a number two from Google and Riccade de Castro
[01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:08.600]   to post him from Google to run their ad sales, paid him.
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:14.040]   We believe more than she got paid herself $40 million a year or something like that.
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:17.280]   No, I guess $40 million is severance.
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:18.280]   Yikes.
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:19.280]   Wow.
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:20.280]   Yikes.
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:21.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:22.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:28.640]   The beginning of a new year writes Marissa Meyer in, by the way, of course, Cara Swisher
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:30.520]   has the memo.
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:33.240]   The beginning of the new year always provides time for reflection.
[01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:36.000]   And upon reflection, you're fired.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.960]   No, as we enter 2014, I couldn't be more proud of what we've accomplished.
[01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:44.320]   But during my own reflection, I made the difficult decision that our chief operating officer and
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:46.840]   Riccade de Castro should leave the company.
[01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:49.040]   She put that in a memo.
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:50.040]   Wow.
[01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:51.040]   That's harsh.
[01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:54.480]   Usually they say, "Mr. de Castro wants to spend more time with his family.
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:56.640]   Wish we wish him the best of luck."
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:01.320]   Apparently there was a lot of people who were waiting for this to happen.
[01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:04.520]   He was not very well liked in the company.
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:09.440]   So I think it might have been an admission that she had to do.
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:11.200]   She had protected him for a long time.
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:12.200]   Yeah.
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:14.760]   And she wanted to say "Méo culpa" kind of.
[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:15.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:17.640]   We didn't work out.
[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:22.000]   He will walk away with any somewhere between $88 and $109 million.
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.160]   It's a good gig for you.
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:27.160]   A year and a half.
[01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:33.640]   According to The Times, The New York Times, he was the eighth highest paid executive in
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:39.960]   Silicon Valley for 2012.
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:44.120]   Marissa Meyer herself received $36.6 million a year.
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:45.120]   That seems okay.
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:46.120]   I would take it.
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:50.280]   But de Castro got $39 million a year.
[01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:51.280]   And then he's going to get the 7th.
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:53.320]   What's the million here and there, Leo?
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:54.320]   Right.
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:55.560]   It's the Silicon Valley.
[01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:56.560]   What do you want?
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:57.560]   Come on.
[01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:01.040]   Apparently it never worked out.
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:03.080]   It just was never a good relationship.
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:04.080]   No.
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:05.080]   $39 million a year.
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:07.080]   I know it's crazy, right?
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:09.080]   $40 million severance package.
[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:11.640]   What's your salary?
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:13.800]   You can go to the Bahamas for a year.
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:14.800]   Right.
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:15.800]   Bahamas.
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:17.400]   You could live for the rest of your life in Mexico.
[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:22.320]   Have a hacienda, couple of servants.
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:24.240]   Where was it that John McAfee went?
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:25.680]   And just hang out there.
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:26.680]   Make bath salts.
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:27.680]   Bermuda was it?
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:29.680]   Belize, I think.
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:30.680]   Belize?
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:38.480]   By the way, McAfee says he's very happy that Intel has dropped the name McAfee from its
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:39.760]   antivirus.
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:43.680]   I think he used a slightly more colorful description.
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:44.680]   Yes.
[01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:49.080]   I think he said something like has finally liberated me from the...
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:54.080]   He basically says it's the worst software in the world.
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:55.960]   Yeah.
[01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:59.480]   The company is going to call it Intel Security.
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:04.800]   McAfee said, quote, "I am now everlastingly grateful to Intel for freeing me from this
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:09.360]   terrible association with the worst software on the planet."
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:10.360]   Oh.
[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:12.720]   He's not far wrong.
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:13.720]   There may be worse.
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:14.720]   I don't know.
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:21.320]   When you get John McAfee and John Ledger in one room.
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:22.320]   Crazy.
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:23.520]   That would be pretty awesome.
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:24.520]   Crazy.
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:32.080]   And then I guess we'll wrap it up with this kind of tip of the hat to Sandra Day O'Connor.
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:37.000]   She saved the VCR on this week 30 years ago.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.720]   You remember, maybe you don't.
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:39.720]   You're probably young.
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:45.400]   It was on Friday, that the Betamax case was finally decided.
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:50.120]   The movie companies, the motion picture association took Sony to court.
[01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:58.080]   I think it was the current head of the MPAA at the time who told Congress that the VCR
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:04.120]   was to the movie industry what the Boston Strangler was to women home alone.
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:05.120]   They sued.
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:06.120]   Yeah.
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:07.120]   That's harsh rhetoric.
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:09.240]   Thank you, Jack Valenti.
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:12.200]   They sued saying, "You got to kill video cassette recording.
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:16.920]   It's going to put us out of business."
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:19.720]   In 2019, what was it?
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:22.440]   Sandra Day O'Connor was the swing vote.
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:26.440]   At first, according to archival files, she was, this is the Washington Post writing,
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:32.520]   and climbed to side with the studios along with their Supreme Court majority.
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:37.440]   But she grappled with the majority opinion so much so she ended up defecting and supporting
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:45.400]   the dissent of five, four decision against the motion picture association in favor of
[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:46.400]   it.
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:47.400]   The VCR was born.
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:52.120]   And of course, as is always the case, the motion picture industry made billions off
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:53.120]   the VCR.
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:57.760]   And in the hindsight, it was the stupidest lawsuit ever.
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:40:59.680]   It was all about porn.
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:01.920]   It says what you say.
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:02.920]   I don't know.
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:03.920]   That's the technology.
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:07.080]   That's always about porn, isn't it?
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:08.080]   Yeah.
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:13.920]   Hey, thank you so much for taking some time from your football day.
[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:16.280]   Miriam Jwar is, of course, at this.
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:18.200]   Are you, what are you social media marketing?
[01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:19.760]   What do you do at get pebble.com?
[01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:21.680]   I'm the product evangelist official.
[01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:22.680]   Oh, I like it.
[01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:26.760]   But that really just means that I had communications and strategy on the product.
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:30.840]   She's tank girl, no vowels on the Twitter, TNK, GRL.
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:31.840]   And you know what?
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:32.840]   It's my blog.
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:38.320]   Old habits die high, hard, and Miriam still covers the mobile world and the tech world
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:41.880]   with great verve and intelligence.
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:48.200]   TNK, GRL.com, you can read all about it.
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:49.200]   Tank girl mobile.
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:50.200]   Thank you, Miriam, for being here.
[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:51.200]   I appreciate it.
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:52.600]   Thank you for having me, Leo.
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:55.920]   Patrick Bejah is at PatrickBejah.com.
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:57.200]   I am.
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:41:59.360]   And not Patrick on the Twitter.
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:00.360]   Exactly.
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:03.440]   Which we'll never quite get.
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:05.040]   Well, Patrick was taken, so.
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:06.040]   Yeah.
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:07.040]   You know, make a work time.
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:08.040]   But you are Patrick.
[01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:09.040]   You're not so confused.
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:12.880]   There are a few not people on Twitter now.
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:13.880]   There's quite a few.
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:14.880]   Yeah.
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:15.880]   Yeah.
[01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:16.880]   And you want a plug?
[01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:19.120]   What do you want a plug?
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:20.680]   So I guess there are a couple of things.
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:24.680]   First very quickly, my French tech news show, which is Law and the Wu-Tek, because there
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:29.960]   were a couple of people, it was weird this week, a couple of English-speaking people,
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:34.000]   told me that they were brushing up on their French, listening to the show.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:39.760]   And since it's a familiar subject matter, it can be pretty useful.
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:45.360]   So if that's your case, is the French of Law and the Wu-Tek?
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:46.360]   Perfect French.
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:48.560]   Is it the kind of French I should emulate?
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:49.560]   Parisian French?
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:50.560]   Yes.
[01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:51.560]   I'm going to go with, yes.
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:52.560]   Law and the Wu-Tek.
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:54.760]   I'm going to say that right.
[01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:55.760]   Law and the Wu-Tek.
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:56.760]   Law and the Wu-Tek.
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:57.760]   Exactly.
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:01.360]   What is the word for tech in French?
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:02.360]   Tech.
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:06.320]   You know, it's like that awesome quote.
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:14.120]   I can't remember who said it, but some American CEO said the problem with France is that
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:17.960]   there is no, they have no words, they have no words for entrepreneur.
[01:43:17.960 --> 01:43:18.960]   Oh.
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:20.800]   Which of course is a French word.
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:22.720]   What does entrepreneur mean in France though?
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:23.720]   Oh, the same thing.
[01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:24.720]   Same thing.
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:25.720]   Same thing.
[01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:27.120]   Someone who starts, who starts.
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:28.120]   Start up guy.
[01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:29.120]   Yeah.
[01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:30.320]   But it's also for Mr. Jesus.
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:31.320]   Mr. Jesus.
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:32.320]   Say again?
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:33.320]   Sorry?
[01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:34.560]   In most more mistresses.
[01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:35.760]   Yes.
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:43.960]   And the other thing is my brother's royalty free music shop called Music in Cloud.
[01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:44.960]   Yes.
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:46.480]   Which is really cool.
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:48.040]   And he's doing it with his wife.
[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:49.920]   It's a real mom and pop shop.
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:51.520]   And he's very talented.
[01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:55.040]   So you should go check it out if you have royalty free music needs.
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:57.040]   What's the address?
[01:43:57.040 --> 01:43:58.960]   Musicincloud.com.
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:02.200]   There is no definite article.
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:06.440]   Music is absolutely no definitize by Daniel Bezha.
[01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:07.440]   Cool.
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:08.600]   Rorily free music.
[01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:09.600]   I like that.
[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:12.880]   Podcasters especially would get some value out of this.
[01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:14.720]   And he's got some pretty cool stuff there.
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:16.000]   So check it out.
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.720]   Thank you guys and gals.
[01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:18.720]   Thank you for being here.
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:19.720]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:22.000]   I hope you didn't get disturbed by our early start.
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.360]   We wanted to get everybody out of here in time to watch a football game.
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:30.920]   But normally we do Twitch Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:33.680]   That would be 2300 UTC on Twitch.tv.
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:37.440]   If you'd like to watch live and we will be at our regular time next week.
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:40.440]   Although I'm thinking and maybe I'd love to get some feedback.
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:41.440]   Maybe we should.
[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:43.920]   Why should we wait an hour between the radio show and Twitch?
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:46.480]   Why shouldn't we just get Twitch right underway?
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:50.240]   Why is that hour even there?
[01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:52.480]   For you to brush your teeth.
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:53.480]   Yes.
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:57.360]   I'm going to be a bunch of part of my ritual before every show.
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:59.720]   Dental hygiene is so important.
[01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:01.840]   As someone who lives in France, I would say it better.
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:02.840]   Earlier is better.
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:03.840]   No.
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:04.840]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:06.840]   Earlier is better, right?
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:11.280]   We also make an on-demand audio and video available after the fact at Twitch.tv where
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:15.840]   currently all bits are created equal, at least for the time being.
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:18.000]   So if you can't watch live, do watch after the fact.
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:21.560]   Don't forget TNT all week long, 10 a.m. Pacific.
[01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:25.600]   That would be 1 p.m. Eastern time, 1800 UTC for your daily tech news.
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:30.520]   And now our new show, TN2, our evening version, tech news tonight.
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:31.520]   That's 4 p.m.
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:33.480]   Pacific 7 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:36.840]   It's 4 plus 12 is 16 plus 8 is 24.
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:39.440]   Right at midnight UTC.
[01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:42.840]   Your last gasp of news at the end of the day.
[01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:44.360]   Thanks for joining us and we'll see you next time.
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:46.120]   Another Twitch is in the game.
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:56.120]   [MUSIC]
[01:45:56.120 --> 01:45:56.960]   - Yeah, baby.
