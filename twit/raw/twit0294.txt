[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.200]   It's time for Twit, the show that covers the computer
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.200]   and technology news.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.200]   I don't even should even say computer.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.200]   I don't think we have one computer story in here, ever.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.200]   Technology news, I guess, joining me now, a great panel.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.200]   We've been had some great panels in the last few weeks
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.200]   and I credit our producer Eileen Rivera for putting these together,
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.200]   starting with from Read, Write, Web, Marshall Kirkpatrick.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.200]   Hello, Marshall.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.200]   Hey, Leo, thanks for having me.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.200]   It's great to have you.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.200]   This is going to be a challenging pronunciation job all around.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.200]   Read, Write, Web.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.200]   Then from Boing Boing, I can say that.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.200]   Shelly Jardin, did I get your name right?
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.200]   You got it.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.200]   All right.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.200]   Hey, it's great to have you back.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.200]   She's drinking matcha today, so she said,
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.200]   if she gets a green mustache, we'll tell her.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.200]   It's okay to have a green mustache.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.200]   And the author of a book which is soon to come out in the next few months,
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.200]   How to Be Rebecca Black, it's Barrett's one day Thurston.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   Am I right?
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.200]   You're wrong on so many levels, it's so much fun.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.200]   It's not too late.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.200]   I'm not going to correct any of that.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.200]   That was an amazing introduction.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.200]   Also from the onion.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.200]   Don't you want to kind of change it now and say,
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.200]   How to Be Rebecca Black, wouldn't that sell better?
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.200]   I have a thing called artistic integrity.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.200]   Oh, dear.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.200]   And I'm not going to put that on something.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.200]   Oh, dear.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.200]   No, I'm not going to change the title of my book.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.200]   It'll be out in the future.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.200]   That's all I'm committing to.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.200]   And when it's out, you'll definitely know.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.200]   I can't wait.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.200]   I do want to, I do feel like Jerry Lewis that we should have a took board here and say,
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.200]   Let's roll the numbers 50 57 58 million hits now for Friday, Friday.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.200]   Well, there was one comment that I saw on the video today.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.200]   It was great.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.200]   It said, we have collectively spent 412 years.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.200]   Oh, Jesus.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.200]   Watching this video.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.200]   Oh, dear.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.200]   That's a commentary.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.200]   Not to mention, I mean, if you tallied up all the hits for the, I mean, some of the,
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.200]   some of the parodies, there's a pair, one parody, the Bob Dylan parody, I think has 1.7 million views.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.200]   Nice.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.200]   So you tally them all up.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:36.200]   It really is the entire collective conscience of consciousness of America has been devoted to this 13 year old's song for the last two weeks.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.200]   All of Shakespeare's monkeys banging out of it.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.200]   That's what you get.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.200]   That's so clear.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.200]   Clay Shurkey says it used to be gin.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.200]   Then it was desperate housewives and now the internet supposed to open us up to Wikipedia edits.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.200]   Right?
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.200]   That's what we're supposed to spend our time on.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.200]   Everybody's coming, baby.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.200]   And this is what they do.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.200]   They make a, so it was a bot mitzvah video that went wrong.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.200]   Very wrong.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.200]   And people have, I mean, I, you know, she was on Leno.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:15.200]   She seems like a very nice 13 year old girl who just got caught in the, in the internet meme machine is being ground up by the gears right now.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   It's just amazing.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.200]   Better that than you done goofed.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.200]   It could be worse.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.200]   You're right.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.200]   Sort of.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.200]   There are real stories.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.200]   In fact, Jenny, you've been covering the nuclear disaster in Japan.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:34.200]   And one of the things I've noted before is how hard it is to get real information about this.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.200]   I mean, the Japanese government's not being very helpful here.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.200]   But everybody seems to have an axe to grind.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.200]   What's the latest from Fukushima?
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:49.200]   You know, one of the things that we've been doing, Maggie Kurtz Baker, Boing Boing Science Editor and I've been teaming up on this.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:05:05.200]   And, you know, when, when stories this big and this science focused happen, we feel like Boing Boing is a special venue where we're able to explore those things without having to apologize for being technically specific.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.200]   And taking time to talk to scientists, to talk to experts.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:27.200]   Maggie's done an amazing job with sorting through that data and being skeptical of sources and helping our readers, our viewers sort through what's true, what's been, and frankly doing the job that cable news networks ought to be doing a better job of.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:37.200]   Just over the weekend, there was this report that came out from TEPCO saying, well, radioactivity levels are 10 million times what's normal in this one reactor building.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:47.200]   And then the following morning, Los Angeles time, they, they retracted that, they retracted that statement and said, well, actually, we meant 100,000 times.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:06:05.200]   It's really interesting the, the level of, the lack of transparency in any story involving large power companies, large energy companies, that's something that we've grown to expect.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.200]   The BP disaster taught us that.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:16.200]   But between the government of Japan and TEPCO and all the sort of fear-mongering that's happening, this is a really, really tough story to get your head around.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.200]   Have you reached some sort of consensus in doing all of this research?
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.200]   Don't trust energy companies and don't trust the government.
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:34.200]   Another meme that's been going around is that giant cube of how many people have died from coal and then the little teeny-weeny cube of how many people have died from nuclear power.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:54.200]   I think the third lesson is don't necessarily trust science because science too is not necessarily objective. An engineer with an axe to grind, maybe somebody at university somewhere has received lots of funding from the nuclear industry may really have strong motivation, financial motivation to downplay the risk of radioactivity,
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:07:09.200]   and to downplay the potential disaster that is still unfolding here. But on the other hand, you have people freaking out and buying iodine tablets on the other side of the world and perhaps even impacting the supply for people in Japan who will need them first.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:24.200]   There's also the issue, and I've read some blog posts on this, of aid groups raising considerable amount of money to aid Japan when in fact Japan doesn't really want any help or need any help. What have you learned about that?
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:35.200]   We've been doing a series of webcasts with people inside Japan bloggers and journalists who we know and pay a lot of attention to just generally.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:46.200]   And what we're hearing is that yes, absolutely, there is help acutely needed in the northern part of the country. The numbers of dead and missing are growing by the day.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:55.200]   This is a disaster of unprecedented proportions. And remember here, we're just talking about people so far who were harmed by the quake and the tsunami.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:11.200]   We don't know what could unfold yet with the nuclear crisis. But what we're hearing is that you have to remember that just sort of throwing money at really large global aid organizations doesn't necessarily get help on the ground right there where it's needed right now.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.200]   And it's a little bit more complicated than one might imagine.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.200]   Yeah, I mean, this is not a poor country. This is not Haiti.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.200]   It's not Haiti.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:31.200]   One of the, I've got some friends who live in Tokyo. Actually, when I was there a year and a half ago for the Discovery Science Future Show spent a good amount of time with them.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:39.200]   I've been watching her Facebook status updates. And what they are, they do a lot of local organizations. It's not about raising money, but they're building hygiene kits.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:43.200]   It's one thing that I just wouldn't have thought of has never been in such a drastic situation.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:50.200]   So they're asking people in the region send the Ziploc bags. They're putting together towels, toothbrush, toothpaste, because there's so many people who've been displaced.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:59.200]   And that's a very meaningful contribution. The other thought that I have, and I've not been following this as closely as it's possible because there's so much stuff blowing up around the world.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.200]   But I saw this in the chat room. It kind of has a joke, but Japan does love its robots.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:11.200]   And if there were ever a time for robots to do what they've been designed to do, this is it. Come on robots, do your thing.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:18.200]   They've been doing some robotic stuff. I know both in the nuclear plants, but also in search and rescue as well.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:31.200]   Yeah. I would just add it too. One of the things that we've observed as Maggie and I have been comparing notes and sort of trading links back and forth and trying to sort through what's really happening and what to report to our readers.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:45.200]   A lot of what the story has taught us is that the really large news organizations, the large news organizations here in the US do wildly varying jobs of telling it like it is.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:51.200]   And I just have to be blunt here. Watching CNN domestic CNN US has just been utterly pathetic.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:10:03.200]   When there was major news breaking, they were running stories that had been debunked. Nine hours after they debunked and ran on Twitter, ran on Japanese news.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:13.200]   I spent a lot of time monitoring TEPCO and press conferences from TEPCO from the Japan Nuclear Safety Administration.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:27.200]   From other entities in Japan, there were these links that were being traded around where on Eustron, you could watch sort of an array of six different television channels from the BBC to NHK to Kyoto news.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:41.200]   Monitoring that with English translations, monitoring the print Japanese language news, monitoring Twitter feeds, that turned out for me and for Maggie, I think, to be some of the best sources of news.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:50.200]   And then just reaching out to people who are there or reaching out to nuclear scientists who could help us parse what was happening.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:59.200]   This is such a science story and science in media in America is just pathetic. It's been abandoned in favor of our machine.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:06.200]   Yeah, it really is a shame. But good, you know, that there are outlets like Buying Buying, who are willing to focus on that.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:13.200]   I feel like that was kind of our mission too. We have a technologically literate audience. I don't think we did as good a job as we would like to.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:23.200]   And it's something that we're going to really focus on is building a better news division so we can cover this kind of stuff from a technically literate point of view and assume an audience that is intelligent.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:28.200]   And Leo, as Kanye says, it's a process.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.200]   It is. Absolutely. Absolutely.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:38.200]   I wanted to know if you guys had seen this other story out of Japan on badass of the week.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.200]   It's a website that celebrates badass human beings doing badass things.
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:12:00.200]   And it's about this guy who got separated from his wife right after the tsunami, got a bunch of scuba gear and waterproof lighting and went back in underwater, searching through his flooded town, found his wife, like in their apartment, just barely breathing, brought her back to safety.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:07.200]   Then went back and got his mother doing the same thing. Now he just keeps going back day in and day out.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:07.200]   It's amazing.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.200]   Japanese MacGyver, a hero character.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:18.200]   There's that and then there's one comment from a nuclear, someone who worked at one of the facilities saying, "I'm willing to die to prevent a meltdown."
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:23.200]   And it just makes it one of those comments. If you hate your job right now, you really need to keep that to yourself.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:29.200]   You guys know Joey Eto, I'm sure his sister.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:37.200]   Nizuko Ito, Mimi Ito. She's a cultural anthropologist based here in LA. She does a lot of work on youth and mobile devices. Fascinating woman.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:56.200]   She and I were trading emails about this series of reports coming out of Japan in Manichi, in Asahi, in Kyoto news, where over the weekend, just this weekend, you're starting to see this sort of swell of criticism and anger for the lack of safety measures
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:12.200]   and monitoring for the so-called Fukushima 50 or 100 for the workers who are inside the plant doing the heroic and horrifying job of trying to keep this from turning into an exponentially worse disaster.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:23.200]   They're literally putting their lives on the line and there's great criticism that TEPCO has a long history of lying about safety measures and faulty safety measures for their workers.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:43.200]   This is, I think, the most poignant example of this is one report where a doctor who, in a previous nuclear disaster in Japan, had treated a lot of radiation victims, he came out very, very critical of TEPCO, critical of the government, but specifically of TEPCO for not monitoring these guys constantly and not providing better safety.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:52.200]   Hours later, after that criticism was published in a big report, just take it out. Mimi found that. She pointed us to it. She helped us translate it.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:14:06.200]   Small steps like that in outlets like Boeing Boeing, that reach a wide audience here in the States, I think, are very helpful in helping to provide context and seeing sort of what the sentiment on the ground is like over there.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:23.200]   I think that it really may, we say this every time, but every time you get more and more of a sense that the mainstream traditional news sources are not very useful and that there is a really, but there is something to replace it, which is really kind of exciting.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:39.200]   And then if people do have the interest, they can get all this information and you can watch NHK on Ustream and you can watch Al Jazeera and you can, you know, you can go to Twitter and you can find out people like A. Carvin, his coverage of not just Japan, but of what's going on in the air.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.200]   Andy Carvin's amazing.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.200]   He needs a raise in Pulitzer.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:51.200]   You just wrote Marshall Kirkpatrick, who's at the CTIA this week. You wrote an article for Read, Write, Web.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.200]   I lost your picture. There we go, Marshall.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:59.200]   Here's the article for Read, Write, Watch Dogs says Mobile Web would have changed the Nazi Germany.
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:13.200]   And it's interesting to kind of reimagine what history would have been like and how it may never again may be able to get away with that kind of thing because of the harsh light of the Internet.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.200]   Can you tell us what he said?
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:31.200]   Oh, it was the director of Human Rights Watch. Kenneth Roth, and he was discussing the way that so many atrocities have been hidden from the world throughout history.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:53.200]   And yet now, today, thanks to wireless and mobile technologies, he's able to have people on his staff and stringers from the general public communicating live from some of the most repressive situations in the world, despite government efforts to shut down those communication channels.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.200]   They're just unable to, and not really, really changes things.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:05.200]   The flip side of it, which is that there is so much going on that our attention is now moving very, very quickly.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:10.200]   Not only is the news cycle instantaneous, but our attention span has gotten shorter and shorter.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.200]   So, oh, Japan, that was three weeks ago.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.200]   Right.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.200]   It was a year ago.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.200]   It was a year ago.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.200]   I got a quick technical need.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:29.200]   I'm going to reboot my Skype. It's taken up like 100% processor and you guys are all sounding like silence, but even though I'm sure you don't, right? You're not really silenced.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.200]   Take care.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.200]   We are.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.200]   Can you call me back when I look back up?
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.200]   Thank you.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.200]   Yes, I will.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.200]   We have a plan.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.200]   It's a processor.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:42.200]   I hope you say that every like 10 minutes.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.200]   It's a processor.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.200]   I think we got the title of the show.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.200]   No matter what, as Kanye says, as Kanye says, I'll be right back.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.200]   Yeah, we'll get you right back in just a minute.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.200]   Let's take a break.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:17:05.200]   We're going to come back, get Baratunde back on and talk a little bit more about CTIA because there was some, I know, it almost feels dumb to talk about gadgets after you talk about these serious world issues, but there's stuff going on there.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.200]   Yeah, just sort of part of how we communicate about this serious world issues.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.200]   That's right.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:14.200]   It's all, it's a tool as Kanye says.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:22.200]   But, you know, if Kanye were here right now, I'm sure he'd be saying, whenever I send invoices, I send them from freshbooks.com.
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.200]   It's easy online.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.200]   Actually, we're big fans of FreshBooks.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:32.200]   When, if you are invoicing people, you know that it's actually one of the most painful things in the world is to do invoices.
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.200]   FreshBooks will turn you around.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.200]   You will love invoicing.
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.200]   You upload your logo.
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.200]   FreshBooks lets you do it on the web.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:45.200]   There's an iPhone app that will actually track your hours if you do hourly billing and will port it right into an invoice there.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.200]   You got to love that.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.200]   It's free for the first three clients.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.200]   You have to love that.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:59.200]   And if you, if you have clients, and I know there are a few out there who say, well, I appreciate the email invoice, but can you please mail me a paper invoice?
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.200]   They'll even do that for you.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.200]   Not free.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:07.200]   You have to pay for the postage as a small fee, but they literally will print the invoice, stamp it, and mail it for you.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.200]   Now, here's the part I like the best.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:18.200]   They put a button on that email that says, pay right now, or you can even have your client schedule regular payments.
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:25.200]   Believe it or not, a lot of clients like the idea of just saying, oh, yeah, as soon as they get an invoice from this guy, pay them, and it'll happen automatically.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.200]   You can, they can use a credit card.
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:33.200]   They can use up to 11 online payment services like PayPal, Authorize.net, Tuco, and On and On and On.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:37.200]   If they don't pay, late payment reminders are automatic as well.
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.200]   You couldn't get easier than this.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:45.200]   If you're a freelancer, if you've got to invoice, please do yourself a favor and check out FreshBooks.
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.200]   It's free.
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.200]   FreshBooks.com.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.200]   Over two million folks have started using FreshBooks since I started in 2004.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.200]   It's really grown, and it is just fantastic.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.200]   Every day, by the way, FreshBooks is giving away a birthday cake to one of our audience members.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.200]   Doesn't even have to be your birthday.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:04.200]   Just sign up for FreshBooks, and a cake could be on its way.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.200]   All right, let me see if I can get Baratunde back here.
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.200]   Do you think he's had time to reboot?
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.200]   One never knows.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.200]   Depends on the boot.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.200]   Depends on the processor.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.200]   Have a little matcha on me.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.200]   I raised my mug, too.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.200]   That's a massive mug.
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.200]   What is that mug?
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.200]   Oh, it's pretty.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.200]   It's like a Japanese mug, huh?
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:33.200]   Traditional Japanese mug, or as I call it, my tea trough.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.200]   All right, everybody's hydrating.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.200]   Yes.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:43.200]   Let me ask, Marcia, what was, you were at CTIA, which is the big cell phone conference this
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.200]   year.
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.200]   What was anything you came away with of interest?
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.200]   Oh, it was great.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.200]   I really enjoyed it.
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.200]   Yes.
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:56.200]   Yeah, I need to remember to smile when I say things like that.
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.200]   It was remarkably well-run.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:04.200]   The content on stage, I thought, was really engaging.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.200]   Aren't these guys at each other's throats at this point, though?
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.200]   I mean, the T-Mobile acquisition.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.200]   Oh, yeah, it was great.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:18.200]   Jim Kramer got on stage and interviewed the CEOs of Verizon Sprint and AT&T and talked about
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:22.200]   the T-Mobile acquisition and the Sprint CEO just came out swinging.
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.200]   Oh, blah.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.200]   Which was great.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:30.200]   Jim Kramer said, "So why does the video stream always stop working online?"
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.200]   I've had.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.200]   I've got all three of you here to, you know, who's going to fix it?
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.200]   And I thought that was refreshingly rank.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.200]   And yeah, it was quite enjoyable.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:48.200]   One of my primary areas of interest in that world is about web-connected devices, about
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.200]   sensors being put all over the place in what's called the Internet of Things.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.200]   And that just kept coming up over and over again.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.200]   Come on, they can't even get us enough bandwidth for our phones.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.200]   Now they want our refrigerators to be online.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:06.200]   That's a big part of, yeah, they say that that's why they need all the more spectrum.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:11.200]   Marshall, at any point when Kramer was hosting this conversation, I assume there was a camera
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.200]   on a jib constantly moving on.
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.200]   You're wrong!
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.200]   Oh, he was terrific.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.200]   He was super fabulous.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.200]   Actually, that's the kind of guy you should get for something like this because otherwise,
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.200]   these guys are mealy-mouthed, these executives.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:30.200]   You have to get somebody to sit down and start yelling at them, or they're not going to say anything at all.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.200]   Did they talk about spectrum?
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.200]   Because I guess that's really, that's the issue right now.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:42.200]   Yeah, CTIA is not some neutral host for a nice little industry conference.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.200]   It's an advocacy organization.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.200]   And spectrum, spectrum, spectrum.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:50.200]   We want the federal government to intervene and give us more spectrum.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.200]   Was the drum they just kept beating over and over and over again.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.200]   FCC Chairman Julius Genakowski was there as well.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.200]   And I understand he's talked about spectrum.
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.200]   Yep.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:06.200]   I can only assume there's going to be a major reallocation sometime real soon.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:14.200]   They're talking about 500 megahertz of wireless spectrum that will be, they hope, available in the next ten years.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.200]   Well, the demand is just...
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:26.200]   It's so much already climbing so fast and it's just going to climb faster, especially if some of the predictions that people are making come true.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:30.200]   You know, the CEO of Ericsson said there are, oh, what did he say?
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:42.200]   I believe there are 4 billion mobile subscribers around the world today, and they expect there to be 50 billion mobile devices above and beyond human subscribers.
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:47.200]   But multiple phones per person and sensors all over the place.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.200]   And it's, you know, if they can pull that off, it's going to require...
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.200]   It's interesting.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:56.200]   Because, I mean, they're building in higher, higher, you know, 4G into all the new phones or higher and higher speed.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:01.200]   We want more speed, but it seems like the infrastructure is woefully behind.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:06.200]   I mean, anybody who has AT&T and an iPhone is suffering.
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.200]   Hopefully we'll find a way.
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:13.200]   We hit these new levels of supply and demand and how they work out.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:18.200]   And we discover whole new ways to get things done, like not until all of your friends have mobile phones.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:22.200]   Does your social use of mobile technology take this exponential leap?
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:29.200]   And so when all of our devices are also connected, we'll hit a new way of generating, you know, bandwidth band.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:37.200]   Hopefully on the networking side, the network planners at these companies and within the policy and the government will also hit some new level of supply that can be used.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:42.200]   And so we're going to find a way to get people to know what's going on.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:47.200]   And we're going to find a way to get people to know what's going on.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:51.200]   And we're going to find a way to get people to know what's going on.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.200]   And we're going to find a way to get people to know what's going on.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.200]   And we're going to find a way to get people to know what's going on.
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:00.200]   And we're going to find a way to get people to know what's going on.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.200]   And we're going to find a way to get people to know what's going on.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:08.200]   And we're going to find a way to get people to know what's going on.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:13.200]   And we're going to find a way to get people to know what's going on.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:17.200]   And we're going to find a way to get people to know what's going on.

[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.200]   Everyone controls it.
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.200]   Everyone of those is moderated.
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.200]   I share my location occasionally with certain audiences certain times.
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.200]   And to a certain level of specificity.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:30.200]   So that level of control is something that's part of my personal data management,
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.200]   which I think we're all going to have to start dealing with.
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:36.200]   Just like you do with your financial management, your food and clothing and housing,
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:38.200]   which your data management is going to be a part of your life.
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.200]   It should be.
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.200]   Now that's okay.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.200]   That's a great distinction.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.200]   So it's an opt-in.
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.200]   It's more than an opt-in.
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:54.200]   It's an opt-in with sort of your ability to shape, you know, what amount and through what outlets
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:58.200]   and that would frequency this information, though not content legally,
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:02.200]   but you know, should be considered content about you is able to be released.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:06.200]   I think that's got to be a part of this connected network of things and people interacting with things.
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:11.200]   Otherwise, there's going to be a lot more horrific and embarrassing incidents to come.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.200]   We might not get over it.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:17.200]   So it sounds like there's a few things that any privacy manifesto would demand.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:21.200]   One is that you have choice of how your data is used.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:26.200]   The other is you can demand it be either withheld or anonymized, effectively anonymized.
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:33.200]   Although we've learned that anonymization isn't very effective because whenever search engine results are handed out,
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.200]   people are meeting.
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:36.200]   What was it? AOL that gave the data set?
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.200]   No, it was Ask.com.
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:42.200]   Gave a data set to researchers and a reporter in Florida took the data set.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:44.200]   And so, yeah, that's that lady.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:45.200]   They found her.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.200]   And the completely anonymized data set.
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:48.200]   So I don't know.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:54.200]   I just, I feel like most people will have given up by the time your cereal box has an intervention.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:58.200]   It will just be, what are we going to do?
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:05.200]   You know, I might predict that there will be a backlash, that there will be sort of a middle round of growing concern
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:10.200]   about what all of that means and what that means for identity, what that means for culture.
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:17.200]   I'm hearing more and more, like here in LA, I met a filmmaker a couple weeks ago who was involved in a big important
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:23.200]   award-winning documentary and she said that the next project that the same team was working on was about privacy,
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.200]   digital privacy.
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:34.200]   I mean, obviously at Boi and Boi and with Cori on board and with all of the reporting that we do about civil liberties
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:40.200]   and what these issues mean for human rights workers, for activists in other countries.
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.200]   It's something that we care a lot about.
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:48.200]   I mean, I remember seeing some tweets just last night with people like Jake Applebaum, one of the volunteers
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:55.200]   with the Torr Project and the Workie Leaks who was saying, if you're in Syria, you have to know that if you're connecting
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:01.200]   to the internet with Firefox, if you're doing this, if you're doing that, your government is monitoring all of this traffic.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:09.200]   And some of the tools that are put out there to help people, it's more complicated than just downloading the tool.
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.200]   Right.
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.200]   One of the flip side.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.200]   Oh, sorry, go ahead, Marshall.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:22.200]   The flip side of this is that hopefully when more and more of this data is made quantifiable and accessible,
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:30.200]   it can be made accessible in a way that can also be leveraged for social justice and to illuminate
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:37.200]   things that are unfair and more rationally planned, allocation of resources, stuff like that.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:44.200]   The example that I had used historically is about real estate redlining, where when the US Census data
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:53.200]   and the bank home loan application data were both first available for computational analysis,
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:37:03.200]   people were able to cross reference those data sets and prove, demonstrate that there was a pattern of discrimination
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:11.200]   against African American families in home loan applications across major cities all around the United States.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:21.200]   So I think that there's probably going to be really big opportunities of comparable importance when we have this living
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:27.200]   census of our devices and our social network data and have you able to be cross-reprints with other data sets?
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:30.200]   Dude, I love the phrase living census.
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.200]   That's a great concept.
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.200]   Hash tag it up.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.200]   Yeah.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:40.200]   One other story from CTIA, then we'll move on.
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:46.200]   It didn't take long for Google to jump ship since AT&T is acquiring T-Mobile.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:50.200]   From T-Mobile to Sprint, they announced the next Google phone will be a Sprint.
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.200]   Sprint phone.
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:38:01.200]   And Sprint announced that they were going to use Google Voice for their messaging, which I think is great news.
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:04.200]   Anything to say about that, Marshall?
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:09.200]   To be honest, I have never really gotten into Google Voice.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.200]   Oh, I love it.
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.200]   What?
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.200]   I need someone to explain to me why I've got...
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:19.200]   Maybe it's because I'm privileged to have gotten grandfathered into unlimited data on my iPhone back from old days
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.200]   but it just doesn't do much for me.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.200]   Do you like Google Voice, Spirit, and do you like the Google Voice?
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:27.200]   I not only like Google Voice.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.200]   I love Google Voice.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.200]   It has enhanced the quality of my life.
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:37.200]   I do not work for Google Voice, but I'll say first of all, the head of Google Voice is a guy named Vincent Packett,
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:39.200]   which I like to pronounce Packett, which I think is cool.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.200]   They should have a telecom service.
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.200]   Your last name is Packett, so I'm already supportive.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:48.200]   I was using Google Voice from the days it was grand central and back in, I think, 2006
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:54.200]   and the idea of having more control, again, we're getting back to this issue of micro-controlling your digital existence.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:59.200]   So we'll be able to give out a number to have some redundancy to your numeric identity in the world.
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:04.200]   So if I give out a cell phone number that's tied to a network and a device, I lose that device.
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:10.200]   It's very hard for me to pick up messaging attached to that device without getting a new device from that same carrier.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:12.200]   Hopefully they're open, maybe it happens in the morning.
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:15.200]   I'm out of luck, especially with text messaging.
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.200]   Those don't forward.
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:18.200]   You know, text messaging goes into a black hole.
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:24.200]   You hope it gets through, essentially, but unlike a voicemail or a call, you can't reroute that.
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:29.200]   So the benefits from me of Google Voice, you know, routing the phone to other phones is great.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:34.200]   Being able to make calls from my computer saved a lot of minutes because I'm usually on a fast Internet connection.
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:39.200]   I'd rather use the IP connection than a telephony connection, but the text messaging,
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:43.200]   being able to search my text messages over time, being able to send messages from a computer,
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:50.200]   and if I'm traveling, which I do increasingly, being able to log in, read and respond to text without necessarily activating my phone,
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:56.200]   or if my phone is not available, hugely, hugely valuable in a way that I never anticipated.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.200]   I thought the phone routing was going to be the thing.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:04.200]   Turns out for me, it's the online multi-platform access to my SMS log and my contacts that's been such a savior.
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:10.200]   I just read a great blog post about not having a phone at all.
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:15.200]   Like, just don't even have a phone. Make people like do you make?
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:21.200]   No, just say, I'll talk to you, you schedule time, I'll have Skype running or something, but I don't have a phone.
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:27.200]   I like that idea. He said it's surprisingly liberating, and people think you're like, you got balls,
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.200]   because you had to say, I don't have a phone.
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:32.200]   It sounds like one of those four-hour work we catch.
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.200]   It is. It sounds exactly like that.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:39.200]   I'm only going to respond to your email between 3PM GMT.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:42.200]   Admit it. You would love to do that.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:48.200]   I would, but I would miss some little bits of plankton.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:52.200]   No, no fear. That's the point. No fear.
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:41:02.200]   I think fear is something that keeps you rooted in reality sometimes, and I know that I do need to be more connected than that would allow.
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:06.200]   Maybe for the guy who's getting rich off of all those books, it works.
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:10.200]   That's a good one. There was a lot of the four-hour work week, the original book,
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:14.200]   and I was like, yeah, this works for you only.
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:19.200]   And so it's like I'm very happy that I think about a third of the book was massively applicable.
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:25.200]   A third was just for him, and a third was kind of insane in a fun way, but not necessarily a practical way.
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:31.200]   There were one downside I found in Google Voice, you cannot send text messages right now to international numbers.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:38.200]   And that I found out when I was in Australia, I was trying to respond to people through SMS, and they just don't know how the gateway is in place.
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:45.200]   So in our increasingly global world, Google Voice is still very US-centric, and they've got to fix that to make it a real product.
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:48.200]   I like Google Voice, but I think that you could use it that way.
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:54.200]   The problem is my phone number leaks out all the time, so I can't really, I don't answer the phone.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:56.200]   Yeah, no one answers their phone.
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.200]   Well, that's the point. You don't answer the phone, do you?
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:01.200]   Parents probably answer their phone because there might be something to do with their kids.
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.200]   No, I look at the caller ID. If it's not a number, I know I go screw you.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:09.200]   Yeah, I have my phone number very public.
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.200]   Because you don't answer it.
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:15.200]   No, I do answer it. I'd say I answer it probably two thirds of the time.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.200]   Really?
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:20.200]   And people will say that they're surprised that I'm willing to put it out there publicly.
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:25.200]   Maybe I'm not as, you know, there's probably one or two PR agents that call me every day.
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:28.200]   Every once in a while, I'll answer the phone.
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:33.200]   And what I get usually is nervous laughter and they hang up because they don't, they know my number.
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.200]   And they don't expect me to answer.
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:38.200]   They were trying to reach Justin Bieber.
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:41.200]   They go, and they hang up.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:46.200]   Marshall, when you say you get one to two PR calls a day, that from the same PR person?
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.200]   Over and over and over.
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.200]   Over three or four days in a row, generally speaking.
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.200]   Yeah. And I don't, I don't mind it.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:56.200]   I don't mind someone putting themselves at the top of my mental inbox.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:59.200]   So that I'll tell them in about 15 seconds.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.200]   I'll say, I'm not going to write about your client.
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.200]   Goodbye.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.200]   You know, problem, problem solved.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:06.200]   Wow.
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.200]   I like to write about their client.
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.200]   And I say, thank you.
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:11.200]   Let's schedule this right now.
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.200]   Yeah, cool.
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:13.200]   Yeah.
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.200]   They're very responsive.
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.200]   Man, that's awesome.
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.200]   Yeah, I'm impressed.
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.200]   Yeah, go get the phone.
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.200]   We're going to take a break.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:24.200]   Marshall Kirkpatrick is here.
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:27.200]   He writes for Read/Write Web and he loves hearing from PR flax.
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:30.200]   No, no, I don't.
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:33.200]   I can't imagine you do, but okay.
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:38.200]   Also here, Shady Jardin, she's at Boing Boing.net and really a great website to read.
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:43.200]   Not just for fun stuff, because there is a ton of fun stuff there, but also for real news
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:46.200]   about stuff like science.
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.200]   For your steampunk and your science.
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.200]   Steampunk and science.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.200]   Nice.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:54.200]   Baratunde Thurston is at baratunde.com.
[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:58.200]   He also is the official web guy for the, something like that, right, for the onion.
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:00.200]   I am director of digital.
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:03.200]   He's the DOD at the OA ION.
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:05.200]   But you can call me mayor.
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.200]   And mayor of all.
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:09.200]   All he surveys.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:12.200]   His new book is going to be out someday.
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.200]   Yes.
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.200]   All I can say.
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:15.200]   He won't let me say anymore.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.200]   No, just that.
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.200]   Hey, I want to talk real quickly about audible.com.
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.200]   Then we'll move on to topic number three.
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:23.200]   This has been fun.
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.200]   This is great.
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:27.200]   I tell you, I love getting intelligent people on.
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:29.200]   So I can just, you know, shut up.
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.200]   Stay out of the way.
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:32.200]   But I do want to mention audible.com.
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.200]   Audible is how I read and I love it.
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:39.200]   I just, you know, I just saw there's a great movie came out a couple of years ago about
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:42.200]   Tolstoy's last year of life called The Last Station.
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:43.200]   It's really great.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:48.200]   And it made me say, you know, I can, I'm going to read War and Peace finally.
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:51.200]   And then I chickened out and I said, no, I'm going to listen to it.
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:54.200]   I'm going to go to audible.com and I'm going to get War and Peace.
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:58.200]   And it's like, I don't know how many hours, but I got it and I'm listening to it.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:44:59.200]   And you know what?
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:00.200]   It's actually really great.
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:04.200]   See, Audible is about the rediscovering reading in your life.
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:07.200]   80,000 books on audible.com now.
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:11.200]   In fact, there's two different versions of War and Peace on a bridge.
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.200]   So you can decide which one you want to read.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:17.200]   I'm sure there's some of the bridged versions as well if you don't have the time.
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:21.200]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E-Oddable.com.
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:24.200]   Now you can get two books right now, absolutely free.
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:30.200]   If you go to audible.com/twit2 you'll be signing up for the Platinum account.
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:33.200]   That's subscription to two books a month.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:40.200]   And, you know, the only real challenge on this is, is which two books?
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:44.200]   With 80,000 books to choose from, it's tough.
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.200]   There's so many great books.
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.200]   One of the things Audible folks do when they get together is they say,
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.200]   "What's good?
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:49.200]   What are you listening to?"
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.200]   I love listening to a book.
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:54.200]   It's like somebody reading to you and it just brings the book to life.
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:46:00.200]   Whether it's War and Peace, I'm reading Peter F. Hamilton's A Great Sci-Fi Epic, The Dreaming Void.
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:04.200]   I just finished a great book that Andy and Aka recommended about the history of the Smother Brothers.
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:08.200]   It's called The Dangerously Funny by David Bancouli.
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:10.200]   There are so many good books on here.
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.200]   Look, here's what I would suggest.
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.200]   Go to audible.com/browsaround.
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:16.200]   When you're ready to pick two, then go to audible.com/twit2
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:19.200]   and sign up for that gold account.
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:24.200]   Two books a month, our first month is free and you can cancel at any time.
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.200]   Those books are yours to keep forever.
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:29.200]   Play on any of the Apple devices, the Zoom.
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:36.200]   They've got a great Android app now that I just love that lets you see all of your books and download whatever you want to listen to.
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:40.200]   audible.com/twit2.
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:42.200]   Check out their Sci-Fi section.
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.200]   They've been recording a lot of great books.
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:49.200]   audible.com/twit2.
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.200]   We thank them for their support of this week in tech.
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:58.200]   Let me go back and check our rundown of stories and some Android stories out there.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:04.200]   Playbook is a do-out soon and the folks at RIM say the playbook, which is based on QNX.
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:08.200]   It is neither iOS nor Android nor even WebOS.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:12.200]   We'll play or we'll run Android apps.
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:24.200]   They're going to offer tools for Android app developers to easily port their tools to the playbook, but they'll even be a little emulation layer because it's all in Java that will support apps written for Android 2.3.
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:27.200]   They'll support apps for BlackBerry Java.
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:31.200]   This is one way to handle that issue of what apps do you run?
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:34.200]   I ordered a playbook.
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:36.200]   They come out April 19th.
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:40.200]   Any of you have Zooms or playbooks or any of those Samsung Galaxy tabs?
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:51.200]   I ended up winning a Galaxy tab at Southby and I haven't activated the AT&T thing in it because I have too many telecom billing relationships.
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:56.200]   They're very good at taking your money and I don't need more cash going to them.
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:57.200]   You are so right.
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.200]   I have like four or five data accounts now.
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:09.200]   They're essentially banks that process your payments and exchange for occasional telecom services, which works out well for them.
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:13.200]   One of the very positive things I noticed, that size is great.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:19.200]   I have the first generation iPad. I love the iPad, but the tab fits inside my coat pocket.
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:23.200]   If I'm just going to run out the door and have no bag whatsoever, don't want to hold anything.
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.200]   That makes a big difference.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:26.200]   It's a very readable size.
[00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:31.200]   It's more Kindle size, which again slips inside of a pocket and can run and go.
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:35.200]   I think there's a market for something that size and clearly Apple is not exploding it.
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:40.200]   I hope everyone making things that size is a bit more successful in that space.
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:43.200]   In fact, Steve Jobs said nobody wants seven inch tablets.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.200]   That's crazy.
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:47.200]   Steve Jobs says no one wants anything until Apple makes a thing.
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.200]   We make it.
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:52.200]   No one wants their seven inch spin master.
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:54.200]   The playbook is seven inches.
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:56.200]   I played with it and really liked it.
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:57.200]   It's very speedy.
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:00.200]   It feels good, but we're going to get a zoom to it.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:05.200]   We have a new show all about Android, which debuts when is your first episode tomorrow?
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.200]   All right.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.200]   What time?
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:11.200]   5pm Pacific, 8pm Eastern on live.twit.tv.
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:16.200]   Eileen Rivera, our producer, and Jason Howell, who persists T&T will be hosting and producing that show.
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:20.200]   We're going to get a zoom for them in a playbook.
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:24.200]   Do you play with any of these, Jenny or Marshall?
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:32.200]   No, I got to a little bit at CTIA and the idea of a smaller form factor is really growing on me.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:36.200]   But for some reason I always hope that they'll cost less than the iPad does.
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:38.200]   And I don't think they really do.
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:44.200]   I think that there are 4.99 versions of both, but I don't think they have.
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:46.200]   I think they're Wi-Fi only, right?
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:47.200]   Yeah.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:51.200]   I'd love to see somebody compete on price as well.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.200]   I'd buy more about them.
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.200]   Playbook is the same price.
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:55.200]   It's 4.99 for Wi-Fi.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:58.200]   I think the zoom is a little more expensive.
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:00.200]   They're both dual processor.
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:01.200]   I don't know.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:03.200]   I'm with you, Baratunde.
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:07.200]   I think the real problem is this connection, is this connectivity.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:11.200]   Now my old iPad, I have a 30 buck a month account, my new iPad, I have a 30 buck a month.
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:14.200]   I mean, AT&T is just sucking me dry here.
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:23.200]   Well, hopefully what will happen in this connected world of devices, you will have a one live broadband connection that's attached to you.
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:26.200]   Most likely it'll come in the form of your primary mobile phone.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:27.200]   Let's call it your mobile phone.
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:28.200]   Wouldn't that be nice?
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:29.200]   It's tether, everything tethers.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:31.200]   And then everything gets auto-tied.
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:34.200]   You have a shared identity key among your items.
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:43.200]   You've got a similar connection, because you have a primary fixed connection to your home, whether it's wireless or terrestrial, doesn't matter, but it's your home pipe.
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.200]   And that's shared within your home as it is now.
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:51.200]   And then you have a mobile primary connection, and everything attached to you or around you that you want to opt in.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:56.200]   You know, a friend's phone or a device you're playing with, and some kind of new video gaming facility or a movie theater.
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:58.200]   You want to connect your chair and order popcorn.
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:00.200]   Yeah, I just made up something right there.
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:01.200]   You're welcome.
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.200]   I like that.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.200]   Yeah.
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:04.200]   You think Marshall, that's possible?
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:05.200]   Were they talking about that?
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:06.200]   No.
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:09.200]   They're talking about how to extract more money out of Baratunde.
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:24.200]   There was some under-celebrated awards granted at CTIA, and one of the award winners was Alcatel Lucents, who I should disclose as a major read-write web sponsor.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:38.200]   But they won an award for a new replacement for cell towers, I believe they are called a light radio that is, I mean, it's just offers crazy mobile connectivity to an entire network.
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:41.200]   I believe in the palm of your hand.
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:43.200]   We need that.
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:46.200]   We need that.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:57.200]   Google says that Honeycomb will not be out as soon as they decided not to release the platform source code to the community.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:02.200]   It's open source, but until Google releases a source code, there's not much you can do with it.
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:05.200]   So far, the Zoom is the only Honeycomb-based tablet.
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:11.200]   Leon, I think you're forgetting you can do something very important with it, which is the call it open source.
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:12.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:17.200]   Whether it is or not, it will be.
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.200]   The source will be.
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:22.200]   Come on.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:32.200]   So I think iPad's going to have the year before Apple doesn't have to worry about anybody for a little while.
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:35.200]   All of this is everybody's in disarray.
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:38.200]   iPad did go on sale worldwide.
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:41.200]   Was it yesterday or Friday?
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:44.200]   Two long lines all over the world, including London.
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:52.200]   And the suspicion that there aren't all that many that they probably will be sold out pretty quickly worldwide.
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:54.200]   They just care in Portland, Leo.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:53:04.200]   I'm told that there are still people lining up at three in the morning to get the limited number of iPads that they sell down at the mall each day.
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:09.200]   Is that mass hysteria or is there really a reason to get in line for an iPad too?
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:18.200]   Well, I know it's the device that I pick up more often than my laptop when I have a choice and it makes me happy when I do pick it up.
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:25.200]   All right.
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:28.200]   You know, I remember hearing over the last few weeks to here in Los Angeles, people lining up at four thirty, five thirty in the morning to go to the Apple stores here.
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:36.200]   I think specifically I kept hearing these were people who wanted AT&T and not Verizon and there was less, presumably less stock of the AT&T device.
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:37.200]   Really?
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.200]   Yeah.
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:39.200]   I don't get it.
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:41.200]   Yeah, I don't get that either.
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:43.200]   I'm telling you, there's something in the water.
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:45.200]   It's just amazing to me.
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:55.200]   Meanwhile, you've got plentiful supplies of numerous Android tablets and walk in and buy one.
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:58.200]   Well, maybe they should drop the price for, you know?
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:53:59.200]   Well, I think there are cheap.
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:04.200]   In fact, I think that there's the galaxy is going to end up being $2.99. I think some models of that.
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.200]   That's great.
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:08.200]   So there are some, and of course there are off brands, Arcos and others.
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:12.200]   Arcos isn't really an off brand, but Arcos is selling very inexpensive Android tablets.
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:15.200]   But none of them are on Honeycomb, I guess maybe that's an issue.
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:18.200]   Apple says Amazon can't call it the App Store.
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:22.200]   Why are you laughing?
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:24.200]   It wouldn't be fun with an Apple Lutz.
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:29.200]   It's an Apple thing. It's the lawyers thing. It's just, come on now.
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:31.200]   Like you didn't create apps.
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:34.200]   Apps have existed before you didn't create store.
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:35.200]   You can't take two things.
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:36.200]   But app is in our name.
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:37.200]   We are Apple.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:38.200]   We are Apple.
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.200]   Oh, yes.
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:47.200]   It's just silly. I don't know. I want like the author of the Bible to sue Apple for using the word Apple.
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.200]   Like let's just...
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:50.200]   It doesn't have to taste.
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:51.200]   Yes.
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:53.200]   Lawyers got a loy.
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:54.200]   Lawyers got a loy.
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:59.200]   Well, it's interesting because the Apple was initially turned down in its trademark for App Store.
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:01.200]   They attempted to get, I think, outside of the US.
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:05.200]   Because it's a descriptive term. You cannot trademark a descriptive term.
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:07.200]   Yeah, iTunes App Store.
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:09.200]   Apple App Store. Those things work.
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:11.200]   Just generic App Store.
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:14.200]   It's like trademarking grocery store, trademarking.
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:15.200]   Right.
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:16.200]   You can't...
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:17.200]   It's just not reasonable.
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:18.200]   It's just...
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:23.200]   So the argument the Apple attorneys made that ended up getting them, the trademark was...
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:28.200]   Well, it was descriptive. But now that Apple's used it so much, it really should be Apple's.
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.200]   We own that.
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:32.200]   They wanted to trademark store.
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:34.200]   Yeah, they couldn't get store.
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:37.200]   So I don't know. I mean, I guess Amazon could just walk away.
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.200]   Who cares?
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:39.200]   It's just a name.
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:41.200]   But I wonder if Amazon's going to fight this one.
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:42.200]   They should...
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:43.200]   I hope somebody...
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:48.200]   Somebody needs to fight it, right? I mean, there's...
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:49.200]   All right.
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:50.200]   Let's talk...
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:52.200]   We're going to talk about the silliest story of the week.
[00:55:52.200 --> 00:56:00.200]   What if you were to create a buzzword compliant iPhone app that was social photography?
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:04.200]   Instant, quick, easy.
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:07.200]   How much money could you raise? Don't answer that question.
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:11.200]   We will answer it with an unbelievable number.
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:14.200]   Actually, we've got two unbelievable numbers coming up.
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:20.200]   The also the unbelievable number, the record industry is asking for damages from LimeWire.
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:22.200]   I don't know which is more believable.
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:23.200]   LimeWire.
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.200]   Yeah, get ready.
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:27.200]   I don't know if it's an arm run down.
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:28.200]   It's not, but believe me.
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.200]   You're going to love this one.
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:31.200]   We'll talk about it in a moment.
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:34.200]   But first, I just really quickly want to tell you about backing up with Carbonite.
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:37.200]   It's how I back up and how I recommend you all back up.
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:40.200]   When my daughter went to college this year, she brought a laptop with her.
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:45.200]   And I know this dad's on laptops. Hundreds of thousands of laptops are left in airports every year alone.
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:47.200]   I mean, they get lost all the time.
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.200]   And of course, hard drives.
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:49.200]   Disaster happens.
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:50.200]   Catastrophe happens.
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:52.200]   And I know Abby.
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:54.200]   She is not going to be backing up her laptop.
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:55.200]   She's not...
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:58.200]   She's going to be throwing it in her backpack, throwing it around.
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:01.200]   I mean, I know that I'm going to get that call at some point.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:05.200]   Dad, my thesis, it's gone.
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:06.200]   And can you help?
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:09.200]   And I said, I'm going to be able to say, yeah, no problem.
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:11.200]   Log into your Carbonite account. It's sitting right there.
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.200]   Carbonite is online backup done right.
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:14.200]   It's automatic.
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:17.200]   Anytime you're online, it automatically trickles your data up to the Internet.
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:19.200]   It's encrypted 128-bit SSL.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:24.200]   You can even add your own triple desk or blowfish encryption to make sure it's completely private data.
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:28.200]   It also is available to you even before disaster strikes.
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:31.200]   You just log into your Carbonite account on any computer, Mac or PC,
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:35.200]   or they have an Android app, a BlackBerry app, an iPhone app.
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:36.200]   There's your stuff.
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:39.200]   It's really... it's cloud storage plus backup.
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:41.200]   And all that for $55 a year.
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:43.200]   That's $0.15 a day.
[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:44.200]   Unlimited backup.
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:46.200]   All the data on your internal drive.
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:47.200]   Say it's internal.
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:49.200]   You can't just plug in a bunch of external drives.
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:51.200]   Have it back them up and plug into them a bunch more.
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:52.200]   It's...
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:53.200]   This is reasonable.
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:55.200]   Unlimited data on your internal drive.
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:57.200]   So if it's a laptop, your whole laptop is backed up.
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:59.200]   Easy to use.
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:00.200]   Very straightforward.
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:03.200]   I do want you to try it free for two weeks because it is dependent on your Internet connection.
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:05.200]   Make sure you've got enough bandwidth to do this.
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:07.200]   It doesn't slow you down or the connection down.
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:08.200]   It's trickling it up.
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:10.200]   Go to Carbonite.com.
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:11.200]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:12.200]   You get two weeks free.
[00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:20.200]   If you decide this is for me and I know you will use TWIT again when you check out to purchase a year's worth of Carbonite, 12 months,
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:23.200]   and you'll get 14 months, two extra months for free.
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:25.200]   You kind of back it up to get it back.
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:29.200]   So do it right automatically offsite with Carbonite.
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:31.200]   Carbonite.com.
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:34.200]   Offer code TWIT.
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:37.200]   So the guy who created Lala...
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:38.200]   Oh yeah.
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:39.200]   Oh yeah, baby.
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:40.200]   You like Lala?
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:42.200]   I miss it every day.
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:46.200]   I have found that RDO is a reasonable replacement for the fun.
[00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:47.200]   Yeah, I'm following you on RDO.
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:49.200]   You're a big Kanye fan.
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:51.200]   Yeah, I've played Kanye for a while.
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:54.200]   I'm actually really into I love Black and Rob Faleson, Pete, right now.
[00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:56.200]   See, I know that because it's a social...
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:57.200]   I follow you.
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:58.200]   I hear your music.
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:03.200]   Every time you say you follow me, it has a very threatening sound to it.
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:05.200]   Well, when you go to the playgrounds, I don't follow you.
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:07.200]   But you know, I'm kidding.
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:12.200]   But Lala had that RDO doesn't want the ability to upload your own library and share that.
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:16.200]   I definitely miss that because there are things I own that RDO still doesn't have a license for.
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:17.200]   Oh, that's a good point.
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:22.200]   Because RDO is unlimited streaming, but it doesn't have everything.
[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:24.200]   No, Jillian Welsh.
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:26.200]   No Jillian Welsh?
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:28.200]   No, Rebecca Fried.
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:30.200]   No, Rebecca Fried.
[00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:32.200]   Don't get me started.
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:33.200]   I got that thing in my head.
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:35.200]   It's the worst earworm ever.
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:36.200]   You're a producer.
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:38.200]   I can't get stopped.
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:40.200]   It's like, I don't know, it's in my mind now.
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:41.200]   Do math.
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:43.200]   Is that what you do?
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:46.200]   Yeah, if you do math, it'll kill an earworm.
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:47.200]   Oh.
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:49.200]   Do my timetables in your head.
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:52.200]   That's something that math or math.
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:55.200]   Math will kill a lot of things, but probably not an earworm.
[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:57.200]   No, in fact, I think math thinks it works.
[00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:59:58.200 --> 00:59:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:06.200]   No, somebody once told me that if you sing, "My baby takes the morning train."
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:07.200]   It works.
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:09.200]   That's such a bad tune that it can't stick in your head.
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:12.200]   And so it wipes away any earworms.
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:17.200]   I think this Friday song might be the next tune that's so bad it'll kill anything else.
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.200]   Well, it is.
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:19.200]   It's going to kill anyway.
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.200]   This guy started Lala.
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.200]   Where was I?
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:22.200]   Yes.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:26.200]   Mr. Nguyen and his very large windfall.
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:27.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.200]   Well, and this is interesting.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:29.200]   So Lala got sold to Apple.
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:35.200]   And of course now that now he's a star because you create a startup and you sell it to Apple
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:39.200]   for, I don't know, hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:44.200]   When you next go to venture capitalists, they sit up and take notice.
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:47.200]   So Bill Nguyen, well, interestingly enough.
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:52.200]   A few months ago, he purchased color.com for $350,000.
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:56.200]   C-O-L-O-R.com for $350,000.
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:00.200]   So, and he bought by the way, C-O-L-O-U-R.com.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:03.200]   He bought both spellings.
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:06.200]   So people thought, "Ah, Bill's up to something."
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.200]   Well, apparently he was.
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:13.200]   There's a new application that he has put out, came out this week, called color.
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:15.200]   And it's a little weird.
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.200]   I don't know.
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.200]   It's a little strange.
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:21.200]   When you first sign in, it doesn't really tell you anything about what's going on.
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:25.200]   It just says, "Here, give me your name and a picture."
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:29.200]   And I will just broadcast that to the world somehow.
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:34.200]   And then when you take pictures now with color, see there it is, when you take pictures,
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:37.200]   doesn't this look a little creepy?
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:40.200]   It's like IKEA or something.
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:41.200]   I mean, take photos.
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:45.200]   Those figures are very like training for nuclear fallout shelters in 1950s style.
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:47.200]   I feel like this is a little creepy.
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:50.200]   So it says, "Take photos together, Leo."
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.200]   This is it.
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:54.200]   It doesn't really, it's got cryptic things that I don't know what they do.
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:56.200]   I don't know who's pictures these are.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.200]   I don't know what any of this is.
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:01:59.200]   It's just there, right?
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:00.200]   Yeah.
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:03.200]   And then there's a clock, but I don't know what that is.
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:05.200]   And then these are other pictures I took.
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:08.200]   And then, and if I take another picture now, I'll take, here I'll be very meta.
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:11.200]   I'll take a picture of the color icon.
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.200]   So that's really meta.
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:16.200]   So now that is become, that's a picture on color.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:21.200]   Now, as I understand this, and I'm not really clear at all about how this is,
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:28.200]   but everybody within 150 feet of me who's running color will now see the pictures that I took.
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:32.200]   And we're all in a group, we're in an ad hoc group.
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:35.200]   So, that's amazing.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:36.200]   Yeah.
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:40.200]   Well, is it 41 million dollars amazing?
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:44.200]   You know, maybe phase two of the operation might be truly revolutionary.
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:48.200]   And this is just to seed and make people ask questions.
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:50.200]   Like I tried to use it on a recent trip.
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:51.200]   There was no one around me.
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.200]   So I was alone.
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.200]   That was boring.
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:56.200]   And then when I was at a table with other people just testing out the app,
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:59.200]   we were just taking pictures of each other, taking pictures of each other
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:02.200]   to then look at the screen of the pictures we had just taken of each other.
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:04.200]   But it would have just been cheaper to just look at each other's faces.
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:05.200]   It is.
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.200]   That's what's weird because you're there.
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.200]   You're taking pictures of something where you are.
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:10.200]   And you've seen that.
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:14.200]   I can imagine maybe if you're on a field trip with a school to the zoo and different,
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:18.200]   you know, members of your class are taking pictures of different exhibits at the zoo or the museum.
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:23.200]   And you have this collective memory of your trip where you didn't have to take the pictures,
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:29.200]   create a Facebook group or an email list or a shared photo album on Flickr or Picasa,
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:32.200]   upload all these photos, label them and where they were taken.
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:34.200]   You know, the geography is already there.
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:36.200]   The photos were put in an ad hoc group right away.
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:39.200]   There might be something interesting about that.
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:42.200]   I think the UI is totally not intuitive.
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:47.200]   And if you just touch it, you just do something which, you know, my confusion as well.
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:48.200]   Like what's the clock do?
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:51.200]   What's the little pretty NBC peak off looking thing do?
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.200]   I don't know.
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:53.200]   So there's been a lot of.
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.200]   I got so upset about it.
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:56.200]   I had to just drop off the webcast there.
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:57.200]   So.
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.200]   Yes, you hung up on us.
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:03:59.200]   That's it.
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:00.200]   I give up.
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:04.200]   No, but there was no, I don't mind that they got 41 million dollars.
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.200]   It's not my money.
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.200]   Obviously you do.
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:07.200]   I don't mind money.
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:09.200]   Well, I thought it was a day.
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:13.200]   McClure who said what would you do with the 41 million dollars?
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:15.200]   I'd have eight hundred twenty startups.
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:19.200]   You know, it isn't your money, but think of what that money could have done and all the,
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:24.200]   I feel bad for all the startups who have legitimately good ideas who are sitting looking.
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:27.200]   You guys already talked about in the thirty seconds that I wasn't with you.
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:30.200]   The most hilarious review of all time.
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:31.200]   Yes.
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:32.200]   We didn't.
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.200]   It's on iTunes, right?
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.200]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:39.200]   So we had this on Boing Boing this morning where somebody, I'll read a little bit of it.
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:45.200]   Color is a groundbreaking new entry in the, in the new genre of MLPR, MLR, RG, which stands
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:48.200]   for massively multiplayer, real live marketing games.
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:54.920]   And it just goes over like two thousand words and plays on the, the interview in business
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:55.920]   insider.
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:00.480]   I think it was that sort of poo poo is the idea of privacy and lays it out there like it
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:03.200]   is that this is a data mining app.
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:05.200]   Is that really what you think that this is, is all of it?
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:06.200]   To the founder said, yeah.
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:08.200]   Oh, he even said it's too.
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.200]   He's too.
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:14.200]   The chief of product there is the former chief scientist from LinkedIn.
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.200]   Okay.
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:21.120]   And the co-founder, Peter Pham is formerly of an online bill paying service called Bill
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:24.200]   Shrink and did Biz Dev at Photo Bucket.
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.200]   Ah ha.
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.600]   Sold to Fox for $300 million.
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:33.160]   So these, yeah, I mean, it may not make a lot of sense to us at launch here, but, uh,
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:38.720]   neither, I mean, I hate to say this, but neither did Twitter to me when I first saw it.
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:40.760]   So you, you think that this may have some value?
[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:44.960]   Well, I mean, obviously somebody does $41 million worth of value, but, but, but it sounds
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:45.960]   like a capital.
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:47.440]   So Coyle believes it.
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:50.080]   Backers of Google and YouTube and so much more.
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:51.080]   Yeah.
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:54.600]   But at the same time, Bertina, you think that's because there's something, you know, evil
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:56.600]   that's behind the scenes here.
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:58.680]   Well, there's always something evil behind the scenes.
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:05:59.680]   That's what evil does.
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:00.680]   It hides behind the scenes.
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:03.000]   So that's just, that's part of the thing.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.600]   But I think more, uh, slightly more serious and legitimate.
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:08.560]   There's clearly something else going on.
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:12.400]   I don't know that it has to be evil, but there's got to be more here.
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:16.440]   That's a big, that's a big number to put a big bet on something that is obviously foolish.
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:20.080]   Clearly it's not obviously foolish to the people who are putting the money up.
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:22.320]   You've seen this, you've seen this deck color.xx.
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:23.800]   I flip through that.
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:24.800]   Oh, it's pretty cool.
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:28.760]   I want to get, I want to make an app called white and use open as a white screen.
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:29.760]   Colors.
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:30.760]   People love that.
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:31.760]   That's the point.
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:38.080]   People love sharing mobile social apps, sharing mobile social apps color will do all that.
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.920]   And it's a mobile social app that lets you share your favorite color with your friends
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:42.480]   and low quiteances.
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:51.080]   And now this is a mock presentation with all the main, you know, buzzwords, lean, agile,
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:52.080]   organic, grass-fed.
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:56.520]   We're having a fun time on Twitter the other day, imagining the headlines that will start
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:07:00.640]   popping up in tech blogs and on the Wall Street Journal and the like, there's got to be the
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:04.600]   inevitable profile of the founders called people of color.
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:05.600]   Yes.
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:10.280]   You start spinning out like color by numbers, which is the financial profile.
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:15.680]   I want my royalties when they start writing them.
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.880]   You probably know the guy who did this baritone.
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:19.520]   He's a New Yorker, right?
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.560]   He's, I know all the New Yorkers.
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:22.560]   Yeah.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.120]   Yeah, you know, he's in your town.
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.120]   What's his name?
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:29.120]   I make sure to interview all new applicants to the City of New York before they are allowed
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:30.120]   to take away.
[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:31.120]   Yeah.
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:32.120]   Yeah.
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.440]   I'll look him up by identification number.
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:38.360]   You know, some of these jokes are certainly funny.
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:43.720]   My wife was disturbed by how loud I was laughing while looking at this deck in particular,
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:46.040]   but snark is cheap.
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:48.400]   Snark is cheap.
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:49.760]   That's good.
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:50.760]   So you think...
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:51.760]   Yes, it's a very good detail.
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:52.760]   I've really taken it down to others.
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:53.760]   Yeah.
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:58.120]   So really, it's just a bunch of us are really jealous that they got that built by 41 million
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:07:59.120]   dollars.
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:01.480]   I can't see the use case very clearly yet.
[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:06.400]   It's certainly not apparent with such a small user base right now, but I can remember when
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:09.360]   a friend first turned me on to Twitter and Twitter was in different properties.
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:10.360]   Sure, that wasn't obvious.
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:12.880]   And I remember thinking this is totally stupid.
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:15.040]   I don't get why anyone would use this.
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:21.480]   And now it's evolved into something different, but sometimes the need evolves around the
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:23.040]   tool that is available.
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:26.840]   I have to say that I think if they'd launched this, obviously they intended to launch it
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:29.200]   south by southwest and they just missed the deadline.
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:33.120]   Had they launched it south by southwest, it would have been much more interesting because
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:37.800]   you had 1500 people using it and it'd be full of great interesting pictures.
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:40.080]   I wonder about high school kids too.
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.080]   Sure.
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:47.400]   I mean, we're all people whose favorite type of place to check into on Forceware probably
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:48.880]   is airports and...
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:50.080]   And in our bedrooms.
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:56.760]   Yeah, most of my friends, I do have friends in real life that are in my town.
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:57.760]   But...
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:00.360]   And I love them, that's great.
[01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:07.200]   But most of our social lives where it touches technology are not immediately around us.
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:11.040]   Well, here's the reason this is of interest is because there is a big discussion going
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:17.600]   on of whether we're in a bubble, whether there is massive overvaluation of these ridiculous
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:24.040]   things just because there's irrational exuberance over anything on the web.
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.400]   So that and group on?
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:26.400]   Yeah.
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:31.280]   I mean, this is a data point that kind of encourages the thought that maybe we are in a bubble.
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:35.200]   I don't know that $41 million at this day and age is...
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:40.160]   I mean, that's what Henry Blodgett Business Insider said was, "Look, for building almost
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:47.600]   any other kind of business, $41 million isn't that big a raise in a VC-funded sector."
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.440]   And he says, "There's two kinds of strategies.
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:54.000]   There's the Dave McClure style lean startups and then there's the fat startups."
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   That's a big one.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.440]   Yeah, and that's a legitimate strategy as well.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:00.880]   I have to say that's a lot of money.
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:04.720]   What could you possibly need $41 million for?
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:10.120]   The evil plans lurking in the shadows.
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.720]   Well let me ask you guys, are we in a bubble?
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:15.400]   Who's balling the yoga balls at the developer's sit-on?
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:16.400]   Exactly.
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:17.400]   Are we in a bubble?
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:18.400]   Is all this stuff overvalued?
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:20.000]   I mean, come on, look at color.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   Really?
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   What is the value of that?
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   Come on.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.960]   So, I mean, I think we're given the state of the overall economy in the country and around
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:28.960]   the world.
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:29.960]   Yeah, we're in a depression gang.
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:37.440]   Yeah, I don't roll in financing startup circles and go to venture capital events and
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:42.000]   I don't live in Silicon Valley, so I feel perfectly qualified in making up an opinion
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000]   on this subject.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000]   Good.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   It is 4.20.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000]   Go ahead, just live it up.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.080]   Now we're not in a bubble.
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:50.480]   I think, you know, I just doubt it.
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:51.480]   I don't see tons of money.
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:56.400]   I don't see lots of people getting great job offers that suddenly might explode later.
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:59.880]   If it is a bubble, it's a very weird definition of one.
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:04.280]   We're a handful of people, you know, with billions of their own dollars or putting a
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:07.840]   bit of money into a handful of other people who need money.
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:11.520]   So if it is a bubble, it's like a tightly prescribed one.
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:12.520]   Yeah.
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:13.520]   There you go.
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:15.800]   What do you think, Jenny?
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:18.160]   I want some of that sweet 41 million.
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:19.160]   He do.
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:21.760]   I got you a bubble right here.
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:23.200]   You got your use case.
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:28.720]   No, I just, I think it will be interesting to see what happens with this somebody who
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:31.520]   was sort of arguing back and forth with people on Twitter last night.
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:36.640]   What might happen when the summer music festival season comes around and stuff like
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:39.640]   outside lands and on a roof.
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:41.000]   I'm looking at pictures M.G.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.800]   Seeker took of a party and this is fun.
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:50.240]   Adrian Chen at Gawker had a funny piece today about how he used color for a few days and
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:54.560]   saw people around him in the same buildings, be it restaurants or office buildings or his
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:55.560]   apartment building.
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:12:00.280]   I saw people having more fun than him and that that was the killer use for this app
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:06.240]   is seeing how much more miserable your life is.
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:08.200]   These people are having way too much fun.
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:09.200]   I do agree.
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:10.360]   You know, there is something to that.
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:15.280]   I think South by Southwest is probably one of the more connected conferences as far as
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:19.560]   you know, the multiple people there sharing their own perspectives about what panels they're
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:22.760]   into what parties they're at that you are not in.
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:30.280]   And what it, you know, the real time availability of choice that you didn't make and highlighting
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:34.280]   the position you're not in is a relatively new phenomenon in world history.
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:38.440]   You might hear later like a week later, you might read somebody's report about this event
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:41.240]   that you also were like, oh, I didn't even know Big Boy was there.
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:48.320]   Now you know that he's there and you're not champagne and you're not with them backstage
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:49.320]   hanging out.
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:50.680]   And so it does heighten.
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:53.800]   You know, we part of our economy is a big chunk of it.
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:56.200]   Probably all of it's built on desire rather than need.
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:03.280]   And so this ups the the the the the gap, you know, your knowledge of the gap between you
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:04.640]   and the Jones is next door.
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:08.680]   But the Jones is all up in your face showing you real time, how good they have it.
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:09.680]   That's true.
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:12.400]   Differently they have it doesn't necessarily have to be good, but with a different perspective
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:13.400]   right there.
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:17.480]   I'm just pleasantly pleased that so far it's not full of ween.
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:20.920]   Unlike chat roulette, which was just a big ween fest.
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:21.920]   Yeah, ween.
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:22.920]   Oh, ween.
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:23.920]   Oh, ween.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:24.920]   I get it.
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:25.920]   So apparently, how long until it turns into a big schwa.
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:26.920]   Ween fest?
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:27.920]   Yeah.
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:28.920]   We'll use the word schwa.
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:29.920]   We'll use the word schwa.
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:36.360]   Well, my case short.
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:38.120]   What do you know?
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:42.440]   I did one interject one last thought on color.
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:43.440]   Thank you.
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:49.640]   As we discussed that those kinds of use cases, I mean, another way to put it would be if
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:58.520]   they can nail an effective user experience for the the act of empathy of seeing the same
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:06.680]   phenomenon from another person's vantage point, then that sounds like existential disruption
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:07.680]   to me.
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:08.680]   Whoa.
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:11.040]   Marshall is blowing the big terms.
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:13.240]   We have living senses.
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:14.240]   I thought schwa.
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:15.880]   Schlong was a big word.
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:16.880]   All right.
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:17.880]   I'm impressed.
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:18.880]   I'm very happy to be on here with you.
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:19.880]   Wow.
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:20.880]   No kidding.
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:25.120]   According to Ben Parr writing in Mashable, color is going to fix the loneliness problem.
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:26.920]   Oh, sure.
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:27.920]   Yeah.
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:28.920]   Is that my lip?
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:32.200]   You're not gonna say anything, huh?
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:33.200]   But you said enough.
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:34.520]   You said enough.
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:38.760]   He says he talked to Bill and in order somebody in order to get value out of color, someone
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:40.960]   has to be nearby using the app.
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:45.680]   Otherwise, Bill says, Bill, new and the creator, it's not going to make any sense.
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:50.320]   So the next edition, you won't, oh, this will make it better.
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:51.720]   Get this.
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:55.120]   You won't be able to use the app if nobody's nearby.
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:59.320]   Well, okay.
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:04.280]   And color will be changing the distance required for somebody to be considered nearby.
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:08.960]   I don't know if that currently it's 150 feet.
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:11.320]   They're going to start.
[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:12.560]   They've really overthought this.
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.640]   This is what happens when you get $41 million.
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:19.280]   We're going to start adjusting the range based on the density of the city you're in.
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:22.200]   Or square does stuff like that?
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:23.760]   Facebook, stuff like that.
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:24.760]   Really?
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:32.680]   Yeah, I think that not as extensively or as ambitiously as these folks do, but for Google,
[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:40.560]   for Facebook, $41 million split between these three co-founders or these three top people
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:42.760]   is a signing bonus.
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:43.760]   Wow.
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:44.760]   Right?
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:50.120]   I mean, look at pro athletes and the revenue they help generate and the compensation they
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:59.080]   receive and Dave Moran and Path got offered $100 million from Google before a week after
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:01.960]   the silly photo sharing app launched.
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:02.960]   Did they really?
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:04.840]   They got a $100 million offer from Google.
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:06.880]   Yeah, and they turned it down.
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:07.880]   That's crazy.
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:08.880]   And they turn it down?
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:09.880]   Yep.
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:10.880]   But it was a talent grab.
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:11.880]   Right.
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:12.880]   They want a date.
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:13.880]   Yeah.
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:17.400]   Because Path doesn't make any sense.
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:19.640]   It's an Instagram, but you can only have 50 friends.
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:23.160]   I just, it doesn't make any sense.
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:25.640]   Anybody buy a Nintendo 3DS just out of curiosity?
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:28.720]   No, but I did see a, I grabbed a screen shot.
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:32.080]   I sent a, she listened to it over to you on Gizmodo.
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:38.160]   They had an article titled something really strongly worded like hand held 3D devices
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:39.320]   make no sense.
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:42.200]   Like the idea and the premise was the idea of 3D is supposed to be immersive, supposed
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:43.560]   to be surrounded by it.
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:46.920]   So having 3D in your hand is just foolishness.
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:50.280]   And then right below that is like this post sponsored by the Nintendo 3DS.
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:51.280]   Whoopsies.
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:52.280]   Available now.
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:53.280]   It's a loop for you.
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:55.280]   Actually, I played with it.
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:56.280]   It's 3D.
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:58.640]   It's kind of cool to see something popping out at you even though it's a little tiny
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:16:59.920]   screen in your hand.
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:04.920]   It's almost like having, you know, Princess Leia in your hand.
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:09.160]   Or that, that, that was, you know, helping Obi Wan Kenobi, you know, as she's like,
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.160]   you know what I'm saying?
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:11.160]   It's like the little hollering.
[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:12.160]   It's like the little hollering.
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:15.560]   It's like there was a Star Trek next generation I think episode where they had this very addictive
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:16.560]   game.
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:20.120]   They tried to get like a donut and a hoop and you derive some pleasure from the act.
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:21.120]   So it was, well, that's right.
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:22.120]   I remember that.
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:23.120]   Yeah.
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:24.120]   It happened in front of your face and everybody got addicted.
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:25.600]   No, that was Saturday Night Live.
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.720]   That was the cone heads.
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:31.080]   Wasn't that pretty sure there was a Star Trek CNG.
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:33.000]   Where's my chat room people on this?
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000]   Yes.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.200]   So yes, they said Punter Joe, vindicated by Punter Joe.
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:40.240]   Well, anybody in Punter Joe would know.
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:44.640]   Dean Takahashi over at Venture Beat is one of the game's reporters that I paid most attention
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:48.400]   to and he wrote about it in great detail and said that it was fun.
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:52.560]   It was cool, but it was kind of pricey and there was a 30 minute bar for limit.
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:53.960]   Yeah, that's part of the issue.
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:54.960]   More than 30 minutes.
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:58.200]   But there is a little slider that you can turn the effect down if you're starting to
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:59.200]   feel a little worse.
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:00.200]   Or less.
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:01.200]   Yeah.
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:02.200]   The likelihood of tossing your cookies.
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:03.200]   Let's see.
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:04.200]   That's a question.
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:05.200]   Yes.
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:11.480]   You don't, when you go out on the water or if you do like a zero gravity flight, there's
[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:16.920]   different drugs that you can take that will help reduce the likelihood of motion sickness.
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:17.920]   Yes.
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:23.120]   I wonder, does that work for the sort of motion sickness induced by 3D gaming experiences?
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:24.120]   That would be interesting.
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:25.120]   I could it does.
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:28.440]   So, scope decks, scapole, I mean index, a dream that's the thing that the astronauts
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:31.120]   use or I'm blanking out.
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:33.600]   What's the name of the drug that you use for when you're on the water?
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:34.600]   Dremmery.
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:35.600]   Dremmery, thanks.
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:36.600]   It's the one that makes you sort of drowsy.
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:37.600]   Yeah.
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:41.440]   I wonder if that would work for say people who are particularly sensitive to 3D.
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:46.800]   Well, the issue that nausea comes from the fact that your brain's confused because your
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:51.000]   body is moving one way and you're not.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000]   And I think that's what the nausea is.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.800]   Your inner ear is arguing with your brain.
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:54.800]   Exactly.
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:57.520]   And it's like it's trying to tell you alert, alert danger.
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:58.520]   Yeah, we're floating.
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:18:59.520]   Something's wrong.
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:01.520]   You leave the magic mushroom, you should throw up.
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:02.520]   Right.
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:03.680]   Exactly.
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:10.880]   I would take a tablet if it helped me play with my iPad more hours in the day, right?
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:12.280]   The tablet for your tablet.
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:13.280]   Yeah.
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:15.920]   Watch the movie Limitless last night, by the way.
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:16.920]   Really good movie.
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:17.920]   I thought a little.
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:18.920]   Really?
[01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:20.880]   I just got to tell you, if you play with your iPad for more than four hours, you should
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:23.680]   see your doctor.
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:25.320]   I missed some discussion.
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:27.480]   The chat room vindicated me the episode.
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:28.800]   It's called The Game.
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:30.200]   It's Star Trek the Next Generation.
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:31.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:33.640]   Wesley, Wesley Crusher, Ashley Jug, guest stars.
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:34.640]   So take that.
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:39.080]   You know, we should have had Will Wheaton on this episode and then we could have cut right
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:41.400]   through that.
[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:45.720]   Social network LinkedIn that passes 100 million members.
[01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:47.920]   It's not 600 million, but it's still pretty good.
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:48.920]   You know, it's funny.
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:53.080]   In the wake of Facebook, 100 million is like, oh, yeah, 100 million big deal.
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:55.040]   Well, Forrest, I don't know.
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.080]   For me, LinkedIn is very rarely used.
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:58.080]   Thank you.
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:02.920]   Yesterday, someone described it as that network you go to when you're about to lose your job.
[01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:03.920]   Right.
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:04.920]   That's what it's for.
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:05.920]   Right.
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:06.920]   Right.
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:07.920]   Since we're all working.
[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:10.880]   The final thing, it's not a, you don't need it every day.
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:12.920]   Your friends aren't posting baby pictures every day.
[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:16.920]   You're not getting, at least most people I know, I should say, I doubt most of their
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:19.280]   users are daily session timers.
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:22.960]   They got some discussion boards in there that if you're in a particular industry that
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:23.960]   might be quite useful.
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:27.800]   If you're looking to recruit people, it can be very helpful to try to find talent or identify
[01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:31.000]   some at a company that you're trying to reach out to.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.120]   But I guess good for them, 100 million people occasionally log in.
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:35.120]   That's great.
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:39.640]   Faritunde, can I ask you publicly in that case to please separate your Twitter and LinkedIn
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:40.640]   accounts?
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:43.080]   Because every time I go over to LinkedIn, it's full of tweets from you.
[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:44.640]   I will happily do that.
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:45.640]   Yeah.
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:46.640]   No, I, that's a good point.
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:49.040]   I have so abandoned my LinkedIn presence.
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:51.400]   I didn't even think about the other side of it.
[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:54.480]   And I read every one of your tweets religiously on Twitter.
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:55.480]   You don't need it.
[01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:56.480]   You don't need it.
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:57.480]   I'm on LinkedIn again.
[01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:00.440]   No, it's funny because I, when I, when I first, I can't remember was using some social
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:04.120]   network that LinkedIn, LinkedIn, all of a sudden I saw this traffic and I thought, wow,
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:07.040]   people are using LinkedIn, but really mostly they're doing what Baratunde does, which is
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:08.920]   they're pumping their Twitter into it.
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:10.480]   Yeah.
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:12.040]   Bad news from MySpace.
[01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:21.000]   Man, in, in January of 2011, according to ComScore, 73 million uniques, February 63 million
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:27.480]   uniques, loss of 14%, 10 million users in one month.
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:31.920]   So you're saying, well, MySpace and went to LinkedIn, right?
[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:32.920]   Yeah.
[01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:33.920]   MySpace is, yes.
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:38.920]   Isn't that an insightful, MySpace is losing users.
[01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:42.120]   That is the sound of the world's finiest violin playing.
[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:44.080]   Can you hear it?
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:46.640]   They've lost half their staff.
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:48.920]   I wonder if they're going to be able to sell it or if they're just going to have to shutter
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:49.920]   it.
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:51.920]   At this rate, they'll, there won't be anybody there in September.
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:55.240]   There'll be nobody here.
[01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:56.640]   Then we could take it over.
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:03.880]   Uh, guys, I just got some breaking news that Ashley Judd's husband won an Indy car race.
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:05.960]   And that happened moments after we mentioned her name.
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:07.280]   So I think we can take credit for that.
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:08.520]   Would you tweet that?
[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:10.480]   We could see it on your LinkedIn that way.
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:11.480]   [LAUGH]
[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:13.080]   It came in from Sports Center.
[01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:14.760]   I'll just, uh, I'll read to you.
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:18.880]   So, uh, in a couple of days, Larry Page becomes the CEO of Google.
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:24.240]   Eric Schmidt, perhaps the rumor says, we'll take a government job as a secretary of commerce
[01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:25.880]   in the Obama administration.
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:26.880]   Yeah.
[01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:28.080]   Um, which would make sense.
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:29.800]   That would explain a little bit.
[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:35.960]   Larry says, uh, he's going to bring Google back to its roots, uh, talking to Stephen Levy
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:36.960]   and, uh, Levy.
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:39.760]   So, so that would be just like a search engine with a simple input box.
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:40.760]   Yeah.
[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:41.760]   Slowing in the face.
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:42.760]   Please.
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:43.760]   I beg of you.
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:46.840]   Marshall, you, you're following like the Google circles or whatever they're calling this
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:49.480]   stuff that they're testing music, Google music internally.
[01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:53.920]   We were told that they would have launched all of these services by last year.
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:58.640]   Is Google still even looking at a Facebook killer, a music service?
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:59.640]   Any of these things.
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:04.120]   Andrew, there's so many people that work over there and yeah, I have reason to believe it.
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:11.320]   I'd talk to, uh, to enough people that had told me despite Google's VM and denials that
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:17.880]   there is social networking based on personas on contextual integrity of communication.
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:23.360]   You know, one message goes to the, your, uh, your message from church doesn't get rebroadcast
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:27.200]   to your friends from the bar, et cetera, uh, that sort of thing.
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:30.720]   But I expected to see it a couple of weeks ago too and it's not out yet.
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:35.080]   So I think they have to be a little bit frozen in place by, by what we talked about earlier,
[01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:38.240]   this privacy fears, people are scared of Google.
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:42.440]   And I think anything that they do is then they kind of got slapped around over buzz.
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:44.960]   Uh, Google wave was just horrible.
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:46.760]   I think they're a little maybe gun shy.
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:53.880]   Well, and they need to, to ready the ramp for the brain implant whenever that comes out,
[01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:54.880]   right?
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:55.880]   Yeah.
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:24:00.200]   What you're doing before you even know, uh, let's see.
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:02.200]   Oh, last story.
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:04.200]   OMG.
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:07.000]   LOL has entered the OED.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.600]   WTF guys.
[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:12.600]   That too.
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:14.480]   I think this is actually is a non-story.
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:19.520]   It's not, I mean, OED is supposed to include every word that's used in commonly in the
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:34.080]   English language.
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:37.240]   And so they, they've actually had some other words before, uh, BFF, FYI, TMI, LOL and OMG.
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:40.680]   The OED says these are noteworthy initialisms.
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:41.680]   Initialism.
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:42.680]   I didn't even know that was a word.
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:43.680]   Did they, did they officially add initialisms?
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:44.680]   I think initialism is a new word.
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:45.680]   That there's, where's the press release for that?
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:46.680]   Yeah.
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:47.680]   They're strongly associated with the language of electronic communications.
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:48.680]   Actually, I thought it was kind of interesting.
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:51.360]   Is there any kind of communication other than electronic?
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.320]   I think not anymore.
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:58.680]   That was kind of interesting because they trace, uh, think like, uh, OMG's trace back to 1911,
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:24:59.680]   its first use.
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:02.720]   FYI has been used in business since the 30s.
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:04.720]   So many of these are not that old.
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:07.200]   OMG has been used since when?
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:08.200]   1911.
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:09.200]   No, I'm sorry, 1917.
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:10.200]   What about?
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:11.200]   It's the roots of the phrase.
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:12.200]   Oh, okay.
[01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:13.200]   No, no, no.
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:14.200]   1970.
[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:15.200]   That makes a little more sense.
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:16.200]   I'm not 1911.
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:17.200]   Yeah.
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:18.200]   No way.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:23.680]   The Great War was, the Great War was coming and people, yeah, uh, researchers at the OED
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:28.920]   discovered the OMG appeared in a personal letter from 1917.
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:32.080]   LLL had a previous life in the 1960s.
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:35.240]   Remember, it stood for, you don't remember, you guys are old kids.
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:36.720]   It stood for little old lady.
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:39.960]   Oh yeah, that's different.
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:40.960]   That's different.
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:43.560]   I don't see any of this on the Wikipedia entry.
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:46.600]   Well, it can't be real then.
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:50.160]   Uh, five, five years for a Twitter, happy birthday.
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:56.080]   Um, Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner are 80 this week.
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:57.080]   What?
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:59.320]   Yeah, that's what I said.
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:00.320]   WTF?
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:01.320]   That's not okay.
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:02.320]   That's a...
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:05.640]   No, it's hard to believe they're that old, but in fact, they are.
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:08.160]   I want to, can we go back to the OMG thing really quickly?
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:09.160]   Yes.
[01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:12.360]   They said they found usage in a letter.
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:15.240]   So the OED people go through people's personal correspondence.
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:16.240]   They do.
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:19.400]   You gotta read, there's a great book, The Professor and the Mad Men.
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:20.400]   Okay.
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:27.000]   In which, which talks about the roots of the OED and they used all kinds of, uh, doesn't
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.280]   have to be printed in a book to become part of the language.
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:32.760]   And so they use all kinds of sources.
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:36.680]   And, and they were at the time and they were doing this in the, I guess it was the 30s.
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:39.880]   They were cutting up, you know, they'd take a book and they'd cut up and they had slips.
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:41.080]   They had this special thing built.
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:42.280]   I mean, it was amazing story.
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:43.280]   It's a great book.
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:44.480]   Highly recommend it.
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:48.000]   So now they can just read the databases that the government keeps of all our tweets.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000]   Right.
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.000]   Yeah.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:56.640]   I don't want to have my Facebook messages get into who knows who's and the OED.
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:59.200]   I better not show you my Twitter message.
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:01.640]   Oh, dear.
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:03.880]   Shenny Jardin is at boingboing.net.
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:07.920]   Please follow her on what's your Twitter handle, Jenny?
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:08.920]   Shenny Jardin.
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:09.920]   Oh, it's easy.
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:11.720]   X-E-N-I-J-A-R-D-I-N.
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:17.000]   And you tweet good stuff, links and so forth too, which I like.
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:22.400]   I like it when people tweet links because then it populates my flip board or flip book,
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:24.120]   whatever that is on my iPad.
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:25.520]   And your cereal box.
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:26.520]   In my cereal box.
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:27.520]   That's what we want.
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:32.240]   You know, how long before an iPad so cheap you could put it in the back of a cereal box?
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:33.800]   I grew up reading cereal boxes.
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:36.040]   It's just kind of the next thing.
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:38.120]   It's perfect sense to me.
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:44.000]   Marshall Kirkpatrick writes for ReadRightWeb.com.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.160]   So nice to have you again, Marshall.
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:46.160]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:47.800]   Yeah, thanks for having me.
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:50.480]   And that's been a great conversation with all of us.
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:51.480]   Sure.
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:55.000]   It's nice when we get smart people together.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:00.600]   I'll exclude myself from that conversation, but not Baratunde Thurston, who is brilliant,
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:01.600]   as always.
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:07.000]   He's the mayor of all he surveys at paratunde.com.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.640]   Yeah, Baratunde on Twitter.
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:11.240]   And I just thank you for putting me on this episode.
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:13.720]   Shelly, your hero, you're awesome.
[01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:14.720]   It's actually so great to be here.
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:18.040]   Marshall and I met many years ago in Seattle at a conference.
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:22.040]   And I have loved his work and what ReadRightWeb does since then.
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:26.040]   So this is actually like dining with heroes or something like that.
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:27.160]   But, Graham, Leo, you're cool.
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:30.560]   So that's, thank you very, very, very much everybody.
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:31.560]   That's all.
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:32.560]   Just cool.
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:35.360]   No, you got, you know, you have digital things and stuff.
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:36.360]   No.
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:37.360]   You're great.
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:38.360]   Oh, it's okay.
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:39.360]   You don't have to say that.
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:40.360]   Yeah.
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:41.360]   I'll see you guys on color.
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:42.360]   See you on color, baby.
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:46.760]   Don't forget we have, we had a great photo walk, by the way, yesterday.
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:50.200]   I understand mostly Lisa did a great job.
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:55.240]   We're going to have a video from that on mostly photo, which is now Tuesday's 11 a.m.
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:56.240]   Pacific, 2 p.m.
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:57.240]   Easterntime and live.tv.
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:02.360]   That took the place of net at night, which has moved to Mondays at 11 a.m.
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:03.360]   Pacific, 2 p.m.
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:04.360]   Eastern.
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:07.640]   Caroline and Amber MacArthur, they've actually, are they calling it the social hour?
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:08.960]   I think they are.
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:09.960]   The social hour.
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:18.360]   So that's a new time and a kind of a redesign show to cover social media on live.twit.tv.
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:19.360]   I thank you for joining us.
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:20.360]   We'll see you next time.
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:21.360]   Another twit.
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:22.360]   This is amazing.
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:23.360]   I feel like everybody.
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:30.360]   And then the music, all of that.
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:35.880]   This is where we get our glow sticks out when we dance.
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:37.440]   We, Eileen and I think of it as cooking.
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:38.440]   It's like a recipe.
[01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:39.920]   I was just going to make a cooking now.
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:41.760]   Yeah, it's a little pinch of that.
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:42.760]   And always like jazz.
[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:43.760]   Yes.
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:45.520]   So we, so this is a good example.
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:47.120]   This show, we started with Marshall.
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:50.040]   And so Eileen and I think, we'll think on Thursday, we'll kind of brainstorm on who
[01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:51.280]   do we, who do we want.
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:54.920]   And then she heard from, I think she heard from Baratunde and we went, yes.
[01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:55.920]   And then, and then Jenny.
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:30:02.640]   And it was like, oh, oh, it was like, I'm happy this time there was no earthquake during
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:03.640]   the.
[01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:04.640]   Yeah.
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:05.640]   Yeah.
[01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:10.280]   By the way, someone on the chat room just reminded us we never did the line wire story.
[01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:11.280]   Oh crap.
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:14.320]   He's the, well, let me do the line wire story.
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:15.760]   I can't believe I left it out.
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:17.040]   Did you read this story?
[01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:20.200]   So the music industry wants punitive damages on line wire.
[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:23.480]   Remember line wire is they already put them out of business.
[01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:27.320]   It was the music sharing, you know, it was a peer to peer sharing service.
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:31.360]   75 trillion dollars.
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:34.680]   So when you say that number, I think you're required to put your pinky at the corner of
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:35.680]   your mouth.
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:36.680]   Trillion.
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:37.680]   There you go.
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:38.680]   That's much better.
[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:39.680]   Trillion.
[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:40.680]   Yeah.
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:45.600]   13 record companies, 75 trillion.
[01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:51.640]   So I got to ask this question, this was, we're not a part of some kind of hoax situation.
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:52.640]   You're right.
[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:53.640]   This is not a piece of satire.
[01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:56.880]   No, like this is, this is not the onion law.
[01:30:56.880 --> 01:31:04.600]   I don't know unless, unless law.com, maybe law.com is, is law.com is like the onion of
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:06.600]   law, but I don't think so.
[01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:07.600]   Federal judge.
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:08.600]   Wow.
[01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:09.600]   Okay.
[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:13.040]   Kimba Wood, who's, yeah, she said it's absurd.
[01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:17.240]   So what's the language of the claim here?
[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:24.120]   They say, "Lamware owes it trillions of dollars in damages for enabling the illegal distribution
[01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:27.120]   of 11,000 copyrighted songs."
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:28.120]   So they multiply.
[01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:29.120]   So they multiply.
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:30.120]   So they multiply.
[01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:31.120]   So they multiply.
[01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:32.120]   So they multiply.
[01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:33.120]   So they multiply.
[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:34.120]   So they multiply.
[01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:35.120]   So they multiply.
[01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:36.120]   So they multiply.
[01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:37.120]   So they multiply.
[01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:38.120]   So they multiply.
[01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:39.120]   So they multiply.
[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:40.120]   So they multiply.
[01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:41.120]   So they multiply.
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:42.120]   So they multiply.
