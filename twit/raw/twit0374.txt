[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.120]   It's time for "Twit" this week in Tech
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.760]   to show the covers all your latest tech news.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.000]   We look forward here with the crew.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   I mean, a great pair.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.680]   But I think we really can blame this panel on SpaceX.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.040]   And I'll explain that in a moment.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.760]   First, let me introduce Veronica Belmont, who
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.600]   is visiting us-- newlywed Veronica Belmont.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.680]   He was visiting us via Skype.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.760]   Hi, Veronica.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.260]   Hi.
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.760]   How are you?
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.920]   Congratulations.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:52.960]   Thank you very much.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.960]   We had Ryan on-- was it last week or a couple weeks ago?
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.120]   We looked at wedding pictures.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.760]   You look-- that was a beautiful dress.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.280]   You look cool.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.280]   Oh, thank you.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.640]   Thank you.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.440]   Yeah, I have to go through all the other photos
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.960]   and get them all sorted out and stuff.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.680]   But haven't had time quite yet.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.360]   And so the hashtag from now on for your life is "Blockmont."
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.960]   Are you?
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.720]   Yes, until the end of days.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.840]   I think that's so great.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.160]   The first people I know who have a hashtag for their wedding.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.760]   But that worked because all I had to do
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.720]   was search for "Blockmont."
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.600]   I could find all the wedding pictures and everything.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.000]   Yeah, sorry.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.880]   I couldn't be there in person.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.240]   But everything in the world is going on in San Francisco
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.800]   this weekend.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.080]   I don't know if you knew that.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.240]   So traffic in and out of the city is insane.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.040]   Yeah, it's like--
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.240]   It got fles--
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.640]   I hated you for not coming here.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.600]   But then I realized you're absolutely right.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.120]   There's the America's Cup.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.640]   Mm-hmm.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.720]   Fleet Week.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.200]   So the Navy's flying around.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.280]   Bluegrass Festival.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.240]   Bluegrass-- strictly--
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.760]   Partly strictly--
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.320]   Partly strictly--
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.480]   Partly strictly--
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.480]   Partly strictly--
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.000]   Bluegrass.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.760]   Kind of maybe bluegrass.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.160]   Which is free.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.520]   Yeah, the Castro Street Fair.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.560]   Castro Street Fair is this weekend too?
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.520]   Niners are playing.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.720]   And then the Niners are playing.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.200]   And of course, the Giants and the Reds and the playoffs.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.280]   All of that's in San Francisco.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.520]   And a Burning Man party.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.040]   Seriously, in the mission.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.480]   Wow.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.000]   Really?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.800]   Yep.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.280]   Wasn't it like--
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.240]   What did we know about that one?
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.720]   Burning Man was like two days ago.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.000]   It was like a reunion party.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.800]   We miss it so much.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.200]   Maybe that's how we were in the desert.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.920]   It was awesome.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.880]   Bring the wine.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.120]   It's a play a party.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.960]   That's Tom Merritt from Tech News Today.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.760]   We rarely have Tom on this show because we
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.160]   don't want to confuse you.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.720]   Right.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.760]   But you're here.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.560]   And so is Justin Robert Young from NSFW.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.920]   Because you guys will be part of our SpaceX coverage.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.880]   We're going to do the weird-- we're
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.160]   going to help weird things do your--
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.640]   Sure.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.640]   Yeah.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.520]   We're moving the weird things special event here.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.200]   You were nice enough to know.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.440]   Andrew Mayn will be on Skype.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.680]   Andrew Mayn will be on Skype live from Cape Canaveral.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.800]   He's going to be there.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.040]   He is there now.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.840]   And he's going to have the coverage there.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.280]   So as soon as we're done with Twit,
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.800]   we're talking--
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.280]   Right away.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.120]   We have a limited window.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.320]   We're going to go and run over to the other set.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.440]   And hopefully, right in the first--
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.440]   It's a launch window.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.440]   --it's a launch window.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.160]   We're going to see the first ever private cargo run.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.680]   Wow.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.440]   So we have a hard out for Twit today?
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.960]   We do.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.440]   We do.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.040]   You'll be glad to hear that, Ron.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.080]   You know, there's a new thing.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.640]   There's a new meme going on where people get up only an hour
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.680]   or two or three into Twit and leave.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.040]   They say, I thought it'd be over by eight o'clock.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.600]   It's like occupy end of show.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.120]   Like an actual long panel.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.920]   Just like take off.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.440]   Yeah.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.160]   Yeah.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.680]   So--
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.640]   By the way, for those of you who are only audio listeners,
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.280]   please go ahead to the meme that will surely
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.440]   be cropping up of the impressed Veronica face,
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.040]   like the impressed and not bad obonuts.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.680]   That was good.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.760]   I like that.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.840]   Hard out for Twit.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.360]   Yeah.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.720]   I'm bad.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.160]   Yeah, impressed Veronica.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.480]   Wow.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.360]   You are married, aren't you?
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.600]   My ex-wife used to make that face all the time.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.000]   Now, I realize I'm wearing a cowboy hat.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.640]   And I just realized that this is actually--
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.360]   the brim is casting a shadow that's not really
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.040]   very solicitous.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.640]   So I'm going to replace the cowboy hat.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.200]   I have another hat that's a smaller brimmed hat.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.400]   And I think it's more--
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.720]   More appropriate to the show.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.720]   Oh, you're a cook.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.120]   I am a certain kind of cook.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.720]   You look like a Bond henchman.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.400]   Say his name, Justin.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.760]   What's my name?
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.600]   You know my name.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.680]   What's my name?
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.360]   And who knocks?
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.520]   You know where this is a pork pie hat.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.840]   And this came up because I was watching "Breaking Bad."
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.280]   And actually, I think Sarah Lane and I were talking about it.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.960]   And I said, what is that funny hat that Walter White, Heisenberg,
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.120]   Brian--
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.960]   what's his--
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.460]   Cranston.
[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.280]   Cranston, that's right.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.200]   What is that hat Brian Cranston wears?
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.920]   And I didn't know.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.800]   I thought, that's as strange as weird as heck.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.000]   And then everybody in the chair.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.520]   I said, no, that's a pork pie hat.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.020]   We got--
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.200]   worn by jazz artists and strange people.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.680]   It doesn't--
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.840]   Take it where a black suit--
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.520]   --is everywhere with a skinny tie to really give me--
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.920]   Yeah, there's a combo not feeling that.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:39.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.120]   I was like, Popeye or something.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.760]   It looks like you should be hailing kebs.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.240]   Like me.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.080]   Oh, I am.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.240]   I am the Sir Francis Drake.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.160]   I am the doorman at the Sir Francis Drake.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:49.660]   Absolutely.
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.480]   They've got a new Western theme.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.480]   Are you hired the Firefly crew and won't pay them?
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.320]   Could be.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.840]   Something like that.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.640]   Could be that as well.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.120]   So boy, there's a lot of news.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.080]   We have such a great panel here, people
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.760]   who are expert who follow this.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.120]   Really?
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.120]   Who's joining us?
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.120]   That's exciting.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.280]   We're all about exciting.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.160]   Next week will be--
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.080]   But let's-- you know, I wouldn't mind starting.
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.600]   Because you were here for this, Tom.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.280]   A year ago, October 5, Steve Jobs passed away.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.560]   And it was a very moving day for all of us.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.520]   And here we are a year later in the tech industry.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.480]   And I'm just wondering if there are thoughts a year later
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.480]   about Steve Jobs.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.960]   I liked-- we talked about this on Tech News today this week.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.720]   I liked Matt Honan's article, why we will never
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.880]   stop talking about Steve Jobs.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.080]   Because obviously, there were a lot of articles.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.000]   Because some of which were from a place of admiration
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.800]   saying, gosh, it's been a year and he was so important.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.160]   Some of which were probably link bait to say,
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.200]   if we put a Steve Jobs story, people will click.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.640]   And a lot of people were like, gosh,
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.680]   do we really need to drag this out again?
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:55.200]   And Matt's point was, Steve Jobs changed so many industries,
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.560]   affected so many industries, even if you hate him,
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.840]   even if you think he gets too much credit, he had an effect.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.920]   You can't argue with that.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.680]   And so he will be talked about, like Thomas Edison
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.480]   and Nikola Tesla and others, or Henry Ford,
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.600]   not because he's as good as them or he's even the same as them.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.440]   But he had that kind of impact on people.
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.640]   And just like Thomas Edison, Thomas Edison
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.280]   is criticized by many people saying he gets too much credit.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.320]   He didn't invent all the things people claim he did.
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.560]   But they're still talking about him.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.720]   And the same thing about Steve Jobs.
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.040]   You make an apt point.
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.960]   And this is the illustration for Matt Honan's article
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.960]   in Wired.com by Simon Lutrin.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.680]   And these are the four right people to pick
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.280]   because Ford was a Nazi sympathizer.
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:47.680]   - Well, no, seriously, none of these guys were paragons
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.760]   of virtue.
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.760]   And I think maybe Edison, it turns out Edison became Edison
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.760]   because his primary job was stealing patents
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.000]   for people to animals.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.280]   - He would be, he killed an elephant because of Tesla.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:07.280]   But seriously, Edison started by reverse engineering
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.400]   patented inventions for money.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.960]   You know, he was a patent troll.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.120]   I don't know if you can say anything bad about Tesla
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.440]   except he has a terrible hairdo.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.960]   But other than that,
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.000]   - I mean, he was legitimately crazy.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.920]   - Yeah, yeah, I think he was just insane.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.960]   And that's why he could never get his stuff together to--
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.680]   - Yeah, he had, was it like a deep personal,
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.920]   if not romantic relationship with a pigeon?
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:31.760]   (laughing)
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.600]   - Is that right?
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.440]   - I believe so.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.440]   - Yeah, it was a bird, some kind of bird.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.000]   I'm sure someone's gonna have it in the chat room.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.160]   - Like Mike Tyson in that way.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.160]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.000]   - Customado.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.160]   - Great of their age.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.560]   - So I close throw Mike Tyson in here too.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:49.520]   I guess what you could say is great men are often quirky.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.360]   - Certainly so.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.120]   I mean, as far as jobs, you know,
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.920]   there was just so many elements to who he was,
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.480]   not only in just kind of the force of personality
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.720]   in an interview, but also he had this great narrative
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.880]   to his life, which we always, you know,
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.440]   revisited while he was alive.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.840]   And now in its totality, it's just so immaculately impressive
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.280]   that we keep referring to it.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.280]   But also consider this, you know, you saw in both,
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.360]   you know, Mitt Romney and Barack Obama's speech
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.760]   at their conventions positively mentioned Steve Jobs.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.600]   - Wow.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.760]   - And Apple as an example of, you know,
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.640]   in this very complicated economic time of, you know,
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.000]   on Mitt Romney's side, how innovation, you know,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.960]   will be the savior and, you know,
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.760]   sticking to a private business and creating
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.080]   and innovating is what we need to do.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.880]   And on, you know, Barack Obama's side
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.640]   that things aren't going all that bad,
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.240]   because look, we've created, you know,
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.440]   the most valuable company, you know,
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.960]   over this four year period,
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.960]   while things have been obviously very complicated.
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.240]   So, you know, that's the kind of person he is.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.720]   I mean, he's almost this post,
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.640]   that when nothing is post political,
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.960]   he is post political.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.200]   He got, you know, gigantic invasions
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.120]   in both conventions when they mentioned him.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.640]   - And I think it's important to note too,
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.120]   that a lot of the concern when he passed away,
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.600]   other than of course just being, you know,
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.040]   sorry, very sad for the loss of Steve Jobs
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:13.440]   was about Apple itself and the continued survival
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.280]   and success of that company.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.160]   And I think we've seen over the past year
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.960]   that it has continued to go on the path
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.240]   that he set out for it.
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.800]   And, you know, that's probably partially
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.160]   what Steve Jobs did and also the fact that he left behind
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.440]   a good group of people to run the company instead.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.840]   - And I do think we will eventually,
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.560]   and eventually is in deep bold letters,
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.520]   get past the what would Steve Jobs have done thing.
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.600]   I don't think it's going to be any time
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.440]   in the next five years. - I think we should
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.680]   get rid of that now.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.240]   - It'd be nice, you know.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.640]   - But yeah, but I don't know if you read our,
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.160]   Jackie Chang's article on our "Stectico",
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.280]   but she talked with a lot of people inside of Apple
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:51.520]   and they said as much as people try not to do it,
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.440]   it still happens.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.040]   I mean, Steve Jobs said, don't talk about what I would do.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.200]   Just do what you think is right.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.200]   - He knew that that was a pitfall.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.040]   - And yet that was a pitfall.
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.600]   - Yeah, he said that's a pitfall.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.360]   - Steve Jobs wouldn't let this happen
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.880]   for whatever they're talking about.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:03.720]   - Yeah.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.560]   - But it's almost done.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.400]   - One thing that's hard to say,
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.800]   I don't think anyone really, even when he was alive,
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.280]   knew what he would have done for the last minute.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.120]   So it's very hard to think in that way
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.040]   because it could have changed
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.200]   at any particular moment in time.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.440]   And so it's a hard thing to kind of, you know,
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.000]   go forward on because you never knew.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.400]   - Yeah, and that was a bit of why we loved him
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.040]   'cause he was this kind of oracle,
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.600]   or at least the myth around him was
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.240]   that he was this kind of oracle.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.080]   - Do we love him?
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.240]   - Because he was so good at creating the image
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.200]   of Steve Jobs, or did he genuinely make a contribution?
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.280]   - Oh, I mean, I think if you,
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.920]   and the Houghton article does a great job
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.320]   of just running down all the fields
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:46.160]   in which he absolutely made a indelible impact, you know,
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.960]   from, you know, and I think we might talk about it
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.280]   a little bit later of like where, you know,
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.720]   phones, computers throughout the world,
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.560]   the music industry.
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.800]   - Are going to be phones, you know.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.720]   The music industry and my,
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.440]   in I'm a voracious non-fiction reader.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.160]   My favorite line of non-fiction writing ever
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.360]   comes from Steve Levy's "The Perfect Thing"
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.120]   in describing Steve Jobs' initial meeting
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.960]   with the five labels and he walked into the room with,
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.880]   and this is the line for line description,
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.640]   ball-high-gene shorts.
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:17.960]   (laughing)
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.800]   It's just like my favorite description of like,
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.080]   like, I can see it.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.640]   - I'm Steve Jobs, and this is what I got.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.160]   - Exactly, not in my sense of song,
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.160]   $10 an album, you'll never regret it.
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.200]   What, it's computer-sailing music.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.520]   What could possibly go wrong?
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.720]   - You could go out of business or you could do what I want.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.400]   - Yeah, and he's essentially the editor.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.040]   - Well, no, he's told them to them as like,
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.640]   it's a, it's a, you know,
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.480]   - Don't worry.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.320]   - Nothing for you guys.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.160]   - Don't worry.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.480]   - This is such a small part of your business.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.320]   - Don't worry.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.080]   - Yeah, you can get around the Napster thing, you know,
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.120]   'cause you guys are all pulling your hair out about that.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.880]   Here's just an easy way that people can buy your music,
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.600]   and then all of a sudden, it's affected.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.840]   It was so successful that it's almost
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:00.320]   hampered Apple going forward with television, movies,
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.880]   specifically with the Apple TV.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.320]   - The industry's terrified of Apple.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.840]   The cable companies won't make a deal with Apple.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.920]   That's, you know, as to-
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.320]   - So there's a little bit of a difference there,
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.680]   'cause the cable companies wanna own the relationship,
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.200]   and it's similar to what publications are doing,
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.440]   but the fear is there.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.280]   - Yeah.
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.200]   - So we're going from like, we saw what you did with music,
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.960]   and if you do that with the actual customer information,
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:21.800]   we're screwed.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.480]   So it's not just about selling shows,
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.840]   it's about, we're the cable companies,
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.400]   we manage that information with the customers,
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.560]   and we wanna continue that, and you know Apple resists that.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.480]   They're like, no, we don't wanna give that information.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.520]   - Yeah, that's one of the reasons
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.720]   the Facebook deal fell through with Ping.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.960]   Is that Facebook wanted customer information?
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.360]   Apple said, nope, you're not gonna do that.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.760]   - Poor Ping, Ping is dead.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.880]   - Ping died this week.
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.760]   If I had on, I would take it off in Ping's memory.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:46.760]   - There we go.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.200]   - Oh, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.240]   - We hardly knew you.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.240]   If I could have thought I ever used it.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.440]   - No, I tried to use it a lot.
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.280]   - It was bad.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.480]   - It was just frankly, good riddance.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:01.640]   - You know, we sometimes people knock jobs
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.560]   'cause he was such a good marketer,
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:04.960]   but I think about Thomas Edison,
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.160]   who completely, especially in later life,
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.600]   marketed the brand Thomas Edison.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.480]   I mean, it's not a knock against the fact
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.480]   that he invented the light bulb in the phonograph.
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.240]   And I mean, he still did those things
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.600]   and he marketed himself.
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.200]   - And you'll have people argue that he didn't invent the light bulb
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.520]   and that he stole the film and idea from this guy.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.920]   And he's a whole story about the guy who,
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.000]   I think was a Scott inventor,
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.360]   who did in fact invent the light bulb.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.320]   And people think Edison invented the light bulb
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.400]   because he got the US government to issue a stamp saying
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.240]   he invented the light bulb and talk about good marketing
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.280]   that stamp proves it.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.580]   It's, hey, the federal government said he invented the light bulb.
[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.460]   - But real quick, to the point of when we will stop talking about,
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.960]   or if we will stop talking about what would Steve Jobs have done.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.460]   I mean, like, you know, Frank and Weenie
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.060]   underperformed at the box office.
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.060]   We're not saying-- - We're not saying--
[00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:51.980]   - We're not saying-- - Did you have it
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:52.820]   in the movie draft?
[00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:54.120]   - Well, we must, Disney have done.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.380]   No, I had taken two, which by the way,
[00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.780]   made $50 million this weekend.
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:57.620]   - What?
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:58.860]   (laughing)
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.140]   - Crime.
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.000]   - Who had the master?
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:02.920]   - Nobody had the master.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.680]   - I know, just checking out.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.520]   - Came out too early.
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.360]   Oh, the master was awesome.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.200]   Did you guys see the master?
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.520]   - You know, shot in 65 millimeter.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.680]   - That was short, it was very boring.
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.900]   - It's only boring if you like movies with plots.
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.180]   Are you-- (laughing)
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.340]   - It had no plot, but I thought it would be acting.
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:19.980]   - I thought it had a plot, it had a simple plot.
[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:20.820]   - The acting was great, but--
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.620]   - I'm sorry, you were making a Frank and Weenie point.
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.860]   - I'm saying, nobody's, we're not saying today,
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.060]   Walt Disney wouldn't have done this.
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:27.900]   - Right.
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:28.900]   - You know, but we did say that--
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.500]   - You know, in fact, it's interesting you should say
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.060]   that Walter Isaacson and his biography of Steve Jobs
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.700]   mentions, in fact, that the Disney company
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:39.220]   for 20 years was hindered, hampered,
[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.040]   by the fact that nobody would make a decision
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.720]   without saying what would Walt do.
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.020]   That actually hurt Disney, and for a long time,
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.560]   Disney went through a bad spell until it was sold
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.420]   and others started running and didn't ask that question.
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.000]   So that can be a pitfall.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.260]   - Oh, yeah, but I mean--
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.560]   - I think-- - I learned not to is what I'm saying.
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.640]   - Yes, and Apple will have to learn how to--
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.640]   - They have to. - Especially if it is
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.940]   an internal meme that people are knocking down ideas,
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.740]   or affecting ideas because of this--
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.240]   - It's too easy to do that, yeah.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.920]   - Well, I think what Jackie Chang's article was saying was,
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.720]   what happens is people say, no one's coming in
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.780]   and calling BS on stuff, and that's what Jobs used to do,
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.460]   and that's what's really stoking that mean to continue
[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:19.700]   within, is like, Tim Cook is a different style guy,
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.460]   and there's nobody else who's got the authority
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:25.300]   to wait in and go, no, this is crap, start over.
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.340]   And that was the role that Jobs filled particularly.
[00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:30.900]   - Yeah, I'm still very interested to see how the next
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.800]   five years are going to pan out with Apple,
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:36.080]   because as I mentioned earlier, there was a roadmap
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.580]   in place at the time of Steve's Jobs passing,
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.180]   and we haven't, we're not seeing anything deviating really
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.960]   from that plan yet, so I hate to say,
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.860]   I'm curious to see what the future holds,
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.760]   but in this case, I actually am curious to see
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.420]   what the future holds, because that will really
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.500]   be the telling thing. - That's on legit.
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.100]   - Yeah, that seems legit.
[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.740]   - And I have to say, we're probably at the end
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.160]   of that roadmap, we're close to it.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.180]   I mean, the iPhone 5, everybody said Jobs worked on directly.
[00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:03.800]   If there is an Apple TV, which I'm starting to doubt,
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.780]   presumably Jobs worked on that,
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.080]   but beyond that, I don't think there's anything else
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.480]   in the pipeline, right?
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.220]   - I'll tell you what, there is such a market
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:16.980]   for just any kind of television that makes the
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.020]   interacting with television that I agree.
[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.660]   - Why is it television the worst?
[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.520]   - Oh, gosh, it is terrible.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.700]   - It's the angry.
[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.460]   - Like I have like Uverse, and now I don't know,
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.560]   like their Uverse app, the remote app,
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.900]   is better than using-- - What's the problem though?
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.400]   - Problem is, I never know what channel anything's on.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.600]   - You know, I never want to take the time--
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.340]   - Across channel, across platform search,
[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.080]   where you could say, okay, breaking bad,
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:41.920]   where can I watch that?
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.240]   - There's so many half-assolutions.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.280]   - Yeah, I want to see you with my TV.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.080]   - Veronica did a great thing, which I've referred to again
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.580]   and again, I don't know if anybody's ever told you,
[00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.560]   but we often refer to the set-top box
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.200]   that you did for Tekzilla.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.960]   - Oh, yeah, that's still live, too.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:00.860]   - Yeah, b-i-t-t-l-y slash set-top,
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.000]   and it will go to a Google spreadsheet
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.760]   that has been kept alive by, sorry, it's loading, it's huge.
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:11.760]   Kept alive by your users about what these things do.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.880]   - They've taken it above and beyond
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.320]   what I ever expected to be. - It's so good.
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.720]   - It's all user-gen info, it's all stuff
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.520]   that they found online, and if there's any kind of question
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.120]   about the veracity of one of the segments,
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.600]   people go in and fix it and do research for it.
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.280]   - It's a Wikipedia for set-top boxes.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.480]   - Well, and there you go, there's the trouble right there.
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.320]   - That we need it.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.840]   - That many people will-- - I can't even--
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.960]   - This spreadsheet is so big, that much time
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.680]   to keep something like that up to date.
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.840]   So people obviously want this to work,
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.640]   and yet there's nothing in there
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.160]   that makes people go, "I don't need this spreadsheet."
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.000]   That's the choice.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.720]   - Isn't that what Google TV was supposed to do?
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.120]   - But even, theoretically, but then it had the gigantic--
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.040]   - Google TV does a lot of what you want.
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.920]   It says, "We don't care where it's from,
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:57.720]   "we're gonna give you a single unified interface
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.440]   "and tell you what's on your DVR
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.560]   "and what's available on demand."
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.360]   So you just search for your program.
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:03.760]   - We just broke Google down.
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:04.600]   - Ah, well.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.360]   - Everybody, I am kidding, I am kidding, you're not.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.080]   Everybody watching the show just went
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.200]   to load that spreadsheet, and it now says,
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.120]   "Trying to reach google.com."
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.120]   (laughing)
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.800]   - You broke Google, it's just down the road.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.120]   - I don't think it's a service.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.480]   - Yeah, it's fine.
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.320]   - And what do you think are like--
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.440]   - That's proof positive.
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.840]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:25.680]   - Holy cow.
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:26.760]   - You know, like today I wanted to watch,
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:31.760]   they had the A's game on MLB network, you know?
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.120]   I wanted to go watch that, and so I flip on that channel.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.240]   Apparently I've not subscribed to it,
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.760]   but it's like there's just even the interface to be like,
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.040]   "Okay, well I wanna get this channel
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.040]   "is like four menus and just, I don't know,
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:45.880]   "it's just a pain."
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.480]   - You know, you can buy the MLB app on the iPad
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.160]   and airplay it to your Apple TV.
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.480]   You get the audio from the broadcast.
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.120]   - I don't know, I didn't think you could do MLB app.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:53.960]   - What an idiot, I am.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.320]   - You can get the audio from the broadcast
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.760]   and then you get the quad view.
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.960]   MLB is smart.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.200]   - He's a reds fan, paying attention to him.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.440]   - They're not a card those fans.
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:02.280]   - Oh, you're a card those fans.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.160]   - They are red, but they're, all right.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.560]   - So, but the thing with MLB is like, they're smart.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.200]   They're like, we're not gonna get in the way
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.600]   of these contracts with, especially ourselves in this case,
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.720]   but we're going to give you an avenue.
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.720]   That's a little different.
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:18.120]   If you have the HD version on your television to watch,
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.040]   you're gonna choose that over the quad view on the app,
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.520]   but if you don't have either one quad view,
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.600]   you're gonna get your-- - This is great for MLB,
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.240]   but this does not solve the overarching problem
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.280]   of, you know, we don't have an all-a-card system in place.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.680]   I would, I think, still be the most beneficial
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.880]   for users out there, but the networks will never agree
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.120]   to that kind of stuff and Comcast will never agree to that
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.280]   and Dish never will.
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.080]   So, we have all these little bits and bobs
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.880]   and ways that we can view certain shows occasionally
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.160]   and it's just, it's not user friendly.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:46.160]   It's not conducive to a good experience.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.360]   It's so archaic at this point, it's ridiculous.
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.200]   - Well, in fact, MLB is a perfect example
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.160]   of the fragmentation.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.800]   Everybody says, oh, we'll solve it
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.360]   with our particular content.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.720]   I mean, we've got a Twitter app, same thing,
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:58.560]   but what do you do?
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.520]   Is there some way, I mean, how are you gonna solve this?
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.120]   You create some basket with every show gets thrown into it
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.840]   and then you can play whatever you want.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:05.680]   - Well, never gonna have--
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.280]   - I mean, the problem is that the networks,
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:11.200]   that entire industry from the networks on
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.880]   is based on the idea that they are getting
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.920]   X amount per subscriber.
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:18.880]   You know, like networks count on their entire revenues,
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.040]   or at least the majority of the revenues,
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:23.560]   are based on what they get for the larger cable company,
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.400]   each subscriber they have.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.240]   - So they have to reinvent how they make money.
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.080]   They have to--
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.240]   - Which is not gonna happen.
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.520]   - Well, it's gonna take one of the guys
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.840]   at the back of the line to go, fine,
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.440]   you know what we're doing so poorly,
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.240]   Dish Network or Cable Vision or something.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.240]   - Or Louis CK.
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.320]   - That will partner up with Apple
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.040]   and will give them that customer relationship
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.800]   'cause it's better than going out of business
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.560]   if we can be the ones to blaze the trail.
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.720]   Once that domino falls, my theory is,
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.080]   everybody else starts to fall in line
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.320]   just like everything else Apple is.
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.800]   - What if instead of the companies that do that,
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.880]   it's the content creators like Louis CK who say--
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:54.880]   - That's a lot to do.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.560]   - We don't even need those middlemen,
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.160]   why don't we just go direct?
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.800]   - Because you need something to replace that cable
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.000]   in people's living rooms.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:02.840]   And having Louis CK--
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:03.760]   - It's called the internet.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.320]   - And it's called the internet.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.960]   - But you need everybody to move the,
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.120]   you need HBO and CBS.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.280]   You don't need HBO, you don't need CBS.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.200]   You need the people who create shows for HBO.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.760]   - But then you need every single person
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:15.600]   who creates shows. - You need David,
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.320]   so that takes a lot longer to get everybody
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.240]   to move over. - Yeah, it's not.
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.280]   - Yeah, you need, you need to mean,
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:22.200]   Game of Thrones is shot in what, four countries?
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.520]   You know, probably-- - I mean, that could happen
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.000]   with a Netflix or something like that.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.760]   They've got House of Cards coming up in February
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.320]   and they have Arrested Development coming up.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.520]   But then there's gonna be the one show
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.160]   you wanna watch that isn't on Netflix.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.800]   And it's on still on the old version.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.760]   - As Matt Three in the chat room says,
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.600]   Louis CK only works because he's already famous.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.160]   - Nope, they say that all the time.
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.000]   - People who are chosen-- - I don't agree
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.800]   with that, I'm with Veronica on this.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.200]   He has a very successful show on a network
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.360]   that he gets paid for.
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.320]   He was a touring comedian, you know,
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.800]   that had a lot of people, you know,
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.120]   including me go to see him before he did this kind of stuff.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.840]   You know, there's, I think the lesson of--
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.400]   - He gets mad when people say that, by the way.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.040]   - I'm sure he does. - He says no.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:23:59.880]   - About a lot of things.
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.880]   You ever watched this said?
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.080]   - He's an angry man.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:05.880]   - You know, there's, I think that the lesson for Louis CK
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.440]   is there's not to learn from it,
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.880]   but it's not that the gates have broken open.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:10.760]   - They say that about me.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.240]   They say that about anybody who creates content that--
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.360]   - What about Chris Hardwick?
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.320]   - There are plenty of people,
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.160]   exactly, Nerdist John-- - Well, he can't--
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.000]   - Well, he's not the most-- - Well, he's not the most--
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.240]   - Well, what are you talking about?
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.800]   You're an existing entity, Chris Hardwick's an existing entity,
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.520]   like it's-- - Where do they exist from?
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.440]   - I watch Chris Hardwick every day after the--
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.520]   - The presumption-- - The presumption--
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:27.400]   - The guarantee on single note.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:31.240]   - The presumption is, and I think this is perhaps true now,
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.320]   but will not always be true,
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.520]   that you need mainstream media to propel you to that point.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:36.840]   Now, I look at Jonathan Colton,
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.360]   who in fact did not do it that way.
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.960]   There are examples of people who did not do it that way,
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.360]   but that's what your guys are saying.
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.120]   Oh, you need to be mainstream famous--
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.800]   - No. - So that you can then be internet famous,
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.440]   and I think that day is in.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.400]   - No, that's not what we're saying.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.440]   - Trerective, of course, yeah. - You're not gonna be able
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.240]   to break out of that TV model.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.560]   You're not going to be able to totally tear down the walls
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.360]   of what is existing already and get every single person
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.840]   to have successful, you know, have jobs
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.720]   and be able to pay their bills based off the shows they're making
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.320]   if-- now I'm confused.
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.120]   - No, you're right, Veronica.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.120]   It's not gonna happen overnight,
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.400]   and there's gonna be a lot of pain along the way,
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.400]   and the trade unions are not gonna be happy.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:18.160]   I got my SAG aftercard, I'm not gonna be happy.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.840]   But in the long run, the right answer for this
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.640]   is for content creators to go direct to the audience,
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.280]   and this kind of, this intermediation is what the internet
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.040]   has done already in so many other industries.
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.040]   - Sure. - And it's going to happen eventually
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.320]   in the entertainment industry, but it takes a while
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.320]   because, for instance, I'll give you an example.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.680]   You said, "How do we get Game of Thrones made?"
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.680]   - Yeah. - It doesn't have to be HBO.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.080]   How do you get any app made or any website made?
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.840]   You have venture capital. - Sure.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.800]   - There will be, there doesn't exist now,
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.920]   but eventually there will be the infrastructure
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.000]   so that a content creator, Justin Robert Young,
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.160]   who has a brilliant idea as a screenwriter,
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.040]   can go to investors and say, "I'd like to put this together."
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:02.280]   What's changed is the internet provides a distribution medium
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:06.680]   that no longer requires the big wigs with lots of capital.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.600]   You don't, and that's the change.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.440]   It's not gonna happen overnight, but it will happen.
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.840]   It'll happen in probably-- - But usually in your lifetime--
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.240]   - And Veronica's lifetime, Tom and I will probably never see it.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.600]   - I'll be doing it. - Jesus.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.640]   - Well, but you'll still need that service that says,
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.000]   "Here's how to find all that stuff."
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.520]   - Well, that's easy. - The cable covered things.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.920]   - The cable covered things. - The cable covered things.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:24.920]   - And you need that pile.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.560]   I still think you're gonna have to have something
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.760]   replace your cable system or enhance your cable system
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.120]   to bring all that stuff together.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.520]   - The problem right now is the stakeholders are silos.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.760]   They are information silos just like the internet.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.720]   We saw this happen already on the internet,
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.960]   where AOL was a silo.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.360]   You couldn't search into AOL.
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:44.000]   You couldn't send email from AOL to CompuServe.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.160]   Those silos fell, and ultimately these silos will fall.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.160]   And then it's easy. It's a search problem.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.440]   - What are you talking about now?
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.280]   - Something comes in and fills the gap.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.400]   Some of the old people die, some of the old people stay around,
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.880]   and a bunch of the new people die,
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.280]   and a bunch of the new people stay around.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.520]   - Exactly. - And that's what happened
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.520]   with the e-commerce and it happened with print.
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.560]   - So I'm dead. - We're killing how many people?
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.160]   This is like a holocaust here.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.200]   - Really serious. - In a lot of people's proposals.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.400]   - In 100 years, it's all new people anyway, Justin.
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.480]   Don't worry about it. - True.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.680]   - So don't worry about it. - Well, no, I guess that--
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.680]   - Go ahead. - Veronica.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.960]   - Veronica. Veronica Belmont.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.440]   - No, my TV, my TV was pretty close right now.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:21.440]   Like, there's a lot of stuff that I like about how it searches
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.240]   and about how it-- I still want to watch the shows
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.800]   that are on TV now. I don't want all new stuff that's out there,
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.960]   but it's, you know, if I want to watch like new girl, for example.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.720]   I enjoy that show for quite a month.
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.080]   - It's because you are Zoe Deschanel.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.400]   - No, I'm not.
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.720]   - You ever seen them in the same place in the same time?
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.240]   - She is Zoe Deschanel.
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.320]   - But, you know, then I tried to watch back episodes
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.000]   and I had the option of watching it on Amazon streaming Hulu Plus
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.720]   and Comcast on Xfinity.
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.600]   And I tried to connect it to my Comcast, which I pay for already.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.720]   And it was like, it's not working right now, sorry.
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.920]   And then I had to sign up for like the Amazon stuff,
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.200]   and that wasn't working properly.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.360]   So it's the experience that I'm really frustrated with right now.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.680]   - Completely. - Completely.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.880]   - Completely. - You're absolutely right.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.400]   And that's why Google couldn't solve it
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.400]   because as soon as Google TV came out, Hulu and CBS said,
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.280]   "You ain't gonna get to access our stuff."
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.600]   As long as these stakeholders survive,
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.080]   they're gonna be silos and they're not gonna let you search into it.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.960]   But that, I am optimistic that that's gonna go over.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.760]   - Oh, I think so too. You just need the device.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.720]   That's why I keep saying you need the device to fill the gap.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.960]   Because I'll tell you, I know I'm ahead of the--
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.400]   - It's temporary. - Of what the mainstream is doing.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.200]   - All of you. - But eventually with DVRs,
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.320]   you get to the point where you're like,
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:33.400]   "I don't want to have to remember what I've recorded
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:37.040]   and to refresh the past and to make sure the priorities are right.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.400]   I just want to go and say, "I want to watch Haven,
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:40.840]   type in Haven and watch it."
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.080]   - You still use a DVR? - You still watch Haven?
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.960]   - I love Haven. - It's the most underrated show on television.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.320]   Veronica, do you use a DVR?
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:48.760]   - Yeah, I still do in the living. - DVR.
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.360]   - I just cut the cord in the memory. - I use a DVR.
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.280]   You all use DVRs? You guys are sold-fashioned.
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:57.360]   Because really, what's the point? A DVR is just to make it on demand for you.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.680]   Everything's on demand, right?
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.880]   - Not everything. - Not everything.
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.360]   - Why not? - Not everything immediately.
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.200]   If you're just half hour behind on Saturday Night Live,
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.640]   mostly what I watch on my DVR is HBO.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.920]   - You know what I use? - I watch Fringe Live.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:11.560]   - I'm a lot more. - Torret.
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:15.280]   - You like breaking the law. - Ultimately, that's not a way to--
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.440]   - 'Cause that's the word. - That's the word.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.920]   - What's my name? - The morally ambiguous,
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.720]   Leo LaVorda that's pork by hand.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.440]   - No, but that's seriously, that is--
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.760]   And the record industry realized this,
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.560]   and eventually the content interest rate,
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:28.480]   as a whole, will realize it.
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.120]   That's the competition, piracy.
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.120]   - Well, but then all you're doing is you're teaching people to pirate.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.120]   - But Steve Jobs wouldn't let this happen.
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.760]   - Not under Steve Jobs. - Not under Steve Jobs.
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.320]   - What? - Yeah.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.640]   - Actually, I don't use BitTorrent,
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.880]   'cause I don't want copies of this stuff.
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.800]   - But at a certain point, it becomes your only option.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.480]   That point is becoming smaller and smaller over time,
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:51.080]   as they slowly add the ability to find things on--
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.720]   - That's what reinvented the music in the music.
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:55.680]   - Even HBO just said, "You know what, fine, in Scandinavia,
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.960]   where we don't get the benefit of partnership with cable companies,
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.800]   we're gonna market directly to people and see how it works."
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.440]   - HBO wants-- - They won't do that in the US right now.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.520]   - They can't, they get too. - They get too much value
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.800]   out of the partnerships that market--
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.720]   - They would love to, but Time Warner Comcast
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.520]   and the other people won't let 'em.
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.680]   - Well, no, no, no, no. - They get them free advertising.
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.840]   - They don't want to do it because their X amount of their business model
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.480]   is the fees they get paid through--
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.680]   - Well, there's the fees, but there's also the free marketing.
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.440]   - Yeah, that's what I'm saying. - Time Warner Comcast,
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:27.280]   all those guys do all of the customer acquisition for HBO
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.280]   in the United States.
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.560]   - Yeah. - So right now, it doesn't make sense
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.240]   to take on that cost themselves.
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.440]   - All right, we're gonna take a break.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.800]   Wow, this went from Steve Jobs to something very different
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.640]   and actually very interesting. - To Frame Rate.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.640]   (both laugh)
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:43.400]   - This is a brush, this is a brush with a wave from a dragon cocktail already.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.720]   - A brush with a wave from a dragon cocktail.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:49.680]   You know, if you do like this 'cause a frame rate is an awesome show
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.360]   for people who want to cut the cord in my eye.
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:52.920]   - Thanks. - And all of you have been on it
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.720]   and set me.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:57.480]   - This show brought to you-- - You walk by and pass me all the time.
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:00.000]   - Next time I'm dropped. - I think I've been on Frame Rate.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.520]   - You've not been on Frame Rate?
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.800]   - I don't think so. - VB, why don't you and I
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.400]   start a show to compete with Frame.
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.440]   Oh wait, my Frame Rate is my Sh-- - Rain-freaked.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.280]   - Rain-freaked.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.720]   We're gonna call it Rain-freaked.
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.200]   (both laugh)
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.200]   Ha!
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:17.120]   And I'm Mr. Mom Tarrant, a host of Rain-freaked.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:18.480]   Just call me Mom.
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.600]   - Mom. (laughs)
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:24.280]   - Oh, Mom Tarrant's the one stealing Mom Tarrant.
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:27.560]   Okay, now we've gone off. (laughs)
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.280]   And Spryan brush. - Oh, and I was on.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.760]   I was on Chat Room, says I was on for the move feature after the--
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:32.960]   - They're all on the draft. - You're right.
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.960]   Chat Room knows everything. - They do.
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.120]   - They do. - I don't know anything.
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.200]   I just let the Chat Room know it.
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.200]   - Yeah.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.840]   This show brought to you by our friends at Citrix,
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.720]   who do the great go-to meeting.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:48.720]   If you are not having regular meetings at your company,
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:52.200]   I bet you communications are spinning out of control.
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.760]   We did that. We tried, 'cause I hate meetings.
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.200]   You know, I hate meetings.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.480]   Always hated meetings.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.920]   And so we didn't have meetings for the first five years at Twit,
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.120]   and everything fell apart. (laughs)
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.240]   - It was awesome. It was awesome,
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.880]   'cause we didn't have to go to meetings.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.760]   Nobody knew what the hell was going on.
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.080]   So now we have regular meetings.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.440]   The problem is in most businesses,
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.280]   people are spread out.
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.440]   The company's all over the place.
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.280]   Clients and colleagues are traveling.
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:16.000]   So this is why go-to meeting is such a great solution.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.840]   In fact, we do meet often.
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.120]   Almost every day we use go-to meeting to meet with clients
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.400]   or colleagues.
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:24.800]   We use go-to meeting for screen sharing,
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.160]   but now with the HD faces,
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.360]   it's also a great way to actually get to know somebody
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:29.760]   to build rapport.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.280]   Studies have shown that the way to trust somebody,
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.080]   you can't do it with your eyes closed,
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.840]   is you're looking at nonverbal cues.
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:37.920]   You're looking at their posture,
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:38.760]   looking at what they're doing,
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:39.880]   their arms folded, they're leaning in,
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.480]   they're leaning back, they're squinting,
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.080]   they're scowling, they're smiling.
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.120]   All of that's real important.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:48.560]   Go-to meeting has added HD video for that very reason.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.920]   And now it really is like meeting in person.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:53.040]   Easy to use and very affordable.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.760]   If you spent tens of thousands,
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.480]   I know companies spent hundreds of thousands
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.600]   on that special teleconferencing room,
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.080]   you don't need it anymore.
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:02.240]   Every computer's got a camera on it.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.640]   All you have is a click and you're in a meeting
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:05.600]   and you're seeing each other.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.680]   In fact, you can even use the iPad to join a meeting
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.840]   and use the camera on it and the microphone
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:12.920]   and the earbuds is really fantastic.
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:16.200]   A $49 a month for as many meetings as you want,
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.200]   as long as you want.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.000]   I want you to try it free right now.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.120]   If you have a go-to meeting.com,

[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.440]   You know, we watch all the videos
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.280]   and they have lots of information about go-to meeting
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.080]   and their sister products go to webinar and go to training.
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.640]   They all use that great Citrix remote access backbone.
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.000]   Click the try it free button.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.400]   Promo code is twit.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:38.960]   I bet Walter White, if he had only had go-to meeting,
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.600]   he and Gus might have gotten along better.
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:44.680]   There was, it was 'cause he had to go to El Poiro Armanos
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.280]   and wait in line and eat that crappy chicken
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.080]   and he was in a bad mood by the time.
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.520]   See, see what I'm saying?
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.680]   Go-to meeting would have solved a lot of problems
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:53.520]   on breaking bad.
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:54.520]   Go-to meeting, I don't think they would.
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:55.360]   Hank, it could have tapped.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.920]   No, it's secure, you're right.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.960]   Yeah, it's secure, Hank couldn't have gotten in it.
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.760]   Hey, by the way, you want to win an iPad?
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:03.600]   Sure.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:04.440]   Sure.
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.280]   I do.
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.120]   You're not allowed.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:06.960]   Whoa!
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.280]   No, sorry.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.520]   No, it's creating against possible Indians.
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.960]   No, Veronica, yeah, you could win an iPad
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.440]   'cause you're not an employee.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.280]   I mean, I don't pay you money, do I?
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.120]   No.
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.240]   I give you money, right?
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:19.920]   I get, it's a pittance, I understand.
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:21.200]   I get paid through brushwood.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.400]   But that pittance, really Brian pays you,
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:24.240]   then you're eligible.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.320]   Yeah!
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.280]   Whoo!
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:27.280]   Brian's not eligible.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.120]   Don't you take my iPad out.
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:28.960]   Don't you take my iPad out.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:29.880]   Exactly.
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.760]   So here's the deal.
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.160]   What we want you to do is tweet
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:34.600]   and we're gonna use a hashtag,
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:35.840]   twit free iPad.
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.200]   Now I talked with our people,
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.280]   we're not gonna use that ever again
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:41.120]   'cause I realized free iPad is a bad hashtag, right?
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:41.960]   Mm-hmm.
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:42.880]   Yeah.
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:45.000]   I suddenly realized that after we did this contest
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.560]   four times, wait a minute, it's worked before.
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:48.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.200]   So what we're gonna do is a hashtag,
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:52.040]   twit free iPad.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.880]   Tell us in a tweet, so you know,
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:55.400]   it's not, you don't have to write an essay,
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:56.720]   where you would like to meet
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:58.680]   and who you would like to meet using GoToMeeting.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:34:59.720]   And maybe if you wanna throw in,
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:02.720]   why share a story, say why you wanna win this iPad
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:06.000]   for GoToMeeting and we were gonna pick somebody at random
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.480]   to give them a free iPad, US residents only, I'm sorry.
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:13.920]   And that's just the lawyer's got, it's horrible.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:15.680]   But you have to do that 'cause it tariffs
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:16.840]   and customs and stuff.
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:17.880]   That's a very fine answer form.
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:21.240]   Campaign, fine answer form, Larry Lessig, it's complicated.
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:22.600]   For rules and regulations,
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.840]   I blame the US Commerce Department, it's your fault.
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:25.680]   Exactly.
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:29.440]   For rules and regulations inside.twit.tv.
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.240]   And next week, maybe we'll have a,
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.840]   maybe you'll be our iPad winner.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.600]   There we go, I wanna type it in, I wanna meet any Roosevelt
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:36.760]   after I die.
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:37.880]   Perfect.
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.680]   Twit, and don't forget the hashtag, twit free iPad.
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.320]   Hashtag, twit free iPad.
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.520]   I'll give you the iPad after you die.
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:44.920]   (both laughing)
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:46.760]   Just that simple, but we're gonna do this time
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.040]   'cause we're gonna have the iPad shipped here
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:48.880]   and we'll sign it.
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.720]   In fact, if you guys wanna autograph it, whoever,
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:52.720]   just tell us who you wanna autograph in your iPad
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.040]   and we'll autograph it.
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:55.160]   We'll contact you when you win
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:57.680]   and we'll get it all out there and all together.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.640]   Hey, let's find out.
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:03.000]   You know, Tom Merritt regularly joins us.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.320]   Mm-hmm.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.640]   I don't know how this is gonna work.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:06.880]   Why did you throw,
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.880]   can you ever throw into yourself?
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:09.880]   I don't know.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.880]   Oh, is it time to see what stories
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.080]   are coming into the week ahead?
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:13.920]   Let's ask Tom.
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.880]   Okay, Tom, pretend I'm Leo
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:18.360]   and let us know what stories are coming in the week ahead.
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.200]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.000]   Here's a look at some of the things
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.560]   that we've been an eye on in the week ahead on Tech News today.
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.640]   Wednesday, October 10th, CTIA Enterprise,
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:27.680]   the fall telephone industry conference
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.000]   happens in San Diego.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.880]   Also, the ITU is holding patent licensing talks
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.040]   in Geneva that day
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.800]   and Google announces their earnings.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.920]   Thursday, October 11th,
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:38.600]   there's an event for Samsung in Germany.
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.520]   We think it's probably some kind of new--
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.000]   So, of course, Intel's CIS.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.560]   Maybe a Galaxy S3 Mini.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:45.840]   Also, that's the day Groupon announced their earnings.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:49.480]   And Friday, October 12th, the PS2 with the 12 gigabyte flash drive,
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.360]   a first for PS3 hardware,
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:54.280]   goes on sale in Europe for 230 euros.
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:56.320]   That's a look at what we'll be keeping an eye on
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.160]   in the week ahead.
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:58.280]   Back to you, Leo.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.760]   Thanks, Tom.
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.160]   That was Mom Tarrant.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.640]   Yeah, no, that's me.
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.480]   I'm Mom.
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.920]   Oh, you're Mom Tarrant from FrameOn.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:06.720]   Do you ever find--
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.880]   This might be one of those weeks
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.400]   where there's just not a lot going on.
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.240]   And it's just kind of a slow weekend.
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:13.520]   This is like a half speed week.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.720]   There's a couple of things going on.
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:15.720]   Dredging up German--
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:16.560]   That's crazy.
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.160]   Unintelligible German events.
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.080]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.800]   There are seriously rumor sites out there
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.760]   saying it's going to be a Galaxy Mini.
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:23.120]   Really?
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:24.120]   No, that's a joke.
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:24.600]   That's crazy.
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:25.600]   I don't think it's going to happen.
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:26.600]   Like a smaller--
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:27.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.160]   Like a Samsung Galaxy S.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.680]   That would be just typical of Samsung.
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.320]   The times it's crazy.
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.080]   What's Apple doing?
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:32.880]   Oh, let's do that.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.760]   Yeah.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:34.840]   Wouldn't that be funny?
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:35.840]   By the way, Samsung--
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.360]   It seems to be a troubling habit for them.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.360]   Considering the billion dollar penalty.
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:42.120]   Well, no, because now they're suing Apple.
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.640]   Remember they said, as soon as Apple does an LTE
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:46.200]   phone, we're going to court.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:49.920]   Apple, iPhone 5, infringes patents.
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.720]   Samsung says in suit.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:57.680]   I don't know if they'll get a billion dollars back.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:58.920]   Maybe a couple hundred pounds.
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.280]   It's a cycle of violence.
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:01.880]   It is, isn't it?
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:03.680]   They just continue-- and I think it's--
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:06.640]   is it Judge Coe again, who has to see this one?
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:07.680]   Poor Judge Coe.
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:10.880]   It would be awesome if it was just to see
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.720]   that poor judge driven insane slowly.
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.680]   She must just be so tired.
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:16.600]   I think so.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:19.040]   It says US District Judge Lucy Coe,
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.000]   who was presiding over the litigation in California,
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.080]   yesterday rescinded a ban on US sales at the Galaxy tab,
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:25.880]   10.1 that she imposed in June.
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:26.400]   Oh, that's a big story.
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.560]   Because there were no brands.
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:28.760]   Yeah, that's from the earlier.
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:30.760]   Because the jury found that there was no infringement.
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:33.120]   So now she has to go back and say, oh, you know,
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:34.680]   when we said you couldn't sell in the US
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:36.120]   because it's infringed, well, guess what?
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:37.280]   No, you can.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.760]   Which I'd be a little miffed about.
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.360]   Apple is not commenting, big surprise.
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:44.680]   You know, though, I think this is all going to die down
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.480]   in like two years.
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.400]   I feel sooner than that.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.440]   I think that $1 million actually is a damper on it.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.520]   And notice Motorola yanked it's one of its accounts
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.960]   against Apple.
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.080]   I think that these guys are now actually starting to talk.
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:58.120]   Well, you remember when it was--
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.920]   Is it because it would spur settling?
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:03.080]   It's whenever we get something new and popular,
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.600]   everybody starts to go to try to seize
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:06.280]   the middle ground of patents, right?
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.560]   We saw it with computers.
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:10.160]   We saw it most recently before this with like one click,
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:15.160]   with web people trying to patent HTML commands and links.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.640]   And all of that has died out now.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:17.200]   It has.
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.440]   And I think this is because smartphones and tablets
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:22.480]   just got super popular, everybody's in a land rush
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.280]   to be like, this is where our patent boundary is
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.800]   because we want the biggest one possible.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:27.560]   So I agree.
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:29.640]   If it's a hill, where are we on the hill?
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:30.760]   I think we're at the top of the hill.
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:31.360]   OK.
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.640]   So there's only-- we're just going to go tumbling down.
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.480]   We're pushing that rock right up the hill
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:38.840]   and get delivery now endlessly.
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:39.840]   Wow, that was very--
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:40.840]   Until the end of time.
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:41.840]   Obstrus.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.840]   What would Sisyphus jobs do?
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:46.840]   Sisyphus jobs.
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:47.840]   What would Sisyphus do?
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.840]   You have a Sisyphus.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.840]   You have Sisyphus.
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:52.840]   Was it his liver?
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:53.840]   Was it his pancreas?
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:54.840]   I can't remember.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:58.840]   Thought it was liver, but that could be a bad translation.
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:39:59.840]   Can't remember.
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:00.840]   Liver.
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:01.840]   Pancreas sounds more Greek.
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.840]   It does.
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:04.840]   Spell it with a K.
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:07.840]   Probably order it in flaming cheese.
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:08.840]   Mm.
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:09.840]   Roasted pancreas.
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:16.360]   I was about to apologize for ruining the patent story, but then I don't think that's possible.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.840]   You can't ruin the patent story.
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:18.840]   No.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:19.840]   Let's-- I know.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:20.840]   I got an invitation.
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:22.840]   I rarely get invitations to tech events anymore.
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.840]   And I actually got an invitation to--
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.840]   That would have never happened to Steve Jobs' life.
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:27.840]   Exactly right.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:28.840]   I've not gotten that invitation.
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:31.840]   It was an invitation to Microsoft's launch of Windows 8.
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:32.840]   That's great.
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:33.840]   What are we going to do?
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.840]   Because that's-- so they're having an event in New York City which I'm not going to go
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:37.840]   to.
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:40.840]   And that's on 25th, before the-- because the launch happens at midnight.
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:41.840]   Right.
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:42.840]   And the pop-up stores go pop-- pop.
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:46.840]   I think of like the pills very do-boy popping fresh.
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.840]   Let's open the store.
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:49.840]   Whoa.
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:50.840]   No, first of all.
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:51.840]   Whoa.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.840]   You want a surface?
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.840]   The pop-up store is open the next day, the 26th.
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:58.840]   32 of them around everywhere.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:40:59.840]   Mm-hmm.
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:00.840]   You're going to follow.
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:02.840]   One of them is going to be on surface stuff.
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:04.840]   That's what I thought.
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:10.440]   I thought I saw a story that said that there was a store in the Bay Area that wasn't going
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.440]   to open that day.
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.440]   Five days later.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.440]   Five days later.
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:18.840]   I guess they anticipate massive lines or something.
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:22.840]   What the-- you're trying-- what the-- I'll get Windows later.
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:26.840]   You know, getting that Mac pop-up store from the cosmetics maker out just going to take
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:27.840]   longer than they call it.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:28.840]   No, you know it's the Halloween stores.
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:29.840]   Oh, maybe--
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:30.840]   It's the Hollis Spirit Halloween stores.
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:31.840]   They're talking about the space.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:32.840]   That's where it is.
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:36.920]   They pick up all the empty business space and apparently in court of Madeira there's nothing
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.720]   free until November 1st.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.840]   Yeah, because I just walked past it the other day.
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:43.840]   It's like right at the other end of the shopping center from the Apple store.
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:44.840]   Uh-huh.
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:45.840]   And it's got a big banner up.
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:46.840]   You're almost--
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:47.840]   It's almost opening November 1st.
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:48.840]   Well, how about so?
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:52.840]   It's going to be-- it's just, you know, that five-day lull between--
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:53.840]   Oh.
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.840]   Nobody, everybody else is going to be able to-- when everyone-- of course, everyone's going
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:56.840]   to be rushing out and buying their services.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:57.840]   That's the problem.
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:01.840]   Is there another one coming up in the area or is that the only one where--
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.840]   Well, there's one downtown in San Francisco.
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:04.840]   There's just a center.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:05.840]   There's going to be one as well.
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:06.840]   There's San Jose.
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:14.840]   There's 32, but the funny thing is nearly every one of them is in a mall with an Apple store.
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:15.840]   Smart.
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:16.840]   Don't you think?
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:18.840]   It's kind of acknowledging defeat.
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:22.840]   No, I mean, that's just where people who buy these kind of products.
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:23.840]   That's where people go.
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:24.840]   To buy things.
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:26.840]   So let's just let Apple do the research.
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:28.840]   Do you want to deal with like four cows?
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.840]   Well, no, but there's not Apple stores at every mall in America.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.840]   You could have a different mall that might be as good.
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:37.840]   But they put Apple stores very specifically in mall.
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:38.840]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:39.840]   It's Microsoft saying--
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.840]   It's a discretionary income.
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:43.840]   No, no, that's exactly what I'm saying.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:45.840]   It's Microsoft saying, "Oh, it's too much work.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:46.840]   Where did Apple put it?"
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:47.840]   Okay, let's put it there.
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:48.840]   I think that's fine.
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:51.840]   I'm describing a lot of motivation to that decision.
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.840]   It's just too much work to figure out where people go to shop.
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.840]   Where did Apple put it in stores?
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:56.840]   Let's go there.
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.840]   That's what it seems like to me.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:42:59.840]   It's like defeat.
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:00.840]   That seems efficient.
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:01.840]   That seems smart.
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.840]   Yeah, like all digital market research on where people are shopping.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:05.840]   Why don't we just do there?
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:08.840]   I guess it's kind of the same thing, but it's for a different reason.
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.840]   And the right kind of consumers.
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:15.840]   The consumers that wouldn't blink at spending several hundred dollars on a piece of consumer
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:20.840]   equipment, they aren't going to put it at the swap shop in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
[00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:25.840]   They're going to put it at the high end mall where rich people go and shop.
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:27.840]   I agree.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:28.840]   Exactly.
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:31.840]   Not as if this swap shop isn't where the bargains are.
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:33.840]   It's like you got a Tim Hortons.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.840]   And you're trying to figure out where's a good place to put a coffee shop?
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.840]   Wherever Starbucks is, we'll have one across the street.
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:40.840]   But Starbucks did that and it worked for one of them.
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:41.840]   Yeah, that's exactly.
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:44.840]   Yeah, in Boston, it was on every corner that there was a Dunkin' Donuts, a Starbucks
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:45.840]   jumping in.
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:46.840]   Really?
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:48.840]   When they first started showing up in that area.
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:49.840]   That's interesting.
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:50.840]   And so it just made sense.
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.840]   People go to get coffee in that neighborhood and if they're like, "Oh, there's a different
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:53.840]   store there.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:54.840]   I'll check that one out too.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:55.840]   That's a good place to put it.
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:56.840]   That's a good place to put it.
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:57.840]   That's a good place to put it.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:58.840]   That's a good place to put it.
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:43:59.840]   That's a good place to put it.
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:00.840]   That's a good place to put it.
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:01.840]   That's a good place to put it.
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:02.840]   That's a good place to put it.
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:03.840]   That's a good place to put it.
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:04.840]   That's a good place to put it.
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:05.840]   That's a good place to put it.
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:06.840]   That's a good place to put it.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:07.840]   That's a good place to put it.
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:08.840]   That's a good place to put it.

[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:35.840]   That was my friend J.D.
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:37.840]   He took that picture from all that.
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:38.840]   Here you are.
[00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:39.840]   Oh, there's Ome.
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:40.840]   Ome Malek.
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:42.840]   That's a nice picture.
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:43.840]   That's good.
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:45.840]   It looks like you're pregnant though.
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:46.840]   No, I don't know why I'm holding.
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:49.840]   I didn't know what to do with my arm in that picture.
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:50.840]   You had a case of awkward arms.
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:51.840]   I'm not pregnant.
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:52.840]   There's no babies.
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:53.840]   Awkward arms.
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:58.840]   I remember actually taking that picture and being like, "I don't know where to put my arm because
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:52:59.840]   I'm on the end."
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:00.840]   Right.
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:03.840]   You're like Ricky Bobby in Talladega Nights.
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:05.840]   You just don't know where to put your hands.
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:06.840]   Just this.
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:08.840]   Thumbs up.
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:11.840]   Whenever you have a free arm, go like this.
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:13.840]   People think you're very jaunty.
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:14.840]   Yeah.
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:15.840]   Yeah, like that.
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:16.840]   No new tax.
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:21.840]   You know, that's a magic, a maggotism.
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:22.840]   Is that right?
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:28.840]   This is just a useful tip for those of you who want to be on television.
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:32.840]   There's a company called Frank Maggot that trains pretty much every local newscaster.
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:34.840]   But they also do politicians.
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:37.840]   And one of the things that they tell them is it's aggressive to point.
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:41.840]   Don't ever do that because it looks like you're nagging or you're scolding.
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:42.840]   So do this.
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:43.840]   This is a friendly gesture.
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:48.840]   And you'll notice every freaking politician going back to Bill Clinton.
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:49.840]   No.
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:51.840]   I did not have sex with that woman.
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:52.840]   Does that?
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:54.840]   Not this.
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:55.840]   That.
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:57.840]   Like you give a whip.
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:59.840]   Apparently it's an intel.
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:02.840]   Not regulate derivatives.
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:03.840]   He did though.
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:05.840]   Was that Glass-Steagall?
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:08.840]   No, he left derivatives out of it.
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:09.840]   Okay.
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:12.840]   Intel software Snag said to hamper, Windows Apple response.
[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:14.840]   That's a strange headline.
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:15.840]   Who's that from?
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:16.840]   Bloomberg.
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:21.840]   So it just seems like like I don't think Apple's actually involved in this, but they threw it.
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:23.840]   The word Apple in there because they'd figured to get better clips.
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:24.840]   I was gonna say, yeah.
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:25.840]   SEO.
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:26.840]   Yeah.
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:28.840]   That's just, that's all.
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:30.840]   It's all Google Windows Apple.
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:31.840]   It's really wrong.
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:32.840]   Three downloads sexy porn.
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:33.840]   #twitfreight.
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:40.240]   But the story is not wrong, which is that Paul Adelini, the CEO of Intel apparently, told
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:43.840]   Taiwanese employees that Windows 8 sucks.
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:45.840]   But it's okay.
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:48.840]   That was, I mean, that's really what he said.
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:49.840]   Yeah.
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:50.840]   It's not ready to release.
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:51.840]   It kind of sucks, but it's okay.
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:55.840]   I'll never forget interviewing Andy Grove when he was the CEO at Apple.
[00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:56.840]   And we hadn't rolled the cameras yet.
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:59.840]   And he basically said the same at Intel.
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:01.840]   He basically, I was, that was for the SEO.
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:02.840]   He threw that at.
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:03.840]   He basically said the same thing.
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:05.840]   Microsoft software sucks.
[00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:09.840]   So it's kind of, I think it's a continuing theme at Intel.
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:16.840]   And now it turns out that one of the reasons that these tablets perhaps have been held up
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:23.840]   is because Microsoft is waiting for drivers from Intel, I think particularly on the power
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:24.840]   management drivers from Intel.
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:25.840]   Yeah.
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:29.880]   Adelini was speaking in Taiwan and the quote that they leave out in this Bloomberg story,
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:31.480]   but I've seen it in a couple places.
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:35.840]   He says, PC channels, or not PC, I'm going to get the wrong quote, but he says, yeah,
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:36.840]   this is not ready yet.
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:40.120]   But he says, it's the right thing to do to go ahead and ship it.
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:44.200]   We need to have this competitor in the marketplace and they can update the drivers later.
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:45.200]   Right.
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:46.200]   And it'll all be fine.
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:49.960]   Well, and, but how long has it been since Windows?
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:50.960]   What's the last one?
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:51.960]   Seven came out.
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:52.960]   Three years?
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:53.960]   Four years?
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:57.680]   The PC industry holds its breadth when there's a new version of Windows coming.
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:01.600]   Nobody buys a PC because PC users pretty much don't upgrade their OS.
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:02.640]   They just buy a new computer.
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:03.640]   Yeah.
[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:04.640]   So I remember this happening with Vista.
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:06.200]   I remember Vista was very delayed.
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.400]   Remember five years delayed?
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:08.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:09.400]   And then the whole industry got stagnant.
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:10.960]   They did the dual rollout with Vista.
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:11.960]   Right.
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:13.160]   Where they only put out the business version at first.
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:15.120]   And the industry just was stagnant.
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:19.200]   And so Intel's not selling as many chips as they'd like.
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:20.520]   Manufacturers aren't selling computers.
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:21.680]   The whole thing holds its breadth.
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:25.040]   So that's probably what he's saying is we're all holding our breath.
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:28.920]   Could you please release the damn window seven was 2009 October 22nd.
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:29.920]   So it's not that long.
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:31.160]   I mean, three years is about right.
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:32.160]   Isn't it?
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:33.160]   It's about right.
[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:35.200]   But then every other Windows release seems to run into this problem.
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:36.200]   Right.
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:39.360]   You know, me, XP, Vista seven, right.
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:45.160]   And now eight, although eight to me looks much better than Vista did at this point.
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:48.400]   But I hear a lot of rumble nightmare.
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:49.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:51.000]   And me was the issue with a.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   I don't.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.200]   I mean, there are people are reporting bugs.
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:54.200]   I haven't seen them.
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:58.200]   But the issue with eight really is going to end up being that it's just so very different
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:01.440]   in the user interface and that people it's going to make take people back.
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:04.720]   I just don't understand why they don't allow you to customize that to boot right to the
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:05.720]   desktop.
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:08.360]   That because Microsoft is all in.
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:11.960]   Microsoft says we don't want to do that because then people won't use the new Metro
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:14.920]   tile interface and we want everybody to use it.
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:20.520]   And if you look at the ads for the Windows 8 phone, Windows RT tablet, Windows 8 desktop,
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:23.840]   it's the same start screen on all three of them.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:26.840]   And Microsoft really thinks I think this is important to their business.
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:28.000]   We've got to go touch.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.920]   We've got to get people used to the idea and we want people to buy into our ecosystem
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:33.680]   of phone, tablet and desktop.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:36.920]   But consumers though will not change it.
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:39.120]   It's only the power users in the enterprise that will.
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:40.280]   And I guess they want that's what they want.
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:44.560]   They want the enterprise to not be able to change it either so that every worker in America
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:45.560]   and around the world.
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:46.560]   I want that tile.
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:47.560]   Well, that's just silly.
[00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:49.200]   I want that tile thing.
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:50.200]   What is that?
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:51.200]   Finally.
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:52.200]   Tiles.
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:58.520]   Meanwhile, we did find out that the Windows phone 8 will be coming out October 26th as
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:57:59.520]   well.
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:01.880]   And this is weird.
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:03.720]   Developers will get an SDK that day.
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:06.000]   What is up with that?
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   It's like...
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   29th for the phone.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   29th, I'm sorry.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.800]   It actually comes down a few days later.
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:15.600]   Like typically you want to give developers access to the SDK so they can develop applications
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:16.800]   for your platform.
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:21.760]   And yet when Microsoft isn't releasing the SDK this time around or they are to a very,
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:23.920]   very small number of people is it?
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:24.920]   Or maybe those last.
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:26.560]   The key developers have got it.
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:30.600]   In fact, key independent developers are also starting to get it.
[00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:31.880]   Well, why would they even do that?
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:35.640]   I mean, I understand the idea of wanting to build excitement around the release but at
[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:39.440]   the same time and not having feature releases out there in the wild.
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:42.400]   But I mean, that's not doing them any good in the end.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:47.160]   I mean, the whole point is to try to catch up with other platforms that have a really
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:50.000]   robust ecosystem already existing.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.320]   So it doesn't make sense to me.
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:56.320]   And so much of the success of both Android and iOS has been very small developers.
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:59:01.520]   One dude in his, you know, in his office that decides to like, "Oh, I can solve this
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:04.520]   problem in a interesting, elegant way."
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:06.440]   And it catches on in a big time way.
[00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:10.680]   So picking the winners and losers on this for Microsoft, I don't really understand.
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:14.160]   It concerns me a little bit because I think now Windows Phone 8 will run Windows Phone
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:19.240]   7 software but whatever the secret sauce is in 8 won't be supported by that.
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:20.440]   But it will at least be apps.
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:21.440]   It'll be 100,000 apps.
[00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:26.200]   They may say we don't want developers spending a lot of time on Windows Phone 8 and abandoning
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:31.040]   Windows 7 and 7.5 until we absolutely have to have them do it.
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:33.000]   That kind of makes sense.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.600]   The story that Microsoft's giving out is there, as you said, there are secret features we
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:37.800]   don't want them to come out.
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:41.520]   But Apple all the time does this and people honor the NDA.
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:44.960]   Try and get a developer to tell you about secret features in the, oh, I guess we can.
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:45.960]   I guess that takes a while.
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:46.960]   Well, yeah.
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:49.960]   I mean, now, I mean, with iOS 6, you know, we knew a lot.
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:53.600]   Yeah, through the people that were developing for it and, you know, because it's also not
[00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:54.600]   hard.
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:55.600]   I mean, that's the trade.
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:56.600]   You spend 99 bucks.
[00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:57.600]   Exactly.
[00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:58.600]   Yeah.
[00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:01.160]   So you have a wider group of people that could make really awesome apps that could drive
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:05.840]   sales for your phone and could really be a feature that is constantly evolving for your
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:07.480]   platform at the price of--
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:10.880]   Well, like, oh, the secret, the big secret will be out.
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:15.160]   Especially because it's generally conceded Microsoft is behind with Windows Phone.
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.160]   Yeah.
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:18.600]   And they don't have time to waste.
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:20.120]   They need those apps out here.
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:24.800]   I mean, even super secretive companies like Apple still gives their developers access to
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:28.680]   the SDK, you know, under, under, on disclosure agreements.
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:29.920]   So it's confusing.
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:33.320]   I don't understand what would be the impetus for that.
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:34.320]   Right.
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:35.320]   Well, we'll find out.
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:36.320]   Maybe there's some magic.
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.320]   Nobody knows.
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:38.840]   It gets us talking about it.
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:39.840]   It's provocative.
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:40.840]   It is.
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:43.200]   Hey, let's talk a little bit about Audible speaking of provocative.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:46.240]   We were talking before the show about cloud outlets, which comes out this week.
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:47.480]   I'm excited about this movie.
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:50.080]   And Sword and Laser, that's your book for October, right?
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:53.280]   That is our current book pick because the movie is October 26.
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:55.600]   So you got time to read the book and then go see the movie.
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:59.240]   I actually-- because I have the platinum plan.
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:00.760]   So I get two books a month.
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:01.760]   And I didn't have any credits.
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:06.280]   And I bought cloud apps because I really wanted to read it or listen to it before the
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:07.280]   movie came out.
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:08.280]   Do you want to go into it already?
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.400]   No, I'm pretty-- just in the second story.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:15.680]   So it's weird because the stories abruptly stop and the next one starts.
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:19.280]   So I'm excited though because I love the language.
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:20.720]   It's a really interesting book.
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.560]   And I'm starting to sense something's going on here.
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:25.680]   Maybe because I saw the trailers for the movie that I understand.
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:28.960]   The trailers look entirely different after you get through the book.
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:30.960]   Because you know who all these people are.
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:31.960]   They're kind of spoilery.
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:32.960]   The trailers.
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.960]   If you've read the book, the trailer is spoilery.
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:35.960]   If you have it.
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:38.880]   If you're in the process of reading the book, the trailer is kind of spoilery.
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:39.880]   I feel like that.
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:40.880]   I did not expect that.
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:44.280]   I feel like I kind of know a little bit about the landscape that I'm entering.
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:47.120]   In any event, I always liked-- and I bet you guys agree.
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.200]   I always like-- I don't know.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:50.440]   I always like to read the book before I see the movie.
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.440]   You're the same.
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.440]   I like to go the other way.
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:53.440]   You go the other way.
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:54.440]   Because you're--
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:55.440]   Your way is wrong.
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:56.440]   Because you're expanding.
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:58.440]   You have the shorter version.
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:01:59.440]   No, but you're spoiled.
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:00.440]   You have the shorter version.
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:02.560]   And then you see the larger thing.
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:04.880]   So you were looking at an expanding story as opposed to a different--
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:07.840]   You already know that Ari's Targaryen is Luke Skywalker's father.
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:08.840]   It spoils.
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:10.840]   It spoils the book.
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:13.080]   If I see them, then I can't see anybody else.
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:15.600]   If I read it, then I get a picture of them myself.
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:16.600]   That's a good one.
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:17.600]   And the character seems fuller to me.
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.600]   OK.
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:19.600]   I mean, we actually--
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:20.600]   You know what?
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:21.600]   You get to do it any way you want for crying out loud.
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:22.600]   There's no rule.
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.600]   And a lot of times you don't know.
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:26.640]   I mean, because you don't-- like, you're not-- if you're super interested in a story
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:30.960]   and you have the peace of mind to go read it and because this movie's coming out, then
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:31.960]   yeah.
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:32.960]   I mean, that's something cool that you want to get.
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:35.760]   I'm frustrated for the movie for Republic Lost by Lawrence Lesson.
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.440]   I've never read the book.
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:38.440]   So this is-- OK.
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:39.880]   So we're going to give you two recommendations.
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:40.880]   So here's the deal.
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:44.440]   The audible plan that you're going to-- that we're going to sign you up for.
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:45.600]   You get a month free, right?
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:47.200]   And we're going to sign you up for the platinum plan.
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.200]   That's two books a month.
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:49.200]   Yeah, I like that.
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.640]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:54.840]   And always the challenge is, Audible has over 100,000 titles.
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:55.840]   It's best audiobooks.
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:56.840]   It's best readers.
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:00.160]   It really performances that bring the book to life.
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.880]   The challenge is always, well, OK, but which book?
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.200]   Because I get two.
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:07.320]   So we're going to give you two that are very different.
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:09.840]   And we've got lots of recommendations through history.
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:10.840]   Why don't you start with yours?
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:11.840]   Because you just read Larry Lesson.
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:12.840]   Yeah, I just finished this.
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.280]   I blazed through it because I loved it.
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:21.400]   Republic Lost was put out in 2011 and it's basically identifying the problem with the
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:22.720]   government in the United States.
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:27.240]   And he argues that it's not money and it's not evil people.
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:32.160]   It's money in the wrong place causing what he calls a gift economy influence.
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:36.720]   So there's not a lot of examples of actual grafts, somebody going and paying for a bill
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:37.720]   to be passed.
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:41.160]   But you feel gratitude to your contributors.
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:44.120]   And you actually feel like you need to take care of them in advance.
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.120]   It's a soft obligation.
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:47.880]   Because they spend 30 to 70% of their time fundraising.
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:49.480]   They don't actually have time to read bills.
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:50.480]   They don't have time to discuss.
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:54.240]   They don't have time to actually fix all these things like education and government being
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.240]   too big and to tackle more.
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.320]   Because you've got to raise money.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:58.560]   Because they've got to spend all this time raising money.
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:01.000]   And so the voices of contributors are out of whack.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.960]   And he says we need to restore confidence in the government by restoring confidence
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:06.720]   that the money isn't affecting it.
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:09.400]   Even if you can't prove that money is affecting it, we all think it is.
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.240]   And that's just as bad.
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:17.480]   It's interesting because Larry remember was very big on the commons and resolving this
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:18.640]   whole copyright issue.
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:23.800]   He created Creative Commons to solve this problem.
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:26.680]   And he realized because he knew that we had to have change.
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:28.520]   And he was always said don't steal music.
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:29.520]   Let's change the rules.
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:30.520]   Let's change the law.
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:31.960]   And he realized he couldn't.
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:36.320]   He was stymied and he's actually changed his focus because campaign finance reform has
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:38.760]   to predate anything.
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:42.960]   Whether it's SOPA or music or anything else, you've got to fix this broken system at least
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:43.960]   in the US.
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:46.120]   I bet you it's true around the world but at least in the US.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:50.680]   And I think it's an important read because I think he nails what the problem is.
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:52.680]   Now you can debate what the solution is.
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:53.800]   He actually gives four solutions.
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:56.720]   He says which one he proposes we should try.
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.260]   He says it's not the only one though.
[01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:00.560]   We still need to find that solution.
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:06.840]   But I think he absolutely pulled the scales off my eyes in identifying how money is affecting
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:07.840]   Congress.
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:08.840]   Everybody knows it is.
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:09.840]   And this is fundamentally nonpartisan.
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:10.840]   That's what's great about it.
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:11.840]   It affects both parties.
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:14.280]   It affects everybody.
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:16.440]   We got to solve this first.
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:19.320]   This is why nothing gets done whether Republicans or Democrats are in control.
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:24.960]   It doesn't matter because it's all stymied if it affects a contributor in a negative way.
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:29.600]   Republic comma lost how money corrupts Congress and a plan to stop it.
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:32.400]   Larry Lessig, brilliant lawyer.
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.400]   He wasn't Stanford.
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:34.800]   I can't see he went back to Harvard now.
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.240]   He went back to Harvard.
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.960]   And a really great guy.
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:41.320]   He's been on Twitch before and just his brilliant thinker.
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.840]   One of the most important thinkers of all.
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:44.840]   So that's one.
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:47.400]   But you know, I like to mix nonfiction fiction, nonfiction fiction.
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:51.440]   Yeah, if you get depressed reading about how our government is broken, you need to state.
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:56.880]   Yeah, I just, well, I just finished a long history of World War II, very depressing.
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:58.960]   You know, we went in the end though.
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:05:59.960]   Oh, sorry.
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:00.960]   Spoiler.
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:01.960]   Spoiler.
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:03.640]   Is that the one about Poland?
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:05.240]   Or is it a different one?
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:10.200]   It's called the storm of war and it's materials that were released when the Soviet Union fell,
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.480]   stuff we did not know.
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:12.480]   Oh.
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:13.880]   And it's really very interesting.
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:18.360]   The last chapter is why Hitler lost and it was close.
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:21.240]   Could have gone very differently, but ultimately was in the last sentences.
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:23.160]   Hitler lost because he was a Nazi.
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:26.040]   The Nazi ideology is what kept them from winning the war.
[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:29.400]   They had the manpower, the material, the best soldiers in the world.
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:32.280]   And they lost because of ideology and no other reason.
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.280]   Interesting.
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.280]   Really interesting.
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:36.720]   So I love history, but now I'm ready for nonfiction.
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.120]   And I knew this movie is coming out.
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:40.440]   And I have to say, and I'm only on the second chapter.
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:41.440]   I don't know.
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:42.440]   Are those chapters when the--
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:43.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:44.440]   --the second story?
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.080]   It's great.
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:50.400]   So we've gone from like the 18th century to 1931.
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:52.080]   And I know the more is going to happen.
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:53.360]   We go in the future too, right?
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:54.360]   Yeah.
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:55.360]   So is this science fiction?
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:58.040]   What is-- it defies categorization, I think.
[01:06:58.040 --> 01:06:59.040]   It does.
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:01.800]   I mean, there's definitely a fantastical element to it.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:05.400]   It's definitely more in the realm of science fiction than fantasy, perhaps.
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.440]   But it's six nested stories.
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.600]   So they're all related to each other.
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.960]   And they all take place in different time periods.
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:15.360]   And I don't think it's a spoiler to say that you come around to the second half of the
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:17.520]   story at the end of the books.
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:18.800]   So at the end of the book, rather.
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.320]   So each story does have a conclusion.
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:25.200]   So you won't be-- don't have to feel like you're just losing the story halfway through.
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:26.200]   But it's a very interesting read.
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:28.120]   I mean, it really shows how--
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:29.120]   Duck and cover.
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:31.120]   Oh, it's Flage's The Blue Angels.
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:32.120]   Yeah.
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.120]   You can't miss that.
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:34.120]   Wow.
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:41.920]   As I was saying before the Navy showed its immense power force over the air.
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:44.520]   It's a good book.
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:48.200]   And David Mitchell has a real grasp on language and different dialogues.
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:49.200]   Sure does.
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.560]   It's a really super interesting way of writing.
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:52.920]   So I enjoyed it, definitely.
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:56.520]   It's not one of my favorite books I've read in a really long time.
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:58.120]   But I found it fascinating.
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.560]   And I can't wait to see how they make it into a movie.
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:06.200]   The word comes to mind kind of virtuoso in the way that he is changing the personality
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:08.000]   and the language through this.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.120]   And it gets more impressive as he goes to present day and then future.
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.600]   He has two future interesting stories as well.
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:18.080]   So another recommendation doesn't have to be, you know, you can pick any two books.
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:19.080]   You're going to get two credits.
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:20.080]   So some books are two credits.
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:22.560]   If you want to listen to Game of Thrones, that's two credits.
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:24.120]   That could be your book.
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:26.800]   Or if you want to listen to Cloud Atlas, that's a credit.
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:29.280]   And Larry Lesk's Republic Lost, that's a credit.
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:30.280]   So there's your two books.
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:33.280]   Go to audible.com/twit.
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:34.280]   I got one.
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:35.280]   I just got one.
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:36.280]   Okay.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:37.280]   Another one.
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:38.280]   Juggle it.
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:39.280]   Real quick.
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:40.280]   Rational Optimist by Matt Ridley.
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:41.280]   It's awesome.
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:42.280]   Fiction?
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:43.280]   Nonfiction.
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:44.280]   Nonfiction.
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:49.520]   But basically talks about how specifically ideas, basically the entire first chapter
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:53.720]   is how ideas have sex and why that is what's separate.
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:59.400]   How they combine and why that separated humans and this particular era of humanity and why
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:03.720]   we should be rationally optimistic going forward, the fundamental underpinnings, why
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:04.720]   societies.
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:06.200]   Because I am.
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:07.880]   Getting better and better and better.
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:12.200]   And even though we have depressing little things that we focus on like campaign finance
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:18.400]   reform and everything, then ultimately we are on a rocket upward as we have been and
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:23.560]   why we should look at the facts and the data and know that we should be optimistic.
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.200]   I need reasons to be optimistic.
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:27.280]   So I'm going to put that down.
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:28.800]   Rational Optimist by Matt Ridley.
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:31.160]   This is a good one because it's whisper sync ready.
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:33.600]   So you can now, if you have the audio.
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:38.320]   What, I know Veronica just exploded into life.
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:39.320]   This is, I was so happy with that.
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:40.320]   I have a paperweight.
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:42.840]   I can't wait to use it with the audible stuff.
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:49.400]   So you, when you get the kindled book on your paper white for 395, which is 759, an additional
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:56.760]   395, so a total of like $12, you get both the kindle version and the audible version.
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:00.280]   And it's cool because as you're listening, as you're reading it, it picks up.
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:01.280]   So then you get in the car, right?
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.280]   You're reading on the paperweight.
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:06.760]   Now it picks up where you left off on the kindle version and the audio version.
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:08.080]   We've been waiting for this forever.
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:11.080]   And if you use the audible app, which I highly recommend on Windows Phone and Android or
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:14.680]   iPhone, it does the same thing, but with the audio version only.
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:18.800]   So when you leave off on my iPhone and I pick it up on my Nexus 7, it picks up the same
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:19.800]   spot.
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:20.800]   I do exactly the same thing.
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:22.640]   How long it works too?
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:23.640]   It does work.
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:25.640]   How many are the kids to try it yet?
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:26.640]   I can't wait.
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:27.640]   Great.
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:28.720]   So this is whisper sync ready.
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:31.760]   When they say that, that whisper sync for voice ready, that means it'll work with the
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.320]   kindle version and the audio version.
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:35.640]   I think all of the audio books work now.
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:36.640]   Yeah, they all sinker now.
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:39.960]   By the way, Cloud Atlas is thought of as conceptual fiction.
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:40.960]   That's what I would say.
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:44.760]   Like Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Freddie Murakami, and Jeh Verne is even.
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:45.760]   Yes.
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:46.760]   And actually that's my favorite category.
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:47.760]   Is it?
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:48.760]   Yeah.
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:49.760]   Is that right?
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.060]   I could really come again.
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:56.600]   You know, I turned down two or three chances to ride in the Blue Angels Jets.
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.480]   Oh, Patrick Norton loves telling that story.
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.480]   He passed out.
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:01.720]   He p- he blacked out.
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:03.920]   Which is exactly what I would have done.
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:05.640]   I would have vomited.
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:07.400]   So that's why I chose not to go.
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:08.640]   I would have vomited and passed out.
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.400]   Then passed out in my vomit.
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.120]   So you could see why I said no.
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:13.120]   He passed out.
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:18.360]   You know, a lot of our best creators of music have done that.
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:23.800]   You know, because I used to work at the radio station that did the Fleet Week play by play.
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:25.880]   So I would stand next to the guy from the Navy.
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:26.880]   He's there.
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:31.160]   Now here he comes and F8 J. Ford, Hornet, and he's doing a barrel roll.
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:32.320]   He didn't talk like that.
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:34.320]   But anyway, I wish he did.
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:37.240]   And you know, it's a hard thing to drive that airplane.
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:38.320]   Did you know that?
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:42.280]   We got a stick between your legs and they clench.
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:43.280]   I'm sure they do.
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:45.720]   They do not wear flight suits.
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:49.760]   Normally you'd wear a pressure suit to keep your blood from all going into your head.
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:53.040]   So you're actually leaving your head and going to your feet.
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:57.320]   So you pass out, but they don't have to do that because they're trained to clench.
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:58.320]   Wow.
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.320]   So they...
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:00.320]   They go like that.
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:03.800]   And then the blood goes out of their head.
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:07.920]   But if you get in the plane with them, Veronica, you will be required to wear a pressure suit
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:10.320]   because you can't be expected to clench.
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:15.280]   I could try.
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:16.280]   Not pressure suits.
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:17.280]   G suits.
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:18.280]   You're right.
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.280]   It's G suits because they're hitting high Gs.
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:20.280]   That's why they call him G-Men.
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:21.280]   No, that's another...
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:22.280]   No, that's a G-Men.
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:23.280]   That's a G-Men.
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:24.280]   And over there, he works for the federal government.
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:25.280]   No, they...
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:26.280]   Super Bowl champion.
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:27.280]   G-Men.
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:28.280]   All right.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:29.280]   I'll tell you who's clenching.
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:34.280]   Jack Dorsey after reading your getting picked back door to the New York Times.
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:37.320]   Kyle Lee, that's gotta hurt.
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:40.200]   So tell us what happened here.
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:41.200]   This is Nick Bilton.
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:42.360]   Well, we keep trying.
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:43.680]   Why is Nick not on this show?
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:44.680]   Is he coming?
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:47.560]   He has a very difficult schedule.
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:49.800]   He's scheduled probably two months in advance.
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:51.040]   I don't think he likes me.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.200]   I think he doesn't want to be on the...
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.480]   He's been on the show many times, and now all of a sudden, we can't get him.
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:57.440]   So November 4th is the episode that he will be on.
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:58.440]   All right.
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:59.440]   Nick, I'm right.
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:04.080]   But he's been writing really interesting articles for the New York Times about Silicon
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:05.080]   Valley.
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:06.080]   That's become his beat.
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:07.080]   That's why he hasn't had time.
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:08.080]   Maybe that's it.
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:09.080]   Yeah.
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:11.320]   So this one is about Dick Costalo, who is the CEO of Twitter.
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:12.320]   Absolutely.
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:19.360]   But in that, they discuss how Dorsey, who of course is also the CEO of Square, has been
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:21.480]   focusing more on Square lately.
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:25.720]   And according to Bilton's sources, some of the Twitter employees are not all that upset
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:27.280]   to see him less involved.
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.280]   This is a direct quote from the New York Times story.
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:33.240]   "Mr. Dorsey's role has since been reduced after employees complain that he was difficult
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:37.320]   to work with and repeatedly changed his mind about product directions.
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:42.360]   He no longer has anyone directly reporting to him, although he is still involved in strategic
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:44.400]   decisions."
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:49.480]   And then he goes on to say, "Mr. Costolo says he looks to Mr. Dorsey for ideas and sometimes
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:53.080]   has to pull them out of them, although Mr. Dorsey is a regular on the media search."
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:54.080]   What's part of his body?
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:55.080]   Is he pulling those ideas?
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:56.080]   Wow.
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:57.080]   Sweetboard knows.
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:02.480]   He's a regular on the media circuit appearing on CNN as well as Charlie Rose and other programs.
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:04.480]   He tends to be quiet in meetings.
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:08.760]   Dick does a good job of saying, "Jack, what do you think?" says Michael Sippy, director
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.600]   of consumer products at Twitter.
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:15.720]   Mr. Sippy works with Mr. Dorsey to make sure that new features are quote unquote "Twittery."
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:16.720]   Oh boy.
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:18.800]   Well, Dorsey invented Twitter.
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:19.800]   Indeed.
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:21.640]   Was his idea when he was at Obvious.
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:28.280]   I often wonder, "How can he be both the product guy at Twitter and run his own company?"
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:29.280]   Yeah.
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:30.280]   So maybe that's part of his tire.
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:31.280]   He's resting at the meetings.
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:32.280]   He's closing his eyes.
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:35.560]   It sounds like he may just not be a good manager.
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:36.560]   Fine.
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:40.080]   He's... they want his brain and they're like, "You go run square.
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:43.360]   Just stay on the payroll here so we can mine your brain for ideas sometimes."
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:45.680]   Well, but the problem seems to be better that way.
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:46.680]   But you can also see it.
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:50.480]   You can't you kind of see it at Twitter where it just doesn't clear.
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:54.680]   They don't seem to have a clear path forward or am I wrong?
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:58.600]   This feels that Twitter doesn't really know what the hell it's doing.
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:03.360]   I feel like Twitter has done a great job until this last iPad app.
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:07.400]   This is the first time where I looked at something they did and said, "That's not something
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:08.400]   I want."
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.400]   Don't even get me started.
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:12.720]   All the iOS apps, the new Twitter apps, first of all, they kill the third party apps.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:15.800]   They basically say to third parties, "Thank you, but no thanks.
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:18.320]   You got us to this point, but now we're going to do it ourselves."
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:20.680]   And they take the Apple apps and they trash them.
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:24.040]   They take everything that was good out of them and they make them garbage.
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:26.240]   Now, let me ask you about this.
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:30.240]   And I did not watch the debates and watch Twitter at the same time, but it sounds like
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:32.440]   you with your iPad and your TV.
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:33.960]   My Nexus 7.
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:36.240]   You're watching the Twitter, right?
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:43.840]   Somebody told me that in the Twitter stream, there were paid ads from milk romneys.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:47.600]   Milk has many different Twitter accounts, apparently.
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:50.760]   There's a whole bunch of bit-rommy Twitter accounts and that you were seeing them in
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:51.760]   the stream.
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:52.760]   Did you see them?
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:53.760]   I didn't see that.
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:54.760]   No.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:55.760]   And I was looking in the app.
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:56.760]   It was an official Twitter app and I was following along.
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.760]   Now, I was on tape delay.
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:00.400]   You wouldn't have seen them.
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:01.400]   And so I'm following along and Twitter.
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:02.800]   I think what it was too.
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:03.800]   And reloading.
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:05.920]   And so maybe I avoided them because of it.
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:06.920]   If you're not watching live live.
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:10.360]   But I think they would be cashed in, I mean, because all I was doing was scrolling down
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:14.560]   10 minutes to what people were posting at the point where I was watching.
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:19.720]   So let me ask the chat room or Veronica or Justin, did you guys see ads during the
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:20.720]   debates in Twitter?
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:22.160]   I didn't.
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:25.600]   I was on my phone on Tweetbot and I didn't see anything.
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:28.320]   But I don't think I see them on Tweetbot.
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:29.320]   That's true.
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:30.320]   Yeah.
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:31.320]   Ads in general.
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:32.320]   Same thing.
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:33.320]   I had Tweetbot on my phone.
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:34.320]   That was following through.
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:35.320]   But I didn't see any ads in there.
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:39.080]   But although I'll tell you what, the political ad controversy, you guys follow us this week
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:44.160]   that all the liberal and conservative blogs are furious with the campaigns.
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:45.160]   Why?
[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:51.440]   Because both campaigns have gone to more of the cookie centric, you know, like the ads
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:55.600]   that just show up anywhere that they'll try to buy the certain kinds of users.
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:56.840]   So those ads that follow you will wrap.
[01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:58.640]   You're sorry, but online ads, not TV ads.
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:16:59.720]   Yeah, not TV ads.
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:02.880]   These are all liberal and conservative blogs that normally would experience.
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:04.720]   They're not getting any revenue.
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:09.040]   They don't get the big buys directly from the campaign.
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:13.520]   So now normally they would look to these seasons like the television networks do.
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:18.960]   Like, you know, their networks in Orlando and Virginia Beach, where it's just a gigantic
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:24.080]   boon for them that every ad they have is bought out by a political campaign.
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:27.280]   This is normally what happens for sites like, let's say, little green footballs in the
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:28.280]   right or the daily co-som.
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:30.240]   Yeah, that's a big, big money.
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:31.240]   Yeah.
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:34.640]   Now, not so much because those, the campaigns are saying, well, why are you going to buy
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:35.640]   for you guys?
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:37.240]   We'll just buy through Google.
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:42.520]   First of all, you don't buy from them because those people have already made up their mind.
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:46.120]   All you care about in a presidential election is people who haven't made their mind down.
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:47.520]   You want to turn out a good base?
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:48.520]   Turn out a good base.
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:49.520]   Really?
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:50.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:51.520]   Turn out.
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:52.520]   All right.
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:53.520]   All right.
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:54.520]   Okay.
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:55.520]   You're right.
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:56.520]   So you do want to get them excited, but meanwhile, that's why you do debates.
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.520]   Debates don't actually change anybody's mind, but they get base fired up to come out and
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:17:59.520]   vote.
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:00.520]   Got it.
[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:04.040]   But meanwhile, so that's so like if you're President Obama, if you like, throw the debate
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:09.000]   so that people will then say, oh, he really poor, poor Barack.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.160]   He's so tired.
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:11.160]   We should vote.
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.160]   Sure.
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.400]   Look at him, a warm glass of milk.
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:15.400]   Okay.
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:18.000]   I'm going to get a C in that class.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.600]   That's all I know.
[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:23.080]   But yeah, it's a smart thing.
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:26.600]   I don't know if I can't tell if the Romney campaign did this or not, but wouldn't it
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:31.760]   be smart to buy the ads, not ads, but tweets in the Twitter stream during an event like
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:32.760]   that?
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:33.760]   It's hard.
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:38.400]   I mean, because I don't even know what that value is for perspective voters.
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:41.880]   I don't really know exactly how the promoted tweet thing works, but I know you're buying
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:42.880]   an algorithm.
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:46.640]   You're saying when certain conditions are met, I want my tweet to show up.
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:50.440]   This guy, I'm sure political posts were flying fast and furious.
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:55.160]   Anyway, and I think what they were, and I'm not sure, the guy who was telling me about
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:19:00.440]   this said, they were, as Romney would make a point, there were links to further information
[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:01.440]   about that.
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:02.440]   Yeah.
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:06.120]   Or when Obama would say something and say, now this is, well, look at this link.
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:10.520]   And it was a really good way of kind of annotating the debate for your candidate.
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:11.520]   Sure.
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:13.760]   I don't, if they didn't do that, they ought to have done that.
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:14.760]   Maybe not.
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:18.440]   Maybe people watched Twitter on their own Twitter accounts instead of doing ads.
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:22.200]   Well, they were, but that was the problem is you have to follow them.
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:26.560]   So what they wanted to do is to get to people who weren't following Romney accounts.
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:27.560]   You're right.
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:30.080]   They're doing it on the Romney accounts, but they want to get it to people who weren't
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:31.080]   following.
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:33.560]   Well, that's the whole thing with promoted tweet is getting your message into somebody's
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:34.560]   feed.
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:35.560]   Who doesn't follow you?
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:36.560]   I don't follow 90.
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:41.200]   So somebody who's not watching the debates and is tweeting about basketball wives can now
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:42.200]   find out.
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:43.200]   Mitt Romney's back to that.
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:45.040]   No, but that's my point though is that that's good.
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:46.800]   It shouldn't be following showing up there.
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:50.800]   It should only be showing up with someone who's actually tweeting about the debates because
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:55.360]   the way that's a trillion of Twitter's promoted tweet is that they're supposed to only show
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:58.040]   up to people who would want to see them.
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:01.440]   The algorithm is supposed to look and say, oh, you're following these people and you're
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:03.560]   posting about these kinds of topics.
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:06.680]   So we'll give you that promoted tweet because you're going to go, oh, that's interesting.
[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:08.880]   So maybe I wasn't a qualified tweeter.
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:09.880]   Maybe.
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:11.360]   I guess I was watching on tweet.
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:13.440]   I was just following Gary Johnson and Jill Stein.
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:14.440]   So oh, I bet they were.
[01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:18.440]   I was eating burritos at the time.
[01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:19.440]   I know.
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:22.240]   The crucial Northern California burrito eater vote.
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:26.400]   They were playing the debate at the Mexican restaurant I was eating at.
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:27.400]   Really?
[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:28.400]   That's encouraging.
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:29.400]   Yeah.
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:30.800]   Hey, that's where I went.
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:32.800]   Brock, you had just eaten a big burrito.
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:35.160]   You know, I didn't make you tired.
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:38.320]   It's so funny because I did not see the debates and I didn't read any news accounts, but I
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:42.840]   get a pretty good picture of what happened from tweets from you guys from Facebook.
[01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:43.840]   You don't have to do that.
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:44.840]   People are mean.
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.560]   I'll tell you, I was surprised at just watching it.
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:52.320]   How much people who are fans of or traditionally kind of fans of Barack Obama just get mean
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:55.840]   with it, just angry about it.
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:57.560]   Here's the story from the Washington Post.
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:01.960]   Websites lose to Google AOL and race for Obama run a campaign ad.
[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:03.040]   Which had a look at Merrick.
[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:04.040]   They're cut of the graft.
[01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:05.040]   Exactly.
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:08.920]   It's funny because now they're in a very weird position where they like personally and they
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:13.040]   and they bitch in this in that particular article where they hate the campaign and they're
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:17.080]   very angry that like this was something that they thought was sort of owed to them.
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:18.080]   Right.
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:19.080]   And it's a huge.
[01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:20.080]   They don't like the campaign.
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:23.680]   But meanwhile their whole entire shtick is pumping up the campaign.
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:26.600]   But you know what little sites like little green footballs can't do?
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:29.680]   They can't help affect legislation later on.
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:33.480]   But bigger companies, media companies that are part of conglomerates can.
[01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:35.200]   Are we back to campaign finance or phone?
[01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:36.200]   I don't know.
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:37.200]   Maybe I do.
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:41.320]   I read a book.
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:44.840]   Google passes Microsoft's market value.
[01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:46.000]   But what happened to the Google stock?
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.480]   Why did it suddenly take off?
[01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:48.760]   You must know Tom.
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:53.720]   You know the story did not either surprise me or really captivate me.
[01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:57.560]   I mean Google's been raising rising slowly since at IPO.
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:01.520]   They had a nice big $767.
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:03.840]   And this is just kind of the inevitable progress of Google.
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:06.840]   They haven't really messed anything up horribly.
[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:10.040]   So they keep getting a little more of the stock market rewards people who don't mess
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:12.880]   things up our Microsoft's not mess things up horribly.
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:13.880]   They just that going.
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:16.000]   People didn't realize how much better their maps are.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000]   Maybe that's it.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.640]   If it was about the maps, I think it's momentum.
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:19.640]   No, I don't know.
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:21.480]   It's possible I guess anything's possible.
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:24.160]   They've actually gone down a little bit since Friday.
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:26.200]   So correct it.
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:27.760]   Corrective correction there.
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.760]   So never mind forget I said anything.
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:32.320]   You know Microsoft's not doing badly.
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:35.520]   I think when Apple like that, but their stock price is stagnant.
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:37.120]   That was that was significant.
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:38.120]   That's a story.
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:41.000]   Google being like really valuable like Microsoft.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000]   It's also really valuable.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.200]   It seems like well, but it could be the changing of the guard.
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.760]   It's a web services company versus smart company.
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:51.200]   You know, it's like when Microsoft passed IBM.
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:52.200]   Right.
[01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:55.000]   Changing of the guard.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.280]   Do they dress like beef eaters?
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:59.280]   No, I think they're wearing today.
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:02.520]   Everybody's wearing pork pie hats and Western shirts, I believe.
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:03.520]   How about it?
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:04.520]   I don't know.
[01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:07.040]   How about a print ad with a live Twitter feed?
[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:09.120]   That's kind of cool.
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:10.120]   Free phone.
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:11.760]   I don't understand how that works.
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:12.760]   So a thousand.
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:13.760]   Oh my God.
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:14.760]   I'm very loud.
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:15.760]   How was that?
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:16.760]   Free phone.
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:19.800]   Entertainment Weekly had an ad for CW television.
[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.160]   It was only a thousand copies.
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:26.720]   They were only in LA in New York and they had an Android phone embedded in the ad.
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:28.080]   It was stripped out of its case.
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:30.440]   Hackers were able to dial with that phone.
[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:34.280]   It had a T-Mobile connection that was putting live tweets and if you ripped it out of the
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:36.160]   ad, it was activated.
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:40.920]   So yeah, I mean, you couldn't see the keyboard, but once you figured out the QWERTY, you just
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:43.400]   dial and you can make a phone call with it.
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:46.280]   Now, first of all, that's got to cost a lot of money.
[01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:48.720]   Well, I'm sure it'll cut the service off after a week.
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:50.560]   But yeah, I mean, even a thousand copies.
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:54.240]   I guess you get, well, you're getting attention from more than a thousand people.
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:55.240]   Exactly.
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:56.240]   We all talked about it.
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:57.560]   We've watched Vampire Diaries now.
[01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:58.560]   Is that what it was an ad for?
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:23:59.720]   It was a CW network, yeah.
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:03.360]   It was a live Twitter stream about the shows.
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:05.000]   That is just why.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.720]   Which I think is a pretty novel idea.
[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:07.720]   It's a cool idea.
[01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:08.720]   Yeah.
[01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:09.720]   I guess it just depends.
[01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:12.920]   And business-wise, how much they spent $86 for free.
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:13.920]   Who thought of that?
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:14.920]   Really?
[01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:15.920]   Yeah.
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:16.920]   Who thought of that?
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:18.880]   Who said, hey, I know, we'll put Android phones in every copy of Entertainment Weekly.
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:21.200]   It's an $86 phone, but it probably didn't cost them $86.
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:22.200]   No.
[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:23.200]   I know a Chinese cuffing.
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:24.200]   Get these for $50.
[01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:25.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:26.200]   Stuff, yeah.
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:30.400]   $5,000, our ad placement cost don't go up that much, and we get a big splash out of it.
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:36.080]   I'll tell you what, what is the insert, the flow and rate for something like that?
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:37.800]   Oh, on the magazine beside, yeah.
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:38.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:39.800]   That's probably the real cost.
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:40.800]   Sure.
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:41.800]   Stick it in the magazine.
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:42.800]   Now, I got it.
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:43.800]   We're working in newspapers.
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:45.200]   I know how much it used to cost to put a flyer in.
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:46.200]   Right.
[01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:47.640]   It was just a ridiculous amount of money.
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:49.800]   A little of them putting a phone.
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:52.680]   If you have one of these, it's got to be pretty valuable.
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:54.280]   You could sell that on eBay, I would think.
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:55.280]   That would be valuable thing to have.
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:57.680]   Does anybody really care about this?
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:58.680]   Like it's cool.
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:24:59.680]   It's interesting.
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:00.680]   To me, it was a hacker thing.
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:02.080]   Like, yeah, you could pull this out and use it.
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:03.080]   That's awesome.
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:04.080]   Yeah, and then they hacked the phone.
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:05.800]   Granted, no, you didn't even have to hack it.
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:06.800]   It was not all.
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:07.800]   You could dial it.
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:11.160]   You just had to have a stylus to be able to press the keys because there was no keyboard.
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:13.640]   It was just the bottom part of the sensor.
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:15.640]   That's so funny.
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:17.120]   Just tear it right out of the page here.
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:21.120]   Yeah, I don't know if we'll be seeing too many more of those, but I think it's interesting.
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:22.120]   It's new.
[01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:23.120]   Yeah, it's cool.
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:24.120]   You'll never see that with an iPhone.
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:26.120]   I'm not sure if that right now is expensive.
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:27.120]   It's expensive.
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:30.000]   By the way, I just want to point out, because people keep asking me if you scratch your iPhone
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.440]   yet, look at the size of that divot that came out of the bezel there in the hair.
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:36.720]   I must have dropped it.
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:38.120]   I don't remember dropping it.
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:41.000]   All I have is a little bit of a video trail.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.760]   I have a little bit of wearing at the edges.
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:44.760]   You do.
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:45.760]   That's all I have.
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:46.760]   I don't have any dents or just things.
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:49.240]   I've got nothing because I just got it two days ago.
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:51.000]   I've got a case.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.000]   Yeah, that's the question.
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.000]   I need to get a case.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.600]   That doesn't detract to much for mophia.
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:56.600]   The insipio feather.
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:59.040]   It was the same one I had on my last phone too.
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:00.040]   It's nice.
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:02.200]   It's the same one you had on the four S?
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:03.440]   Well, not the same case.
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:04.440]   The same product.
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:05.440]   Yeah, the same brand.
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:06.840]   It's like how did you do that?
[01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:07.840]   Version.
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:08.840]   Yeah.
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:09.840]   It's a chart extraction out.
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:11.320]   It's bigger on the inside.
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:12.320]   I must have dropped it.
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:16.000]   I just didn't know and clattered to the floor because it looks like what happened is it landed
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000]   on that divot.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000]   Yeah.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.720]   And then there's a bunch of little smaller divots.
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:22.920]   You know, I dropped an iPad like that, though, and it didn't have that big of a dividend.
[01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:24.360]   It's a big chunk out of the aluminum.
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:28.080]   This is why we can't have nice things, Leo.
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:29.560]   Si.
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:31.360]   Si.
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:34.480]   You know, when I first got it, I tried to cut it with a knife.
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:36.200]   There's a great video.
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:37.200]   There's a great video.
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:43.240]   I fix it video of the host and her daughter trying to scratch it with a set of keys.
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:44.240]   Yeah.
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:46.280]   She just gives it to her toddler and the girl's just going at it.
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:47.280]   Oh, wow.
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:48.280]   Did they?
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:49.280]   Did she?
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:50.760]   Yeah, they, she, she scratched it.
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:51.760]   Yeah.
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:52.760]   That's too surprising.
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:54.800]   Molly Wood did it on Always On too.
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:55.800]   Sure.
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:56.800]   She's made a career now.
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:57.800]   This is her new thing.
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:02.120]   The torture, torture testing stuff.
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:03.880]   Are you buying Zinga stock?
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:04.880]   No.
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:05.880]   Whoopsie doodle.
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:06.880]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:07.880]   Maybe it's a bargain.
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:11.880]   I wonder when you go in, I wonder if she pop guys are going to bail from that deal.
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:13.880]   The words with friends guys are gone.
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:15.720]   And that was a big product.
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:16.720]   I don't know.
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:21.720]   You can just follow the bellowing laughter of the show.
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:24.880]   The OMG pop guys from their acquisition and just, they may not.
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:26.440]   You see that leaving the building.
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:27.440]   How much?
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:28.440]   It wasn't like a billion.
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:29.440]   Whoo!
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:30.440]   Something like...
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:31.440]   Was it still worth a billion?
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:32.440]   How much it was stopped.
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:33.440]   It was less than that.
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:34.440]   Yeah, it was a big stock thing.
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:36.240]   But it was so much money.
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:40.920]   Even then, like, I mean, that was like, it was like, what, like four days after they
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:46.960]   bought, you know, the whole OMG pop team that draw something was just like, you know,
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:47.960]   like, draw one?
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:49.880]   They bought, draw something at the absolute peak.
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:50.880]   Yeah.
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:52.960]   Like, I always use smart strategy.
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:53.960]   Yeah.
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:57.800]   Casual gaming was like a mini, mini bubble, I feel like, and we're seeing it bust.
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:58.800]   Well, that's...
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:02.120]   Okay, so John Konstein writing in TechCrunch's "Why Singa Failed?"
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:03.120]   premature.
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:04.120]   Yeah, a little early on that.
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:05.120]   A little bit.
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:06.120]   Like it's failed yet, but it's failing.
[01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:07.400]   It's not doing well.
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:09.680]   Too many developers, they had a lot of games.
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:10.680]   Yeah.
[01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:12.360]   Not enough soft core gamers.
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:14.360]   Are there too few casual game?
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:15.360]   I don't know.
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:16.360]   I just agree with that.
[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:20.160]   But I do strongly agree with his point that people are just sick of seeing games spam in
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:21.160]   their Facebook feed.
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:22.160]   That's it.
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:23.160]   Yeah.
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:24.600]   I think... and you just... you lose interest after a week.
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:27.760]   I was playing SimCity on Facebook for a while, which I love.
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:28.760]   I love SimCity.
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:29.840]   I love everything they do.
[01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:33.320]   And then after a couple of days, I was like, "Yeah, I'm not going to do this anymore.
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:34.320]   It's too complicated."
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:40.680]   There was a great article, I think, by Lee Alexander about why we get sick of these games
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:45.240]   so quickly and why we're not getting as much out of them as we could because they hook
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:49.880]   you real early by giving you like, "Oh, you know, the quests are really easy to complete
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:52.360]   and you can build up your farm real fast."
[01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:56.200]   And then all of a sudden, you're not getting stuff as easily as you were.
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:29:00.000]   So then you have to, "Oh, you have to share with your friends to try to get more materials."
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.440]   Or you have to pay some real world money to accomplish this certain goal.
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:08.440]   And then suddenly you're like, "I'm just not getting that much out of this with what
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:09.800]   I'm putting in."
[01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:10.800]   So it's hard.
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:14.640]   You hit a wall with these kinds of games where suddenly it's not as fun anymore.
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:15.640]   Right.
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:18.080]   And that time it takes to hit that wall is different for different people.
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:19.080]   But you're right.
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:20.080]   You'll always hit it.
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:24.560]   And so I think they've been living in a dream world that they can keep this going and keep
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:28.000]   bouncing the ball forward with new farm bills and things.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.240]   But didn't we see this in the console gaming arena as well?
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:37.320]   I mean, it reminds me of the days of Atari where Atari could do no wrong.
[01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:39.200]   I'm going back a little bit.
[01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:40.200]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:41.200]   The 2600.
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:42.880]   They were king of the world and then they started making some crappy games.
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:48.240]   I remember them bulldozing games because they had flooded the market with crappy cartridges.
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:50.320]   And then eventually just basically went bust.
[01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:53.200]   But that didn't mean it was the end of console gaming by any means.
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:54.200]   Right.
[01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:58.520]   It just meant that it wasn't as crazy easy to make huge money as it may have looked right
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:29:59.520]   in the early days.
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:00.920]   You've got to make great games.
[01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:01.920]   Exactly.
[01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:02.920]   And you've got to make...
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:06.440]   I think that's what Rovio is trying to balance right now is like, "Look, Angry Birds is not
[01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:07.600]   going to last forever.
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:08.600]   So let's do piggies.
[01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:09.600]   But let's do it right.
[01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:10.600]   I like piggies.
[01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:11.600]   And let's make it good.
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:12.600]   Do you like bad piggies?
[01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:14.080]   And so far bad piggies seems to be good.
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:15.080]   Do you like bad piggies?
[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:18.080]   I haven't played bad piggies yet.
[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:19.080]   But I think what Rovio is doing is...
[01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:21.080]   I actually just noticed that last night...
[01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:22.720]   Rovio is doing the right thing, right?
[01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:25.680]   They're saying, "We're not just going to flood a bunch of stuff out there.
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:30.960]   We're going to play this at a nice rhythm and not over inflate."
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:34.520]   Zinga got a little too excited and just started throwing everything out there like Atari.
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:36.160]   It's a great comparison.
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:37.160]   Yeah.
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:42.360]   And I think it is just a volatile market that you need to always chase that next hit,
[01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:43.760]   the next trend, you know, the next...
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:44.760]   We lost Leo, by the way, by saying...
[01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:45.760]   I'm sorry, I'm playing bad piggies.
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:46.760]   But I'm playing bad piggies.
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:50.400]   But what I like about bad piggies is kind of a different game.
[01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:52.400]   They could have just like reversed it or something.
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:54.240]   But the idea of bad piggies is a little more...
[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:55.840]   And that's the problem with all those farmville clones.
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:57.840]   It's like, "Oh, I'm just playing farmville, but farming it."
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:00.280]   Yeah, I do not like mobile games.
[01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:01.280]   Really?
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:02.680]   No.
[01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:03.680]   Not into it.
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:04.680]   What are the pocket plans?
[01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:05.680]   So what are you playing these things?
[01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:07.680]   Pocket plans I gave up on after they got me.
[01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:10.920]   I shilled in a lot of money for that game for pocket plans.
[01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:11.920]   Really?
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:12.920]   Yes.
[01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:13.920]   So I had to stop.
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:14.920]   I did not...
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:15.920]   I was not a travel decision.
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:16.920]   It was a financial decision.
[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:17.920]   It was a bit of a...
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:18.920]   It actually happened.
[01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:20.840]   So I put a lot of money into that game.
[01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:23.520]   And so now I have a lot of bucks, B-U-X.
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:24.520]   And...
[01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:28.360]   But I'm not high enough level to spend the money on anything good.
[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:32.640]   So now I have to invest a lot of time with boring gameplay in order to advance to a point
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:38.040]   where I can actually spend the money that I paid real money for in the game.
[01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:39.040]   There you go.
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:40.040]   No, I got...
[01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:41.040]   That's bad.
[01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:42.040]   That's where pocket plan died for me.
[01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:43.040]   That's bad.
[01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:45.880]   I didn't dump in, I guess, the financial reserve that brought me up.
[01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:46.880]   Veronica did.
[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:47.880]   I don't even want to say that's funny.
[01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:53.000]   But don't throw out the piggy with a bath water because it's possible...
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.160]   It's possible these are just bad games.
[01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:56.160]   Right.
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:58.760]   And if it were a great game, you would all say, "Oh."
[01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:01.760]   And there was a time when you could put out a bad game and people would play it anyway
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:02.760]   because they were just excited about catching the game.
[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:03.760]   The Atari example.
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:04.760]   Exactly.
[01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:05.760]   The example, exactly.
[01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:11.160]   We're going to take a break, come back with more Veronica Belmont is here from techzilla.com.
[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:16.600]   And her partner Tom Merritt, they do a great show called Sword and Laser, which that guy
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:17.600]   I guess cloud out.
[01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:19.360]   This is your current book of the month.
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:20.360]   It is.
[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:21.360]   You can read that.
[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:22.920]   Anything exciting coming up in the...
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:25.040]   We're interviewing Gail Carriger for our next episode.
[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:26.040]   I love Gail Carriger.
[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:27.040]   Oh, she's crazy.
[01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:28.040]   It's coming to the office.
[01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:29.040]   Well, you can see the scene.
[01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:30.520]   I thought it was the guy that they shot in.
[01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:31.520]   No, no, no, not that girl.
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:32.520]   Breaking bad guy.
[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:33.520]   Oh, no.
[01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:34.520]   Hey.
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:35.520]   Gail.
[01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:36.520]   What's wrong with you guys?
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:37.520]   I'm a spoiler.
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:38.520]   Oh, that is a spoiler.
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:40.200]   I am sorry.
[01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:41.200]   I am so sorry.
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:45.000]   Oh, you're not doing my looper thing from the beginning of the show.
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.000]   It was not a spoiler.
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.000]   That was a spoiler.
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.640]   The value of people are shooting at themselves is the plot of the movie.
[01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:50.640]   That was a spoiler.
[01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:51.640]   That was the end of the show.
[01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:52.640]   That was the end of the show.
[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:53.640]   Who's shooting you?
[01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:54.640]   Who's shooting you?
[01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:55.640]   Who's shooting you?
[01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:56.640]   Is it the trailer?
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:57.640]   No, it was.
[01:32:57.640 --> 01:32:58.640]   I said someone shoots themselves.
[01:32:58.640 --> 01:32:59.640]   That's the plot of the movie.
[01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:00.640]   That is a spoiler.
[01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:01.640]   That is a spoiler.
[01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:03.120]   Do not say that in the trailer.
[01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:04.120]   You see that in the trailer.
[01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:05.120]   You do?
[01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:06.680]   Oh, there's two hymns.
[01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:08.840]   Just because the trailer did it doesn't mean it's okay.
[01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:09.840]   All right.
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:10.840]   That's a dangerous territory.
[01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:14.640]   If a trailer jumped off a bridge, would you come off a bridge just at least so?
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:19.000]   The burger is coming to the building when we record live, so Leo, I will introduce you.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000]   She's very nice.
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.000]   What is she right?
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.000]   Oh, you haven't actually.
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.000]   Oh, right.
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.000]   The parasol protectorate.
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.000]   The parasol protectorate.
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.000]   Victorian vampire teapunk.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.920]   That's a Jean Baine fantasy.
[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:30.920]   That's a genre.
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:31.920]   It's awesome.
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:32.920]   Victorian vampire teapunk.
[01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:36.800]   Imagine like A.C. Wells meets Dickens meets Steampunk.
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:37.800]   It's awesome.
[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:38.800]   It's really good.
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:43.200]   My favorite series right now, it starts with Solis.
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:44.800]   It's a great series of books.
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:45.800]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:48.800]   She just came out with a young adult novel too that she's working on that takes place
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:50.600]   in the same world.
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:52.600]   You just like combine three genres.
[01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:54.440]   Any three genres and then you got a new one?
[01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:55.440]   Is that how it works?
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:56.600]   No, but they have to work.
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:57.600]   This one works.
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:33:58.600]   This one works.
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:33:59.600]   Yeah.
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:00.600]   Like Western jazz musician.
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:01.600]   It's a new genre.
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:02.600]   It's a new genre.
[01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:04.400]   I know, I know, I know.
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:06.240]   They're going to launch a plane or something in a minute.
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:07.800]   So we got to hurry.
[01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:08.800]   There's space.
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:12.320]   No, there's like, well, there's like good space excellence.
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:13.320]   Is it?
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:14.320]   Well, it's good.
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:15.320]   Andrew is there on the on the pad.
[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:16.320]   Apparently with Molly Wood.
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:17.320]   Molly Wood's there too.
[01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:18.320]   Molly Wood's there too.
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:20.680]   Is she going to put an iPhone underneath the rocket?
[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:21.680]   I don't know.
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:26.520]   Although apparently, Andrew set me pictures of Teslas in the parking lot.
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:28.760]   Oh, the Teslas of a ride.
[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:29.760]   Those are all yours.
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:30.760]   Yeah.
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:31.760]   Oh, Elon owns space.
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:32.760]   Yeah.
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:33.760]   So there might be a reason for that.
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:34.760]   Yeah.
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:36.800]   I can let me along because I don't know about Elon Musk.
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:39.560]   My best friend Elon Musk.
[01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:43.400]   Did they name the perfume after him?
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:45.120]   This show brought to you by Squarespace.
[01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:47.280]   By the way, also here Mr. Justin Robert Guillen.
[01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:48.280]   It's me.
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:49.280]   Thank you.
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:50.280]   Host of frame rate.
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:51.280]   No.
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:52.280]   Host of NSFW.
[01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:53.280]   There we go.
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:54.280]   And weird things.
[01:34:54.280 --> 01:35:00.280]   Of weird things, which we're going to see oddly enough in about 45 minutes.
[01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:01.280]   Indeed.
[01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:03.680]   Or less if I can get through this ad.
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:06.520]   I want to talk a little bit about Squarespace.com.
[01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:10.600]   See if Google had been using Squarespace, we never would have been able to bring Veronica
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:13.440]   spreadsheet to its knees.
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:15.000]   Everything you need to create an exceptional website.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.280]   That means hosting.
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:18.520]   That means the best content management system on top of it.
[01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:20.680]   You even get the domain name registration.
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:24.600]   Now when you sign up for a year plan, they throw in the domain name registration, hook
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:27.440]   it up so that it goes right to your site.
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:33.880]   And I have to tell you, just take a look at the, take the tour if you go to squarespace.com.
[01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:39.480]   Take a look at the various sites that they, I mean, people use Squarespace.
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:40.480]   Nothing looks the same.
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:45.040]   No two sites look the same because while, yeah, you start with these great 50 great templates.
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:49.400]   But you're going to always and very easily modify it to suit you.
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:51.360]   So it really looks the way you want it to.
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:52.560]   This is really important to creatives.
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:57.120]   And one of the groups that Squarespace really reaches out to is photographers, artists,
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:35:58.640]   people are looking for portfolios.
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:01.120]   It is such an easy way.
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:04.840]   Now I know there are service providers who specialize in photography portfolios.
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:08.600]   Do it yourself, save money and get exactly what you want.
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:09.960]   You want to make a change?
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:10.960]   No problem.
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:12.680]   It's very easy to do.
[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:15.480]   All the content just automatically reflows.
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:20.280]   And in fact, with their responsive designs now, you make one site that looks great on
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:26.080]   any size screen, whether it's an iPhone all the way up to 27 inch display because they're,
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:28.280]   they're automatically resizing the images.
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:29.280]   You get seven.
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:31.160]   Different thumbnails to fit the right display.
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:32.520]   They're reformat.
[01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:37.280]   Every template is designed to look great on mobile.
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:38.800]   They just, such great stuff.
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:45.320]   Of course, the iPad and iPhone apps, now Android apps too, make it very easy.
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:51.400]   Not only to post, but to moderate comments to see the stats.
[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:54.320]   And of course, it works with all of your favorite services.
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:57.760]   They've got plugins for all of them, a great commenting system.
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:36:58.760]   Let me just show you.
[01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:02.200]   This is, this is the pricing and this is where you're going to really be blown away.
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:05.240]   When you sign up for a year plan, they still have got two plans now.
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:08.240]   First of all, you can get the free 14 day trial just by clicking get started.
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:09.940]   You don't need a credit card or anything.
[01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:14.520]   If you decide to buy, that's what we're going to ask you to use the TWIT 10 offer code.
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:17.240]   Because you'll save 10% off your first purchase.
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:20.480]   If you make an annual purchase, you're going to save the most and look at the prices.
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:23.640]   The basic plan is $8 a month when you buy an annual purchase.
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:26.400]   $10 when you just go month to month.
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:29.720]   When you buy an annual plan, you get the custom domain and use the TWIT code.
[01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:30.720]   You'll get 10% off.
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:33.000]   But I got to, I got to point you to the unlimited plan.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:38.080]   I've never heard of a web hosting company giving you unlimited bandwidth, unlimited storage,
[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:43.840]   unlimited pages, galleries and blogs, unlimited contributors for $16 a month.
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:45.080]   I don't know how they do this.
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:46.840]   Yeah, but they charge you for the domain name, right?
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:48.920]   I mean, no, no, no, that's the beauty of it.
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:49.920]   The domain name is free.
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:51.400]   You get a domain name free too.
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:55.960]   You're not making the, that's not the profit domain name and they hook it up.
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:38:01.040]   I really don't, you know, the only limitation that I, that I know of is that you have file
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:03.240]   sizes limited 20 megabytes.
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:06.200]   So the only limitation on this one I know of, but that's, this is amazing.
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:07.200]   20 megabytes.
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:09.720]   What are you going to put on the, I guess you couldn't, you couldn't put like your home
[01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:10.720]   movies on there.
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:11.720]   Store those on archive.org.
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:12.720]   Yeah.
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:13.720]   Yeah, not a problem.
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:14.720]   You too.
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:15.720]   Link it up.
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:16.720]   What's wrong with the YouTube?
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:17.720]   And then you bet it in your squares.
[01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:18.720]   Yeah.
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:19.720]   Boom.
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:20.720]   Well, what, you don't like that?
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:21.720]   No, I think it's.
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:22.720]   I have a squares based party.
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:24.720]   I have one technical difficulty that, that I would like fix.
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:25.720]   I know friends over there.
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:28.440]   You tell me what's, what's the, I can help you.
[01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:33.120]   We're trying to convert sort of laser.com to squarespace six, but it's not automatically
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:34.120]   copying over.
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:35.120]   Oh, it won't.
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:36.120]   Oh, oh, yeah.
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:37.120]   Okay.
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:42.440]   I started fresh when I went to six and you really want to, I know you really want to,
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:47.840]   because the, the responsive design does not work well with the old stuff.
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:51.160]   So you really almost, I did, I did the same thing and you have to just kind of say, okay,
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:52.480]   I'm going to go move over.
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:53.480]   That's a lot.
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:54.480]   I got to get an intern on that.
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:55.480]   You get a lot of embeds.
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:58.080]   Well, all of our podcasts, all your links.
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:00.080]   Oh, no, no, I can help you with that.
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:01.080]   The arc up to her.
[01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:02.080]   Good beds.
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:05.400]   The embeds, the, the, the embed code won't translate over.
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:06.400]   Yeah.
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:07.600]   What are those little guys called?
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:12.400]   I, you push the, you enter the code into a separate little applet and then it's not
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:14.600]   talking about squarespace guys about that.
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:15.600]   I haven't.
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:16.600]   I will.
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:17.600]   Or you can.
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:19.560]   You know, it's a really effective way to do that.
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:21.200]   Talk about it on a well listened to body.
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:23.160]   Let me talk to Anthony about, they can fix it.
[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:25.440]   I guarantee you that's not, they'll fix that for you.
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:27.840]   That's not a problem.
[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:31.960]   Squarespace.com and that's the kind of customer support by the way, not just for Veronica
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:33.440]   Belmont, but for you too.
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:37.280]   24/7, they've got workshops that are free webinars.
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:39.880]   It's just a really, and they're nice people.
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:41.200]   Try it for free.
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:42.200]   You don't need a credit card.
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:43.440]   You don't need a code or anything.
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:48.880]   But if you do decide to buy 10% off your first purchase, offer code TWIT10.
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:51.480]   And just in case you're listening to this in November, just add a one.
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:52.480]   It's the month.
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:54.520]   So it's TWIT plus the number of the month.
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:56.400]   It'll be 11, December, it'll be 12.
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:57.400]   Spoiler.
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:39:59.040]   No, I know.
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:00.760]   I ruined it for you.
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:03.880]   Joseph Gordon-Levitt uses NSFW10 in looper.
[01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:05.240]   Oh, he's the best.
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:06.400]   TWIT10s rather.
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:07.400]   He is good.
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:08.760]   He is my favorite.
[01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:10.760]   He's the star of looper.
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:14.200]   And I thought he looked a little strange like they had changed him.
[01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:15.200]   They changed him.
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:16.200]   I thought they photoshopped him.
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:17.200]   Yeah.
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:18.200]   Well, they did it physically.
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:20.600]   Yeah, he wore his wearing a real long and photo show.
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:21.600]   He was making a movie in Photoshop.
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:22.600]   He did.
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:23.600]   You know what's funny?
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:25.360]   Didn't look more like Bruce Willis.
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:26.560]   I thought he said did.
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:27.560]   Did he?
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:31.960]   I thought it was fairly unnecessary because in movies we see that out of the time.
[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:32.960]   He's 30 years later.
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:33.960]   I didn't need to.
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:34.960]   I thought it was kind of cool.
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:35.960]   I thought it was a nice touch.
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:36.960]   Yeah.
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:37.960]   I thought it really helped.
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:38.960]   I don't know.
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:39.960]   I mean, whatever Ryan Johnson wanted to do, I was amazing.
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:40.960]   It was awesome.
[01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:41.960]   I agree.
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:42.960]   I love the movie.
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:43.960]   I know again.
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:46.560]   But at the same time, I just watched Warrior for the first time, which I loved.
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:47.560]   It's on Netflix.
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:51.760]   But it's got whatever's first name, Edgeworth and Tom Hardy and their brothers.
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:53.080]   And they look nothing alike.
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:55.760]   They literally have no physical or as I'm called to move.
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:56.760]   But you buy it.
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:41:00.440]   It's like, oh, you're saying that what his chin was too pointy?
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:02.240]   Wasn't big enough, I guess.
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:03.960]   It is eyebrows different.
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:05.200]   Is eyebrows more rigid?
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:06.200]   Yeah.
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:07.200]   Or cling online.
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:09.320]   I never realized how much did we grow?
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:13.920]   And Willis were alike until I saw Levitt doing a young Willis.
[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:16.640]   And I'm like, that could be a young De Niro.
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:19.000]   Then this.
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.160]   Now we're making a paradox.
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:23.040]   This is why you should watch Rainfrate because it's such a good job.
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:24.040]   Rainfrate.
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:26.040]   With Mom, Mom, Taryn.
[01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:29.520]   When we get that show on, I tell you, it's going to be good.
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:32.000]   It's the hot.
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.000]   Are ultra books dead?
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000]   No, they're not.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000]   Are not?
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.800]   I said they were dead.
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:38.760]   Well, this is the new meme, right?
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:40.400]   Are trend stories dead?
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:41.400]   Trend stories.
[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:42.400]   Yes.
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:43.400]   Are things dead?
[01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:44.560]   Dead?
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:46.040]   And then say no, it's not.
[01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:47.040]   Yeah.
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:48.040]   This is from the next web.
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:50.360]   Ultra books are dead?
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:52.520]   Then why are they out selling apples and tire line?
[01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:56.000]   Well, there was an MPD study, I guess, that they were reacting to at the next web.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.920]   I remember this now.
[01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:00.680]   There was a study out saying we're revising down our predictions.
[01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:04.480]   It might not have been MPD, but it was one of those maybe IH tech crunch headline.
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:05.480]   Remember ultra books?
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:06.720]   Yeah, that was a good time.
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:07.720]   I like ultra books.
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:09.600]   These are the windows version of the MacBook.
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:12.440]   So the study came out revising down saying we don't think ultra books are going to sell
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:14.040]   as well as we thought they are.
[01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:16.240]   They're not going to pick up until mid 2013.
[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:18.880]   TechCrunch wrote this article saying, yep, they're dead.
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:20.960]   Next web responded to that.
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:25.200]   But yeah, I mean, the problem is we don't know what an ultra book really is.
[01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:27.080]   It's just a thin light laptop.
[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:31.880]   And Intel is trying to define it so rigidly that certain things that we like, well, that
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:33.160]   should be an ultra book, right?
[01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:34.160]   It's not an ultra.
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:35.160]   That's foolish.
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:36.160]   Also, anything not with the tell.
[01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:38.760]   Remember when there was a distinction between laptop and notebook?
[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:39.760]   Yeah.
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:40.760]   Yeah.
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:41.760]   Yeah.
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:42.760]   It's a waste.
[01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:43.760]   It's a marketing.
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:44.760]   It's kids to the market or something to do.
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:46.800]   People like thin light laptops.
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:47.800]   Yeah.
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:50.520]   Some people want big heavy laptops, but most people want thin and light.
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:52.720]   That's actually a pretty big one, but you're running Linux on that one.
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:53.720]   Yeah, there's a 14.1.
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:55.000]   That's actually kind of cool.
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.120]   Three pound laptop.
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:58.680]   That's actually really cool because you're running.
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:42:59.680]   I love this.
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:00.680]   It's one to one.
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:01.680]   Yeah.
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:02.440]   It's a Boon to 12 for.
[01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:04.760]   You reviewed this on before you buy last week.
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:08.600]   That's speaking of which, you know what we should do is if you missed to it, we had some
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:10.720]   good stuff before you buy was great.
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:12.040]   Let's take a look.
[01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:14.800]   This is Twitter this week in law.
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:20.480]   This is simply the reason why we have so many artists who have been cheated blind signs
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:22.760]   and absolutely exploited.
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:27.520]   It's simply because they were just too stupid to make the right type of choices.
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:28.520]   Triangulation.
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:29.520]   That started out.
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:30.520]   They were laughing at fire.
[01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:33.720]   They were laughing at me and then they were laughing with me.
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:38.480]   And then when I went on the daily show to promote that first day, they loved it.
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:40.040]   I was laughing at them.
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:41.040]   Yes.
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:43.080]   Windows weekly.
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:45.680]   I got my invite.
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:49.080]   Microsoft invited me to the Windows launch.
[01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:52.240]   I shocked Gizwiz.
[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:58.240]   It's attached to me.
[01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:00.160]   I'm still, by the way, tight Elizabeth Marrow.
[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:01.160]   She's under the table.
[01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:02.400]   You never did.
[01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:04.040]   Mac Brake weekly.
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:05.400]   Will this change the world?
[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:07.320]   Only time will tell.
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:13.280]   If you missed this week on Twitter, you missed all the time.
[01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:16.640]   Now if you're listening, you probably didn't know, but that the guy we were talking about
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:19.560]   was John with John Hodgman.
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:21.360]   He was so great on triangulation.
[01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:24.760]   He's funny because usually we do it like we're doing with Veronica via Skype.
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:25.760]   He's in New York.
[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:26.760]   He's in Brooklyn.
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:28.040]   I came in and I didn't expect.
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:29.200]   I thought he was going to be on Skype.
[01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:30.600]   And there he is without shoes.
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:32.520]   And it was amazing.
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:33.520]   It was amazing.
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:36.640]   On Skype, you can't smell people's feet.
[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:37.640]   That would be great.
[01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:38.640]   He's a great narrator too.
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:40.640]   I was thinking to him on Nary, you're zero.
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:41.640]   He did you're zero right now.
[01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:42.640]   Yeah, he's great.
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:44.760]   I love Hodgman.
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:46.240]   He signed our wall.
[01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:47.640]   We have a wall of fame.
[01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:49.080]   You all have signed it.
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:50.080]   And he signed it.
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:51.520]   He says, I was not here.
[01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:52.520]   John.
[01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:57.080]   Oh, also Judge John Hodgman is one of the funniest podcasts out there.
[01:44:57.080 --> 01:44:58.080]   Absolutely.
[01:44:58.080 --> 01:44:59.080]   On maximum fun.
[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:00.080]   It's great.
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:01.080]   I asked, I said, do you prepare?
[01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:02.080]   Do you know the question?
[01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:04.440]   He says, no, it's all ad lib.
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:07.160]   Just kind of out of nowhere.
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:09.200]   Should I buy a nest?
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:10.440]   Yes.
[01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:11.440]   Do you have a nest?
[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:12.440]   I do.
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:13.440]   What's a nest?
[01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:14.440]   I love it.
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:15.440]   It's a thermostat.
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:16.440]   Sit in.
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:17.440]   It's not important right now.
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:21.760]   Do you have the new nest or the old nest?
[01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:23.360]   I guess I have the old nest.
[01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:24.800]   Yeah, there's a new nest now.
[01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:25.800]   But it's great.
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:28.480]   You can control it with your phone or your tablet.
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:29.480]   And it works, right?
[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:31.160]   And it works fantastically.
[01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:34.560]   It took us about 10 minutes to set the whole thing up.
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:35.560]   And it's great.
[01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:36.560]   I'm so glad we have it.
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:37.560]   It senses when you're in the room.
[01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:40.640]   It can tell what kind of temperatures you prefer to have.
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:44.920]   It automatically adjusts the heat depending on the time of day or the air conditioning
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:46.440]   if you have it.
[01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:47.440]   And it works wonderfully.
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:52.040]   And it does save you money too because when you're home, it can turn off the heat automatically
[01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:53.560]   and then it senses how does it know?
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:55.040]   It sees movement.
[01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:57.080]   It tracks movement.
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:46:01.360]   Or you can set it on a particular clock also on a schedule.
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:03.240]   Your cats don't fool it.
[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:04.240]   Trigger it.
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:06.680]   Too high up for them to see the cats.
[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:08.480]   So that's a good point.
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:11.360]   Although one day, one day I think they're going to get there.
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:12.720]   Yeah, the cats trying to be seen.
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:13.720]   The cats will figure it out.
[01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:15.480]   It's a little cold in here.
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:17.320]   Mr. Little Jeans is going to figure that out.
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:19.160]   He's working on it right now.
[01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:20.880]   Justin, he's not the smart one.
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:24.840]   Little Jeans is not that bright.
[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:29.240]   DVI Rack in our chat room says that Kevin Rose did a foundation with Tony Fadel, the
[01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:30.320]   guy who created Nest.
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:31.320]   That's cool.
[01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:32.320]   Off to watch that.
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:33.320]   Yeah, it's a cool company.
[01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:36.320]   He worked on the iPod for Apple and that's where he got his design sense.
[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:39.680]   The new Nest thermostat is apparently more compatible with more systems.
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:41.680]   It was fairly widespread before.
[01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:43.360]   But now it's like 98% of systems.
[01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:44.360]   I'm going to get it.
[01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:45.840]   That's really cool.
[01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:47.960]   If you rent, you might be thinking, "Well, I can't take care of it."
[01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:48.960]   I do rent.
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:53.120]   But even if you rent, you just take off the old thermostat, put the nest on, and when you
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:54.600]   leave, you can take the nest with you.
[01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:56.600]   They'll never know I nested it.
[01:46:56.600 --> 01:47:01.440]   It's really just a matter of they give you a really handy chart in the box when you open
[01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:02.600]   up your nest.
[01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:04.160]   And you can see which plugs.
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:07.800]   It's got like little stereo plugs, little clamps, and you just clamp it into the right
[01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:08.800]   spot and it works.
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:09.800]   Did you do it?
[01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:10.800]   I'd like to do it.
[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:11.800]   My landlord is a real jerk.
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:13.680]   Oh, yeah, don't do it at your place.
[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:14.680]   Yeah.
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:15.680]   He's just a real stickler.
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:17.960]   No, but I mean, you can't even tell that it's there.
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:19.760]   I mean, you have to use a little...
[01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:20.760]   Oh, I know.
[01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:21.760]   I think you'll know.
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:23.880]   You think you'll know?
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:25.360]   Is he there when you're not?
[01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:26.880]   You might be at this table.
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:27.880]   Surfing around.
[01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:30.200]   Your landlord is at the table?
[01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:31.920]   I rent Tom's apartment.
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:32.920]   Oh, right.
[01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:33.920]   I forgot about that.
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:35.480]   I thought, "Wait a minute.
[01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:37.320]   Do I have an inside baseball?"
[01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:38.320]   I know.
[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:40.080]   Who would I have got that?
[01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:41.360]   Can he put a nest in his...
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:42.360]   Of course, I don't...
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:43.360]   You can do it.
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:45.720]   This is a good conversation.
[01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:51.040]   So it's $250 bucks and it's available available October 4.
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:53.080]   I'm going to order it right now.
[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:54.080]   Look at that.
[01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:55.640]   I'm going to pre-order with one click.
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:56.640]   I'm not puppy.
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:47:57.640]   Primed it.
[01:47:57.640 --> 01:47:58.640]   It'll be here.
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:47:59.640]   It'll be here October 15.
[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:01.000]   Be here before the show's over.
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:02.160]   No, you know what?
[01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:04.320]   Amazon Prime is kind of starting to do that, aren't they?
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:05.320]   They're arriving the next day sometimes.
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:06.960]   I wish they would get in ridiculous.
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:09.880]   There's always those rumors that they're going to do like hour delivery or same day
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:10.880]   delivery.
[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:11.880]   I really wish they would.
[01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:13.120]   I think they're working in that way.
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:16.480]   Hey, by the way, we mentioned Steve Jobs passing as a year old.
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:20.120]   Did you know that the CD is 30 years old this week?
[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:21.360]   I did.
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:22.360]   Lance Bass told me.
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:24.600]   Did you celebrate in any way?
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:26.240]   Lance Bass of InSync?
[01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:27.240]   Yes.
[01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:28.240]   What do you mean?
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:29.240]   Wait a minute.
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:32.000]   Who was on Lance Bass's show on SiriusXM?
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:33.680]   And they mentioned that the CD was a year old.
[01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:34.680]   Lance Bass has a show?
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:35.680]   He does.
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:37.680]   Did you listen to?
[01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:38.680]   I was on it.
[01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:39.680]   No, I...
[01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:41.520]   Never on Lance Bass's show.
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:42.520]   I was.
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:43.520]   It was really fun.
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:45.920]   So you mean I am now two degrees of separation from InSync?
[01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:46.920]   Yeah.
[01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:47.920]   How cool.
[01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:48.920]   Awesome.
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:50.920]   Congratulations to all of us.
[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:56.680]   Well, by the way, they still have the most, the record for most CDs sold, most albums sold.
[01:48:56.680 --> 01:48:59.640]   I'm not officially an InSync expert because of some shows.
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:03.400]   Did you know this is the anniversary of IBM building the first calculating machine to
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:05.880]   use solid state transistors instead of vacuum two?
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:06.880]   That's cool.
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:07.880]   Today, October 7th.
[01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:08.880]   Do you still do this weekend?
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:13.080]   I do tech history today on my blog and I've got a chronology of tech history that I'm
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:14.080]   about to publish.
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:15.440]   You know the nice thing about that?
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:17.040]   Every year you just reuse last year's.
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:18.040]   I know.
[01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:19.040]   Right?
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:20.040]   I'm into October.
[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:21.040]   It's like, "Here we go again."
[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:22.040]   It's easy.
[01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:23.040]   It's crazy.
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:24.040]   You got to add some.
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:25.040]   You got to...
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:26.040]   Did anything important happen today now?
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:27.040]   All right.
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:28.040]   That was the problem.
[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:30.760]   You know, I did that in the first tech almanac or the second one, I think.
[01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:31.760]   And that was the problem.
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:33.720]   There were some days, nothing really interesting.
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:36.200]   It took me two years to really come up with three important things for again.
[01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:39.440]   We ended up doing things like today the packing peanut was invented.
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:43.960]   That's why you do this day in alternate history on days and nights.
[01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:46.360]   What should have been invented today but wasn't?
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:49.760]   Today, Englishman Ralph Wedgewood received the first patent on carbon paper.
[01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:51.600]   Okay, so you were obviously...
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:52.600]   Oh Wedgewood.
[01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:53.600]   Yeah, that's...
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:55.880]   Yeah, he was a rogue, wasn't he?
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:56.880]   He was.
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:49:57.880]   What a card!
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:07.400]   I came to that panoply of crazy jobs.
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:09.040]   So the first CD player...
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:11.040]   First CD player.
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:16.680]   Hey, Tom, did you know the first CD players were announced in Japan in 1982?
[01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:17.680]   Yeah.
[01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:20.360]   Look at the size of those.
[01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:22.200]   You wouldn't really want to carry that around with you.
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:24.840]   I came after a laser test.
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:25.840]   Lasers.
[01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:28.640]   I bought my first CD in 1984, two years later.
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:30.440]   So that was October 1st.
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:31.600]   Yeah.
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:34.680]   My first CD was Roxy Music's Avalon.
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:37.600]   My first CD was Jerry Harrison's Revit Up.
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:41.000]   I love Jerry Harrison's keyboardist of Talking Heads.
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.400]   My first CD was Dookie by Green Day.
[01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:48.800]   My first CD was the self-titled Ace of Base.
[01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:50.360]   Is that...
[01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:51.360]   I don't believe you.
[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:52.360]   For real.
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:53.360]   I don't believe you.
[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:54.360]   That's an absolute truth.
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:59.280]   The CDP101 sold for 168,000 yen in 1982.
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:05.320]   And you could only get Billy Joel's 52nd Street on CD when it first came out.
[01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:06.320]   That's really good.
[01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:08.320]   It was a few weeks before I stayed.
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:11.320]   No, that's the remix.
[01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:12.320]   I know.
[01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:15.120]   I actually don't have the rights to play.
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:17.120]   I was not Billy Joel.
[01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:19.360]   I can only play the 8-bit Ace of Base.
[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:20.360]   There we go.
[01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:21.360]   They saw the sign.
[01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:23.680]   Leo saw the takedown notice from YouTube.
[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:31.360]   You know, I just want to say, we ran a Chipotle ad a year ago in a This Week in Google.
[01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:35.280]   We were talking about Chipotle and we ran one of their ads because it was an interesting
[01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:36.280]   ad.
[01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:40.280]   A year later, they took us off YouTube because they added it to the content ID database.
[01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:41.280]   Oh.
[01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:43.800]   A year later, they didn't add it until a year later.
[01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:46.040]   And then the content ID database sent fly.
[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:48.320]   And it wasn't one of those, oh, this isn't going to ding you.
[01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:49.320]   We just want to put an ad in there.
[01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:50.840]   It was like, no, take it down.
[01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:53.640]   And that, well, you know, they just changed the policy.
[01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:54.800]   I'm waiting for that.
[01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:55.800]   So what does that mean?
[01:51:55.800 --> 01:52:01.240]   So essentially, what they've done is roll the DMCA into YouTube's policy before it was
[01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:02.240]   all an internal policy.
[01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:03.840]   So they take you down before you post it.
[01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:10.160]   There was no negative to someone posting a takedown claim on you because there was no
[01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:12.200]   part of it was all internal to YouTube.
[01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:14.920]   There was no, it was not part of the legal DMCA.
[01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:21.640]   So what YouTube has done is said, if content ID flags you as infringing, first of all,
[01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:25.640]   we're going to try to do a better job of catching uses that aren't infringing.
[01:52:25.640 --> 01:52:32.840]   And second of all, if you dispute it, the content owner has to file a formal digital
[01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:37.680]   Millennium Copyright Act notice to get you taken down the second time.
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:40.640]   And if that's frivolous, then there are damages associated with that.
[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:41.640]   But if it's not, then you go to jail.
[01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:43.160]   And you can file a counter takedown notice.
[01:52:43.160 --> 01:52:44.160]   The way I then go to jail.
[01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:46.160]   And after that, it goes to court.
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:47.160]   Yeah.
[01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:48.440]   And then they can build up fines.
[01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:50.560]   So John, did they put us back up?
[01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:52.560]   We filed a counter claim.
[01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:54.360]   I think they put us back up.
[01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:58.120]   So instead of, because what it used to be is like, you'd hit the content ID, your video
[01:52:58.120 --> 01:53:01.360]   would go down, you'd file a dispute, it'd go back up, and then the content owner would
[01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:03.040]   go, no, and it'd go right back down.
[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:04.040]   And that would be it.
[01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:05.040]   Like you wouldn't have any recourse.
[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:07.840]   Now the content owner has to go, well, wait a minute.
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:10.680]   I could be legally liable if I'm wrong here.
[01:53:10.680 --> 01:53:14.800]   So let me make sure that this is really an infringing use rather than just blanket saying
[01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:16.200]   note everything.
[01:53:16.200 --> 01:53:24.320]   Yeah, because it was weird because it was Chipotle, Sony, and some Brazilian television
[01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:25.800]   station.
[01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:28.480]   And I'm pretty sure that we didn't infringe on a Brazilian television station.
[01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:30.200]   Well, not the other problem with content ID.
[01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:34.000]   Like, if you include anything in your video and then you add your video to the content
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:37.960]   ID, then now every video that was in your video is now in content ID as own owned by you.
[01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:39.640]   That's how NASA got taken down.
[01:53:39.640 --> 01:53:41.640]   In Portuguese or wearing a phone.
[01:53:41.640 --> 01:53:50.680]   I just looked at the chat in our spreadsheet and says, Chad, mouse on my face.
[01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:52.240]   Yeah, there was a mouse on my face.
[01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:53.240]   Chatroom told me.
[01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:55.080]   But Chad got rid of the mouse on your face.
[01:53:55.080 --> 01:53:57.080]   No, no, it's lurking in the corner.
[01:53:57.080 --> 01:53:58.080]   Where?
[01:53:58.080 --> 01:53:59.080]   Look at that.
[01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:00.080]   It's a little mouse.
[01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:01.080]   No, no, there's another one over there.
[01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:02.080]   There's mice all over the place.
[01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:03.080]   Oh my God.
[01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:04.080]   It's in the station.
[01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:06.080]   Whenever you see two, that means that there's hundreds in the wall.
[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:07.240]   All right, SpaceX is starting its feet.
[01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:08.880]   So let's quickly wrap this up.
[01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:10.520]   First with a word from stamps.com.
[01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:13.520]   If you do not want to go to the post office, again, you do not need to.
[01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:17.480]   You can print postage right from your computer using your computer and your printer.
[01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:19.760]   This should not be a revelation if you've been watching our shows.
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:22.200]   But then you can't get working dogs.
[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:24.160]   You know what's better than that?
[01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:27.040]   You could put your dog on stamps.
[01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:29.320]   Oh, I don't have a dog.
[01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:30.320]   Yeah.
[01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:35.560]   Well, my dogs, Mr. Lane jeans or whatever the hell your cat's name is.
[01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:36.560]   What's his name, Mr. Green?
[01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:37.560]   Little jeans.
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:38.560]   Little jeans.
[01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:41.200]   That's apparently the dumb one.
[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:42.200]   There's a genius cat.
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:45.320]   Wouldn't you like a Mr. Little jeans stamp?
[01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:46.320]   Yes.
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:49.320]   Well, yes, you would forget working dogs.
[01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:55.400]   All of a sudden she's rather have the Little jeans stamp and you can make that with stamps.com.
[01:54:55.400 --> 01:54:56.760]   How about that?
[01:54:56.760 --> 01:54:58.360]   You can print your own envelopes.
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:00.320]   You could print international postage.
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:01.920]   By the way, they fill out the forms for you.
[01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:02.920]   Makes it a lot easier.
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:03.920]   You get discounts.
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:04.920]   You don't get it.
[01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:07.720]   Because the post office is saving money because you're not going there.
[01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:11.040]   You're mailing everything with stamps.com and the mail carrier comes and gets it.
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:15.480]   Even if it's not in their schedule, you can see if you're in New Zealand, which is they
[01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:17.560]   had this, we do.
[01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:18.560]   We have this.
[01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:19.840]   You don't have this in New Zealand.
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:20.840]   They have better rugby.
[01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:21.840]   Yeah.
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:22.840]   And the Hobbit.
[01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:24.640]   They have the Hobbit, but they don't have stamps.com.
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:25.640]   No.
[01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:27.240]   Not that I'd want to make a trade.
[01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:28.240]   I think we're fine.
[01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:29.240]   We're fine.
[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:30.240]   Let's leave it the way it is.
[01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:31.240]   I don't know.
[01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:32.240]   If they give us Monteiths.
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:36.000]   When is the Hobbit coming out?
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:37.000]   December.
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:38.000]   December.
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:41.920]   This year of 2013, the first of the three is coming out in December.
[01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:42.920]   Go to stamps.com.
[01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:45.480]   Click the microphone in the upper right hand corner.
[01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:46.720]   I don't want the $80 offer.
[01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:47.720]   Say I want more.
[01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:48.720]   We've got a nice picture of you.
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:51.760]   Enter the offer code TWIT.
[01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:53.280]   That's spelled T-W-I-T.
[01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:55.200]   And yeah, there it is.
[01:55:55.200 --> 01:55:57.080]   Leel, report listeners.
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:55:58.080]   Welcome.
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:55:59.080]   Welcome.
[01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:00.920]   It's now $110 bonus offer.
[01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:03.120]   You get $55 in postage.
[01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:05.120]   You get the Mr. Little Gene stamp.
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:06.600]   You get a free digital scale.
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:08.280]   You get a $5 supply kit.
[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:11.560]   You get a Mr. Little Gene stamp and a four week trial.
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:13.120]   Look at that horse.
[01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:15.840]   Mr. Little Gene stamp not included.
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:17.760]   Now in all areas.
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:22.160]   You know, Mr. Little Gene stamp available where legal.
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:24.680]   We're allowed, which is nowhere.
[01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:27.600]   You have to call Veronica at her home and she will make you one.
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:30.400]   Because she's going to get stamps.com too.
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:33.040]   You will post a picture of Mr. Little Gene's for which you can use.
[01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:35.080]   You can make a stamp as your stamp.
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:36.080]   I want to do that.
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:37.080]   I want to do that.
[01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:40.240]   People will be mailing Mr. Little Gene's everywhere in the world.
[01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:41.800]   Will you do that Veronica on your blog?
[01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:42.800]   That's awesome.
[01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:45.040]   What's your blog address?
[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:47.560]   Oh, I don't ever blog on my blog anymore.
[01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:48.560]   No, but you will on this one.
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:49.560]   It's going to be on the dollar.com.
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:50.560]   I'll put something up.
[01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:51.560]   Put it on your about me.
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:52.560]   OK.
[01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:53.560]   Mr. Little Gene's.
[01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:55.280]   But I'll put it on my blog.
[01:56:55.280 --> 01:56:56.280]   OK.
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:56:58.720]   Tweet it.
[01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:00.160]   Whatever you kids do, do something.
[01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:03.160]   Do me a favor and say the picture of your cat.
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:05.200]   I know it sounds crazy.
[01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:08.680]   I would like a picture of your cat Veronica.
[01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:10.680]   Do you have one?
[01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:11.960]   Oh, I have many.
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:13.120]   Stamps.com.
[01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:16.600]   Use the offer code TWIT and you, I promise, you will love it.
[01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:21.200]   Especially if you do a lot of mailing, like your eBay or Amazon sellers or Etsy too.
[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:22.880]   It incorporates it right in there.
[01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:24.040]   Love it.
[01:57:24.040 --> 01:57:27.360]   Hey, we got to go to space.
[01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:28.360]   We got to go to space.
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:29.360]   We have to re-supply.
[01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:30.360]   Absolutely.
[01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:33.120]   It's the first civilian cargo flight.
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:34.120]   Yeah.
[01:57:34.120 --> 01:57:37.400]   So it's a private cargo trip up to the International Space Station.
[01:57:37.400 --> 01:57:44.200]   But really, the bigger picture on this is the idea that it is kind of space as an API.
[01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:49.880]   And that idea kind of becoming more of a reality that now that we would have a commercial
[01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:53.960]   entity like SpaceX and there's a couple others that are coming up behind it that would regularly
[01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:57.200]   send rockets into space.
[01:57:57.200 --> 01:58:01.440]   They can go, now that you have a fixed cost, it just opens up a whole different world.
[01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:03.360]   Okay, Canaveral becomes a spaceport.
[01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:05.120]   Yeah, like an airport.
[01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:06.600]   Absolutely operated by the space.
[01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:08.600]   Are you okay Veronica?
[01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:09.600]   Space.
[01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:10.600]   Space.
[01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:11.600]   Space.
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:12.600]   Space.
[01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:13.600]   Space.
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:14.600]   Space.
[01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:15.600]   From Port.
[01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:19.200]   I love the confidence in the impression.
[01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:20.920]   I miss Veronica.
[01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:22.920]   I miss you so much.
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:24.920]   Oh, SpaceX.com.
[01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:27.280]   So space, we're seeing.
[01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:30.920]   So this is going to be part of, we're going to do, it's a weird things podcast.
[01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:31.920]   Yeah.
[01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:36.040]   But we are going to have Justin Robert Young and Tom Merritt in studio.
[01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:40.960]   Andrew Maine live at Cape Canaveral and Brian Brushwood will join us from mission control
[01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:41.960]   in Austin.
[01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:42.960]   He's going to mission control.
[01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:44.960]   No, I mean his house.
[01:58:44.960 --> 01:58:45.960]   Oh.
[01:58:45.960 --> 01:58:47.960]   And that's exciting.
[01:58:47.960 --> 01:58:51.800]   And its team line is 29 and counting, so we want to get out of here.
[01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:53.360]   I want to thank you for being here.
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:56.960]   Justin Robert Young, NSFW, the show, watch.
[01:58:56.960 --> 01:58:59.920]   He's also a star of many Bollywood hits.
[01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:03.160]   So we just say to you and all of your friends, Jai Ho.
[01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:04.960]   I don't, I think that's racist.
[01:59:04.960 --> 01:59:05.960]   That's not racist.
[01:59:05.960 --> 01:59:10.200]   No, people say, I didn't say, we say to all of your friends, Jai Ho.
[01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:12.000]   That would be racist.
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:13.640]   Now that's racist.
[01:59:13.640 --> 01:59:19.320]   Also Mr. Tom Merritt, also known as mom, Tarett, the star of rain freight.
[01:59:19.320 --> 01:59:20.320]   We love you.
[01:59:20.320 --> 01:59:26.720]   And we want everybody to go watch Tech Tues today, every Monday through Tuesday, and then
[01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:30.560]   Wednesday, Thursday and Friday to at 10 a.m. Pacific Eastern.
[01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:32.880]   It's about, you know, 1 p.m.
[01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:35.120]   1700 UTC Monday through Friday.
[01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:36.120]   It's your daily dose of techno.
[01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:39.400]   It's really, it makes it unnecessary to listen to whatever again.
[01:59:39.400 --> 01:59:41.240]   You listen to Twitter for fun.
[01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:42.240]   Listen to tech.
[01:59:42.240 --> 01:59:43.240]   That's pretty much true.
[01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:45.240]   There's no news here.
[01:59:45.240 --> 01:59:46.240]   There's news.
[01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:47.240]   It's analysis.
[01:59:47.240 --> 01:59:48.240]   It's a good time.
[01:59:48.240 --> 01:59:49.240]   It's pretty good.
[01:59:49.240 --> 01:59:50.240]   It's pretty good.
[01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:51.240]   It's good.
[01:59:51.240 --> 01:59:53.240]   And Mr. Little Genes.
[01:59:53.240 --> 01:59:54.240]   Veronica Belmont.
[01:59:54.240 --> 01:59:55.840]   He's right here right now.
[01:59:55.840 --> 01:59:56.840]   Techzilla.com.
[01:59:56.840 --> 01:59:58.760]   Sward and laser.
[01:59:58.760 --> 02:00:00.640]   Anything else you want to plug?
[02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:04.120]   Yeah, I got a new show called Factor Fictional on youtube.com/techfeed.
[02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:05.120]   Ooh.
[02:00:05.120 --> 02:00:06.120]   For Division 3.
[02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:07.120]   Oh.
[02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:08.120]   It's a new episode.
[02:00:08.120 --> 02:00:09.120]   It's up on Mondays.
[02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:11.000]   What's it about?
[02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:16.160]   It's about all the technology in your favorite TV shows, movies, video games, comic books,
[02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:18.480]   and if it's real and if it's not real, why not?
[02:00:18.480 --> 02:00:23.320]   And we talked to experts about in their field about that kind of stuff.
[02:00:23.320 --> 02:00:24.320]   How cool.
[02:00:24.320 --> 02:00:25.320]   When did you launch that?
[02:00:25.320 --> 02:00:26.320]   I didn't even know about that.
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:31.880]   We put up a first little teaser episode last Monday, but we'll have another episode up either
[02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:33.040]   Monday or Tuesday this week.
[02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:34.040]   I think Monday.
[02:00:34.040 --> 02:00:36.320]   And is it just you or are there others involved?
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:38.600]   Yeah, it's me and the guests.
[02:00:38.600 --> 02:00:41.200]   But we may have other people pop in time to time.
[02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:44.000]   So you bring in experts who will explain, you know.
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:45.000]   Right.
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:48.080]   Like, for example, I like hoverboards.
[02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:49.080]   Like why don't we have hoverboards?
[02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:50.600]   Yeah, where are we with that?
[02:00:50.600 --> 02:00:51.600]   Where are those?
[02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:52.600]   Yeah.
[02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:53.600]   Yeah.
[02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:54.600]   That kind of stuff.
[02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:55.600]   Okay.
[02:00:55.600 --> 02:00:57.400]   I still think you should change the name of the sounds legit.
[02:00:57.400 --> 02:00:58.400]   Sounds legit.
[02:00:58.400 --> 02:00:59.400]   I like that.
[02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:00.400]   Cool.
[02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:01.760]   Well, we'll be watching that too.
[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:02.760]   Thank you Veronica Belmont.
[02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:04.240]   Thank you for having me.
[02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:05.240]   It was fun.
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:06.240]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:10.800]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern, 2200 UTC.
[02:01:10.800 --> 02:01:12.040]   But you know, you don't have it.
[02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:13.720]   It's nice if you watch live because then we can interact.
[02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:15.200]   Oh, they turned me off.
[02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:16.680]   What happened?
[02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:17.680]   Hello.
[02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:19.160]   Am I still on?
[02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:21.160]   Yeah, you're still on the stream over there.
[02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:23.120]   Oh, what happened here?
[02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:25.680]   Oh, chat with us, Ron.
[02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:27.360]   I'm on fire.
[02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:29.280]   That's what I'm on.
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:30.280]   Literally.
[02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:31.280]   We do.
[02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:32.520]   I think my I'm sorry Liz.
[02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:33.520]   We're almost done.
[02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:34.520]   Poor Liz Romero.
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:38.480]   She never we never did get entangled.
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:40.240]   What was I saying?
[02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:43.400]   Watch the show live if you can because you know, well, then we can see you in the chat
[02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:44.400]   room.
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:49.480]   But if you don't, you can always get on demand audio and video after the fact on Twitter.tv
[02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:53.960]   or via iTunes or wherever else you get your podcasts.
[02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:55.560]   We got two more days in the t-shirt.
[02:01:55.560 --> 02:01:57.520]   I should mention that.
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:03.440]   If you have we are we actually this is going to I think we're going to raise enough money
[02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:05.440]   to buy country.
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:06.440]   The country.
[02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:07.440]   Liz, her freedom.
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:08.440]   Liz, her freedom.
[02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:09.440]   No, Tensepation.
[02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:15.400]   We want to buy a thing called the elemental that will make our streaming more reliable.
[02:02:15.400 --> 02:02:17.040]   But it's how much?
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:18.040]   We have four days.
[02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:19.040]   Oh, the elemental?
[02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:20.040]   I'm not sure.
[02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:21.040]   Twenty five thousand.
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:22.040]   That's what we really expect.
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:23.200]   It's actually level fifty two.
[02:02:23.200 --> 02:02:26.600]   It's also an esper that you need a chocobot to get to.
[02:02:26.600 --> 02:02:28.520]   That's exactly whatever he said.
[02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:33.920]   So here if you go to teespring.com/twit is our t-shirt.
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:37.760]   We have five days in one hour left.
[02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:39.680]   And we have seventeen hundred seventy two sold.
[02:02:39.680 --> 02:02:42.320]   If we can get to two thousand I think that pays for the elemental.
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:46.120]   Yeah, go ahead and buy that a fire elemental or a water element.
[02:02:46.120 --> 02:02:49.120]   It's a box that you plug in and then all the streams come out of it.
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:50.280]   Do you know what we're doing right now?
[02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:54.760]   We're running wire casts on one computer to an hour crash.
[02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:58.320]   We have scripts running so that if it crashes it restarts.
[02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:00.040]   So that if it didn't something goes wrong.
[02:03:00.040 --> 02:03:02.240]   If there's an error message there's a script.
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:04.480]   But it does it's kind of a beautiful piece of hackery.
[02:03:04.480 --> 02:03:06.240]   It's hacked like crazy.
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:07.240]   Yeah.
[02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:08.240]   You get a real thing.
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:11.160]   This is what Google uses is what a lot of smart people do.
[02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:12.280]   Although look at those docs.
[02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:13.640]   How good is it going for them?
[02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:15.440]   Ah well, they don't use it for Google docs.
[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:16.560]   They just use it for YouTube.
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:20.440]   So go to teespring.com/twit and pick up a t-shirt.
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:21.440]   You get it by the way.
[02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:22.440]   It's a smart shirt.
[02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:24.040]   American apparel or fruit of the loom.
[02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:26.080]   And exclusive we'll never sell it again.
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:27.640]   And once it's over it's over.
[02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:28.960]   We're never going to make that again.
[02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:31.360]   The next thing's not even going to be a t-shirt by the way.
[02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:33.320]   I've been talking to the boss.
[02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:35.320]   We're thinking of selling pork by hats.
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:37.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:40.360]   Instead of a feather, you get a little twit logo.
[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:42.120]   But you have to wear it like this.
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:42.920]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:44.000]   We'll see you next time.
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:45.000]   Another twit.
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:46.000]   Damn.
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:52.000]   Do the twist, baby. Do the twist.
