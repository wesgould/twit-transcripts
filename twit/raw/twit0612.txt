[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.860]   'cause some of my favorite people are on
[00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.140]   David and her Hard War as your senior editor at Engadget.
[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.980]   - Hello.
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.060]   - Hi, Devendra.
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.900]   Howdy.
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.740]   - How's tricks?
[00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.580]   - How you doing?
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.900]   - I'm just going with fine over here.
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.740]   - I love your office.
[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.180]   - I'm the TriBekka Film Festival.
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.340]   Yeah, this is my pile of books and other gadgets.
[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.260]   - Is your office chair, which looks very fancy,
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.220]   is it the same one as in Silicon Valley?
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.060]   - I don't think so.
[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.460]   No, this is the Ikea one.
[00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.580]   If you look in the wire cutter,
[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.220]   this is the step down like $200 office chair.
[00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.900]   The one they really recommend is like $800.
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.740]   I'm not gonna spend that.
[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.900]   - You know what, Ashley is Quetha knows.
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.060]   - Yes, yes.
[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.180]   - knows she's left in a knowing way.
[00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.420]   Hi, Ashley, good to see you.
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.100]   - Hi, good to see you.
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.100]   It's good to see everybody.
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.420]   Hello.
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.820]   - I'm thinking of that chair and actually,
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.460]   what's his name is inherited it?
[00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.060]   It used to be the other guys.
[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.740]   - I don't know.
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.580]   - It's like the iron throne.
[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.620]   - It used to be a top-loss piece chair.
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.460]   Yeah.
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.300]   (laughs)
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.700]   There's a whole article on Forbes.
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.540]   Look at this one.
[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.740]   This is a $5,000 chair.
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:23.980]   - Oh yeah, I've tried that out.
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:24.820]   I've tried that out.
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.900]   - I've seen a picture of you and this looks like
[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.900]   you can get dental work while you're playing.
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.620]   - I'm gonna tell you, I did not enjoy this sensation
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.860]   of having a chair lean backwards and recline
[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.060]   while a monitor was over my face
[00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.020]   because I know how I feel when I accidentally drop my phone
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.220]   on my face when I'm laying down and tired.
[00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.260]   So just the idea of,
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.340]   I think coming crashing down and slamming me in the face
[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.740]   is not great.
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:53.580]   I don't love it.
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.380]   And also, I don't wanna work laying down.
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.940]   I wanna take a nap when I'm laying down.
[00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.940]   - So Richard Hendricks got action Jack Barker's chair.
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.420]   It's kind of, but apparently it's real.
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.660]   This is a real chair, man.
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:09.500]   - Yeah.
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.740]   It's a real chair from Scandinavian Designs
[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.580]   and it's not that expensive.
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.620]   It's only $499.
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.180]   It's called the Wow Desk chair.
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.300]   Wow.
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.220]   - That's a bargain.
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.140]   - Look at that.
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.780]   I think, Devindra, you should run out and get it.
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:24.620]   - I should.
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.460]   - Wouldn't you look good in there?
[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.300]   - Right in.
[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.580]   Look at the nice color scheme there.
[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.540]   That's beautiful.
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.980]   It's interesting to look at.
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.820]   I like it.
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.100]   - And it's got a good name though.
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.940]   Wow.
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.700]   Hey also with this Greg Farrow from the Packet Pushers
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.300]   network, Greg was giving us a lesson
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.900]   in how internet infrastructure works
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.980]   in the 21st century before the show.
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:45.940]   I'm sorry, you didn't hear it.
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.300]   He's at ethereal mind on Twitter.
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.100]   Great to have you back.
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.260]   - Thanks so much, Leo.
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.580]   Sorry, I couldn't get there today.
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.900]   I just want to point out that I do have a chair,
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.460]   fancy chair, but I bought it second hand.
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.540]   - Oh, what kind do you have?
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.020]   - What kind do you have?
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.780]   - It's a Herman Miller Airon.
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:03.620]   - Oh, it's an Airon.
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.540]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.380]   Yeah.
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.220]   - Oh, that's so $1999.
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.140]   - Yeah, but I bought it second hand.
[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.900]   So eBay back in the days when eBay was workable.
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.460]   I just started up this going out of business
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.500]   and buy all their chairs.
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.460]   - If you are in the San Francisco Bay area,
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.180]   you can have all of this for the enemies on the dollar.
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.900]   - Any startup that goes out of business,
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:25.900]   just show up.
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.100]   - Show up, they'll give it to you.
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.900]   - Let me assure you that if I was in the Silicon Valley area,
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.220]   I couldn't afford to live there.
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.380]   - Well, that's right.
[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.380]   There's benefits and--
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.420]   - Your house would in fact be that chair.
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.740]   That's literally it.
[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.660]   - Yeah, there'd be a meter of either side.
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.740]   That would be about all I could afford.
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.180]   I looked into it several times,
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.540]   but I've never been able to.
[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.900]   I just can't afford to live there.
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.420]   I'd sit so way too expensive.
[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.260]   - Oh, but we love it here, don't we?
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.100]   - Actually, I forget.
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.780]   Are you in LA, aren't you?
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.460]   - Definitely, I'm not in San Francisco, I'm in LA.
[00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.580]   - Yeah.
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.140]   We're all that real TV people are.
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.980]   - That's right.
[00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:59.820]   - And Divenders in New York.
[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.260]   And today, Greg's joining us from the UK.
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.540]   Where in England?
[00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.300]   - Chiltonum, in the center, just near GCHQ.
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.900]   They're probably tuning us right.
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:09.740]   - Nice.
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.580]   (laughs)
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.340]   - Nice, good to have them.
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.180]   - I'm glad it's the international show today.
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.020]   - It is great.
[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.860]   - It's a great location.
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.060]   - I love that.
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.940]   That's thank you, Skype.
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.380]   So, this was the week of earnings Amazon
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.980]   and Microsoft and Google via its alphabet.
[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.980]   And all three of them actually did very well in the cloud.
[00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.900]   This was the quarter that cloud showed its strength.
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.260]   Both at Amazon.
[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.500]   Now Amazon, you can't really judge from,
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.900]   because Jeff Bezos has a big knob or a lever
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.260]   or something in his office.
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.860]   It has profit on one side and debit on the other.
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.340]   And he decides exactly how much he wants to make
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.780]   in any given quarter.
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.340]   Total net income up to 724 million, a million, a million.
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.340]   With an M, million, nothing.
[00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.900]   Nothing.
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.420]   But a lot of it from a cloud.
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:05.140]   Microsoft's Azure cloud business grew 93% year over year.
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.780]   Almost doubled year over year.
[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.780]   And that made a big difference in Microsoft's bottom line.
[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.660]   A Google, which makes, of course, most of its money
[00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.820]   in advertising and made a huge amount in advertising,
[00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.100]   still did pretty well with the cloud platform.
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.540]   They said in their analyst call,
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.220]   poor at their CFO said,
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.140]   the fastest growing business,
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.180]   one of the companies, fastest growing businesses
[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.740]   was the Google cloud platform.
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.940]   Although really Google, you wanna hear numbers.
[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:39.180]   Google's ad revenue has doubled since 2012.
[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.740]   In 2016, it had 32.8% of the total ad revenue.
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.180]   But that total, let me see if I find the number,
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:52.020]   just a massive profit for Google.
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:56.860]   And big growth, I think almost 20% growth over this year,
[00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.700]   last quarter this year.
[00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.220]   So yeah, big big business.
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.340]   Big big business.
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.180]   Big big business.
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.420]   - Well, you know, they gotta make all that money
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.220]   so that they can, so that Larry Page
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.060]   can make a lot of flying jet skis.
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.780]   - Really, really compelling.
[00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.060]   - You kinda wonder how much Larry and Sergey
[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.340]   are really involved day to day right now.
[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.220]   - Sergey's like, we gotta make lots of money
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.460]   'cause I need an airship.
[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.380]   - He's building a blimp.
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.460]   - A blimp?
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.860]   I need it.
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.140]   And we gotta just make that money.
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.700]   - So why is it that rich middle-aged men go to,
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.140]   they fly their own planes or make their own plane.
[00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.260]   They've always gotta get into flying, right?
[00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.900]   How many times do you wake up in the morning
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.460]   and read the news and, you know,
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.460]   55 year-old so-and-so was flying.
[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.460]   He's playing from here to there and crushed it.
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.860]   - It's flying or it's yachts.
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.140]   And then if you're a yachtsman,
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.820]   there's a couple of things you do.
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.500]   We worked for Paul Allen when we worked at Tech TV.
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.260]   And very famously, he built a submarine in his yacht.
[00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.740]   And so apparently there's companies
[00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.460]   that make submarines for rich people.
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.060]   I don't mean like little submersibles.
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.900]   I mean submarines.
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:03.740]   And-
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.420]   - How else are they gonna play battleship, Leo?
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:10.660]   - So yachts are for billionaires.
[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:11.500]   - Yeah.
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.380]   - Million ass play with planes, right?
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.980]   You've gotta get it right, right?
[00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.900]   If you go down onto the French Riviera
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.260]   or down onto the Greek islands,
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.540]   you can see all the yachts pulled up.
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:23.100]   And some of them have not just the submarine,
[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.220]   but two tenders, so two little boats as well.
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.780]   So that if they come into the harbor
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.340]   and they wanna go to the other side of the harbor,
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.180]   they get in the boat and drive across the harbor.
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.700]   They don't walk around or catch a taxi.
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.700]   They get a special boat put out over the side.
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.140]   - I'm just waiting for the flying boats.
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:38.420]   Like it's a lot of people.
[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:39.260]   - Flying boats, yeah.
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.460]   Where's the my flying pontoon jet ski?
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.060]   That's, I mean, obviously-
[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.660]   - The funniest thing was we were told
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.060]   that Paul Allen built his boat with a submarine in the belly
[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.780]   because he didn't like to jump when he scuba-dived.
[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.980]   He didn't like to jump in the water.
[00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:53.820]   - Aw.
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.300]   - He liked to emerge into the water.
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.620]   So, gotta have-
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:00.540]   - Make it so.
[00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:01.380]   - Make it so.
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:02.540]   - No words, yeah.
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.500]   - I mean, look, if I was a Silicon Valley billionaire,
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.500]   along in the vein of a Bill Gates or a Jeff Bezos,
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.620]   I mean, look, the rocket stuff I get,
[00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.100]   like let's all go to space.
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.420]   But also, I'd be putting so much money
[00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.380]   into having robot servants,
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.980]   like human-oid robots or that's the thing I want.
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:25.060]   That's the sign of true wealth
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.940]   to have little robot servers that look just like you.
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.700]   You make like a little bunch of robot clones
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.580]   walking around your house like,
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.060]   "Hello Ashley, so nice to see you today.
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.180]   "Oh, hi Ashley, thank you.
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.740]   "I thank you, I do look fabulous."
[00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.860]   Like, yes, that's what I want.
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.260]   - Here's an article, it's a little dated,
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.380]   it's from a couple of years back.
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:44.180]   The world's most expensive luxury submarines.
[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:48.060]   And the best one here at the bottom is called the Phoenix.
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.380]   It's an only $80 million, 10 bedrooms,
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.460]   a gymnasium wine cellar, Jacuzzi,
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:58.460]   operates at 1,000 feet, 213 feet long, 5,000.
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.540]   - This is how big still in business.
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.100]   - Yeah, that doesn't really exist.
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.060]   That's the one-
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.060]   - They only need to sell one.
[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.620]   - They're like, "Look guys, we just got to sell one.
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:06.700]   "That's all we got to do."
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.340]   - How about the Seattle?
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.180]   It's 108. - It's a little more render.
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.540]   - They're renders, well, because how many people?
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.060]   - Because no one's ever ordered one.
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:14.900]   - You think?
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.580]   - These things don't make it so many bills.
[00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.420]   - You know what guys?
[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:19.260]   - That's right.
[00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.180]   - 'Cause they're submarines and we've never seen them.
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.180]   - This one is Paul Allen's.
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:26.540]   And he built it to look like the Beatles yellow submarine.
[00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:27.380]   - Wow.
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.500]   - It can stay underwater for a week.
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.820]   It's not as big, it's only 40 feet.
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.900]   He also owns a $200 million yacht called Octopus,
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.620]   which has two helicopters, seven boats, a crew of 60,
[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:41.940]   and costs $384,000 a week to keep running.
[00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.700]   But I love it that he built his submarine
[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:44.860]   as a yellow submarine.
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.340]   I think that's Paul likes rock and roll, right?
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.820]   - If you're gonna do it, I mean, yeah,
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.220]   that's what you would do, right?
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.740]   - Man, you hard not to sing,
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.340]   when you get in there.
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.620]   - I bet you the crew, he pays them to sing that
[00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.140]   every time he gets in the end.
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:11:59.980]   - Yeah, in the end.
[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.460]   - Well, he doesn't have to pay them to sing it
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.620]   because he has a recording studio down there as well.
[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:04.940]   - Oh, yeah, like this is that film.
[00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.500]   - With a full-time engineer because he wants to,
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:07.740]   anytime he wants to go down there,
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.380]   he wants to be able to play.
[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.620]   - Right, acoustic shielding in a submarine.
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:12.460]   - Sure.
[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.860]   - So more to the point,
[00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.380]   Sergey Brin is building,
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.340]   this article came out this week, a blimp.
[00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:25.300]   They rent the old NASA Ames blimp,
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:30.300]   derigible, what do you call it, hangers?
[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:34.740]   - Yeah, which were created during World War II
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.500]   to house derigibles until the Hindenburg
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.180]   kind of put the kabosh on the whole thing.
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.820]   - That was terrible.
[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.180]   - Yeah, but of course that was pre-World War II,
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.700]   but that was because it was later there,
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.620]   made out of hydrogen, which as everyone knows,
[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.340]   is kind of explosive.
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:50.980]   - Slightly flammable.
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.500]   - Slightly flammable.
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.460]   But you put helium in these things,
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.460]   make you talk funny, but it doesn't explode.
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.620]   Apparently--
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:02.180]   - The Germans used hydrogen because that was the only gas
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.140]   that he gave them. - You could get helium.
[00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:03.980]   - Yeah.
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.780]   - But the Americans always used helium
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.460]   because they have a naturally occurring source in--
[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.780]   - A Silicon Valley has been taught--
[00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:11.700]   - Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.980]   Some nice Bloomberg ladies talking, never mind.
[00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.380]   So this is the hanger, although that blimp
[00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:22.140]   is not Sergey's blimp, this is 1934, when blimps were big,
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.980]   and that's hanger though still stands,
[00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.860]   and so he could build it in there.
[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:31.860]   I've often wondered, he rented the hangers, why not?
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.020]   - Yeah.
[00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:34.860]   - Why not?
[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:35.700]   - Why not?
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.140]   - I'm a big fan of that, why not?
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:41.220]   I mean, he's got, if it's not coming out of the pockets of,
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:44.060]   it's obviously coming out of our pockets in some way,
[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.580]   but if I give up a little of my privacy
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.700]   so that Sergey can fly around and a blimp,
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:49.740]   I guess that's all right.
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.220]   - It's pretty clear he hasn't yet taken it out for a spin
[00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.740]   because we would know.
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:54.900]   - We would see, yeah.
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.300]   Unless it's, oh my god, Liam,
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:57.860]   what if it's an invisible blimp?
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:58.700]   - Oh god.
[00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.740]   - There we go.
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.580]   - It's got a race to whichever billionaire
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:06.100]   can build the first airship, but they can just live on.
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.940]   - Yeah, a true airship like Bowser and Super Mario Brothers.
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.100]   I mean like, seriously, it's just propellers.
[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.660]   They're all inside, it's made of wood,
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.420]   it's amazing, there's like cannons and stuff.
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.340]   The Sky Pirates, the Sky Pirates,
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.260]   it's still in the valley, that's the next jet.
[00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.180]   - So Google Glass has become those steampunk goggles
[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.980]   that you used to have, remember the steampunk goggles?
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:24.980]   - A hundred percent, a hundred percent.
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.940]   - They're AR goggles, I love it.
[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.260]   I love all of, you know, I gotta go guys,
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:30.500]   I gotta go write this movie right now.
[00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:35.260]   - Actually, that might solve the whole dorky glasses thing,
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.100]   make them look steampunk.
[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.140]   - Yeah.
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.140]   - Steampunk still looks dorky.
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.900]   - Yeah, but it's dorky in a good way.
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.900]   (laughing)
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.820]   - I would wear a steampunk goggles.
[00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.300]   - You could, at least you could sell steampunk.
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.540]   You definitely couldn't sell Google Glass.
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.300]   - Yeah, yeah, that's true.
[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:57.180]   - I love this story, I'm gonna jump all over today,
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:01.940]   'cause you guys are playful, so we can have some fun.
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:05.500]   The dark overlord, the dark overlord,
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.620]   has apparently hacked the production company
[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.620]   that had oranges, the new black,
[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.580]   and a bunch of shows from ABC, Fox, National Geographic,
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:20.580]   and IFC, and they tried to blackmail Netflix.
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:24.660]   They said we have the next season of "Orange is a New Black,"
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:28.540]   which comes out in June, and if you don't pay us,
[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:29.740]   we're gonna put it on the torrents.
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.140]   Well, Netflix just laughed at 'em,
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:33.820]   so they put it on the torrents yesterday.
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:37.260]   - Netflix was like, we make house of cards, dumb dumb.
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.500]   We know how blackmail works.
[00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:39.980]   You can't do this now.
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.540]   - "Orange is a New Black," according to Netflix,
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.300]   is their most popular Netflix original, I didn't know that.
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.300]   - Great, they're very, they're very cagey
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.700]   about giving out numbers for each of their individual shows.
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.980]   So that is actually a real key piece of information
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:53.820]   for the industry.
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.380]   - According to this, according to Variety,
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:59.100]   the studio is a ADR, which is what,
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.260]   something dialogue recording,
[00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.860]   additional dialogue recording, Larson Studios,
[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.620]   they got hacked in the fall.
[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:08.620]   But the hacker doesn't have the whole season,
[00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.900]   just the first 10 episodes.
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.420]   So Netflix is going, yeah, go, that's great,
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.020]   it's a great promo.
[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.460]   You still have to subscribe to Netflix
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:17.940]   to find out what happens.
[00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.660]   Or you're not gonna get that seasoned finale,
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.220]   you gotta subscribe, find out.
[00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.620]   - These hackers have really good tastes,
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.980]   'cause I feel like "Orange is a New Black"
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.700]   doesn't get as much talk
[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.460]   as much as like house of cards or something.
[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:29.740]   - Yeah, no, you're right, it's like,
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.260]   "This is a good hype man."
[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:33.100]   - It's a great series.
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.780]   - I bet you it's an inside job.
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.180]   What a great marketing campaign by now.
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.100]   - So now you're telling me that Dark Overlord
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.380]   is actually a Netflix employee trying to bait up?
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:41.380]   - Well, first of all--
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.380]   - I mean, it's obviously read Hastings, guys.
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.380]   It's obviously read Hastings, the dark overlord.
[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.220]   - Sure.
[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:47.820]   - He calls himself that in executive meetings.
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:52.220]   What kind of hacker names himself the Dark Overlord?
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.060]   I mean--
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:54.060]   - A very young one.
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:56.260]   - This is a 14 year old.
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.060]   - Definitely, definitely a kid.
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:58.900]   - And by the way--
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.420]   - It's just a kid of somebody who works at that ADR house,
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:02.260]   right?
[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:03.580]   That's what we're all guessing.
[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:04.420]   - Something don't be.
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:05.340]   - Something like that.
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:08.740]   - Yeah, his Twitter handle has a three in it
[00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:10.460]   for the in the word hacker, so--
[00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:11.300]   - Oh, that's Leat.
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:12.140]   - He's Leat.
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.180]   So you know he's really--
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:17.060]   Anyway, the deadline passed,
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.540]   he posted it and then he did a press release.
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.060]   He called it a press release.
[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.060]   - He's a press release.
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.300]   - He called it a press.
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.140]   It's so cute.
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.300]   He's so adorable.
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.940]   He called, let's go to the Dark Overlord hacker.
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:30.940]   Now this isn't it.
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:34.360]   I'm trying to find, there's apparently many
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.500]   Dark Overlords on Twitter.
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.420]   - There's so many.
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.300]   (laughing)
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.140]   I'm surprised he needed, he didn't was like
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.940]   the Dark Overlord 46.
[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.540]   (laughing)
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:46.580]   Oh, this is terrible.
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.380]   Anyway, I'm trying to find the Dark Overlord press release
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.700]   because it's the funniest thing I ever read.
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:55.820]   Let me see if I can find it somewhere.
[00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.460]   Can you find it, Karsten?
[00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.220]   'Cause he's kind of--
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.420]   - Is it the one where he says
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.700]   it didn't have to be this way?
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.700]   - It didn't have to be this way.
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:04.540]   - That was my favorite.
[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.540]   He says it didn't have to be this way, Netflix.
[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:08.780]   Wait, can I just make up?
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:10.820]   - Would you be Dark Overlord for us, Ashley?
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.260]   - I'll be Dark Overlord, guys.
[00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:13.780]   I'll be Dark Overlord.
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.580]   He didn't have to be this way, Netflix.
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:18.900]   You're gonna use a lot of money and all of this
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.940]   than what our modest offer was.
[00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.540]   We're quite ashamed to breathe this same air as you.
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:24.540]   - Wait a minute, what?
[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.820]   We're quite ashamed to breathe the same air as you?
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:28.660]   - So ashamed.
[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:29.900]   (laughing)
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.660]   You figured a pragmatic business such as yourself.
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.900]   It seemed and understand the benefits of cooperating
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.540]   with a reasonable and merciful entity like ourselves.
[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:41.420]   - Merciful, that we are the merciful Dark Overlord.
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.060]   - And I really love the end where he says,
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:46.340]   "And to the other, there's still time to save yourselves."
[00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:47.180]   (laughing)
[00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.340]   Our still on the table for now.
[00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.580]   (laughing)
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.060]   - Oh, thank you.
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.300]   - I'll tell you what, if you know that if I ever do
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.900]   something like this, I am going to be the Dark Overlord
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.100]   so that attribution just becomes a disaster.
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.540]   Like, if you're gonna do this,
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.420]   you do not want people tracking you down.
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.780]   You do not want--
[00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.020]   This is a really good way to obfuscate
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.140]   the people tracking you down.
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.500]   'Cause they're gonna go like,
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.620]   "Hitting Netflix is gonna be like bad news bears.
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.380]   "They can come after you, right?
[00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.220]   "There's some smart people at Netflix."
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.060]   - I'm gonna die.
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:20.060]   - Go over and join.
[00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:20.900]   (laughing)
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:21.740]   - You know what I mean?
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:23.380]   - Don't mess with me.
[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.420]   I'm gonna get my braces off in six months
[00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.140]   and then you'll be sorry.
[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.780]   - But Pete, you don't arrest me before crying, okay?
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.180]   (laughing)
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.100]   - Didn't we see this person in social media?
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.100]   The person with the Raven on the subway?
[00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:35.940]   Pretty sure that's--
[00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:36.780]   (laughing)
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:37.620]   - I think you're right.
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:39.540]   - The person with the live Raven, yeah.
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:40.380]   - Oh, right.
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.260]   - I need to get my hoodie and put my hoodie on
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:43.260]   like Mr. Robot.
[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.460]   (laughing)
[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.900]   - Even Mr. Robot didn't call him
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.540]   "The Dark Overlord."
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.020]   Come on, kid.
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:50.860]   Come on.
[00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.580]   - Get a good handle, get a good handle.
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:53.740]   - Get a good handle.
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.060]   Dark Overlord.
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:55.900]   - I love that.
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:56.740]   That's so difficult.
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.300]   - You know, I'd say right now, like,
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.620]   if I could give you some advice, Dark Overlord,
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:04.420]   if you're watching, do not attack HBO
[00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:06.020]   because if you take Game of Thrones,
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:09.380]   they will literally hire Liam Neeson to find you.
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:11.580]   Like, it will be the plot of "Faking"
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:12.980]   - The next "Faking" movie.
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:13.820]   - Yeah.
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:14.660]   - You'll be very serious.
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:15.500]   - Yeah.
[00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.500]   Here's the, I found the "Dark Overlord"
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.980]   who's apparently a Vincent Van Gogh fan.
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:20.820]   - All the time.
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:21.660]   - He says, yeah.
[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.500]   And he, and--
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.620]   - There's no copyright on Vincent Van Gogh.
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:26.460]   - Oh.
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.140]   He's very, he doesn't wanna, yeah.
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:29.460]   Doesn't wanna offend.
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.300]   - Sorry, open the door.
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.940]   - The fan, yeah.
[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.020]   - Even, yeah.
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:34.340]   - Oh, it wouldn't be amazing.
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:35.420]   It wouldn't have been--
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:36.940]   (laughing)
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.900]   - Ashley, you do that voice very well.
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.580]   (laughing)
[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:42.540]   - You will get to play the "Dark Overlord"
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:43.380]   when we make the movie.
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.580]   - Oh my God, in the motion picture.
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.020]   The "Pirate of Silicon Valley",
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:48.780]   the "Dark Overlord" can be the villain in that movie.
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.260]   - That's awesome.
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:51.740]   Awesome.
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:52.900]   Let's take a break.
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:53.780]   We're gonna have fun today.
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:54.780]   We are having fun today.
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.700]   Ashley is, I'm trying to work on your name.
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.260]   I'm sorry, Esquetta.
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:59.100]   - Yeah, that's it.
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:20:59.940]   - Okay.
[00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.900]   Ashley, Esquetta free from CNET is here.
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:02.740]   Great to have you.
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:04.020]   You're still from CNET, right?
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:04.860]   - Yes.
[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:05.700]   - Okay.
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:06.540]   We don't have in your lower third, but we'll fix that.
[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:07.380]   Unless you don't wanna--
[00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:08.220]   - No, just come find me.
[00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.060]   - Come find me on Twitter.
[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.660]   - That's how I talk to everybody on Twitter.
[00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.700]   It's the easiest, best way.
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:17.100]   - And that's easy because it's ASHLY, ESQEDA.
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.860]   Couldn't you get like T, the "Dark Overlord"
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:22.180]   Esquetta?
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:23.780]   - I tried the "Dark Overlord" with a three,
[00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:24.860]   but it was amazing.
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.780]   (laughing)
[00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:29.780]   - Follow her on Twitter, everybody.
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:32.740]   Also, "Divinder Harnerwar from Engadget."
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:33.980]   We're gonna get him that chair.
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.220]   I'm sending you that chair.
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:36.220]   (laughing)
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.060]   - I love it.
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:37.900]   I love the colors.
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:38.740]   It's just, it's all black.
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:39.860]   - Yeah, no, tan.
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.460]   You got tan.
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.540]   Tan's the new color.
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:46.060]   And Greg Farrell from the "Packet Pushers" network.
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.140]   Great to have all three of you here.
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:48.980]   - I think--
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:49.820]   - Packet Pushers.
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:50.660]   - The real Doc Ive alone.
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:51.500]   - He is actually.
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:52.580]   - Yeah, that is true.
[00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.460]   - You know what, you probably is.
[00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.540]   - Please register for a true "Dark Overlord" on Twitter.
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:00.060]   - Or sitting here laughing at us.
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:01.540]   Saying, "You're next, Laport.
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:06.540]   "I'm gonna release this entire year's episodes of "Twit."
[00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:08.140]   - In advance.
[00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:09.900]   - In advance.
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.100]   - And which would be great 'cause I just go home.
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.020]   (laughing)
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.260]   Please be my guest.
[00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:15.100]   - All right.
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.060]   - Please, "Dark Overlord," I'll give you,
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.460]   I'll give you the FTP site.
[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:19.860]   Just download 'em all.
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:22.380]   (laughing)
[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.460]   I'll show you that they brought to you by sheets
[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:25.300]   of all things.
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.140]   The best betting in the world.
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.940]   You know, having a good night's sleep.
[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:30.980]   We're learning actually is a huge part of health,
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:32.260]   sleeping well.
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.500]   And it's one thing to have a great bed.
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.660]   And I know a lot of you have your Casper mattresses,
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.420]   but you've gotta also put great sheets on those beds.
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.700]   And Bolin Branch is the place to go.
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.020]   You will fall asleep faster, you will sleep deeper,
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.060]   you'll wake up ready to tackle your day.
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.100]   I sleep on Bolin Branch sheets and I love 'em.
[00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.500]   100% organic cotton.
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.180]   They start soft.
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:53.380]   You know, sometimes you'll buy sheets.
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.140]   I bought a pair of sheets and I regret it.
[00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.300]   We have very, very expensive sheets.
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:58.220]   I had to wash 'em eight or nine times
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:59.100]   before I get sleep on 'em.
[00:22:59.100 --> 00:22:59.940]   'Cause they were like,
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.580]   they had a lot of starch or something.
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.180]   I don't know, they were crispy.
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:05.540]   These start soft and over time they get softer
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:08.580]   and you just feel like you're just living on a cloud.
[00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.940]   And by the way, Bolin Branch sells online only
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:13.740]   so you don't pay the department store markups,
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.540]   which is huge, which is like 100%.
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.940]   You're getting half price for twice the quality.
[00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:22.700]   Bolin Branch bedding is slept on by three former US presidents,
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:25.860]   countless celebrities, the reviews rave.
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:28.020]   I'm raving about it and I want you to feel good
[00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.580]   about your sheets inside and out.
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.300]   They're ethically made.
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.100]   Every aspect of the company is geared toward
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:37.420]   making the world a better place and making your sleep better.
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.700]   Try 'em for 30 nights and see for yourself.
[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.140]   If you're not impressed, just return 'em for a full refund.
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.620]   And by the way, for gifts,
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.500]   if you've got a wedding or a baby shower
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.420]   or a housewarming gift,
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.500]   the box they come in is beautiful,
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.820]   heavy cardboard with these satin ribbons.
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:52.820]   You don't have to wrap it.
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:55.180]   It's, in fact, when I got my sheets the first time
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.060]   I thought, wow, what, did somebody say me a gift?
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.540]   No, it's just my Bolin Branch sheets.
[00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:00.860]   You'll love it.
[00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:03.900]   Order 'em from home, free shipping, free returns,
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.060]   and about half the cost.
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:08.220]   Go to B-O-L-L, like, you know, the cotton bowl,
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.900]   B-O-L-L and Branch today,
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:14.060]   Bolin Branch.com, $50 off your first set of sheets,
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:16.580]   plus free shipping if you use a promo code Twitch.
[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.940]   So try 'em and gift them.
[00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:24.260]   B-O-L-L, Bolin Branch.com, promo code Twitch.
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.860]   The best sheets you've ever slept on.
[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.460]   You'll be hooked.
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.300]   You'll be hooked.
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.140]   (sighs)
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.420]   I like--
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.140]   You feel so relaxed after talking about sheets.
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.220]   (sighs)
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.220]   Fucking hell.
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:38.220]   (sighs)
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.940]   I like your banner on your Twitter, Ashley.
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:41.780]   Oh, thank you.
[00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:42.620]   Those are your gla--
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.660]   Now, do you have many pairs of these or just one?
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:48.540]   So, funny story, I've had, I've been accused
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.220]   of any times of having fake hipster glasses.
[00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:54.140]   Like you don't need 'em?
[00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.140]   Like, yeah, like I don't need them.
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.860]   Well, you can see the reflection here
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.100]   and I do have a prescription in there.
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:01.620]   (laughs)
[00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:02.940]   I don't need them to see close-up.
[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.700]   So technically right now I can take them off
[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.020]   and be fine and read stuff online.
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:10.180]   But I need them to see far away.
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:13.300]   And I actually have three pairs of these glasses.
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:17.540]   I bought the last two pairs that LAI Works ever had.
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:19.380]   They discontinued them last year
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:20.740]   and they called me and said--
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.380]   They called you.
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:24.260]   They know it's your trademark.
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:26.260]   Yeah, and well, I just,
[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:28.340]   this is my signature pair of glasses.
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:29.660]   And so I have other pairs.
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.060]   You can see them actually right back here.
[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:32.660]   Yeah, but what are you gonna do?
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:36.340]   Thing, so I have one pair that is a pristine pair
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:41.340]   that is no joke in a storage safety deposit box at my bank.
[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.180]   Are they insured?
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:45.420]   They're not insured, however.
[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:46.740]   And then I also have a pair
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:49.220]   and this is the thing that sort of gets people as they go,
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:51.060]   well, she's not wearing any lenses
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:53.220]   when you see some pictures of me and things.
[00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:55.940]   I actually have a, what I call a stunt pair
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:59.220]   that doesn't have lenses in it for photo shoots
[00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:02.100]   and some appearances because of the glare.
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:03.660]   So I have a stunt pair as well.
[00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:05.620]   I'm getting such an educationally.
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:07.180]   Well, I just say like,
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:09.340]   as somebody who spent 30 years being a nerd
[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:10.100]   and enterprise like,
[00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:12.220]   this is all like, you know, magic.
[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.020]   This is Greg's jealous
[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:14.580]   'cause no one has ever said to Greg,
[00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:15.420]   you know, you just wear it.
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:16.700]   Those are prop glasses, Greg.
[00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:17.620]   You don't need them, do you?
[00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:19.020]   Go ahead, take 'em off.
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:20.180]   You're such a fake geek guy.
[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:21.460]   Just such a fake.
[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.100]   Take 'em off and it's like, what?
[00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.100]   What?
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:24.940]   Computer.
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:25.940]   What?
[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:26.940]   When we...
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.180]   I look like that when I take them off when I'm driving.
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.100]   I'm like, I can't read anything.
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:31.940]   Where?
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:33.220]   I just, I drive all the way to Florida.
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:34.860]   I just would not know how to get home
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:35.980]   and I can't read anything.
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:36.820]   I read screen.
[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.980]   Apparently this is enough of an issue for Ashley.
[00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:39.820]   You're gonna look in.
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.580]   She actually has to put this in her Twitter bio.
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:45.220]   My glasses are prescription.
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:48.060]   Like people really rag you for that.
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.100]   They do, it's a crazy thing.
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.060]   I don't know why, but I do mean them.
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:52.980]   And I love them deeply.
[00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.540]   Twitter is terrible, yeah.
[00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:58.620]   I think people also can't believe that I would choose these glasses for myself because a
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:03.660]   lot of people are afraid of a bright, bold pair of glasses.
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:08.860]   But I learned after trying these on for the first time, I felt like I put on Superman's
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:09.860]   cape.
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:10.860]   Like I was amazing.
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.860]   Like I'd always worn black glasses.
[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:14.820]   And then I tried these on and I loved them so much.
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:20.340]   And someone told me at that store that I bought them from, she said, "Your glasses should
[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.940]   always match your insides."
[00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:23.420]   And I thought that that was really cool.
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:26.500]   And so I kind of live by that now when I buy new glasses.
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:30.540]   I'm like, "Do they match how like my fun personality, like they should match your personality,
[00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:31.900]   not your clothes every day?"
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:36.180]   Well, I'm guessing that Ashley's gonna be the first on her block to own the new Echo
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:37.180]   look.
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.500]   You're right, I am.
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:43.460]   Which is by the way, not an April Fool's joke, but the real deal.
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:48.780]   And I, by the way, you could see, I have already requested an invitation as well.
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.700]   This is the newest Amazon Echo.
[00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:52.700]   It has...
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.700]   I bet you, did you pre-order that jacket that girl's wearing?
[00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:59.300]   Yeah, I'm gonna get that jacket because that's gonna look great on me.
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:00.300]   It's kind of amazing.
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.580]   It's kind of funny because they, I don't know, we're watching the video and they show one
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:04.580]   guy.
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:05.580]   Like...
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:06.580]   He's very fashionable, obviously.
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:08.220]   Yeah, but they don't show him ever again.
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:09.220]   Like that's it.
[00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.020]   Show him or get him.
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.820]   I don't think really this is a guy thing exactly.
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:19.620]   So the idea is it's an Amazon Echo, but it has a built-in camera with LED light and
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:25.420]   it can shoot stills or video and then send that information back to Amazon for what,
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.420]   Ashley?
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:28.020]   What is it gonna do to help me?
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:30.580]   Well, they have a feature called Style Check.
[00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:35.140]   And so you can send two different outfits, two pictures of two different outfits to Amazon.
[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:42.860]   They have a deep machine learning algorithm, a computer algorithm and some actual, supposedly
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:49.580]   fashion oriented human beings behind the, behind style check that will compare and contrast
[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:54.700]   your two outfits and then give you back sort of a, this one is 60, it's a 64%.
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.180]   This is the look you should go and have a picture.
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:59.220]   See if they had a human stylist back there, that would be...
[00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:00.220]   That'd be cool.
[00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:01.220]   Boy, yeah.
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:04.300]   But I think that that's sort of the point that Amazon wants to do at some point.
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:09.660]   Like you'll have, they do have human sort of stylists, but then they're sort of offsetting
[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:16.060]   the cost of that, you know, human by using machine learning to sort of learn what you
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:19.060]   like to wear and what your stylist and then when you log in Amazon.
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:25.460]   Of course, Amazon is going to recommend you all of the great clothes that it sells so
[00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:30.260]   that you can buy it and it knows your style and it knows what you like to wear.
[00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:32.980]   It has a standard tripod socket.
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:37.620]   So Greg, I know you have your iMac mounted on a hydraulic lift in your wall.
[00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:38.620]   You could...
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:44.460]   I don't think Greg is really the market for this, but you could have this on an arm.
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.060]   There's going to be, there's going to be a brand alert.
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:49.060]   If I always get one of those, you just go, "Why are you wearing a crown?"
[00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:50.940]   I'm sorry, you're wearing too much tan.
[00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:51.940]   Stop.
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:52.940]   Yeah, I think.
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:53.940]   It has...
[00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:57.740]   My biggest concern is that it's going to look at me one day and then I'll just log into
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:00.700]   Amazon and it's almost like subtweeting me.
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.180]   It's going to start recommending workout clothes.
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:04.820]   Yeah, no, that would be me.
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:05.820]   It won't do that.
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:06.820]   And a juicer.
[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:07.820]   Like a juicer out.
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:10.380]   It'll be like, "Hey, you were stupid enough.
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.260]   I mean smart enough to buy this.
[00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:13.260]   Maybe you'll buy it.
[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:14.260]   It's a $400 juicer."
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.260]   That's right.
[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:17.260]   That's the thing I worry about.
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:20.060]   Here's this exercise bike just in case you do it.
[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:23.660]   $200 for this, which is as much as the Echo used to cause.
[00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:29.060]   In fact, the Echo was this started this way too with invitation only.
[00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.380]   And it does everything an Echo does.
[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:32.540]   It's just adding the camera onto the Echo.
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:36.900]   But of course, immediately, the dystopian fantasies began.
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:39.220]   People started freaking out about privacy.
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:43.740]   Devendra, would you admit an Echo look into your house?
[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:44.740]   I'm not sure.
[00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:45.740]   I have an Echo.
[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:47.180]   I have a couple Echo dots, actually.
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:51.100]   But this thing looks like, what I love about the Echo is it's also very good speakers.
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.100]   I can throw a Bluetooth over there.
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.100]   Yeah, this doesn't have speakers at all.
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.100]   It looks like.
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.100]   Yeah, I don't think so.
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:57.100]   It's more like a dot.
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.100]   I think it's more like a dot.
[00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:59.100]   But I think it's more like a dot.
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:00.100]   Don't you think this is like a dot?
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.100]   Yeah, just looking at the size of it.
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:02.100]   The Echo is a big cylinder.
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:04.260]   So that's a lot of space to have to build the speakers.
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:05.820]   This thing is tiny.
[00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:06.820]   Yeah.
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:08.420]   So I wouldn't buy this for me.
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:13.020]   Maybe my wife would be into it, but she's also creeped out about machines just getting into
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:14.460]   every aspect of our lives.
[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:15.820]   So yeah, I'm not sure.
[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:17.220]   I don't think I'll be buying this at all.
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:21.020]   This is not for the duct tape over the camera set.
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:22.500]   Definitely not.
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:23.500]   This is great.
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.820]   You know, who I like who I pegged this on was I actually think Amazon might have a hard
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:33.220]   time with this if only because I think this product is perfect for Gen Z men and women.
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:34.220]   Who's Gen Z?
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:35.220]   I've lost track of the.
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.700]   This is beyond millennials.
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:40.220]   So like the set that's like 12 to let's say 20 right now.
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.220]   They're teenagers right now.
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:45.220]   They're just coming into a doll who like might be in high school.
[00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:46.700]   But if it needed to be cheaper.
[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:54.100]   So like I feel like if it were $99 and maybe like it feels like it's a little too expensive
[00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:59.380]   for the set that it should be for, which is a generation of kids who are literally plugged
[00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:03.940]   in and sharing pictures of everything they do every second of every day.
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:06.100]   And maybe we don't understand that as much.
[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:11.220]   Like I know that I don't use social media to share every bit of minutia of my day.
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.540]   But this is for the YouTube haul video crowd, right?
[00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:15.540]   This is.
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:20.380]   Yeah, like this, this to me seems like beauty bloggers style bloggers, people who really
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:23.580]   watch those things and fashion is a huge industry.
[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:28.380]   It's a, it's a, I believe last year, one of one study pegged it out at $2.4 trillion
[00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:29.380]   industry worldwide.
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:32.580]   So it's not small potatoes and Amazon's today's video.
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:33.580]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:34.580]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:37.620]   I got, I got, I started Lindsay's doing a haul.
[00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:38.620]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:39.620]   Let me turn off.
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:40.620]   Oh, you got to get that collective haul.
[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:43.820]   Oh boy, a big haul, big haul, free people forever.
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:44.820]   21 Sephora.
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:45.820]   She went everywhere.
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:48.460]   This is going to be so awesome.
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:51.100]   This is totally the audience for this, right?
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.340]   It's totally the audience for this.
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:55.780]   And it's to say like, Oh, here's my lookbook for spring or whatever.
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:57.980]   It's like the, you know, these people, they'll put together a lookbook.
[00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:01.580]   They'll set up a whole set so that their look can take pictures of them in a very specific
[00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:04.100]   place in their house or apartment.
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.820]   Like that is to me.
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:06.820]   No, they're not.
[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.300]   That crew, I disagree with that.
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:13.020]   That crew is not going to use the crappy camera in a 200 buck piece of rubbish that Amazon's
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:15.260]   going to flog to everybody.
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:17.780]   It's literally a way to sell more rubbish, right?
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:23.100]   What Amazon needs is a bunch of data to feed the machine learning algorithms that it needs
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:24.100]   to do.
[00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:28.020]   So it's got a bunch of humans behind there, fashion consultants, whatever you like.
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:31.860]   But it's never going to take pictures of the sufficient quality that the YouTube beauty
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:32.860]   vlogger can have.
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:37.660]   No, no, no, but the wannabe, the wannabe, right?
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:38.660]   Exactly.
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:39.660]   Yes.
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:46.020]   The ones who go, I love, you know, Michelle fan and I love Gigi gorgeous and I want to
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:47.580]   put together my lookbook.
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:51.820]   Like that's a way for them to do that and share it with their friends and do these sort
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:54.820]   of little short videos and things like that of a 360.
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:59.820]   And like they don't have yet Instagram husbands to like take their photos for them and stuff.
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:02.300]   And like that's literally exactly who this is for.
[00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:03.300]   I'm telling you.
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:04.300]   Wait a minute.
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:06.300]   What's an Instagram husband?
[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:07.300]   Have you ever seen that?
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:08.300]   It's a parody.
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:09.300]   It's a par...
[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:13.500]   There's a great parody video on this where it's Instagram husbands are these guys that
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:17.580]   like, you know, your significant others really into Instagram and is like, help me get the
[00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:19.260]   perfect shot and it's always the...
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:20.260]   He's the photographer.
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:21.260]   Oh.
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:22.260]   It's beautifully curated.
[00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:23.260]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:25.260]   I might be an Instagram husband.
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:26.260]   I don't know.
[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:27.260]   Here's the...
[00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.260]   Here's the parody video.
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:31.260]   It's a great little parody video.
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:34.860]   It makes every time I see it and just it's so perfect and well done.
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:37.860]   It's like help me.
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:40.140]   This camera is meant to replace some of those.
[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:42.700]   Like the people just getting a photo in front of the mirror.
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:43.700]   Right.
[00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:47.260]   But I think that would be much more useful and that sort of visual data would be good for
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:48.260]   Amazon too.
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:50.980]   So, I'm not sure who needs this hardware yet.
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:51.980]   Yeah.
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:54.460]   Keep in mind that this is where Google YouTube has...
[00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:56.940]   Google has such an advantage over its competitors.
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:01.580]   Just to nerd out on this a little bit is that YouTube is full of all this fashion data.
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:06.140]   And Google can go in with its machine learning and its pseudo artificial intelligence and
[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:10.660]   start mining the data sets that it's got from YouTube to start putting this data together.
[00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:14.660]   So if it's decides that fashion is its thing, then it can just take that data and do that.
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:16.700]   Amazon's got to build a data set.
[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.500]   So how do you get pictures of fashion?
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:24.940]   And in fact, this is going to build a very beautiful data set for training machine learning
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:31.380]   because you're going to get real people in fixed forms like in the home, trying on different
[00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.220]   outfits and colors and things.
[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:37.300]   And you're going to be able to build the most comprehensive data set for feeding into the
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:40.340]   ML algorithms to get recommendation into coming out the other side.
[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:41.940]   It's a great way of exploiting...
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.740]   Same resolution, same size.
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:46.140]   It'd be so easy to process.
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:47.140]   It's my new...
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:48.820]   I have a dot in every room.
[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:50.580]   It's my closet echo.
[00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:53.740]   I need an echo in every room including my walk-in closet.
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:56.220]   And that's exactly where it's going to be.
[00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:57.220]   I'm not going to...
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:58.220]   I mean, I don't know if I have...
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:01.220]   I put it right next to my front door so like I could do it right before I'm...
[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:04.100]   I walked out and be like, "That's what I look like."
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:08.380]   And then also, maybe I could take a picture as a kind of a pseudo security camera like
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:10.300]   someone walks in and take a picture of them.
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:13.060]   Well, that's interesting because there could be other slices on this.
[00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:14.060]   That's exactly right.
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:15.060]   Right.
[00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:16.260]   It could have skills later.
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:22.500]   I mean, any Amazon echo with a camera could be used for a variety of different skills.
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:28.220]   Alexa, they did say we're going to expand the skills on this and sorry to anybody who
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.220]   has an echo at home.
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.220]   Say echo.
[00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:31.220]   I'm triggering it.
[00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:32.220]   I'm very involved.
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:33.220]   Say echo, say the A word.
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:34.220]   Yeah.
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:35.220]   Yeah.
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:40.740]   So this is a really interesting kind of move by Amazon and it feels like, you know, and
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:44.860]   I know that on CNET we had a little bit of a scoop this week that was like, you know,
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:47.780]   maybe Amazon's working on a touchscreen version.
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:48.780]   So...
[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:49.780]   Interesting.
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:52.620]   You know, actually there's some evidence that maybe there's going to be a market for
[00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:57.380]   that because Microsoft, when they announced that they were going to put Cortana in a similar
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:01.980]   device, said that part of the specs for such a device would be a touchscreen.
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:02.980]   Right.
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:03.980]   Yeah.
[00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:04.980]   I'm not sure why you want a touchscreen.
[00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:07.780]   Why would you want a touchscreen when you're controlling it with your voice?
[00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:08.780]   Yeah.
[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:09.780]   I don't know.
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:11.620]   Well, because it's to close the feedback.
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:15.180]   Once you control something with your voice, like when you work with Siri on your phone
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:20.580]   or your echo, the feedback loop is really poor.
[00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:23.380]   You don't have any sense of when something goes wrong.
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:27.980]   There's no way of saying to an echo, you know, or Google or whatever it is, that this isn't
[00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:28.980]   right.
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:32.860]   And when you have a touchscreen, you can actually close the feedback loop and say, "Was this
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:33.860]   accurate?"
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:34.860]   Yes, no.
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:38.540]   And also because it's a screen, it can be reformatted and redacted as time goes by.
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:41.260]   You're not stuck with just one way of doing something.
[00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:42.260]   Yeah.
[00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:45.580]   On the Fire TV, actually, when you use Echo, there are little cards that pop up that give
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:47.780]   you more information than just the voice feedback.
[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:48.780]   So that could be...
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:50.460]   I'm not super excited about that.
[00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:55.460]   I'm wondering, though, we haven't seen too many cameras kind of targeted inside bedrooms
[00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:57.660]   or where your clothes would be.
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:01.580]   This seems like a crazy hacking opportunity and a really gross one, too.
[00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:02.580]   So we'll see.
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:03.580]   Super gross.
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:05.580]   But I also would...
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:07.580]   I don't think if I...
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:09.260]   I mean, I set up...
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:11.700]   I signed up for an invitation.
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:16.580]   And I don't think I would ever set this up in a place where I was getting dressed more
[00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:19.820]   than it would more be a place where...
[00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:21.500]   Because you might share your picture.
[00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:24.780]   So it's like, "Oh, well, I would put it in a place where I would be able to walk up to
[00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:28.820]   it like a full-length mirror in my office or whatever, where it's like, "I walk up to
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.180]   it and do my picture and then I walk away."
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.180]   Yeah.
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:37.140]   But for people in your business, it would be hugely valuable when we used to do tech TV
[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:42.340]   and when we had a stylist, they'd take a picture of everything you wore and put it in a notebook
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:45.580]   with the date and everything so that you would know and you wouldn't repeat and if something
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:46.580]   didn't work, you wouldn't use it.
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:50.460]   I mean, that is valuable information and I could see Amazon.
[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:51.980]   I mean, I think there's a lot of...
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:54.940]   It's mostly women, I would imagine, but there's a lot of people who will be very interested
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:55.940]   in this.
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:39:00.380]   Well, I think even young men, like that age demo again, like getting into...
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.180]   Well, a lot of guys care about this stuff.
[00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:04.620]   25 and younger, a lot of guys really care about that.
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:10.340]   And we're seeing more and more men get into beauty blogging and fashion.
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:14.180]   It's certainly an expanding industry for men just blowing up.
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:17.620]   This will be so funny because I've talked to so many people and said, "Oh, this is a
[00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:18.620]   non-starter.
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:19.620]   Nobody's going to buy this.
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:20.900]   This is such an invasion of privacy.
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:22.180]   I think the exact opposite.
[00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:23.420]   I think you do too, actually.
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:24.660]   This is a hit."
[00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:25.660]   I think people...
[00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:29.900]   I think it'll start slowly, but I do think...
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:32.380]   I think right away it won't be in stock.
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:34.180]   It'll be like the original echo.
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:38.180]   I mean, it was like it took how long months before people were able to just buy them.
[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:40.180]   So I think it'll be similar to that.
[00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:43.780]   I think Amazon is very smart making this sort of an invitation only thing.
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:48.420]   So that way, if they undersell it, they don't have to admit that to anybody.
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:52.580]   So that's always a really good sort of strategy sales-wise.
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:53.580]   But...
[00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:54.580]   Yeah, I am really curious.
[00:39:54.580 --> 00:40:03.300]   Yeah, I think that some people really want like you were saying, a speaker.
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:04.620]   They want that sort of...
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:07.660]   I have a tap and I love carrying that into the yard with me.
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:08.660]   That's great.
[00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:10.420]   But I hook my dot up.
[00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:13.620]   I mean, that has a little speaker, but I have my dot up to speakers every power speaker.
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:14.620]   Sure.
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:15.620]   And it's like...
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:16.620]   And it's better speakers in the cylinder.
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:20.700]   And soon it'll be able to control Sonos, which I am super excited about.
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:21.700]   Yeah, that'll be awesome.
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:25.580]   But I definitely am of the mindset that it's like, I do think that Amazon is on the right
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:28.860]   track making different kinds of echoes for different users.
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:33.980]   And this is just one example of, I'm sure, many different types coming in the future.
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:34.980]   With a...
[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:39.700]   I'm not glad you mentioned, but there will be a look app to go along with this that will
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:45.740]   allow you to look at your daily wardrobe looks, rate them, rank them, share them.
[00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:46.740]   It's social.
[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:47.740]   Thinking it's social.
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:48.740]   It's interesting.
[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:52.860]   I'm sure it'll tie into Shop Style Live, the show that they do with...
[00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:57.060]   They have a fashion show, but they do live every day on Amazon.
[00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:58.060]   I had no idea.
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:40:59.060]   Wow.
[00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:00.060]   It's pretty popular as far as I'm aware.
[00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:01.060]   Oh, good news.
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:02.060]   Yeah, it's...
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:03.980]   I think Frankie Grande is one of the hosts.
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:08.700]   And it's like these sort of really big fashion influencers, like digital influencers that
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:09.940]   host it.
[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:13.060]   And yeah, I think this could be a really popular thing.
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:17.380]   And if people are not sure about style look, you can actually use it in your phone.
[00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:19.660]   So it's in the Amazon app.
[00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:21.700]   Like already, you can use this as a feature.
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:22.700]   So here's the...
[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:24.700]   This is so hard because you have to hold your phone out.
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:25.700]   Right, exactly.
[00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:28.220]   Well, that's how Snapchat works today, right?
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:31.780]   So this is just taking what Snapchat does and just monetizing it.
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:35.180]   My door is, for example, forever taking photos of themselves.
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:36.180]   Right.
[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:38.460]   So it's like a conversation or typing words or modicons.
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:39.460]   They just take a photo of themselves.
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:40.460]   You're an Instagram dad.
[00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:41.460]   Yeah.
[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:42.460]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:43.460]   Snapchat.
[00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:44.460]   Snapchat dad.
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:45.460]   Snapchat dad.
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:46.460]   Snapchat dad.
[00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:47.460]   No idea.
[00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:48.460]   I'm like...
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:49.460]   It's like, how do you have it in this Amazon app?
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:50.460]   It's like, you can go right here.
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:52.620]   It says outfit compare and you just tap on that.
[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:53.620]   Fantastic.
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:54.620]   Look at that.
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:55.620]   That's style look.
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:56.620]   So you can try it.
[00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:59.900]   Like if you're not really sure if you want to use it or buy an echo look.
[00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:01.780]   You know, Macy's and Nordstrom are...
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:03.860]   And pennies are already under huge pressure.
[00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:05.500]   The brick and mortar stores.
[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:08.220]   This is the final nail on the coffin.
[00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:09.220]   I mean...
[00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:10.220]   It's tough for them.
[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:15.900]   I mean, I'm in my early 30s and like, why would I want to go to a department store when
[00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:17.460]   I know how to measure my body?
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:18.460]   Really?
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:19.460]   You don't feel really...
[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:20.460]   I mean, obviously...
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:22.300]   I don't need to go to a department store.
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:23.700]   I'll buy anything online.
[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:25.980]   But you do not shop anymore.
[00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:26.980]   You buy online?
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:28.900]   Generally, I don't...
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:32.860]   Unless it's an emergency or I need a last minute thing or something really specific.
[00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:35.620]   But you don't want to try it on in the store.
[00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:36.620]   You're willing...
[00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:37.780]   My wife does this too.
[00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:40.740]   She'll order 10 things.
[00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:44.260]   Try them on and it's very easy to send back the ones you don't want.
[00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:45.740]   Often that'll be all 10.
[00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:46.740]   No big deal.
[00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:51.820]   And I got really mad the other week at 6 p.m. which is surprisingly owned by Amazon.
[00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:54.220]   They make you pay for your own return shipping.
[00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:55.220]   Oh yeah.
[00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:56.220]   For shoots.
[00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:57.220]   Which is...
[00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:58.220]   They're heavy and that's terrible.
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:42:59.220]   Zappos never did.
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:00.220]   Yeah.
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:01.220]   Zappos doesn't do that.
[00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:03.020]   But Amazon, which is super bizarre.
[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:04.020]   You know, that's just...
[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:09.740]   Retail, by the way, is a good point because going to retail, talking to somebody there,
[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.460]   saying like, "You know, do you guys have anything that you would recommend?"
[00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:15.660]   Or just somebody you can ask, like, "How does this look on me?"
[00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:18.740]   That is the feedback loop that they're kind of drawing clothes on online.
[00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:20.380]   So that could be interesting.
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:21.780]   I see a couple of interesting trends.
[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:24.620]   I don't really want to ask somebody in the department store, like, "Hey, does this look
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:25.620]   good on me?"
[00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:27.420]   Because I don't know if I trust them.
[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:29.180]   I don't know what their fashion sense is.
[00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:34.060]   But if a computer is learning about my fashion and saying, "Okay, yes, this looks better
[00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:37.260]   on you than this," then like, "Maybe I trust a computer a little bit more."
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:40.860]   But also, like, my Twitter bio says, "I want to be a robot when I grow up."
[00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:41.860]   So there you go.
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:42.860]   Right.
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:44.500]   Well, Lisa, I'll have a robot dressing you.
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:45.500]   Yeah.
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:52.060]   I was reading some research this week about how long retail will last.
[00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:57.580]   And what they're finding out is that you only need to lose 25% of your current business.
[00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:58.580]   Oh, man.
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:00.460]   The whole company goes out of business.
[00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:01.460]   Yikes.
[00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:04.380]   Because the costs of your retail are fixed, right?
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:05.380]   And the margin.
[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:08.500]   So as soon as you lose 25% of your business, you might as well, you just close up shop
[00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:09.780]   and walk away.
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:12.500]   So Amazon only has to beat its competitors.
[00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:14.580]   It doesn't have to blow them out of the water.
[00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:18.500]   It just has to keep lowering the ceiling to the point where there's no where the ceiling
[00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:19.500]   meets the floor.
[00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:20.500]   And then these people are dead.
[00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:21.500]   25%, 25%.
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:22.500]   And they already are.
[00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:23.500]   I mean, this is like...
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:26.260]   Well, you saw the layout last week in the New York Times.
[00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:32.940]   You talked about this last week, zombie malls, as these malls just die because their anchor
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:36.980]   tenants, the big department stores go away and there is nothing left.
[00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:38.580]   And look what's replacing it, right?
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:39.580]   This is Amazon.
[00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:41.820]   Amazon warehouses and robots.
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:43.300]   Yep.
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:48.900]   And there's something like 33 square feet of mall space for every citizen, American citizen.
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:50.820]   It's already too much.
[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:53.860]   So there's definitely an oversupply of mall spaces.
[00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:54.860]   The malls are going to close any way.
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:56.740]   So there's a couple of interesting trends here.
[00:44:56.740 --> 00:45:00.220]   One is echo entering verticals.
[00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:03.180]   And this is, of course, if you're Amazon, the very first vertical you'd enter.
[00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:04.660]   This is the most lucrative vertical.
[00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:06.140]   It writes right down their alley.
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:07.660]   But I could see other verticals.
[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:10.700]   It's also interesting because it ties into...
[00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:13.180]   And this is where Snapchat's done so well.
[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:16.860]   Individuals creating their own content.
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:22.580]   And this is something I'm kind of intrigued by.
[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:24.940]   It's the trend we've been moving in the direction of.
[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:26.140]   Blogging first started.
[00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:29.740]   The whole idea of everybody would have a blog and everybody could create content and YouTube
[00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:30.740]   came along.
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:32.580]   Everybody could create videos.
[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:35.940]   It's getting easier and easier with Snapchat, Instagram.
[00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:38.780]   Everybody is becoming a content creator.
[00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:43.380]   Now you got a camera that's already connected to the internet that's ready to take your
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:47.540]   pics, your Instagram husband ready and waiting at any time.
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:49.060]   And I could see it in other verticals too.
[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:55.340]   I wonder if Amazon's going to stuff slicing off these vertical markets starting with
[00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:56.340]   the most lucrative.
[00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:59.860]   I was thinking it would be really interesting for the hobby market to have something like
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:03.220]   the look, but with maybe a touch screen.
[00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:06.180]   For your make making things or...
[00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:08.620]   You're making something crafting, something like that.
[00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:14.180]   When working, garage work, you literally can watch your how-to video for whatever thing
[00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:16.300]   that it is you're doing.
[00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:18.020]   You can just pull that right up.
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:22.740]   As you point out, Greg, it's a virtuous circle because you're also getting all this machine
[00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:27.700]   learning on the content you're providing them and that enhances their value.
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:34.140]   Which means that Amazon is in some ways a better position than Google.
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:36.620]   And more importantly, Amazon has no profit motive.
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:41.940]   It's convinced its investors that it can build for growth over a seven-year cycle.
[00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:46.340]   So you look at somebody like, "Well, I'm trying to think of some retail names in the
[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:49.140]   US, Macy's and Nordstrom's and that sort of stuff."
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:50.140]   Is that right?
[00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:51.140]   That's right.
[00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:55.620]   Those people have to deliver 20% of their profits back to their investors as dividends
[00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:56.620]   every year.
[00:46:56.620 --> 00:47:00.820]   Whereas Amazon says, "I can take that 20% and put it back into this thing."
[00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:05.980]   Smartest thing Jeff Bezos did and it was a struggle in the early decade because investors
[00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:09.700]   at one point stopped giving him money saying, "You're going to turn a profit.
[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:11.340]   No, but I'm building for the future."
[00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:16.300]   So he had to borrow money, but he's proven right now.
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.460]   He goes, "Oh, that guy's a genius.
[00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:19.460]   We knew it all along."
[00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:23.660]   How he's building a space rocket to get himself off the planet.
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:24.660]   Yeah.
[00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:28.740]   So if people want to know more about this, have a search on YouTube for Scott Galloway,
[00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:30.820]   how Amazon is dismantling retail.
[00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:32.180]   I'll try and send you the link.
[00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:34.620]   And the chairman just mentioned that as well.
[00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:35.620]   Yeah.
[00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:38.100]   He's a professor of marketing at NYU.
[00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:40.460]   So he did a 25-minute video.
[00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:42.820]   Around about the 10-minute mark, he gives you a demo.
[00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:49.180]   One of the more invidious tricks that's going to happen is variable pricing.
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:54.860]   So what Amazon is is when you go on to the Amazon Echo and say, "It does a demo of this
[00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:55.860]   live on stage."
[00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:58.500]   Actually, he says, "Give me the price of some batteries."
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:00.100]   And it comes back with a price.
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:04.060]   And it says, "But when I did this yesterday, it gave me a price that was $1 extra."
[00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:09.420]   And so one of the interesting things is once Amazon's got you captive, you have this interesting
[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:14.740]   situation where Amazon can give you prices that vary over time.
[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:18.660]   And it's just amazing what they do to do this.
[00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:20.700]   And there was a Washington Post article, I think.
[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:21.620]   Hopefully I can find it.
[00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:27.580]   Let me try talking about the same thing about the death of fixed pricing and how Amazon
[00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:32.780]   is leading that and how much of a change that's going to make to society.
[00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:33.780]   They're so interesting.
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:38.020]   They're algorithms and how algorithmically deriving all the pricing and all the moving
[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:39.460]   is going on in Amazon.
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:42.020]   I have a friend who sells through Amazon.
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:46.700]   More increasingly, stuff you buy on Amazon is not sold by and often not fulfilled by
[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:47.700]   Amazon.
[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:53.660]   They're just a storefront for people selling content all over the world.
[00:48:53.660 --> 00:49:02.980]   He sells an air purifier that he got made in China to his specifications, got his brand
[00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:06.380]   right on it, sells it on Amazon.
[00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:10.660]   And he noted that all of a sudden his sales tanked.
[00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:16.940]   He investigated and found out that Amazon was selling his product itself.
[00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:19.220]   And then he changed.
[00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:21.900]   He dropped his price below Amazon's price.
[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:24.220]   And then Amazon's price didn't go down.
[00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:26.340]   It went up.
[00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:31.500]   And he had some theories about this, but clearly algorithmically they were deciding whether
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:36.300]   they should compete with him or instead offer the product at a higher price, get fewer
[00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:39.460]   purchases, but make more money on them.
[00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:43.460]   And it's all happening as you say, Greg, over periods of minutes.
[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:44.460]   That's right.
[00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:47.140]   This article, I can't find it unfortunately, but this article was talking about that at
[00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:50.940]   Christmas time, the price of pumpkin spice, is that something that is something that is
[00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:51.940]   uniquely American?
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:52.940]   I don't know what that is.
[00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:56.180]   It's a uniquely hated as well, but go ahead.
[00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:57.180]   It's very big.
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:00.140]   You could go on to Amazon and buy pumpkin spice, but in the ramp up to Christmas, the
[00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:01.820]   price of pumpkin spice triples.
[00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:02.820]   Yes, of course.
[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:05.540]   And then as soon as Christmas is over, the price goes through the floor and the variable
[00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:09.860]   pricing is literally so this idea of going to the supermarket to buy a can of pumpkin
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:15.140]   spice, which you expect to pay $2 for 365 days a year might be going away.
[00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:16.900]   And what are the impacts of that?
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:20.900]   But what Scott Galloway is pointing to in his thing is not only is pricing going to be
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:25.380]   variable and changing at any given point in time, and it may well be that once Amazon
[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:31.900]   knows that you're a white middle class successful male with an income over six figure income,
[00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:33.500]   your price might be $10.
[00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:36.540]   But if you're coming from a lower socioeconomic group, then maybe the price that it'll sell
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:37.780]   you the product is $6.
[00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:38.940]   That's the first one.
[00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:41.820]   And the second one is what you're leading to in your previous part is about the death
[00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:43.060]   of brands.
[00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:47.940]   So today we have Proctor and Gamble and Unilever with these massively successful brands built
[00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:53.940]   around branded toilet paper and branded laundry detergent and trusted by millions and blah,
[00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:54.940]   blah, blah.
[00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:59.580]   But if you go on to an Alexa, you know, or a Google voice or, you know, one of these
[00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:05.140]   a Syrian say Siri buy me some washing liquid, which ones are going to ship you?
[00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:10.780]   Why doesn't it just ship you the Amazon no name brand where Amazon takes an 80% profit
[00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:14.380]   margin for minimum effort and bam, the brands are dead.
[00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:18.900]   Yeah, he's got talks about that in his video as well with the I'm going to have to watch
[00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:19.900]   his video.
[00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:22.700]   This is this is actually quite quite fascinating.
[00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:25.740]   He actually gave it added Amazon L2 clinic.
[00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:29.540]   Here's the example he uses with the baby wipes where it's it's basically
[00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:33.620]   an agnostic Alexa buy batteries.
[00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:36.340]   I do not want Amazon basic batteries.
[00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:39.140]   No, I have no batteries to offer you.
[00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:40.140]   I'm sorry.
[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:41.140]   That's exactly.
[00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:45.420]   So what he's saying there's a lecture by batteries and Alexa says here here at price of Amazon
[00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:47.220]   basic batteries is $7.99.
[00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:48.740]   You want me to order them for you?
[00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:51.860]   He says no and Alexa says I have nothing else to give you.
[00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:52.860]   Wow.
[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:55.420]   So you can only have whatever Alexa going to offer you.
[00:51:55.420 --> 00:52:00.140]   I think and I've tried this because I've had this kind of battle this fight with with
[00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:06.380]   Echo at home and I think you could ask for a brand name like buy ever ready batteries
[00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:08.940]   or antelope batteries and it would do it.
[00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:09.940]   But you're right.
[00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:14.860]   I get a lot of Amazon basic products because I but you know, I don't mind.
[00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:16.340]   But you're going to generic request.
[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:21.140]   I'm not complaining and it comes two days.
[00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:25.820]   I didn't you know, that's one of the reasons we have dots in every room because when I
[00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:30.140]   run out of something I can get it right there right then rather than trying to remember
[00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:34.540]   putting it on a list inevitably I'll forget three days later on.
[00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:35.860]   Oh, I needed batteries.
[00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:40.700]   No, I just so I order everything that way and I don't care if they're Amazon basics.
[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:41.700]   Why should I care?
[00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:42.700]   It's a commodity.
[00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:43.700]   Yeah.
[00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:47.660]   But the point is what does that do to brands and how does that disrupt?
[00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:53.020]   You know, like the Unilever and Procter and Gamble there, you know, multi-billion dollar
[00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:57.260]   companies really built with brands that are built up over 50 to 70 years and that whole
[00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:59.700]   business could be disrupted in less than a decade.
[00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:03.940]   What did you say about that Leo is a brand built up over 50 to 70 years?
[00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:04.940]   Like 60.
[00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:07.660]   But okay, let me show you see this box.
[00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:08.660]   It's right in between there.
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:10.140]   Got to show you this box.
[00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:11.140]   Look inside this box.
[00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:12.140]   What is this box?
[00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:15.140]   It's full of batteries and it's got a dash button.
[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:18.220]   Now interestingly, Amazon is still selling dash buttons.
[00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:20.580]   This is an energizer dash button, right?
[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:23.240]   So when this box gets low, is this John, where do we keep this?
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:26.180]   This is right there behind the desk.
[00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:28.420]   So if we run low on batteries, you press.
[00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:29.420]   That's great.
[00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:36.740]   You know, I love it's the ability to get the get these push buttons and be able to custom
[00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:40.540]   program them with my computer and an echo.
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:45.940]   So like if I say, okay, I want it to buy this thing, then you click on it in your profile
[00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:49.180]   and you set it up and you connect it to like a particular button.
[00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:51.380]   Like that's the thing you get.
[00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:56.420]   But do you think it's an Amazon's interest in the long run to get rid of brands?
[00:53:56.420 --> 00:54:00.540]   Because I guess they make more money on basics, but they don't.
[00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:04.520]   Well, they make more money on basics, but then of course they do want brands to do business
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:05.520]   with them.
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.500]   So I'm sure it's probably a bit of a balancing.
[00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:08.500]   Right.
[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:11.100]   And not at all, what they want is brands that they can dominate.
[00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:14.540]   Today's brands, Procter and Gamble is bigger than Amazon.
[00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:18.900]   Well, they have, you know, customers are demanding the brand.
[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:22.140]   So Amazon has to sell it on the terms that the brands have.
[00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:24.140]   Walmart has that kind of cloud too.
[00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:27.140]   And Walmart absolutely strong arms the brands.
[00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:31.140]   But I've got to think the brands fight, try to fight back in some way.
[00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:32.500]   I don't know how they would.
[00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:34.660]   But you know, where are you going to go to fight back?
[00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:35.660]   Yeah.
[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:36.660]   That's right.
[00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:37.660]   How you going to fight back?
[00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:38.660]   Yeah.
[00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:39.660]   Yeah.
[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:42.020]   Like in those Amazon results that we were talking about, let's just jump right back
[00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:48.260]   to where we were at the first article, Amazon's ad revenues grew by like 100% and quarter.
[00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:54.140]   And they're now the fourth or fifth largest online advertising provider and the only place
[00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:56.580]   the advertisers on their own sites.
[00:54:56.580 --> 00:55:00.420]   So you want to think about that in terms of how much money they can make out of just
[00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:04.620]   advertising on Amazon and then how that feeds into this loop.
[00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:09.540]   So they can actually drive the brands out of business because the only place brands can
[00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:11.740]   achieve that 25% right?
[00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:15.100]   Keep in mind that you can still sell stuff through Walmart and Macy's and not whatever
[00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:17.500]   those supermarkets are.
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:21.780]   But you've still got to get that extra 25% to be in business and Amazon is going to
[00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:24.180]   have that and they're going to have them by the short and curlies.
[00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:28.340]   And then if they can say, well, you know, we'll just promote our own brand, then, you
[00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:30.300]   know, where does where do the brands go?
[00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:34.420]   This is bad for consumers ultimately because it eliminates competition.
[00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:35.660]   And Amazon in the end.
[00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:42.740]   No, because what it'll allow is the emergence of new types of brands that are internet only.
[00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:49.220]   So why are you buying tied soap from Proctor and Gamble with a 60 to 80% markup?
[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:54.180]   Why don't so take, for example, you know, these food delivery services, right?
[00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:57.100]   That like Uber and delivery and all that sort of stuff.
[00:55:57.100 --> 00:56:02.860]   And what is happening now is in certain locations like New York, there are restaurants that
[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:07.300]   are not restaurants, they're just a factory that produces food for delivery.
[00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:08.300]   Right.
[00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:09.300]   Right.
[00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:11.380]   They've one share just in case just for the.
[00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:12.380]   No, no, no, no, they don't.
[00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:13.940]   It's just literally the right is.
[00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:16.100]   Yeah, it's basically a pop up.
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:17.100]   Wow.
[00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:20.140]   There's somebody who does this in an industrial estate.
[00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:26.220]   Yeah, they do it in an industrial area in LA and they make amazing food like the reviews
[00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:29.500]   on Yelp are unbelievable, but they only take a little a certain time.
[00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:34.220]   Food is just designed for home delivery on the back of a courier.
[00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:35.220]   Right.
[00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:40.220]   So instead of lamenting the death of the live restaurant and you know, and or maybe just
[00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:43.900]   having some food that you get a bit of a lift in sales by selling some out the back door
[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:49.300]   to a delivery driver, what you do is you change the business model and you set up an industrial
[00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:55.340]   building with a commercial kitchen and you create food that is only for sale by couriers.
[00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:56.860]   That's the emergence of new business models.
[00:56:56.860 --> 00:57:01.260]   And that's, you know, the secret of everything we do about the internet, right?
[00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:03.180]   Are we going to talk about ebooks at all?
[00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:08.900]   And how ebooks have dropped away by 30% which had several articles this week talking about
[00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:12.900]   massive drops in ebooks and the publishers were beating their chests and saying, you
[00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:14.820]   know, rise of the paperback book.
[00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:17.660]   It's here because ebooks sales have dropped by 17%.
[00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:18.660]   No.
[00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:19.660]   Yeah.
[00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:20.660]   Right.
[00:57:20.660 --> 00:57:29.500]   So conveniently leaving out is that you cannot is that as much as the publishers are selling,
[00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:32.700]   the independent authors are now selling directly to customers.
[00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:33.700]   That's right.
[00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:34.700]   That's what's happening.
[00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:39.140]   And so the publishers might be selling 17% ebooks, less ebooks, but I promise you the
[00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:41.380]   market is much, much larger.
[00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:46.580]   And I found some statistics on that, which I could share with you today.
[00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:51.380]   Ben Griffin was showing me the statistics, he's saying, indie self published books and
[00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:55.140]   regular retail books are something in the order of 500,000.
[00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:59.540]   Small to medium ebooks is 200,000 and Amazon publishing is 300,000.
[00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:03.940]   So what you're saying is the big five publisher ebooks sales is 250,000.
[00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:09.340]   indie self published plus indie self published full books is three times the size of big
[00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:11.860]   five publisher sales.
[00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:16.540]   So that all comes back to, I mean, even the shopping thing, Leo.
[00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:23.780]   And Greg is like, it's, it's a matter of like, I tend not to go do my shopping at department
[00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:31.180]   stores because I want to find, and I have the ability to find individuals who are self
[00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:35.580]   publishing, making their own clothing lines, starting up their own beauty brands that are
[00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:42.020]   smaller, more curated and more designed towards me as a customer, as opposed to a really large
[00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:43.340]   group of people.
[00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:47.660]   And then for everything else, well, Amazon basics is fine, but it's like there are those
[00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:51.260]   certain things that I'm like, I want something very highly curated.
[00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:54.860]   And now more and more, we're having the ability to do that.
[00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:58.740]   It's, you know, there are even companies that are now making shampoo and conditioner that's
[00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:04.140]   specifically made for yours type of hair you like to answer a quiz and then they custom
[00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:05.780]   mix it and send it to you.
[00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:08.900]   And I mean, this is like, you know, this sort of, you know,
[00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:09.900]   >> That's not good.
[00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:12.500]   >> You know, those are small business artisanal businesses, right?
[00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:13.500]   They don't see it scaling.
[00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:18.900]   >> I don't think they scale, but they're aiming at an excellent market because most-
[00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:19.900]   >> Right.
[00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:20.900]   >> Right.
[00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:25.340]   >> Because I don't think you can really scale on the low end anymore in such a way that
[00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:27.260]   would compete with an Amazon.
[00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:32.060]   And I think that that's sort of the, that's kind of the really weird evolution of what's
[00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:33.060]   going on right now.
[00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:37.940]   Like I think a Walmart or an Amazon is, you know, if you don't play ball with them, like,
[00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:41.260]   and you want to scale, they're going to eat your lunch, you know?
[00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:46.060]   >> It makes sense that eBooks would die because you don't need a storefront for eBooks.
[00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:48.300]   You don't, there's no physical product.
[00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:53.620]   Anybody can deliver a podcast or any book or any digital product without help from an
[00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:54.620]   intermediary.
[00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:56.540]   >> Well, you need a storefront.
[00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:57.780]   You do need a digital storefront.
[00:59:57.780 --> 00:59:58.780]   >> A digital storefront.
[00:59:58.780 --> 00:59:59.780]   >> Yeah.
[00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:02.980]   We've had like, yeah, they're random PDFs all over the internet.
[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:04.140]   It's centralizing content.
[01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:06.140]   That's what we've learned with the App Store too, right?
[01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:08.940]   Like it's, that's kind of- >> Discovery becomes the issue.
[01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:09.940]   Discover it.
[01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:10.940]   >> Yeah.
[01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:15.820]   >> There's so much out there and it's all being distributed in so many different ways.
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:16.820]   >> Yeah.
[01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:21.500]   >> But the point is, is that you might well be using Amazon as a delivery mechanism.
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:26.140]   So if you're using the Amazon online shopping experience, so there's, you're seeing the
[01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:31.180]   emergence of startups now who build a product and the only place you can buy it is on Amazon.
[01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:35.940]   Now that is a change in the retail where sure, you're out there marketing and reaching users
[01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:38.740]   and driving sales and engagement.
[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:42.860]   And when they want to buy it, so I bought some vitamins this week.
[01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:45.300]   And I went to the company's website to check them out.
[01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:48.740]   I checked them all out and when I went to click buy it just went to Amazon's website.
[01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:53.340]   That is a perfect example of a change in business model where before they would have
[01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:57.060]   had to have a warehouse and a distribution mechanism blah, blah, blah.
[01:00:57.060 --> 01:00:58.060]   >> It's a win, it's a win.
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:00:59.060]   >> It just went to Amazon.
[01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:00.300]   >> It's a win, it's a win all around because you feel more comfortable buying it from Amazon
[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:01.300]   anyway.
[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:02.300]   >> Right.
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:03.300]   Well, arguably, right?
[01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:04.860]   I'm not a huge fan of Amazon like Amazon.
[01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:08.340]   >> Well, you may not like that, but most people say, oh, hey, this is even better.
[01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:09.940]   I know I do this.
[01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:14.180]   If I could buy a product from Amazon or from the vendor, I'll always buy it from Amazon
[01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:16.540]   as a price is the same just because I know Amazon.
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:17.540]   I trust Amazon.
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:18.540]   >> Yeah.
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:19.540]   >> The point is it's easier.
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:20.540]   >> It makes me easier.
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:21.540]   They have my credit card.
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:22.540]   >> Yeah.
[01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:23.540]   >> Yeah.
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:24.540]   >> Everything's already there.
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:25.540]   It's very convenient.
[01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:31.900]   >> So if you're making a product that you can deliver yourself a digital product, there's
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:36.860]   really no reason to go through a middleman except you do have to solve this discovery
[01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:37.860]   issue.
[01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:41.260]   You have to somehow find an audience and have the audience find--
[01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:43.380]   >> And that's what influences our artwork.
[01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:44.380]   >> Yeah.
[01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:46.700]   How does this look in this new era?
[01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:51.980]   You know, obviously, if you're making a good, if you're selling spinner fidget spinner, you
[01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:54.220]   got to get somebody who's going to fulfill it.
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:58.620]   You need somebody like Amazon, somebody with warehouses.
[01:01:58.620 --> 01:01:59.620]   That makes sense.
[01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:02.180]   And that's going to all centralize through probably Amazon.
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:11.860]   But if you're a podcaster or you're an author, I mean, Devindra, you're a writer.
[01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:16.900]   As a writer, I would think that this offers all sorts of interesting possibilities.
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:20.300]   Same thing for musicians, but they always come back to me and say the same thing.
[01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:21.300]   But how do I rise above?
[01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:22.940]   How do I find an audience after?
[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:23.940]   >> Yeah.
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:30.140]   I mean, I remember when blogging first got started, it was all about getting your SEO
[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:32.540]   ranking up and where you stood on Google.
[01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:34.540]   And then more niche things started happening.
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:36.980]   Google News popped up and then it was all about the Google News juice.
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:40.020]   And then things like TechMame for Tech Bloggers, like that's a thing.
[01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:45.100]   >> What really happened was demand media, which was content tailored around search results.
[01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:46.100]   >> What more?
[01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:47.100]   >> Fake news.
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:53.700]   And when all the negatives rose to the surface, if you're somebody who's writing-- if you're
[01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:59.860]   a Ben Thompson who's writing a Stratecary, the real challenge for you, I would imagine,
[01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:04.460]   is one of the reasons you probably still work for Engagit, right?
[01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:08.260]   You could branch out on your-- I don't want to scare your employers.
[01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:13.340]   >> No, everybody can become an independent contractor or something, try to do everything.
[01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:14.340]   >> What stops you from doing that?
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:15.340]   >> Yeah, you don't have an audience.
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:16.340]   >> Audience.
[01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:19.700]   >> I mean, for me also, I like Engagit and I like the people I work with.
[01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:23.980]   It's a site I love and it's a thing I believe in and I want to build.
[01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:27.540]   Doing your own thing is so much more tough and so much more risky too.
[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:32.180]   >> It's nice to get a health plan.
[01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:35.140]   It's nice to get a paycheck every other week.
[01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:37.100]   And a lot of people prefer that.
[01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:38.100]   >> It's all very nice.
[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:39.100]   >> And also--
[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:40.100]   >> That's nice.
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:43.060]   I live in a country where freedom is built into the healthcare system.
[01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:44.060]   So--
[01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:45.660]   >> That's an interesting point.
[01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:52.540]   It's actually a really interesting point.
[01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:55.100]   >> You wouldn't encourage people to take more risks.
[01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:56.780]   >> You'd see much more entrepreneurialism.
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:04:01.940]   You'd see much more individual startups because that would be one whole chunk.
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:03.940]   That's a big risk.
[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:04.940]   >> College too.
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:06.980]   College debt too is another really good example of that.
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:09.700]   I mean, if you're not-- if you're not $100,000 in the whole--
[01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:11.180]   >> That's a really good point.
[01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:13.940]   >> --when you be college, you have some money to maybe start your own business.
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:17.380]   You start with a clean slate, you've got health.
[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:20.400]   All you need to do is make rent and food.
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:21.660]   That means it's a lot easier.
[01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:22.940]   The barrier entry is a lot easier.
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:24.660]   And you could take our chance on yourself.
[01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:25.660]   >> Yeah.
[01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:28.700]   So that's exactly what-- so my business, of course, is exactly that, Leo.
[01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:34.580]   So Packet Pushes is a five years of sweat equity, is a nighttime job building a podcast and publishing
[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:37.580]   shows and blog post weekend week out.
[01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:42.860]   And then two years ago, I was able to go full-time and drop my salary by 50%.
[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:44.140]   But we were able to--
[01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:48.060]   >> So why does innovation still happen here to the degree that it doesn't happen in the
[01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:51.860]   UK or Canada or every other developed nation?
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:55.020]   Because we're one of the last not to offer single-year accounts.
[01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:58.940]   >> Well, I said, you know, the thing is that if you've ever been in the ocean and dropped
[01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:01.740]   a little turd in there, something floats to the top, right?
[01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:07.300]   So the answer is with enough people, something's going to float to the top of the--
[01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:09.100]   >> Are you saying that--
[01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:12.700]   >> I'm going to try to understand what you just said about in that state.
[01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:13.700]   >> Well, I think it also--
[01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:14.700]   >> I'm like, let me rework the metaphor.
[01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:15.700]   >> Let me take your--
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:16.700]   >> Let me take it--
[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:17.700]   >> Let me figure this out.
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:19.700]   So basically, think of it this way.
[01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:23.420]   France has-- that has close to the population of California.
[01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:24.420]   >> Right.
[01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:25.420]   >> So if you're looking at--
[01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:27.340]   >> Why aren't they as productive as California?
[01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:28.340]   >> Cheer scale.
[01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:32.020]   Well, our GDP in California, I think, is really close to France.
[01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:33.580]   So I think actually it's kind of the same.
[01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:34.580]   >> Okay, all right.
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:41.260]   >> But if you look at just sheer scale, there are a lot of people who try businesses and
[01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:42.260]   fail.
[01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:50.420]   And so-- and I do think that because we have a very capitalism-friendly country, I think
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:52.700]   that that is an encouragement.
[01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:55.700]   I think that to see these guys like Bezos--
[01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:58.020]   >> You could just say-- you could actually just say--
[01:05:58.020 --> 01:05:59.020]   >> Let me just-- let me just-- let me just sculpt your idea.
[01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:00.020]   >> It's cultural.
[01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:01.020]   And despite--
[01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:02.020]   >> It's cultural.
[01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:08.060]   >> The economic-- despite the economic disincentives, the-- that culture always will win.
[01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:13.740]   People will do what they emotionally want to do regardless of the logical documents.
[01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:16.220]   >> California is not the only place where people are successful in the world.
[01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:17.220]   >> Yes, it is.
[01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:18.220]   >> Just so far up your own bums.
[01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:19.220]   >> [LAUGH]
[01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:21.900]   >> Or just using it as an example, can I?
[01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:22.900]   >> Really?
[01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:23.900]   >> It's not.
[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:25.940]   >> There's an innovation happening all over the world.
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:30.140]   It doesn't just happen in California or San Francisco or Silicon Valley.
[01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:31.140]   It's everywhere.
[01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:32.140]   Like I live in the UK.
[01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:33.140]   >> Yeah, but it's still a good fifth point.
[01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:35.060]   >> It is the largest economy in the world.
[01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:38.460]   There is a startup incubator just down the road that's bigger than most--
[01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:40.620]   >> But money is probably easier to get venture capital.
[01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:42.820]   It's probably easier to get in the US than it is in the UK.
[01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:46.380]   >> You can get stupid ideas funded faster in the US than most places.
[01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:47.380]   >> That's right.
[01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:48.380]   >> Look at the JU SERO.
[01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:49.380]   >> Yeah.
[01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:51.340]   >> And but I can do the same thing in London.
[01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:53.460]   There's no shortage of stupid startup things funded.
[01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:54.460]   It's actually--
[01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:55.460]   >> It's very different though.
[01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:59.100]   Like I-- when I used to cover startups more directly, like international startups, it
[01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:02.460]   was always very different how each country would approach it, you know, France and the
[01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:04.260]   UK versus America.
[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:05.540]   Like there is that idea.
[01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:10.020]   I think some countries are trapped in a sort of traditionalism where even if you're trying
[01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:13.980]   to do something cool and new, the people around you are like, oh no, that'll never
[01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:14.980]   work.
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:17.340]   >> Well, I used it for several years in a row.
[01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:19.500]   I spoke at L'OeB in France.
[01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:26.940]   And a lot of the purpose of L'OeB is to kind of foster this kind of freewheeling capitalism
[01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:29.180]   that occurs in the United States.
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:33.140]   And there were definitely cultural and financial barriers to that.
[01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:35.740]   A lot of it was an aversion to taking risk.
[01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:38.100]   >> Well, they were very clear about that.
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:41.980]   >> And yeah, there's a whole bunch of reasons to why startups do and don't work.
[01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:45.660]   But you certainly can't generalize and say that innovation only happened to California
[01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:47.660]   or that the US is better at innovation.
[01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:48.660]   >> I'm not saying that.
[01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:49.660]   >> I wouldn't say that.
[01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:50.660]   >> I wouldn't say that.
[01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:52.460]   >> And I wouldn't say that with you in the room.
[01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:53.460]   >> We said exactly that.
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:54.460]   >> No, so you--
[01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:55.460]   >> --in the billions under me.
[01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:57.940]   >> --America better than anywhere else.
[01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:58.940]   >> And that is--
[01:07:58.940 --> 01:07:59.940]   >> Well, we are--
[01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:00.940]   >> Wait a minute.
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:01.940]   >> Right?
[01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:02.940]   >> [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:04.740]   >> All right, let's take a break.
[01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:05.740]   >> It did.
[01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:06.740]   Break off.
[01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:07.740]   >> You know, they're made better at technology startups.
[01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:08.740]   But do you know what?
[01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:11.940]   There's a whole spectrum of industries that are start up to funding up.
[01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:12.940]   >> Of course, Greg.
[01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:13.940]   Of course.
[01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:14.940]   >> Of course.
[01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:15.940]   >> Yes.
[01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:16.940]   >> Of course.
[01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:19.740]   And we're sorry we had about the whole revolution thing.
[01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:20.740]   We--
[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:22.740]   >> I want my tea back.
[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:23.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:26.740]   >> You can borrow Paul Allen's submarine.
[01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:27.740]   >> Yeah.
[01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:28.740]   >> The Boston Harbor.
[01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:29.740]   >> It's at the Boston Harbor.
[01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:30.740]   It's all down there.
[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:31.740]   >> It's going to be nice.
[01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:33.940]   >> Steve would certainly appreciate getting that back.
[01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:36.340]   I'm sure if we have a newer.
[01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:38.060]   >> Actually, you're Australian.
[01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:39.740]   You got nothing to talk about here.
[01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:40.740]   >> Australia is--
[01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:41.740]   >> Australia is commonwealth.
[01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:44.580]   >> I would say Australia is in many respects culturally more like the United States in
[01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:47.140]   terms of kind of go getter and energy and--
[01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:48.140]   >> Independence.
[01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:49.740]   >> Independence and all of that.
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:53.540]   >> So Australia was, when I grew up, was much very anglophile.
[01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:54.540]   >> Right.
[01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:58.940]   >> It was very aligned with the British and the English and all that sort of stuff.
[01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:02.260]   And as time goes by, Australia has become Americanized.
[01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:08.380]   So through my, say, 20s to 30s, Australia was very-- becoming increasingly Americanized.
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:10.940]   And then there was a distinct shift into Asia.
[01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:17.420]   So Australia realized that America really didn't want to be a-- it's a love hate sort
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:20.820]   of a-- you know, we love you this year, but not so much next year sort of thing.
[01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:22.900]   And so Australia turned much more towards Asia.
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:27.260]   So now you have this culture, which is very rich because you've got Asian influences,
[01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:32.140]   very close ties with the Americans, but a foundation in the European cultures or specifically
[01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:33.660]   the English culture.
[01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:38.460]   And it actually ends up-- it's not sufficient to make a generalization that Australia is
[01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:43.420]   very Americanized when it's actually much more Asianized currently.
[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:44.420]   >> Interesting, interesting.
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:47.460]   Well, if you're going to emulate somebody, that's not a bad person to emulate.
[01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:48.460]   I mean, they--
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:50.020]   >> Well, you want to be nice to your neighbors because they might--
[01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:51.660]   >> Yeah, they're right up the coast, yeah.
[01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:52.660]   >> Yeah, that's right.
[01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:53.660]   >> Let's take a break.
[01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:57.180]   We'll have more with our great panel, the vendor of hardware from Engagit.
[01:09:57.180 --> 01:10:03.260]   Ashley Esqueta from CNET and of course, Greg Ferro from Packet to Pushers.
[01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:04.860]   I showed it, they brought to you by ZipRecruiter.
[01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:10.340]   If you're the person in your business that's doing the hiring, I've got the best way to
[01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:11.340]   do it.
[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:12.980]   And it does not involve your email box.
[01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:15.380]   It does not involve your phone and your desk.
[01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:21.580]   It does not involve spending hours going from job site to job site posting, you're listing.
[01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:22.940]   And it's simple.
[01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:25.740]   It's ZipRecruiter with ziprecruiter.com.
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:32.100]   You post once and it immediately goes to 100 plus job boards, including social networks,
[01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:34.060]   with just a click of the mouse.
[01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:39.260]   You could screen rate and hire the right candidate fast because instead of coming into your inbox,
[01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:43.540]   all of those applicants, and you'll start getting applicants within the first 24 hours,
[01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:49.140]   all of them go into the ZipRecruiter interface where the resumes are formatted so it's easy
[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:50.220]   for you to scan them.
[01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:51.580]   They're all uniform.
[01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:56.500]   So you can even ask screening questions, true, false, yes, no, multiple choice, even essay
[01:10:56.500 --> 01:11:01.380]   questions to screen out the candidates who don't fit your needs, rank the rest, hire
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:04.260]   the right person fast.
[01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:07.620]   If you're filling a position at your company, you're doing one of the most important things
[01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:10.180]   your company does, companies are made of people.
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:12.380]   The right person can make your company succeed.
[01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:14.620]   The wrong one can bring it to its knees.
[01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:16.140]   We all know that.
[01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:17.140]   We all know that.
[01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:19.820]   And if you're the hiring person, you're probably also the firing person.
[01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:22.700]   And you know you don't ever want to hire somebody, you're going to have to fire down
[01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:23.860]   the road.
[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:25.020]   So that's why you use ZipRecruiter.
[01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:26.980]   The right person's out there.

[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:38.100]   No wonder more than a million companies have used ZipRecruiter, many of the Fortune 100,
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:42.020]   and many small businesses like ours and medium sized businesses too.

[01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:10.500]   Man, there's pressure on me now because we've had so much fun in the last, I've picked
[01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:11.980]   the right topics.
[01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:12.980]   I think I got to.
[01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:17.140]   I just wanted to pick up on something from the last one where we talked about how discovery
[01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:18.140]   was important.
[01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:19.140]   Yes.
[01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:20.980]   And then Apple has reduced the...
[01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:24.980]   Yeah, and then one of the fascinating things that's coming to me is this Apple reducing
[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:29.180]   its affiliate fees from 7% to 2.5%.
[01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:33.620]   What we talked about is valid and true, and I'm not sure, I thought we all agreed to it
[01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:34.620]   to some extent.
[01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:35.620]   I think so.
[01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:40.180]   Why would Apple suddenly reduce its affiliate fees and not encourage influencers and for
[01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:42.580]   people to engage and participate in promoting their products?
[01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:45.700]   So I've talked to a number of tech blogs.
[01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:47.860]   Maybe David Davenroy has some input on this too.
[01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:54.300]   A number of tech blogs get a significant amount of their revenue comes from links to the app
[01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:56.740]   store and the tech blog.
[01:12:56.740 --> 01:13:03.300]   And they used to make 7% of the money made by purchasing that app.
[01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:07.380]   Apple on May 1st will lower it by 64% to 2.5%.
[01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:11.340]   Now, that's not going to affect you and me buying apps.
[01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:16.260]   It's not going to affect the company selling the apps, but it may very well affect a number
[01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:20.860]   of publications, for instance, that use these affiliate fees for revenue.
[01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:23.340]   Davenroy, you have any thoughts on that?
[01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:26.020]   I don't know how that works on our end.
[01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:27.300]   I don't know if any gadget does it.
[01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:28.460]   And gadget probably doesn't have to.
[01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:29.460]   I don't think we do.
[01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:30.460]   Yeah.
[01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:31.460]   And I wouldn't know.
[01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:32.460]   It's a lot of the smaller Apple sites though do that.
[01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:33.460]   I think I'm more...
[01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:34.460]   And like Wirecutter.
[01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:35.460]   Yeah, Wirecutter.
[01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:37.780]   You know, those sites rely on affiliate links a lot.
[01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:41.780]   This was a weird announcement because it just seems incredibly petty.
[01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:44.700]   In a way, like, is Apple trying to cut costs?
[01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:45.700]   I don't...
[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:48.260]   Like, the app store is one of their big money makers.
[01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:51.220]   It would make sense to encourage more growth there.
[01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:53.060]   Or maybe they don't feel like they need to.
[01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:56.060]   Maybe it's so big now they don't need to really, like, you know, sweeten the pot for
[01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:57.060]   these people.
[01:13:57.060 --> 01:13:59.180]   Federico, I did teach you.
[01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:02.620]   Maybe it's not like they want to be the people curating because I know they've made a little
[01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:06.980]   bit of an effort to, you know, curate a little bit better in the app store.
[01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:10.020]   Like the featured sections and things like that.
[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:11.980]   Maybe that's all they feel.
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:14.420]   Amazon has lowered its affiliate fees too, right?
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:16.620]   I mean, that used to be a great way to make money.
[01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:17.620]   It's structured a lot of the...
[01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:20.660]   In fact, if you were as an author, I made more money from Amazon.
[01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:25.020]   If you bought a book on my website than I did from the publisher, it was more than my
[01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:27.500]   royalties.
[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:30.420]   Which is a sad commentary in the state of royalties.
[01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:32.260]   But I think Amazon has dropped those as well.
[01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:33.260]   So maybe this is just...
[01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:34.260]   They can?
[01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:35.260]   I don't know.
[01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:37.900]   What about if Apple starts selling ads on its...
[01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:39.380]   It has started to sell ads.
[01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:40.380]   You can...
[01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:45.300]   Developers can now pay to have their products promoted on the Apple's app store.
[01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:51.700]   What if Apple gets into ads and it wants that 5% to be able to throw into an ad campaign
[01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:56.940]   so to build up an ad network that they can then sell directly to vendors?
[01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:57.940]   It may or may be that.
[01:14:57.940 --> 01:14:59.700]   It may also be...
[01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:00.700]   And I've seen this.
[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:04.220]   You see this not so much with the apps, but you see it with antivirus companies.
[01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:09.900]   A lot of antivirus companies pump up their sales by using these kinds of affiliate fees
[01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:12.540]   and there's resellers.
[01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:19.660]   And what you get I think is a lot of sketchy websites and sketchy or suspect marketing
[01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:21.060]   techniques.
[01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:22.460]   It may be them.
[01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:25.780]   Apple felt like it was losing control of how apps were marketed.
[01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:29.900]   There's certainly some people who game the system.
[01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:30.900]   I mean, it's like...
[01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:31.900]   And have these sort of...
[01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:32.900]   Exactly.
[01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:38.820]   But the thing is, I'm sure there are a lot of those and I'm sure Apple wants to obviously
[01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:39.860]   curb that.
[01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:45.380]   But in the process, like you were saying, there's a lot of sites like Touch Arcade who writes
[01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:49.660]   great reviews of iOS and Android games.
[01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:53.100]   They will suffer tremendously because of that.
[01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:57.540]   It's not all of their revenue, but it certainly is a good chunk of it.
[01:15:57.540 --> 01:16:00.260]   And you don't want to lose writers on a site like that.
[01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:06.060]   You don't want to lose people who are hardworking just because Apple cut it a certain percentage.
[01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:09.420]   But yeah, I mean, it's a bummer.
[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:10.500]   It's a real bummer.
[01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:14.260]   I feel bad for all of the sites that are on the up and up and really just need that money
[01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:21.940]   to survive that are, I think, being punished a little bit because of some less than pure
[01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:25.260]   actors in the space.
[01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:27.860]   You've got to always remember that if you're...
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:28.860]   What is it?
[01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:35.020]   A dictic bird that lives on the back of a hippopotamus in a symbiotic relationship that it picks off
[01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:36.020]   the parasites?
[01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:39.780]   And you just got to hope that the hippopotamus doesn't turn around and eat you.
[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:42.020]   Or it's a crocodile or an alligator.
[01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:43.020]   They pick the...
[01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:46.660]   Actually, you've seen the pictures of them going in the mouth of the alligator sitting
[01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:47.660]   here when...
[01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:48.660]   They clean its teeth.
[01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:50.820]   They pick out all of the stuff.
[01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:52.220]   Apple's the alligator.
[01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:58.740]   If you live on the crumbs, the alligators given...
[01:16:58.740 --> 01:17:00.780]   It was the same story on the line retailers too, right?
[01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:05.620]   I remember in the late '90s, some of the earliest online stories had affiliate programs.
[01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:08.420]   They were like 10% or more sometimes.
[01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:12.100]   I used to buy video games from GameCave.com.
[01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:14.820]   I had a little website and people were buying for it.
[01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:18.300]   And the company disappeared in a year.
[01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:21.180]   Probably because I was making a lot of money off affiliate links.
[01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:28.460]   Here is the Egyptian plover cleaning the teeth of the little crocodile.
[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:32.420]   And that is better than any circus you could pay to pay to pay to see.
[01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:35.100]   That is a very brave thing to do.
[01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:37.260]   I want that to be our experience.
[01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:38.900]   Yeah, where's that VR experience?
[01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:40.180]   You stick your head in a...
[01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:42.460]   Stick your head in the alligator.
[01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:45.900]   It's a crocodile, my bad.
[01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:46.900]   Crocodile.
[01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:47.900]   What's the difference?
[01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:48.900]   It's all good.
[01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:50.180]   Look, I live on the west coast.
[01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:53.420]   I don't see either of them.
[01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:55.340]   I've been watching the bees.
[01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:56.580]   If you don't have a tongue.
[01:17:56.580 --> 01:17:58.740]   Somebody's got a can of your teeth.
[01:17:58.740 --> 01:17:59.740]   No toothbrushes.
[01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:02.580]   They can't reach their teeth.
[01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:03.900]   Their arms are too short.
[01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:08.700]   Here's another tiny little company suffering from apple beating it up.
[01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:10.500]   Qualcom.
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:12.260]   Apple stopped paying qualcomm's...
[01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:15.700]   Who's going to think of the little guy here, Leo?
[01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:16.700]   Yeah.
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:20.140]   Apple stopped paying qualcomm royalties because they say, "Hey, you're asking for two.
[01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:21.140]   Too much.
[01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:27.980]   Qualcom had to warn our profits are going to drop significantly because we're not getting
[01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:34.420]   that 8 to 9% lower revenue than previous forecasts because apple has not been able to
[01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:36.180]   reach an agreement with Qualcomm.
[01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:42.020]   For more than five years, Apple says Qualcomm's refused to negotiate fair terms.
[01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:44.020]   This is like when the cable company...
[01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:47.500]   I love when you hear apple going, "No, fair, no fair terms."
[01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:48.500]   Fair.
[01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:51.580]   You're just being unfair, Qualcomm.
[01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:55.060]   Did you notice that Qualcomm isn't actually negotiating direct with apple?
[01:18:55.060 --> 01:19:00.140]   It set up the deal in such a way that the people who make the chips that Qualcomm licenses
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:07.060]   to them and then the chip makers then charge apple the Qualcomm fees.
[01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:09.620]   So apple could never negotiate directly with Qualcomm.
[01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:12.660]   It had to always go via the people who made the chips.
[01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:14.140]   So like high school.
[01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:15.140]   Yeah.
[01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:18.460]   It's like you tell Nancy that I'm not going to...
[01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:21.500]   Go to prom with her brother.
[01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:24.820]   Can you do that in the dark overlord force?
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:27.560]   That's just so hot.
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:28.660]   I need to be honest.
[01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:29.660]   I need to be honest.
[01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:30.660]   I need to be honest.
[01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:31.660]   I need to be honest.
[01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:32.660]   I need to be honest.
[01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:33.660]   I need to be honest.
[01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:34.660]   I need to be honest.
[01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:35.660]   I need to be honest.
[01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:36.660]   I need to be honest.
[01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:37.660]   I need to be honest.
[01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:38.660]   No, we don't do business with the YouTube.
[01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:39.660]   That's a good one to do.
[01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:40.660]   I'm going to do it.
[01:19:40.660 --> 01:19:41.660]   I'm going to do it.
[01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:42.660]   I like it.
[01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:43.660]   I'm going to be honest.
[01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:44.660]   I'm going to be honest.
[01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:45.660]   I don't know.
[01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:46.660]   He's got one of those bane masks.
[01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:47.660]   Yeah.
[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:51.980]   You know, the level of indirection you'd become in Taiwan and China that make the chips
[01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:52.980]   are paying quality.
[01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:53.980]   I didn't realize it.
[01:19:53.980 --> 01:19:54.980]   Yeah.
[01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:58.460]   So now Apple can't go and beat Qualcomm up directly.
[01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:01.060]   That's a brilliant piece of business maneuvering.
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:05.580]   Qualcomm is one of the masters of sharp business tactics and quite honestly couldn't happen
[01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:07.420]   to a nicer company.
[01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:13.380]   Qualcomm has been beating up on its customers for quite some time and is not well liked.
[01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:17.180]   It's done a number of things like Verizon and AT&T have had to run in with Qualcomm
[01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:19.780]   over the CDMA technology every year's back.
[01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:20.780]   It's consistent.
[01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:24.340]   Nobody's using CDMA anymore, but you need to use those Qualcomm chips because they own
[01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:25.340]   CDMA.
[01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:26.820]   That's right.
[01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:31.820]   And there's a whole lot of background dealings that Qualcomm got into to make themselves
[01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:33.940]   into this unique leadership position.
[01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:37.220]   It wasn't because their technology was better by the way.
[01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:38.220]   So you couldn't have it.
[01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:42.140]   Well, there's an irony here because Apple used is trying to second source the radio chips
[01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:43.140]   in their iPhones.
[01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:45.660]   They went to Intel, but the Intel chips are so crappy.
[01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:47.540]   They're half the speed of Qualcomm.
[01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:49.700]   It's like this is one of the bones of contention.
[01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:55.180]   Qualcomm's mad at Apple because Apple slowed down iPhones with the Qualcomm chip so they
[01:20:55.180 --> 01:20:57.900]   wouldn't be faster than the Intel chip.
[01:20:57.900 --> 01:20:59.820]   That's all.
[01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:01.980]   Everybody's acting poorly here.
[01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:03.220]   Everybody loses here, guys.
[01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:04.220]   Everybody is losing here.
[01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:06.980]   We put in a better chip, but we're going to slow it down.
[01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:07.980]   Yeah.
[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:10.060]   Both companies are also in the middle of suing each other.
[01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:11.060]   Right.
[01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:12.060]   Yeah.
[01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:13.060]   Yeah.
[01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:14.060]   Yeah.
[01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:17.500]   And Qualcomm's withheld a billion dollars in license fees.
[01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:21.900]   Honestly, I'd love to be able to withhold my rent because I think it's unfair.
[01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:22.900]   I don't.
[01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:23.900]   Can anyone do this?
[01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:24.900]   No.
[01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:28.820]   I'd love to withhold any payment on anything because I feel it's unfair and still get that
[01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:29.820]   thing.
[01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:30.820]   Yeah.
[01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:31.820]   Yeah.
[01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:33.820]   It's a good point to the draft.
[01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:34.820]   Yeah.
[01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:36.320]   Let's see.
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:43.020]   Jimmy Wales, guy who created Wikipedia, is now creating a new news site or trying to crowd
[01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:46.540]   fun a new news site called WikiTribune that will...
[01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:52.180]   It's annoying journalists because they are having to work with real people to create
[01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:53.340]   these articles.
[01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:56.340]   The idea is, and I actually put some money into this.
[01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:59.340]   So here's a disclaimer.
[01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:07.020]   Journalists will write the stories, but then, much as a Wikipedia uses independent contributors,
[01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:14.220]   people who grammar checkers, fact checkers, fact finders, whistleblowers will then contribute
[01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:20.260]   to the story equally, which I think, okay, to vendor, you're a journalist.
[01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:21.260]   What do you think of this?
[01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:23.860]   Is this a good plan?
[01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:28.100]   I don't know if it's a revolutionary as Jimmy Wales thinks it is.
[01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:35.220]   And just the idea of a large scale independent media organization, that's basically the
[01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:37.620]   associated press, isn't it?
[01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:39.460]   The crowd, like, stuff.
[01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:41.020]   Or ProPublica, right?
[01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:43.940]   ProPublica is a very good example.
[01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:49.540]   And ProPublica has found its voice in the Trump era, it's become, well, a great source
[01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:53.780]   for fake news, according to Trump.
[01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:54.780]   So...
[01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:56.700]   I just wonder how this is not going to...
[01:22:56.700 --> 01:23:07.780]   The thing is, is facts, we've seen facts tend to be considered, it's so bizarre, this whole
[01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:10.140]   thing has been so bizarre to kind of live through.
[01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:11.940]   You mean to fake the whole fake news thing?
[01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:16.700]   But it's like, yeah, what do you have, something that is the truth, regardless of what side
[01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:17.940]   it helps.
[01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:20.260]   Like sometimes it helps one side over the other.
[01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:22.740]   And so people weaponize that.
[01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:34.260]   And so I'm very curious to see how this particular project makes an effort to not become weaponized
[01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:38.780]   because even ProPublica now, like you said, they're finding their voice, but some people
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:44.700]   are arguing that that is, well, you've become liberal now.
[01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:51.420]   And so it's a really... it's a hard problem, and it's tough to combat.
[01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:57.380]   And people, even before the internet, people would believe things they heard in a town about
[01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:59.380]   somebody else, a rumor or things like that.
[01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:05.300]   So I mean, fake news is not all that old, it's just really prevalent now online where
[01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:06.900]   it wasn't kind of before.
[01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:13.940]   So I just, yeah, I don't know how this is going to be received by people.
[01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:16.820]   Is it really going to be a source to be trusted?
[01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:22.180]   Is there going to be one side or another that says, hey, this is not, this is now becoming
[01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:24.860]   weaponized, you're fighting for one side or the other?
[01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:25.860]   No, no, no, no.
[01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:30.220]   The word wiki is now tainted a little bit by Julian Assange and Wikileaks.
[01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:33.940]   We know there's, people who know what a wiki is know that there's no relationship, but
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:39.540]   I think the general public might look at wiki Tribune and wiki leaks and conflate the two.
[01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:44.180]   And one, they're actually have opposite missions.
[01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:45.340]   I think you could say.
[01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:46.340]   Right.
[01:24:46.340 --> 01:24:50.380]   I just, I don't know if this also does anything to help the nature of the problem, right?
[01:24:50.380 --> 01:24:55.540]   Of fake news, because what's happening right now, we're in a weird environment where reality
[01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:58.940]   itself is in question, much of the time.
[01:24:58.940 --> 01:25:00.740]   And that's, that's the bigger problem.
[01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:05.700]   Like we're, we're, you know, encroaching like double speak territory.
[01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:09.780]   It sometimes feels like we're being gaslighted by some politicians who say something.
[01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:13.060]   And then the next day we'll be like, Oh, I didn't say that.
[01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:16.780]   What made you think that those lights are really quick as much.
[01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:18.900]   So yeah, I don't know if this solves anything.
[01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:23.460]   What would be really nice is if media companies like focused harder on like making sure we
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:27.820]   don't like start normalizing this weird reality we're in right now.
[01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:29.620]   Interesting article by entertainment.
[01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:33.540]   Like I think that's another really big problem is that like the news has become entertainment
[01:25:33.540 --> 01:25:38.100]   and, and this is a bigger problem than just the last, you know, six months, eight, a year
[01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:39.100]   or whatever.
[01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:42.100]   This has been happening for decades at this point.
[01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:47.900]   And you know, when you, when you read a quote like Jeff Zucker who is in charge of CNN,
[01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:51.940]   considering that, you know, this is a big drama to him and that he's going to bring in
[01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:52.940]   for business.
[01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:53.940]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:54.940]   Great for business.
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:55.940]   He says.
[01:25:55.940 --> 01:26:00.380]   And if I bring in people that, you know, make this almost seem like a dramatic reenactment
[01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:04.180]   of the news, you know, people are going to watch it and they'll be compelled to watch
[01:26:04.180 --> 01:26:05.180]   it.
[01:26:05.180 --> 01:26:09.340]   And the thing is, is just because it's interesting to look at a train wreck doesn't make it any
[01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:10.440]   less awful.
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:14.500]   Like, and that's, that's sort of the key there is that it, you know, there's, there's going
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:18.820]   to have to be a moment where some real soul searching is going to have to happen on the
[01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:23.500]   part of these, on the part of these news outlets, especially on cable.
[01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:25.700]   And I don't know that it will.
[01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:28.380]   So in my view, news was always entertainment, right?
[01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:31.660]   It's always been, you bought the newspaper to read it.
[01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:36.860]   And just because you happen to get a viable politic, you know, balanced politics, views,
[01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:40.260]   politics, societal information, but it was always entertainment.
[01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:44.020]   People would sit and read the newspaper as a way of being entertained, right?
[01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:45.740]   It's never not been entertainment.
[01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:49.420]   It's just that the people who did the news got really full of their own self importance
[01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:54.860]   and puffed themselves up as being the guardians of democracy and the gateway to truth and the
[01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:58.900]   only arbiters, you know, shine the light of blah, blah, blah, right?
[01:26:58.900 --> 01:26:59.900]   That's right.
[01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:04.300]   But it's also, you hypocrite that to say that you're the generalizing of it.
[01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:09.380]   It's always been entertainment and that needs to adapt to the new environment because now
[01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:12.380]   it has to compete against Netflix, Amazon.
[01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:14.260]   I think to say, I disagree here.
[01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:18.140]   I think to say that news has always been entertainment is not accurate.
[01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:21.820]   I think news has always been used to fill people's leisure time.
[01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:27.180]   Like when you read the newspaper 50 years ago, you're getting information and maybe there
[01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:32.860]   are some things that entertain you, but now the people delivering the news have become
[01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:35.700]   the entertainment as opposed to the actual news itself.
[01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:37.180]   That's the problem.
[01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:38.180]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:40.020]   That's what I mean by the news has become entertainment.
[01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:44.980]   And my point is that the news that we get today is not fit for the medium that it's being
[01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:45.980]   delivered on.
[01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:53.220]   You see news being delivered in a 30 second video on Facebook Live or in Instagram or whatever
[01:27:53.220 --> 01:27:54.220]   it is.
[01:27:54.220 --> 01:27:58.340]   These people haven't adapted to the modern era to deliver it in such a way that they can
[01:27:58.340 --> 01:27:59.820]   tell the story in the new medium.
[01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:01.060]   They're still stuck in.
[01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:04.500]   I can publish a Sunday newspaper and make a living model.
[01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:06.380]   I don't even know if it's a new medium though.
[01:28:06.380 --> 01:28:09.340]   It's the rise of like, we've seen so much social news.
[01:28:09.340 --> 01:28:14.660]   Like a couple of organizations are doing it using Snapchat, you know, to kind of make
[01:28:14.660 --> 01:28:16.140]   their reporting better.
[01:28:16.140 --> 01:28:17.140]   It's not the medium.
[01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:21.940]   It's the fact that, I don't know, like I'm having, I've been having like an existential
[01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:26.220]   crisis and ongoing one because every time you turn on the news, it's like we're talking
[01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:28.700]   about these ridiculous things that are happening.
[01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:30.260]   And nobody's like, Hey, wait a minute.
[01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:31.260]   This is insane.
[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:35.460]   This is like, you can only say that so many times before.
[01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:37.460]   I mean, yeah.
[01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:38.460]   There is this.
[01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:43.100]   It's actually quite interesting how.
[01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:49.020]   Next with repetition, your standards change, your expectations change.
[01:28:49.020 --> 01:28:53.020]   I wonder, Greg, if part of the reason you see news is entertainment is a cultural difference.
[01:28:53.020 --> 01:29:02.500]   You know, in the United States, the notion of a fourth estate as a almost a loyal opposition
[01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:10.540]   to speak truth to power, to afflict the, afflict the comfortable and to comfort the afflicted.
[01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:12.820]   That's something we certainly, I don't know.
[01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:14.340]   Is it unique to the United States?
[01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:19.460]   I don't get the sense that the British parents have that same attitude.
[01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:20.460]   Don't get me wrong.
[01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:23.900]   I'm not saying that that's not valuable or useful, but I think it's immensely valuable.
[01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:26.140]   I just wonder if that's something that's in your cultural.
[01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:30.500]   No, certainly in my cultural, I think it's fairly universal across the world.
[01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:35.900]   But it's also a fallacy to believe that that's inherently valuable in its own right.
[01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:39.740]   People used to read the newspapers because that was the only form of entertainment you
[01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:41.620]   could get on Saturday morning for two bucks.
[01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:43.620]   Yeah, you read it with your breakfast.
[01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:44.620]   Yeah, no, I understand.
[01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:48.220]   And it was delivered to your door and it was geographically relevant to you.
[01:29:48.220 --> 01:29:54.460]   Hopefully it was, you know, the best journalism, maybe despite that, but the best journalist
[01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:58.060]   and the best journalism always had in mind.
[01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:03.660]   We are here like the courts in the United States, you know, we're the fourth branch
[01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:04.660]   of government.
[01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:05.900]   That's what the fourth estate means.
[01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:10.460]   We are here to make sure that those other guys stay on the up and up.
[01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:14.180]   And that's not the only function, but it's a big function.
[01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:17.820]   But the take away a free press, you've got so we're really in trouble.
[01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:22.060]   There's no other way to how would you find out what's going on if you didn't have people
[01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:24.220]   trying to dig into it.
[01:30:24.220 --> 01:30:27.340]   Exactly, but it's no longer only journalists can do that.
[01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:32.660]   It's now anybody with freedom of information and availability of information on the internet.
[01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:33.660]   Anybody can dig into that.
[01:30:33.660 --> 01:30:38.740]   Whereas in the past, even knowing how to make a freedom of information request, which government
[01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:43.780]   department, what office, how do you fill out the form, that was an impossible to ask for.
[01:30:43.780 --> 01:30:47.660]   And so I would say that's a broadening of journalism rather than a diminution of the
[01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:48.660]   value of journalism.
[01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:51.340]   That just means those people are becoming journalists too.
[01:30:51.340 --> 01:30:53.900]   It's the same as what the internet has done to every business.
[01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:54.900]   Yes, precisely.
[01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:55.900]   Cut the middle man out.
[01:30:55.900 --> 01:30:56.900]   Precisely.
[01:30:56.900 --> 01:30:59.060]   Do we need the journalists to be the middle man anymore?
[01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:00.060]   And in fact, part of the problem.
[01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:06.540]   Well, but then you get a cacophony of voices with a very, with a huge variety of ethical
[01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:09.260]   expertise levels.
[01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:11.740]   And expertise and ethics.
[01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:15.220]   And that's why you're in this fake news crisis because on the internet, everything looks
[01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:17.540]   equal.
[01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:21.420]   And so if you don't have, well, this is the Journal of Records.
[01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:26.300]   So there's fact checkers, there's some reputational cost.
[01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:29.420]   There's some burden on this to try to find the truth.
[01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:34.620]   Whereas this guy in a blog, it could be Alex Jones.
[01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:35.620]   We don't know.
[01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:38.780]   But my blog has to compete with newspapers.
[01:31:38.780 --> 01:31:42.660]   So I have a blog, you know, I post that reasonably regularly, but my blog has to compete with
[01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:45.740]   newspapers and Snapchat and Facebook live.
[01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:48.660]   It's much more difficult than it used to be.
[01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:49.660]   That's right.
[01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:50.660]   It's not that people are inherently not interested in this.
[01:31:50.660 --> 01:31:56.540]   If there's a fake news crisis, it's because we no longer can distinguish between truth and
[01:31:56.540 --> 01:31:57.540]   fiction.
[01:31:57.540 --> 01:31:58.540]   There's nothing.
[01:31:58.540 --> 01:32:01.460]   There's no big red button on there that says this is true.
[01:32:01.460 --> 01:32:03.060]   And extrapolate that out, right?
[01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:07.420]   So that further, we have so much false advertising.
[01:32:07.420 --> 01:32:11.860]   So many gross lies told to us in advertising, it's very easy to sit there and say in all
[01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:15.740]   the forms of media and like even the newspaper themselves are full of advertising, which
[01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:21.540]   is blatantly overstated or exaggerated or flat out untruthful, right?
[01:32:21.540 --> 01:32:25.940]   So you put the news, this thing that you just said about the fourth estate, and you just
[01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:28.900]   put it right next to an advertisement, which is a blatant lie.
[01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:29.900]   Who's losing here?
[01:32:29.900 --> 01:32:30.900]   Right.
[01:32:30.900 --> 01:32:31.900]   Well, all right.
[01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:35.540]   So the realm of politics, let's talk about medical information.
[01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:39.100]   So it used to be you would go to your doctor.
[01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:44.060]   Your doctor would be the trusted source for medical information.
[01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:46.380]   And that clearly had flaws.
[01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:49.460]   And it disempowered the patient, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:32:49.460 --> 01:32:54.180]   Now thanks to the internet, we can get a lot more information.
[01:32:54.180 --> 01:32:59.340]   There's a huge amount of information out there, and there's absolutely no way to vet it.
[01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:04.900]   And if there's a fake news crisis in politics, there's a fake news crisis in diet and health
[01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:05.900]   information.
[01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:06.900]   Sure.
[01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:08.900]   Wellness is like a big industry now.
[01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:10.900]   Wellness, let's make it about wellness.
[01:33:10.900 --> 01:33:11.900]   What does that mean?
[01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:12.900]   What does that mean?
[01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:17.540]   And I would argue, you know, as it means the FDA, what is Paul Crow selling jade eggs
[01:33:17.540 --> 01:33:20.620]   that you've like the ladies are supposed to buy.
[01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:26.620]   But the FDA, thanks to Congress, the FDA doesn't weigh in on most of what people consider
[01:33:26.620 --> 01:33:27.620]   wellness information.
[01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:28.620]   Sure.
[01:33:28.620 --> 01:33:34.700]   They don't even talk about diet supplements, but alone, jade eggs or magnetic bracelets
[01:33:34.700 --> 01:33:36.580]   or vaccines.
[01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:42.900]   And so we're in now, it's very similar situation with health and wellness where there's just
[01:33:42.900 --> 01:33:46.380]   it's fake news is just a big problem.
[01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:47.380]   Everything.
[01:33:47.380 --> 01:33:49.100]   There's so much of everything.
[01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:50.620]   There are there.
[01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:55.260]   There's a sucker born every minute, and there's also a person designed to take advantage of
[01:33:55.260 --> 01:33:56.260]   that sucker.
[01:33:56.260 --> 01:33:59.500]   It is for the con men of the world because it's gotten easier than ever.
[01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:00.500]   Yes.
[01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:01.500]   Yes.
[01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:06.140]   And that I mean, wellness basically comes down to non regulated pseudo medical products
[01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:09.500]   that you can self medicate safely enough, right?
[01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:12.620]   So the FDA doesn't regulate vitamin supplements or whatever.
[01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:17.780]   Well, but I mean, there's a whole there is a massive business in homeopathic remedies.
[01:34:17.780 --> 01:34:18.780]   Yes.
[01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:20.380]   Let me just let me just.
[01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:25.860]   If any of you is homeopathic resumes, I apologize, but it's garbage science.
[01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:29.420]   Yeah, there's it's it's a it's sugar pills.
[01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:32.620]   It's literally even you can't use the word science in there.
[01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:33.620]   It's just garbage.
[01:34:33.620 --> 01:34:34.620]   It's garbage.
[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:42.220]   It takes advantage of people there and it's and it drains their pocketbooks with no effect.
[01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:46.140]   In fact, the only the benign effect is there's no there's no effect.
[01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:48.620]   At least it's not going to kill you.
[01:34:48.620 --> 01:34:53.820]   And probably because of the placebo effect, it might even do you some good.
[01:34:53.820 --> 01:34:55.860]   But there is nothing regulating it.
[01:34:55.860 --> 01:34:58.380]   No, you go to you go to the drug store.
[01:34:58.380 --> 01:35:04.980]   There's more homeopathic stuff on the drug store shelves than there is FDA approved stuff.
[01:35:04.980 --> 01:35:05.980]   Right.
[01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:10.180]   And stuff I once had a homeopathic primary care physician.
[01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:15.020]   I didn't realize he was a homeopathic doctor before I signed up and that yeah, the dude
[01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:16.020]   was completely.
[01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:17.020]   But he didn't hurt you.
[01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:18.020]   Didn't hurt me.
[01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:19.020]   Never really.
[01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:20.020]   You're still here.
[01:35:20.020 --> 01:35:21.220]   Yeah, it didn't really help.
[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:23.780]   Didn't really help exactly right.
[01:35:23.780 --> 01:35:32.860]   So I feel like I feel bad for us because all the one of the look as bad as all of those
[01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:37.700]   institutions were the keepers of the flame of truth.
[01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:47.740]   We've learned that they were corrupt or they were at least we had some idea of we were
[01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:51.940]   able to they helped us rate the quality of the information we're getting.
[01:35:51.940 --> 01:35:58.540]   At this point, anybody growing up today is is there's an avalanche of information of
[01:35:58.540 --> 01:36:00.980]   all of equal merit.
[01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:06.420]   There's it's very difficult and unfortunately a lot of the fixes for fake news people promote
[01:36:06.420 --> 01:36:10.060]   are well, we have to learn critical thinking and we should teach people how to follow the
[01:36:10.060 --> 01:36:14.180]   links and find the no, it doesn't work.
[01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:16.820]   No, what do you do?
[01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:21.100]   It's because humans aren't like we're inherently flawed in the way our belief structures are
[01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:22.100]   built up sometimes.
[01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:26.620]   So you'll find people on every side of the political spectrum believing weird stuff.
[01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:29.780]   The Allah of the anti-vaxxers are like, that's why I want to take it out of politics.
[01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:33.620]   Yeah, I want to take it out of politics because that's such a loaded thing.
[01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:34.620]   But there are plenty of it.
[01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:35.620]   I mean, it's universal.
[01:36:35.620 --> 01:36:36.620]   It's universal.
[01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:37.620]   Yeah.
[01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:41.420]   Like we will believe like that's it's the problem is that humans like yeah, we will believe
[01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:44.460]   that we're going back to the dark ages when you do it.
[01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:45.460]   You're facts.
[01:36:45.460 --> 01:36:49.140]   You figured out a person was a witch because you weighed them against a duck and the duck
[01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:50.220]   floated.
[01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:53.540]   So if they weigh the same as a duck, they're a witch.
[01:36:53.540 --> 01:36:56.020]   We're back there.
[01:36:56.020 --> 01:37:01.340]   We're right way back to Jucciro juices.
[01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:02.340]   Yes.
[01:37:02.340 --> 01:37:08.220]   In the Jucciro juices things is exactly this cognitive bias issue that we're talking about.
[01:37:08.220 --> 01:37:16.460]   Now, one of our hosts apparently knows the guy and says he is a sweet, honest, good person
[01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:23.660]   and that the Jucciro is not, you know, wasn't an attempt to con people.
[01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:29.380]   He really wanted to reinvent, you know, the food system, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:37:29.380 --> 01:37:31.940]   So I'm not going to assume.
[01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:37.660]   In fact, it's probably the case that this guy's big mistake was he made it.
[01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:43.340]   He made a squeezer that was really way over the top two good and he has to charge 400
[01:37:43.340 --> 01:37:44.340]   bucks for it.
[01:37:44.340 --> 01:37:46.940]   Like how over designed this thing is.
[01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:52.300]   And all it's doing is squeezing a pre juiced bag of stuff.
[01:37:52.300 --> 01:37:56.100]   You can do a better job with your hand.
[01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:59.100]   But it's not his, it's not like he was trying to con people.
[01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:01.020]   He had this really, this, this great attention.
[01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:02.380]   Sometimes you overthink things.
[01:38:02.380 --> 01:38:03.380]   It's like doing it.
[01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:06.540]   It's like you have, you're looking at a puzzle in a seventh guest in the nineties.
[01:38:06.540 --> 01:38:09.300]   It's like, you know, you're looking at it for a million hours and you just feel like
[01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:12.420]   an idiot when you figure it out because it's the simplest thing in the world.
[01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:13.500]   It's the same.
[01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:17.620]   The bigger worry is that all these investors, all these supposed like technical technology
[01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:21.700]   experts looked at this thing and weren't like, this is too expensive.
[01:38:21.700 --> 01:38:22.700]   Why is it so expensive?
[01:38:22.700 --> 01:38:27.140]   Can we drop these costs down and nobody just grabbed the pouch and try to squeeze it.
[01:38:27.140 --> 01:38:28.140]   You know, before.
[01:38:28.140 --> 01:38:32.300]   There was no, they raised over a hundred million dollars.
[01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:33.300]   Yeah.
[01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:34.300]   It was like four.
[01:38:34.300 --> 01:38:37.180]   And nobody thought to be like, Hey man, can I just like see that packet for a second?
[01:38:37.180 --> 01:38:38.180]   Yeah.
[01:38:38.180 --> 01:38:39.180]   Squeeze it.
[01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:43.480]   I think you need to stop focusing on the machine and focus on the fact that they
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:45.820]   build an entire supply chain here.
[01:38:45.820 --> 01:38:51.260]   So you have to have a mechanism that produces fresh vegetables and fruits that are then
[01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:55.380]   chopped and then put into these bags and then you have to refrigerate them and you have
[01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:56.380]   to freight them to.
[01:38:56.380 --> 01:39:00.140]   So I suspect a lot of that hundred million wasn't poured into the machine.
[01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:03.900]   There's a back end in here and each one of these and this is where I mean, this is all
[01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:06.220]   patently stupid, but let's just go with it.
[01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:10.900]   But that's the point is that they saw they were that fooled them.
[01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:12.820]   Oh, you got to create a supply chain.
[01:39:12.820 --> 01:39:20.080]   And instead of them saying, so is somebody going to pay $400 for the juicer and then subscribe
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:21.080]   for what is this?
[01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:23.200]   300, how much a month?
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:25.160]   A hundred dollars a month.
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:26.480]   Is that a business?
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:28.000]   That's what they should have been thinking.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:33.040]   Not, Oh wow, you know, supply chain, but that's the problem with Silicon Valley.
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:36.840]   But for the people who believe that juice is good for you, which is, you know, let's leave
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:37.840]   that to one side.
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:38.840]   The juice is.
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:39.840]   Yeah.
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:44.580]   You know, by the way, alphabet put money and they raised a hundred twenty million dollars
[01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:45.580]   alphabet.
[01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:47.900]   Kleiner Perkins put money into this.
[01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:51.260]   So remember what we said about millionaires like to fly their own planes and billionaires
[01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:52.820]   have yachts?
[01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:56.100]   That's exactly the sort of person who'd believe in this product, right?
[01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:58.140]   Because that's a product they want.
[01:39:58.140 --> 01:40:01.500]   Yeah, it's not a product that ordinary people are going to buy.
[01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:06.260]   It's not a product that the majority of the product, not a product for scale.
[01:40:06.260 --> 01:40:10.680]   Like the supply chain and everything, I don't fundamentally see how this is different
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:15.400]   from setting up like auto delivery of fresh level, like good juice, a good juice brand
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:17.040]   to your house or to your office.
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:18.840]   They didn't fundamentally solve anything.
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:21.480]   So I'm just sitting here looking at this like dumbfounded.
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:26.840]   Yeah, it's easy for us in hindsight, especially after seeing the videos of somebody hand squeezing
[01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:28.000]   the bag.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:31.760]   It's easy for us in hindsight to say, Oh, what, what were they thinking?
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:36.120]   No, there were a lot of people before being like, this is the dumbest thing ever.
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:37.940]   And not quite as paltrow.
[01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:39.300]   She's not all I've seen.
[01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:40.300]   Yeah.
[01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:41.540]   Hey, yeah, it's going to be on goop guys.
[01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:43.540]   And if it's goop, you know, it's good.
[01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:45.860]   If it's goop, is that her business goop?
[01:40:45.860 --> 01:40:46.860]   Goop.
[01:40:46.860 --> 01:40:49.660]   Yeah, that's her, her, her wellness.
[01:40:49.660 --> 01:40:51.620]   I think she's a wonderful actor.
[01:40:51.620 --> 01:40:53.380]   I love her work.
[01:40:53.380 --> 01:40:54.380]   She's not great at names.
[01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:55.380]   What are her kids named?
[01:40:55.380 --> 01:40:56.380]   Apple.
[01:40:56.380 --> 01:41:00.620]   Apple and Moses and their company is goop.
[01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:01.620]   That's very religious.
[01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:03.460]   Apple and Moses.
[01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:09.720]   But goop, I like, yeah, I don't know.
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:10.720]   But you know what?
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:17.480]   All you have to say in the elevator pitches, we're going to do the curry of juice.
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:18.480]   Yeah.
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:19.480]   And people go, I'm in.
[01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:20.480]   I got to write a check.
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:24.720]   Who would have if you'd come to some, look, making coffee too complicated, we're going
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:28.800]   to make these pods and the, and we have a thing it punches a hole in the course, the
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:32.200]   thing that punches the hole in the pods and then puts hot water through it is like 80
[01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:33.200]   bucks.
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:34.200]   It's cheaper.
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:35.200]   Like that's cheaper.
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:36.200]   It's a piece of plastic.
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:37.200]   It's a plastic.
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:39.360]   Now they're getting, yeah, they're big plastic water reservoirs.
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:40.360]   That's all they are.
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:41.360]   Yeah.
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:43.360]   They were, they started out a little expensive, but they got cheaper.
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:44.360]   Yeah.
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:45.360]   I don't think you could use serious.
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:46.360]   Get cheaper.
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:47.360]   Right.
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:48.360]   Yeah.
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:49.360]   I mean, it's terrible for the environment.
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:50.360]   It's insane.
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:51.360]   Those things.
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:54.200]   The Nespresso version of that is now so popular in the UK that the government has forced
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:55.800]   them to start a recycling program.
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:56.800]   Yeah, rightly so.
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:41:57.800]   Because every company.
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:02.000]   I mean, they're made out of aluminium and coffee beans.
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:07.480]   But because it's, you can't put the coffee beans into the compost or we have, I assume
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:12.520]   most people have a compost service and you want to recycle the cup thing, which is pure
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:13.920]   aluminium, but you can't.
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:16.920]   So now they're talking about getting them, blah, blah, blah.
[01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:18.720]   At least that was solving a problem, right?
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:23.000]   Like doing coffee rates, getting fresh beans and everything and like having a fresh grinding
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.000]   and everything.
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.520]   Doing all that right is kind of tough.
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:27.000]   So having way to simplify that is great.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.480]   We live in a country where people think.
[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:32.720]   We live in a country where people think Duncan Donuts is good coffee.
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:33.720]   Hey now.
[01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:34.720]   Don't.
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:35.720]   Don't.
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:36.720]   I grew up in New England.
[01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:37.720]   Let's not do this.
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:40.360]   Don't get me started on US coffee.
[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:42.840]   It's, it's, that's not coffee.
[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:46.360]   That's excrement in a cup with water.
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:47.360]   I'm sorry.
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:49.160]   So today let me talk about it.
[01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:51.240]   In the nicest possible.
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:53.640]   That's Greg Ferro right to him at packet pushers.net.
[01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:54.640]   Ashley Esqueta.
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:55.640]   Esqueta.
[01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:56.640]   Esqueta.
[01:42:56.640 --> 01:42:57.640]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:42:58.640]   That's it.
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:42:59.640]   You got it.
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:00.640]   There's no, it's a D.
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:01.640]   I didn't know this.
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:02.640]   I thought it was a TH.
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:03.640]   So it's Esqueta.
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:08.400]   Yeah, it's a sketa, but then yeah, that D at the end trips people up, but it just sounds
[01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:10.360]   like the word the at the end.
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:13.760]   So I've been saying it wrong again.
[01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:14.760]   Ashley is.
[01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:15.760]   Sketha.
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:16.760]   Yeah.
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:17.760]   See the promise I look at how it's spelled and that's the problem.
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:18.760]   I shouldn't look it out.
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:19.760]   It's spelled.
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:22.160]   I should think in my mind.
[01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:24.360]   Ashley Eskey K E T H A.
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:25.360]   Esqueta.
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:26.360]   Now it's easy.
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:27.360]   Esqueta.
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:30.880]   Is that it's like that castel castel castel in Spanish?
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:31.880]   C C.
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:32.880]   Casteliano.
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:33.880]   It's a bath.
[01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:34.880]   Yes.
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:35.880]   Or's basque.
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:36.880]   Even better.
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:39.300]   Bask is great.
[01:43:39.300 --> 01:43:40.300]   Yeah.
[01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:45.400]   Also with this divindre harder war, you know, his name is just like it's spelled.
[01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:46.400]   Just like it's not.
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:47.400]   It's not Hockowah.
[01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:48.400]   Hockowah.
[01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:50.640]   People, you know, will mistake all the time.
[01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:54.880]   And my last name is so close to hardware that was pronounced that.
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:56.480]   You do write for a gadget.
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:57.480]   It would be better.
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:43:58.480]   The vendor of hardware.
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:43:59.480]   Yeah.
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:00.480]   That should be your.
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:04.280]   You should have a very special blog that's just called the vendor hardware.
[01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:05.280]   Harder war on hardware.
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:06.280]   Harder where.
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:07.280]   Yeah.
[01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:08.280]   I love it.
[01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:09.960]   I'm telling you, we're moving you off into this.
[01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:11.680]   You're going to be a brand brand.
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:12.680]   That's the new group.
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:13.680]   The new group.
[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:15.680]   And we're going to get you the chair.
[01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:17.360]   Oh man.
[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:21.760]   I look, I look at people like Marcus Brownlee, who's basically just taken off.
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:22.760]   Yeah.
[01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:23.760]   Crushing it.
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:27.200]   And it's just all, it's one guy in a camera.
[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:31.560]   The thing is, guys like that are never going to come work for.
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:32.560]   Right.
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:33.560]   Me.
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:37.120]   Places like I tried to hire him for one time.
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:40.640]   We can't afford a guy like that because he's just killing it.
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:42.480]   He's just making a huge amount of money.
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:44.360]   And the other thing is is like.
[01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:46.160]   Why does he want to imagine?
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:48.160]   He's an influencer.
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:51.080]   He accepts money for appearances and things like that.
[01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:54.840]   And that's something that we are not really allowed to do.
[01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:55.840]   Right.
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:56.840]   But let's see.
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:57.840]   There you go.
[01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:00.760]   There's an example of why it's so hard to know who to trust.
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:04.520]   Now, I'm sure Marcus has very high ideals in integrity.
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:06.040]   So I'm not going to say anything.
[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:09.080]   But there's plenty of other bloggers out there where you don't know where their money
[01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:10.080]   is coming from.
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:11.080]   They do take money from the companies.
[01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:13.280]   There's a very big gray area there.
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:19.240]   But you know, and there are people who watch their channels and implicitly trust them without
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:22.400]   knowing where a lot of their income comes from.
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:25.520]   And you know, and they get a lot of free gear and things like that.
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:28.680]   And so it's very much, it's a really interesting time in new media.
[01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:31.520]   I think it doesn't, it doesn't last long.
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:36.880]   If you're not, if you don't have integrity or ethics in this area, people will very quickly
[01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:41.080]   be found out and people will quickly get their bull crap.
[01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:42.400]   I mean, we'll go off and go.
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:45.440]   This person's obviously getting paid somewhere.
[01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:46.440]   It doesn't work.
[01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:48.800]   You have to absolutely be authentic and genuine.
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:50.920]   And if you're getting paid, you have to say so.
[01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:53.160]   And I know that because guess what my business is?
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:55.840]   I get paid to appear at events.
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:45:58.320]   I get paid to fly to conferences.
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:00.160]   We do all of our shows are sponsored.
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:03.880]   And the way that we do it is we just tell our audience, this is sponsored and you have
[01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:06.720]   to be genuine, auto authentic all the way up.
[01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:09.960]   And the minute that you're not is the day that you'll lose everything.
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:10.960]   Yeah.
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:11.960]   It's really a challenge.
[01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:17.360]   And it's changed so much, especially now that, I mean, we do ads, I have to do ads.
[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:21.160]   So we have to be very careful about a letting you know, this is an ad and B. When we talk
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:25.640]   about a product that we advertise, we've become very religious about just claiming it immediately
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:29.300]   and saying, you know, this is, by the way, this is an advertiser because we're always
[01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:32.800]   trying to make sure that that that distinction is very clear.
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:33.800]   Right.
[01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:37.640]   And you have a tosses are always all of these people are, we're all of these influencers
[01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:41.000]   and YouTubers and things are coming up in the world.
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:44.160]   You know, if you're not cross promoting, you're dying.
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:49.880]   I mean, like if you're not on 500 different of your, you know, fellow YouTuber channels,
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:51.760]   that's like you're dead in the water.
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:54.840]   And so how do you, how do you compete with that?
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:56.480]   That's a really interesting question.
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:59.880]   It's like something I think I think about it a lot.
[01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:05.440]   That's the mass consumer market where you need to appeal to very large numbers of people.
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:12.000]   So somebody like Casey Neistat, 6,000 subscribers, he needs to have a producer product which
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.760]   appeals to the largest audience because his monetization is very small.
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:20.600]   Whereas my business works on monetization of a very small audience, that's worth a very
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:23.440]   large amount of money to a very small number of clients.
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:25.360]   So I can build a perfectly viable business model.
[01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:29.520]   So you need to be careful about saying, generalizing what you're seeing, you're talking about
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:34.360]   mass consumer markets, but there are vertical markets where you can run very specific businesses
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:38.680]   that are very excellent places to work like ours, right?
[01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:44.240]   Yeah, we only need to attract an audience of 30 or 40,000 people who have a total spending
[01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:47.160]   of roughly in the order of two to $3 billion a year.
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:49.080]   Whoa, I take those people.
[01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:50.080]   Right?
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:53.280]   And if you could influence them, you've got a viable business model.
[01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:54.280]   That's a good niche.
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:55.280]   Yes.
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:56.280]   Right.
[01:47:56.280 --> 01:48:00.280]   So there's a gap between, you know, 500,000 subscribers, 10,000, you have a business activities
[01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:01.280]   that you need to do.
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:04.520]   So if you want to reach that audience, yes, you need to cross promote, you need to get
[01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:08.920]   exposure because the attrition rate people signing off from your YouTube channel as
[01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:11.160]   opposed to staying with you is very high.
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:13.360]   So you need to continually get the churn going.
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:19.360]   But I don't think Casey Neastat, somebody like a Casey Neastat is not making broad videos
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:23.640]   for monetization because he is sponsored by Samsung.
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:30.360]   Like that's, I mean, you hit a certain point where monetization is a very small part of
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:31.360]   business.
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:32.840]   But Marcus Brownlee is a good example.
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:39.720]   If Marcus Brownlee started being sponsored by Samsung, that would kind of kill his credibility.
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:40.720]   Do you think so?
[01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:46.200]   Like, I don't know because I think a lot of his, I think a lot of his viewers might feel
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:49.160]   that they could trust him with some, a sponsorship like that.
[01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:52.760]   Because even though he's sponsored, he's saying, I know I'm sponsored by them, but I'm going
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:53.760]   to be honest about it.
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:54.760]   Yeah.
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:55.760]   Yeah, maybe.
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:56.760]   I'm not front about it.
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:48:57.760]   Here it is.
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:01.320]   And I think that that's, that is, I, and I mean, I'm talking about this, not a general
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:02.320]   realization, Greg.
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:05.920]   I'm talking about it in the sense of a, as entertainers.
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:08.440]   Like these are, these are people who are entertainers who are, who are bringing you
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:09.440]   information.
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:14.200]   And, you know, whether it doesn't matter what vertical it's in, but it's, it's very
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:17.320]   much, yeah, you absolutely can.
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:19.040]   Even in the music industry, it's the same thing.
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:24.280]   If you can build super fans who have a lot of spending prowess, then you only need a
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:26.320]   few of them to sustain you.
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:30.160]   And you also have to decide what your idea of success is.
[01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:34.200]   But I just, I mean, in the sense of like a tech journalism, I mean, just in general,
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:37.520]   is like the thing that I am familiar with because that's what I work in.
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:43.040]   And that's sort of the, the push and pull of, you know, right now we're seeing a lot of,
[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:49.080]   a lot of talent at YouTube or, you know, doing their own thing and creating their own brand
[01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:53.720]   really hesitant to join a larger corporation because of limitations.
[01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:54.720]   Yeah.
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:55.720]   Mm-hmm.
[01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:56.720]   Yeah.
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:50:00.120]   But that medium is not, is no, you cannot, I don't believe that you can do that.
[01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:02.960]   You can transfer from YouTube to a corporation.
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:06.560]   The corporation is effectively the death of the independent creator because it starts
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:07.760]   to apply rules.
[01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:12.320]   As soon as somebody owns your salary and they can start to dictate the way that you
[01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:15.880]   work and sometimes it's overt and sometimes it's subvert.
[01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:16.880]   Right.
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:17.880]   And it all treats.
[01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:18.880]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:22.600]   They're not, they're very wary about going to corporations because they've built this thing
[01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:23.600]   and they don't have to.
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:25.640]   The thing is they don't need to be clear.
[01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:26.640]   Like, yeah.
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:27.640]   Yeah.
[01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:29.760]   All the ad they're working on YouTube's farm.
[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:30.760]   You bet.
[01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:33.920]   We were just talking about the affiliate stuff like ad rates drop, YouTube kicks you off
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:35.320]   for whatever reason.
[01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:38.600]   Like, it's funny how it's like independent, but not quite.
[01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:41.000]   You're independent on somebody else's platform, you know?
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:42.000]   Sure.
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:43.160]   Hey, let's take a break.
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:44.160]   More to come.
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:45.600]   Great panel.
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:48.600]   We had a great week this week and I'd like to, I wanted to show you this little video
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:51.360]   that we made highlighting the week watch.
[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:53.240]   Previously on Twitter.
[01:50:53.240 --> 01:50:55.160]   Might look like I was on vacation on my face.
[01:50:55.160 --> 01:50:56.320]   No, that is VR goggles.
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:58.760]   It's like maybe a little sunburn, but no.
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:50:59.600]   Yeah.
[01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:00.600]   You know, we're all in the air.
[01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:04.800]   We need to loosen the straps, I think, a little bit.
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:05.800]   Triangulation.
[01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:08.320]   We're talking with Corey Doctorow, his news book, Walk Away.
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:12.480]   A lot of it is about what happens when people who have very strong political beliefs start
[01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:18.160]   to compromise on them and how compromise can slide you from, you know, don't be evil
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:23.160]   to surveillance capitalism in a bunch of very small steps.
[01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:24.320]   Security now.
[01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:26.160]   This is a bad idea.
[01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:33.360]   Mastercard unveils next generation biometric card, but a thumbprint is not exact.
[01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:39.480]   Yes, it's better than nothing, but if we look at the technology that had to be employed,
[01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:44.360]   it is, it doesn't mean that this is cryptograph will be secure.
[01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:47.400]   Know how we're making a raspberry pie a le-
[01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:48.920]   Tell me about the weather.
[01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:52.480]   In Santa Rosa, there's a flood warning in effect until Friday.
[01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:56.440]   We're going to be using the Amazon trigger word a lot.
[01:51:56.440 --> 01:51:59.080]   So when you hear bleeps, it's not saying a-
[01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:03.160]   Not us saying this is your brain.
[01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:04.720]   This is your brain on Twitter.
[01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:05.720]   Any questions?
[01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:07.600]   I don't know.
[01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:09.400]   Pre-swearing always cracks me up.
[01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:11.600]   I just- That's really- That's actually a really good idea.
[01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:12.600]   Just bleep it out.
[01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:13.600]   We do.
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:14.600]   That's great.
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:15.600]   That's great.
[01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:19.440]   But of course, a lot of people watch live and those are the people who get the burden.
[01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:20.440]   I'm so sweet.
[01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:21.440]   Yeah.
