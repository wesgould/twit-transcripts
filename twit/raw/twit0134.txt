[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Steve Gilmore is here.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Formerly of the Gilmore gang now of the gang and the news gang
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   and of course of gesture lab, Steve, it's great to get you on.

[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   >> The gang has always been a must-listen in the podcast world

[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Mr. Dave Weiner, the man who makes this all possible.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   >> Well Dave's not a regular.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   He invented a podcast, super crawl.

[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   I mean, could you have a word, Steve, about that?
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   >> I'll talk to Steve, I know him.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Actually, Steve and I've met, this is the first time we've met,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   except for a dinner at which Jason Calicanis held forth
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   and we never got to say anything.

[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Dave Weiner is the man who makes this possible because,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   of course, he created RSS and bowed to the requests of
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   "He who shall not be named to add enclosures to it."
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And there you go, there you have it.

[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   That might be somebody else's version of this story.

[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   would just orchestrate it.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   >> I could do it.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   You want to do it?

[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   I'm a very-- I'm like this straight talk express here.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   >> Are you a McCain supporter, Dave?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   He doesn't seem that way on Twitter.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   >> No, no, no, no.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   >> You're quite outspoken on Twitter about your support.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   >> Yeah, I'm supporting Obama.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   >> I like that.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   >> It's fun to follow you on Twitter because you can watch
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   during all the events, the debates and so forth, as Dave
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   basically starts losing it and spitting it, Hillary.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   It's really fun.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   >> Oh, God.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I think I'm the least at this.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   >> It's really quite interesting.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   >> You can talk about me without me here.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   >> No, no, no, you have to stay here.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Also, John C. Devorek, you hear his voice in the background.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   He is at devorek.org/blog.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Don't need to tell you that.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   >> Yeah, you do.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   >> Well, actually, I do.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   You're right.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   It's part of the deal, isn't it?
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   If I don't say it.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   >> I'll say it.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   >> He'll say it.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Somebody say it.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   >> Who is this guy?
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   >> You know, I've never heard of John C. Devorek.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   >> No, no, I'm talking about you.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   >> Who am I?
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   >> I know who you are.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   >> I don't know who I am.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I'm just the -- I'm your humble interlocutor.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Interlocutor.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Is that a word?
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Will Harris is from Britain, he would know.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Is interlocutor a word?
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And Will Harris is falling asleep.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   >> I think there's an interlocutor monster.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   >> Interlocutor is a nest monster.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Will, are you there?
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   >> Not a thing for me.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   >> Oh, yeah, I had myself all mute.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   >> Ah, it's quite sightseeing.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   >> Will Harris from channelflip.tv.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   >> No, calm.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   I do that every time.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   >> Close enough of Janice is my old tutors to say.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   >> So a big big, big, big panel today and absolutely nothing to talk about.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   So that's the kind of twit I like.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   >> I will bring up a couple of stories and let you guys hash it out.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Have you been following the WikiLeaks story?
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Anybody?
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   >> Yeah, I have.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   >> Going once.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   WikiLeaks.org is a site, a Wiki site where people put, I don't know, stuff.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Leaks.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   >> Leaks.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   >> They call themselves a global defender of sources and press freedom.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   And you can read amazing stuff there and it was shut down by a judge.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   >> Yeah, it was shut down in the United States and had to go to Sweden where they actually
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   have some tolerance for true freedom of speech-wares in this country where we apparently don't.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   >> A Swiss bank and it's Cayman Island subsidiaries were able to get a summary judgment shutting it down.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   They asked Dine-a-Dott, which is the hosting company to disable the WikiLeaks.org address.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Of course, as you said, John, they immediately moved it overseas and that solved that problem.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   The good news is Friday, a federal judge overturned that summary judgment.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   But of course, if this is going to continue to go to trial, it was just a summary judgment.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   >> It seems--
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   >> Trial for what?
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   >> Well, it's a lawsuit.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   You got to go to trial, right?
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   >> I mean, it was the lawsuit over.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   So they revealed some--
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   >> Yeah, published information that, you know, proprietary information, which was the
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   proprietary about--
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   >> Right, right, right, right.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   >> Here's what--here, I'll read you the complaint.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   The bank is Bank Julius Behren Company.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   They claim the WikiLeaks displayed confidential, personally identifiable account information of its customers
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   as part of the revelation, the revelatory documents, which it seems like a reasonable thing for them to say,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   "Hey, you know, this is privacy issues.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   This isn't just about us."
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Of course, one of the effective customers might have been a certain Ken Lay, former chief executive officer of Enron.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   In this case, no targeted individuals were identified, and so the lawyers for the bank said,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   "You know, you have no right to release this information."
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   I think Judge White, if I'm Judge White and I hear that, I probably say, "Yeah, let's shut it down until we figure out what's going on."
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   >> Well, there's surely a more proportionate response would have been, "Okay, take those documents offline.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   There's no read point."
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   That's the entire thing.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   >> Is there a lot of other stuff on WikiLeaks?
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   >> Yeah, there's absolutely tons of stuff, and it seems ridiculous that you shut down the entire website, you know, for one offending,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   or allegedly offending web page, and so it just seemed like the lower court judge just didn't have much of a handle on this.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   >> Maybe he didn't understand that you could have them pull down those documents without pulling down the whole site.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   >> Yeah, you'd think that these people would think to check first, maybe.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   >> Right.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   >> Well, you know, it seems to me that the courts, how long have computers been around anyway that nobody seems to understand how--
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   >> That's really old.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   >> Yeah, I mean, no, seriously, I mean, you know, we've had, you know, this whole thing started in the, what, the '30s,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   and then we had that personal computer revolution started over 30 years ago in the '70s, and these guys still don't have a clue about anything, and then I don't get it.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   >> So, I mean, it was quite interesting to see that, you know, the judge in the case sort of quite rightly positive,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   and this sort of goes to, like, the thing of the internet.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Judge White said, "Maybe the reality of the world we live in is that when this genie gets out of the bottle, that's it."
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   >> Well, it is.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   >> Once the stuff goes online, then you can take it down off WikiLeaks, but it's already in 50 other places.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   >> Right.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   >> That was his argument against it for the summary judgment, though.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   But of course, you're right.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   I mean, he was right more than he realized.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   >> Steve, is Wiki-- I mean, do you think WikiLeaks is something worth defending?
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   >> Well, yeah, I mean, on its face, as John says, I mean, come on.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   I mean, this is a 101, you know, rights of the individual to learn as much about what's going on as possible in order to protect his family and his friends against attack.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   >> But there is no assurance on WikiLeaks that, I mean, anybody could post anything here, right?
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   >> Well, I mean, now you're talking about whether we should ban WikiLeaks, which, of course, I'm totally in favor of.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   >> Really? Are you being facetious?
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   >> Of course.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   >> We'll get to Jimmy Wells' personal troubles a little later on, but, I mean, obviously, WikiLeaks is a good thing.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Dave, do you have an opinion on this one?
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   >> Well, seriously, I had a case where a lawyer that used to work for me threatened to sue me for defamation if I didn't take down a bunch of people.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   I didn't take down a bunch of things.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   You know, I had very openly been writing about the problems that I've been having with this guy.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   And that's what I learned about defamation law, and it can affect everybody, not just this one site.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   And I would be surprised if there were a lot of people that are listening to this podcast right now who haven't been threatened some way legally and have taken stuff offline as an result.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   >> That's the thing that I learned in that process. I wouldn't take it offline. I said, you know, you're going to have to sue me.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   You're going to have to take me to court. And I learned about how all this stuff works.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   And in California, there are pretty good protections against it.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   >> So he did not sue you, or he did?
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   >> Well, he did, absolutely.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   >> And was it a slap? Did they treat it?
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   >> Well, that's the -- yeah, no, it would never -- that part of it never -- none of it ever came to trial.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   We settled.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   And it was a -- it was like every legal situation, probably with this WikiLeaks situation as well.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Once you get the lawyers involved with it, then basically it starts turning into a mugging almost immediately without any honor whatsoever.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   You know, I mean, what are you going to do?
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   So, I don't know. I suppose people running WikiLeaks might want to avoid the trial.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   I guess they're taking it out of the country was a pretty good idea.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   >> Yeah, our country doesn't have great protections for the first amendment for free speech.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   And it's kind of -- it's kind of --
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   >> Well, just to play devil's advocate, what about people who -- I mean, if you were a customer of this bank had nothing to do with anything
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   except that you were a customer of the bank and your private information is being put up on WikiLeaks,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   doesn't it seem like you ought to have some recourse?
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   >> It's not WikiLeaks, though. It's with the bank.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   It's not WikiLeaks that's actively gone and taken your information off.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   >> But they're the ones publishing it.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   >> But I mean, how do you unring the bell? I mean, once it's out, it's out.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   >> So you just give up?
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   >> What's the recourse?
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   >> Your recourse is to go back to your bank and whatever recourse there is in American law for, you know, disclosure of private information.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   That's what you need to do, you know, legally towards the bank.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   I think the problem that this identifies is that most, you know, public sort of institutions, banks or governments or whatever
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   are increasingly, increasingly bad at protecting consumer information in an age where governments and institutions want to know more and more about it.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   They seem to be getting worse and worse, actually keeping that stuff confidential.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   >> That's the real issue right there.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   I mean, we want to talk about something interesting, is there going to be a meltdown in the identity system,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   and I think it's kind of obvious that that's coming pretty soon.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   >> So let's back up a second talk, since we got Will on the line here.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Look what's been going on in the UK. First a few months ago, they had lost a couple of hard disks with all kinds of data, and then just the other day they lost another.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Somebody sold a laptop on some auction site or something, and there was like a hidden disk in there that had confidential information from the highway.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   >> I learned so much about this when I had to take my Mac in for repairs and I needed to get a new hard drive,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   and they wouldn't let me take my old hard drive back, even though I had paid for a new one.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   So I wrote that one up, and I found out that all kinds of people have lost, they've had phone calls from people, they refurbish these drives,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   and they've gotten phone calls from people saying, "Hey, I've got your hard drive here."
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   >> Right, and Apple felt like they were doing me some great big favor by letting me have the drive back that I had paid for.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   And this is a huge, I mean some identity thief organization is going to get clued in on this one if they haven't already and start buying up these used drives.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   The goldmine of information on these things.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   >> Simpson Garfinkel did a study some time ago at MIT in which they actually did that.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   They bought drives on a variety of sources, eBay used drives. I can't remember the...
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   >> You're kidding.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   >> Yeah, and the stat was something like 80% of them were completely intact, had all the private information they were getting to be able to get off.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   In fact, one of the drives they bought was from an ATM machine.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   >> Oh my God.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   >> And had all the ATM transactions still on the drive.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   >> Let's go along one second with this discussion since Dave brought up the anecdote.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Dave, how come you didn't demand to get the drive back? What was the deal with that?
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   >> Oh my God, John.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   This was okay. This was at the height of Christmas season. I was in the Apple store in Emeryville, and the place is jam full of people.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   They got security guards. They look like they have guns. They certainly have mace.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   I'm all the way in the back of the store. What the hell am I going to do?
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   How am I going to... I can stand there and put my hands on my hips and say, "You know what? I'm not leaving until you give me my hard drive back."
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   >> Did you talk to the manager?
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   >> Hey, it's policy. You can't override policy.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   >> I mean, she showed me a game sheet.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   >> Well, you informed in advance that you weren't going to get the original drive back?
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   >> Of course, that's what they say, okay?
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Because they showed me down in the fine print that I can't even read, that they would never have let me take the time to actually read,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   that I actually did say that they could keep all the hardware.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   >> Wow.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   >> Although, actually, that's their interpretation. I scanned that into the computer, put it up on my website.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   A few tens of thousands of people read it, and there was a lot of debate as to whether or not I actually given up that hard drive legally.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   You know, there was no way I was walking out of there with that drive.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   And they called the cops, and the cops would have put me in jail, John. Is that what you want to see?
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   >> Well, if I was there, I would have.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   >> I think you would have loved that. I'd get it.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   >> Dave, we and the EFF would have come to your support. We would have raised money.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   >> And if that was how many months or years you had to spend in jail, we'd be there for you.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   >> Oh, my God. That's bull. That's better.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   [laughter]
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   >> You're about to say like four-letter words on this show.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   >> No.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   >> You can say them, but they won't appear on the show.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   >> You know which one I'm thinking of.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   >> Yes.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   [laughter]
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   >> It's more than four letters, actually, but that's all right.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   >> Oh, the salient part is the four letters.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   >> You can say bull. That's bull.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   >> Yeah, but that's not as much fun as bull.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   [laughter]
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   >> We just bleep you. It's okay.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   We have a clean tag. I don't know why. I think it's because we expect children to listen to this show.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   >> I should have asked the poor.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   >> At least people should know about this. I didn't know about it.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   I mean, I'd usually swap out my own heart,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   so I probably would never discover the situation because it's not that hard to do.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   >> John, people should know about it. That's exactly right.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   And they should go in there prepared.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   And I think that because I made such a stink about it,
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   and the best advice I got when this happened, and it worked really well,
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   is just send an email to Steve Jobs.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   And that's Steve@apple.com.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   And that is what got them off their bus.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   >> Oh, really?
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   >> Absolutely. They look different.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   >> I don't think any Tom Dickon here, he can write to Steve Jobs again.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   >> No, John. No, absolutely. They did have no idea who I was.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   It made no difference.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   >> I said, "Mr. Wiener, we have your hard drive here."
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   >> Yes, I said to them, "I'm writing about this on my blog."
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   And they go, "Oh, okay."
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   [laughter]
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   >> Ooh.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   >> That's nice.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   >> He's a blogger.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   [laughter]
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   >> We got a problem.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Talk about respect.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   And I've been a Mac developer since 1983.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   Can I get a little respect?
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   Can I have my hard drive back?
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   >> Well, you're right.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   I mean, so the point is wipe your drive before you bring it in for repairs, I guess.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   >> Well, you know, I wanted to get you.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   That's not going to help.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   >> And if you can't do that, throw the DM computer out and buy a new one.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Because the data on that drive is worth, I mean,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   if you got your social security number, credit card numbers,
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   you bank account numbers on there, it's, you know, a thousand, $2,000 computer.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   >> Well, I mean, that's an interesting sort of practical point.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   What's the best way to get that stuff off?
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   I mean, I'm looking in the dis-utility on Mac.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   >> They have a secure wipe.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   >> You know what?
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   You can talk to those guys over at Drive Savers over here in Tiburon,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   and I'll tell you that if the CIA or somebody wanted to get to that information,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   there's residual data on there they can get.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   >> Even Simpson Garfinkel, who knows about this stuff, he himself said,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   "Look, you do a couple of races and rewrites, a race rewrites."
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   That's plenty.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   This notion of the NSA spooks have some sort of magic magnetometer that can read the drive.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   >> Okay.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   >> And I know what I decided, Leo.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   I said, "Look, I've got all this data sitting here in my house, right?"
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   So I just took the drive and I put it on a shelf, on a bookshelf in my house,
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   along with all the other crap that I've got.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   And that is no better or worse protection than my data has always had.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   So, you know, I'll accept that.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   What I couldn't handle was this thing going back to some place in Dallas or wherever it was.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   >> Well, it fits re-soul on eBay without being wiped.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   That's awful.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   >> No, not eBay.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   It goes back in -- for all I know the drive I bought from them was refurbished.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   There is no guarantee that you pay retail for one of these things that it's new.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   >> Okay, good.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   >> Actually, your company, your country, Will, has a -- I think it's the MI5.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   Somebody has a protocol for destroying data that involves grinding the drive up,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   the platters on the drive up, and then storing it in a safe.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   >> Awesome.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   >> I was at a trade show.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   I'm sorry, a couple of years ago, I went and saw -- I was at one of the big trade shows
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   and they had a company that specialized in this.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   And they have this huge shredder.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   >> Yeah, and they just take the entire drive, platters and all and chuck it into this thing
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   and it becomes powder.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   And the guy says, "Hey, this is the only absolute positive way to get rid of the data."
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   >> You know, there is a way -- there's a machine that's been demonstrated that will take shredded
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   documents, even if you use a cross-cut shredder, in an automated fashion, re-assemble the document.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   >> Well, it's not going to do that to a powdered hard disk.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   >> Well, I'm just saying.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   You never know.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   >> I just love the idea of a powdered hard disk.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   >> I don't know why you don't just hook it up to a bit torrents and just overwrite everything.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   >> There you go.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Just put a bunch of, you know, poly-shore movies on it.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Nobody will want it.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   >> That's one of the people on the street.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   >> That's the problem is if you could do that, then you wouldn't need to take the drive in to be prepared.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   >> Oh, yeah, that's a good point.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   >> Deep tell there.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   I mean, that's a technical problem there.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   >> Well, you get the big bucks to use.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   >> Let's pause with our fabulous panel for just a moment because I would like to mention our sponsor.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   Then we'll get back to the action.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   Of course, we're sponsored by audible.com.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com, audible.com/twit.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   If you'd like to sign up for Audible, a great place to listen to your favorite books.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   Great place to learn.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   I find, you know, I don't have time to read as much as I'd like.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Okay, fall asleep when I try to read in bed.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   But the good thing about audiobooks from Audible.com is I can listen in the car when it probably would be who've been not to fall asleep.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   When I'm working out, when I'm taking walks, and so I get a lot more reading done thanks to Audible.com.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   I've been an Audible subscriber for eight years now.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   Over 300 books in my Audible list.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   No, that's another great thing about Audible.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   Once you buy a book, it's in your library forever.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   You can always re-download it.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   Listen to it again.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   It's just like a real library.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Only it's an audio library.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   If you're an Oursa Scott card fan, his newest is just out.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   Read by her daughter, I think.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   It's a young...
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   For youngsters.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   It's a youth at juvenile, as they called.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   I guess this is an older book that is now out for the first time.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Read by Emily Janis Card.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   I'm thinking this is daughter.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   The story is about patience and a great way to get, I think, girls interested in science fiction.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   My kids loved Ender's Game.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   Read it over and over and over again.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   This is a great story.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   It's called Worms.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   W-Y-R-M-S.com.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   Not only will you get excited by audiobooks, but I think this is a good way to get your
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   kids reading.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Let them listen to Worms.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Yeah, the book came out in '87, but this is a new edition of it that just came out.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   Worms.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   W-Y-R-M-S.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   It's not a kid's story.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   Jammer says it's not.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Is it an adult?
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Is it a story for adults?
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   All right.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Well, I'll let my kids read it because I tell you what.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   I think they love Oursa Scott card.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   It's the story of patience, the only daughter of the rightful hip tuck.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   Anyway, that's our Audible Pick for the Week.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   W-Y-R-M-S from one of my favorite sci-fi guys, Oursa Scott Card, who I would like to get
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   on this show.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   At some point, he's really good.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   If you want to join, get yourself a free book, go to audible.com/twit, A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com/twit.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   And we thank Audible so much for their support.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   Now back to the winer gang.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   Anybody play a Scrabulous on Facebook?
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Anybody play the online Scrabble?
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   None of you guys.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   You all have lives.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   I play it.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   I can't play Scrabble.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   That works.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   It's going to pop that.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   Well, here's the deal.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   This is actually a really good example of mainstream companies just not getting it.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   So it's these two Indian brothers.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   They're in their 20s.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   Rajat and giant Arguala, who played Scrabble since childhood.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   They played on a Scrabble game to help them develop vocabulary.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   They played it since childhood.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   They loved it.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   They used to play online.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   The site that they played on went pay.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   And they said, "Well, wait a minute.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   We could write our own Scrabble."
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   They did.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   They created a site Scrabulous.com.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Didn't attract the attention of Hasbro and Mattel who own the rights worldwide to Scrabble
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   until they made a Facebook application.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   It became one of the most popular Facebook applications.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   It's on my--actually, I had to take it off my page because so many people were challenging me to Scrabble games.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   I had 10 games going at once.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   It's addictive.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   They don't make a lot of money on it.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   They say they collect about 25,000 a month in online advertising.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   You know, contextual ads next to the--
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   It's not bad for just sitting around.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   It ain't bad.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   And of course, they don't own the rights to Scrabble.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   I thought while I started playing it, this is interesting.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   I wonder how they get away with this.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   But the point is that Hasbro and Mattel never made a digital version of Scrabble.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   They never licensed it.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   Now they're trying to get these guys to shut it down.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   They went to Facebook saying, "Turn it off."
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   And instead of making a deal with these guys, they said, "No, we got to put them out of business."
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   The point being that I would bet you more 15 to 30 year olds are playing Scrabble now than ever before.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   I bet you this.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   I bought a new Scrabble set just because I enjoyed it so much online.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   I bet you this is fantastic for their business.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Meanwhile, they're trying to shut them down.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   This is the same decision that the record company's made.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Exactly.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   And interestingly, we're about to see when the iPhone SDK is released, where evidently Apple
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   is going to turn this into a store for software.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   So this is going to be the same thing all over again.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   We're going to find that out on Thursday, Apple's having a get together at its headquarters in Cupertino.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   We don't know yet what they're going to do.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   It's rumored that they'll require all applications to be sold to the iTunes store that they'll control it.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   And since Steve did say how much he liked the Nokia S60 verification process,
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   it's kind of indicates he might be kind of going down that path.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   I just saw a rumor today that said, "Well, free applications will be available widely.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   It's just if you want to charge for it."
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   Well, that is the model for podcasts.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   They're all free and they're all take away through the iTunes system without being stopped.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   Right.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Although it bugs me because people, I don't know about you, Steve, but a lot of people I talk to say,
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   "Wait a minute. It's in the store. You press subscribe. How much is this going to cost?"
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   They see in the store and they go, "Oh, it's not free."
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   You have smarter listeners, probably.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   I don't know who's listening, but you know, they...
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   I hear this all the time.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Well, I mean, you know who's listening to you?
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   Yeah, we know, actually. We have a pretty good idea.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   There's Joe over there in Fremont.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   We got a guy in the Netherlands, I think, who listens.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   But I mean, you've got quarter of a million listeners.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   No, about almost 200,000.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   Right.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   A little less than that.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   So what do you think the majority of those people think?
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   I think it would be more... I think it would be more people in general, not just for, I don't know about ours,
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   but because we're kind of nichy.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   But I think in general, more people listen to podcasts if there were other ways to get it.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   What do you think, Dave? I mean, don't you think it's bad that iTunes and Apple kind of dominates this space?
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   I don't care. What I care about is that I get good podcasts to listen to.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   They made it easy. I mean, they came along and they turned it around.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   I don't use their podcast. I use my own.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   Well, of course not, right. But unfortunately, most people use iTunes.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   Yes, I think that's unfortunate, absolutely.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   And there is no ecology for third party because Apple owns it.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   I don't agree with that. I think that there have been an incredible number of examples of markets where people said things like that only to find out that there actually was room for a product.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   Good. I hope that's true. I mean, I've seen so many iPod or X go away.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   Well, it's because they went... Right. Well, they didn't have to go away. It was a free product.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   Where are the third party podcast?
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   But I mean, the iPod or X was... They bootstrapped it. I mean, Adam bootstrapped the original version of that code in order to get something to work.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   I mean, nobody was sitting around waiting for that to become a big company. They were glad that it was there and everybody was glad when Apple started to support the idea themselves.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   No, we weren't 100% glad. I mean, I didn't like all the extra crap they threw into RSS when they could have used stuff that was already there.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   That's annoying. I don't want to...
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   I just a simple phone call up front would have been, could have solved all of those problems, but I found out about it at the same time everybody else did.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   I mean, they're not a great citizen in that regard. I love their products. I use their computers. But, you know, they could have done a better job there.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   Speaking for Ray in August who developed iPod or X, they were terrified when iTunes started supporting podcasts and it did in fact put them out of business and they did not want to be put out of business.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   They wanted to...
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   You can't say that it did in fact put them out of business.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   It did.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   Their sales just plummeted.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   What do you think? Okay.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   No, they told me that.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   Well, cause and effect. I mean, all right. You don't know for a fact that it couldn't have been managed.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   Right?
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   Well, I mean, you're right. I mean, somebody could come along to a third party podcatcher, but I don't see anybody doing it.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   You could say that with any company that goes out of business.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   They're going to be all sorts of reasons.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   That's what I'm saying. Ray, you don't know. I mean, I'm pretty sure.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   No, I don't know, but I can suspect. It seemed to be pretty...
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   That's all I was saying. You can say I suspect and I wouldn't disagree with that.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   Okay. I suspect.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Do you know for a fact? It's like a very specific...
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   No, I don't know for a fact. They were doing fine.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   Apple puts out iTunes. All of a sudden, nobody buys their product anymore. And it could have been because of the sunspots, but it kind of looks like it was iTunes.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   In any event, I don't see anybody coming along saying, "Yeah, I see Yahoo getting out of the business.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   Oh, you know, the pie cuts for three weeks ago."
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   Oh, good. Where is it? Let me download it.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   Flickerfan.org.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   Flickerfan.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   Yeah. You know, you didn't put it in the URL when you introduced me at scripting.com.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   I'm sorry. I just assumed everybody knew. You're right, Dave. Scripting.com.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   200,000 people listen to this podcast, Leo. I don't think they all know. I don't think any of them ever heard of me.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   You and your laughing. Raise your hand if you've heard of me.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   Look at them. Look at them. All raising their hands all over the world.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   They're all holding up the letters.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   Not bad mood today. Dave's in a good mood. Dave's cheerful. He's positively cheerful.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   Now that you mention it.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   John, you should be the authority on cheerfulness.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   So what is this Flickerfan? I'm looking at this. This is interesting. What are you doing here?
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   Well, it's quite a little story. Basically, let's see.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   I went down to visit a friend of mine at a newspaper in South Carolina.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   And I had a few minutes. He had to go to a meeting and I was sitting there in his office.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   He had this screensaver running and there were pictures from current events, sports stuff, world leaders.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   It turns out it's kind of obvious what he was doing. He had his screensaver.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   It was pointed to a folder of AP wire news photos.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   And so I asked him to put together a feed for me. It had those pictures.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   And I put it on my big screen TV and my dad. And every time anybody would come over,
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   it's like they would just get drawn into this thing. It's an amazing thing.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   So I called up some friends. I wanted to make this software publicly available to everybody.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   And so I called up some friends of mine at Associated Press and asked them if they would give me a feed, you know, officially,
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   so that we could do this all legally and, you know, it would be high res.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   And they said yes. So that's the bundle, basically.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   It can also grab stuff off of your Flickr account, your friends' Flickr accounts,
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   and mix all that stuff in there. And then as a result of this, a couple of weeks ago,
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   we got another feed from Aijons-Fronze-Press.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Cool.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   And yeah, and so like we were getting like maybe 20 pictures a day from AP.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   We're getting about a thousand pictures a day from AFP.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   And so that's, you know, AP is more wide, but AFP is like even more worldwide.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   And so that was the first step. And the thought is, let's define what a living room computer is
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   and what does a networked living room computer.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   And so the next thing after that is podcasting.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   I also, of course, had a podcasting client that I had written.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   I wrote mine even before Adam Curry wrote his.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   And so I understood how to do that, and I had one sitting around,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   so I distributed that to all of the users of Flickr fan.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   And slowly we're going to connect all the dots.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   And it's going to be different from Apple TV when it's done.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   And that Apple TV has completely different philosophy.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   And that Apple TV is built on the idea of, you know,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   both making money off of each transaction.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   This takes the podcasting view of things and says,
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   we're not trying to do it quite that way.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   There will be money flowing through here for sure.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   It won't work if there isn't.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   But it's not going to be for the content per se that you're going to be paying the money.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   So that's the idea.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   So it's a picture catcher, but it also will have podcasting catching.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   It is. It has podcast catching.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   It has a podcast credit.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   Cool.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   I'm confused.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Well, that's all right.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Why are you confused?
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   I'm not sure what is the...
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   For one, I don't know.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   I just did the whole thing.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   It's just I'm not getting it.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   No, it's something...
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   I think, and David, this is something maybe you want to address.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   I think RSS in general confuses people.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   Well, I'm not confused by the RSS.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   I'm just trying to figure out what...
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   It's just like to...
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   So you just have a screen saver or something.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   I'm not getting it.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   What puts it in a folder?
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   No, yeah.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   The screen saver stuff goes into a folder and syncs up with a...
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   And it's just a bunch of photos from Agents Press or we're in the front saver.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   Oh, well, no.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   And then you point your back screen saver at the folder that it's managing.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   So you can subscribe to Doc Serll's Photos for sure.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   Which is great stuff.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   Doc's has great photos, yeah.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   So anything that has an RSS feed, you could subscribe to.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   All right.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   So you just have that part now, explain the podcasting part.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Well, Pie Catcher...
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   It just does the same thing only with...
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   Well, it's like listening to the radio.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   It's like listening to the radio, at your living room.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   If it's an activity, you know, listening to news broadcasts or whatever.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   I'm getting this echo, so it's very...
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   Are you still getting an echo?
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   Well, no, I just started getting it again.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   I'm hearing it too.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   Okay.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   So it's...
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   It's coming...
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   I think it looks like it's coming from me.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   Well, let's just...
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Let's discuss this as on a practical basis.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   Which is...
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   Oh, now I'm hearing myself, by the way.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   I'm hearing you twice now.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   How's that?
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   Let me test it.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   No, I'm still hearing it slightly.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   I have no idea what's going on.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   Yeah, it was...
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   You go back to the way it was.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   I didn't touch anything.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   So you sound great, Leo.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   So if you could like interpret for us, that would be great.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   Yeah, I apologize.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   I'm not sure where the echo is coming from.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   So, Dave, how do I get my podcast into the stream?
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   That's what I'm wondering.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   Into your stream?
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   No.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   Into the stream is this...
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   Whatever this is...
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   People would subscribe to it.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   We can't do this.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   I can't...
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   You can't hear it at all.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   Well, no, I can hear it, but it's like reverberating.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Okay, hold on a second.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   Let me look at why...
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   It's worsening.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   It's worsening.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   All right.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Is it better now?
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   Talk.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   Hello, hello, no, it's good.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   It's all fixed.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Okay, well, it's better.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   I know where it's coming from.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   It is coming back to us on the phone channel.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   It's my fault.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   I knew it.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   It is your fault.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   It's the box I'm using.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   For some reason seems to be feeding...
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   All right.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   Let me try to answer John's question.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   Yeah, go ahead and I'll fix it while you're here.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   Go ahead and I'll fix it while you're talking.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   The whole story I told about the pictures, that's a separate story from the podcatcher.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   The podcatcher works more or less the same way you would expect the podcatcher to work.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   If you want to subscribe to this week in technology, you click on the link to say subscribe and you enter the URL of their feed and you click submit and it reads the feed.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   So every time it does a scan, it'll check to see if there's a new podcast from Leo.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   There's nothing fancy about the podcatcher.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   It's pretty plain jane.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   That doesn't mean that it won't get fancy, but right now it's the basic podcatcher functionality.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   Okay.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   I mean, it's back, Eileen.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   It's not widely known yet, but I think we've helped a little bit here.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   Flickerfan.org.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   Yeah, well, I would just say one thing, which is that my bet is that what Dave's doing here is actually creating the ability for people to use a server-based environment to create RSS feeds for themselves with enclosures attached.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   Well, there's that too.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   Absolutely.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   And I think that's a big deal.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   Let me, okay, let me, let me rock that.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   So I could create.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   Oh.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   Rock showed up.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   Yeah, that's a bad sign.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Next, I'll be comparing you to Nazis.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   Is it?
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   It's not?
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   I'll get a bad neck.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   It's Heinlein's law.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   So you're saying, Steve, that I would want to create my own RS, everybody, that everybody would want to create their own RSS feeds locally?
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   Well, I mean, how do you create an RSS feed now?
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   Well, right now you create content on the web and generally whatever you're doing will have, say, a WordPress blog will have an RSS feed.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   Exactly.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   So you use WordPress as a RSS generator.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   Right.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   Okay.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   So here what you can do is you drop into that.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   You both, you just want to be able to assemble all your favorite political broadcasts for the day.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   Right.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   Okay.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   I think you could do that with Dave's software.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   Just put it in, in other words, kind of reverse the process, put it in a folder and, and Flickr fan would broadcast it out, would make an RSS feed out of it.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   Where would I serve that from?
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   Locally?
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   Okay.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   It is.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   Well, they're formats, John.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   So it's like, you know, people get confused between the application and the format, you know, RSS.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   When people talk about RSS, you have to ask, you know, what are you talking about?
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   Are you talking about the reader that you use or the blogging tool that you use or the actual RSS feed, which is almost never when you're talking about it.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   In your mind, RSS is merely a specification.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   Well, no, I have a pretty, you know, if I talk to people about it, I have to try to bring it to them on their terms.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   You know, you say people have a hard time understanding it.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   The best way I've found to just to explain it to people is to say that it's, that it's automated web surfing.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   And that's something most people can understand is that, you know, when you're, you know, browsing around the web, you're sort of, you know, you're doing it manually.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   But if you sort of have a pattern to that, then you can teach the computer how to do that for you.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   And then, ideally, it would only find the new things.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   Now, that's, I think we're a lot of the RSS readers today have fallen down because they're not very good at doing that.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   But, you know, that's another story.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   Can I just ask?
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   I mean, this is something that I would love as the ultimate RSS application.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   So I have to say, I've never used RSS much because I tend to like, I want to go to a website and scan the headlines.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   Right?
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   But what I would love is for an RSS service to pick out stuff that it thinks I would like based on things like, you know, every blog has everything that's tagged, like crazy now, every blog entry.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   Is, can you, is there any specification or any way of getting an RSS reader to bring you particularly tagged items for a blog?
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   You know what's, you know, I use it. I think this is what you would like.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   Both a feed hub and a RSS have, will look at your OPML and then create a feed for you of the most highly quote ranked stories in that based on, I guess, how other people are linking to it.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   It's, it creates kind of a hot feed for you.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   But feed hub does this and I think a RSS does it a little bit better, A-I-D-E-R-S-S.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   Is that, I'm not sure if that's exactly what you're thinking, but what I do is I subscribe to a feed created by AID RSS that's a meta feed of all, from my OPL, OPML, of highly ranked stories in that big pile of stories that I get every day.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   Okay.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   A-I-D-E-R-S-S.com.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   That'll be worth it.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   So it says it uses post rank, whatever the hell that is, to score, filter and track performances.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   Well, that's like, it's like, it's like tech meme.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   It's a meta feed.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   This brings up an interesting issue, which is that if you do that Leo and there's so many things that are tagged as Will says, how can we come on the show today and you say right out from the outset we got nothing.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   I got 18,000 pieces of nothing.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   Yeah, there's too much of nothing.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   Too much nothing.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   Man, Phil, he'll with ease.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   That's a Bob Dylan quote.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   I like it.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   Say it again?
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   Too much of nothing.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   Makes a man feel he'll with ease.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   As usual, Dylan always has the limo joust.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   So, to get back to our original discussion, you feel like it is an open playing field for somebody who really understands RSS Dave and can create these useful tools for people.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   I do.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   In fact, the reason why I feel that way is that nobody has yet made a --
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   I was going to say a podcast player that really, really works.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   How about Google Reader works pretty well.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   It's web based.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   And the iPod is not a very good podcast player.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   The iPod was designed to play music.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   And music, if you think about it, is very different from a podcast.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   A podcast is something that you listen to once and that's it.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   Whereas music, you buy a song for 99 cents and if it threw it out after one listen, you'd be pretty upset.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   The other thing that you're going to carry around with you is specifically for the purpose of listening to podcasts, you would design it very differently from the way iTunes works.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   Very, very different.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   What would you do?
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   How would it look?
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   Well, to begin with, it would have the pod catcher would be built into the device itself.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   And it would have Wi-Fi capabilities and it would not have to tether with a desktop.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   So I guess if you had an iPod touch and Apple opened the SDK, you could write such a thing because of the Wi-Fi built in the touch.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   Yeah, well, what do you want to bet that they don't open the SDK for that right now?
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   Yeah, there's a lot of Fs in that one.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   Plus, it ought to cost a little bit less than an iPod touch cost too.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   I mean, think about it.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   What would the basic components of that be?
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   And also, I would say one of the important features is that it doesn't come from Apple because we'd love to seek some competition here.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   There's another one that I consider basic requirement for this is that it has to be possible for me to put my own software on there.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   And because, you know, if you end up beholden to one company, provide all the software, we know where that goes.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   And there's a stirred thing is that you have to be able to record a podcast on it as well as listen to one.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   We've been all good platforms and John, you know, we all probably go back far enough to remember the Apple II and the IBM PC and the early days of the Mac.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   The thing that makes a platform successful is the fact that you can use the platform itself to create software for the platform.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   Well, you can't use an iPod to create software for the iPod, which would be basically, you know, music or podcasts.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   So those three things, you know, it needs to be able to get it, get the podcast without having to tether up to anything.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   And it's totally technically possible and not very expensive.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   Well, you know what you're suggesting here, I did not interrupt your stream of consciousness.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   Oh, that's okay.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   But you're suggesting here is essentially a real use for what has been a floundering subcategory of kind of a palm-based small computers,
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   pocket computers or whatever you want to call them, the ones that have been usurped by the phone.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   You know, these little things that run this little dinky, you know what I'm talking about.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   PDAs.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   Listen, there's the word.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   You don't have to go too far back.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   Go listen to the, you know, you work for Adam now, right?
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   So Adam and I were doing a series of podcasts in the fall of 2004 called Trade Secrets.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   And this is what we were talking about is what would podcatchers look like?
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   You know, we were hoping, you know, a year or two down the road.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   Well, here we are like four years later.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   And, you know, nobody wants to, well, that's right.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   And if you want to understand why, well, don't depend on iPod or X to do it.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   It's a big business, right?
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   To make this hardware, you would need to have like the kind of money that podshow raised originally would have been a good amount of money to create one of these things.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   And, you know, went in a different, I would say, not a very productive direction.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   I think there'd be much more courageous to have said, let's just go make this thing really work.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   And nobody's not a yet.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   It's kind of running to the idea of making a dedicated podcast player kind of runs against the traditional thinking and consumer electronics right now, which is that people want more converged devices, not less converged devices.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   They want a phone that can do music and audio.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   That's not a part of music player that can do Wi-Fi and internet.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   And actually what people want is eventually, you know, five years down the line, one device that is just phone, mobile internet, music.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   Yeah, you get one device with a lot of mediocre stuff in it.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   Well, don't we do necessary one of your two devices?
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   I wish you wouldn't focus on that part of it because there was no requirement that it be a standalone device and only do this.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   But in order to, I mean, I'm a software designer and developer, in order to actually understand these things, you need to sort of like zero in on what the feature set has to be minimally.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   Well, of course, any general purpose laptop can do that.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   Right, that's true. And that's one of the reasons why I wanted to make a podcatcher and get that all right.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   You know, first, and user tested and make sure that everybody's happy with it before we even think about what the next steps are going to be.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   Steve, you were saying that this though, it becomes you serve it yourself.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   I mean, you're saying that I would run a server on my system that is serving my own RSS feeds kind of?
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   No, well, what I'm saying is that, you know, if you look at what's going on, this so-called on-demand software as a service revolution, it's, you know, all the data is stored in the cloud.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   It's, you know, cloud computing. So the ability to be able to create RSS feeds, not in your system, not under your, you know, requiring your knowledge of programming, et cetera, et cetera, is, I think, a very valuable asset that will proliferate.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   If you look at things like Twitter and Facebook and just all these platforms which are basically offloaded from your hard drive to the network services that you can configure more or less granularly, hopefully more and more as time goes on, this becomes, you know, a console, sort of a dashboard that people are going to want to use.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   What about something like Friend Feed, which is an aggregation of my feeds that I can follow somebody else's. Friendfeed.com. This just went public last week.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   Right, but you know, I don't think Friend Feed supports enclosures, for example.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   Ah, well, it kind of does. If you subscribe to somebody's feed, you'll see their images, but then you do click to get the full image on Flickr.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   So, yeah, you're right. It would be nice if it included the actual data files.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   I just want to push back a little bit on something that Dave's saying, and not Dave specifically, but just the notion that these sort of panacea of if we can just all get together, you know, the Rodney King approach to software development.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   I just don't buy it. I think that what happens is things like what Dave's doing. What he calls the first step, I think is the step.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   I don't see a player coming along, you know, and somehow by player, I mean software or hardware manufacturer coming along and suddenly usurping Apple.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   I mean, these guys are brilliant at design. They may not be better than the imaginary better system that has never been created, but they're the best ones out there.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   And they're going to continue to be the best ones out there. And they have tremendous market force.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   And the real battle, I think, is to uncrate the SDKs little by little to the point where we can do what we want to.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   What Dave wants to do in not having to be tethered to the machine, to the laptop, and to go straight to the device with over Wi-Fi, that is what we want.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   But how do we get there? I don't think that we get there by trying to create an ad hoc, you know, revolutionary group of hardware manufacturers.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   Let me give you a counter example, okay? And maybe you're right. I'm not saying that that's not right, Steve.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   And I use an iPod and I bought everything. I, you know, tried everything and what I take with me is an iPod.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   So I'm pretty flexible about it. I'm not like religious about not using Apple stuff. I'll use it if it's the best thing out there to use.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   But we've had an interesting thing happen over the last few days relative Twitter and Pounce.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   I was just going to bring that up because Pounce, yeah. Yeah.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   Including the full fee.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   Well, yeah. Well, no, no, no. Pounce, they both have APIs, right?
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   And for the long time, Pounce didn't have an API. Then they came out with a pretty limited API, right?
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   And sometime in the last two or three days, I never got an email from anybody saying, "You need to go look at this. It just sort of happened to stumble across."
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   I think on Friday they released it. Yeah.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   Now all of a sudden they've leapfrogged Twitter and they're giving us all this new capability that I have been asking for openly, you know, I call it payloads.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   And I've been asking for it because I've been doing all this development around Twitter to send photographs over Twitter to send podcasts over Twitter.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   You know, we have Twitter as a voicemail system, basically.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   But here's the one that broke Twitter. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   But there's a one that broke Twitter. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   And of course, I kind of understood this. Sometimes when the competitor does something, then you have to do it, right?
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   And so if we can put this stalking, this, you know, sort of thing that Apple has to go catch out in front of them, then we'll get what we want out of Apple.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   Apple won't give us what we want just because they're guys. But companies, you know, I've always learned this when I was running a software company and I've watched lots of people run technology companies.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   And the people you listen to, the best are your competitors. You don't listen to users. You like to say that you do, but you listen to your competitors.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   And so that's what, it's in that spirit, Steve, that I say, "We need somebody other than Apple to do this because you'll sit around waiting forever for Apple to you."
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   Maybe for all I know they may have it and that may be the thing they're going to announce on Thursday, you know, and then I would be one happy camper if that happened.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   Seems unlikely. So what did, tell us a little bit about what Pounds did that you think is so good.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   Oh, it's two way. I mean, it basically, there are two things. First of all, you can now post to Pounds in addition to being able to read stuff through the API.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   But you can also post content. So you could say, for example, you wanted to distribute this weekend technology to everybody who subscribed to you on Pounds.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   We could give you a programmatic way to do that. You could drop the MP3 into a folder and it would automatically just lift it up there and you wouldn't have to do another thing.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   So we like that a lot. And you know, in Twitter, you can do that, but you have to put the URL into the actual message itself.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   And people say they like that, but I don't think I don't like it. And I'm a techie, you know.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   There's already pushback about all the hashtags, all the crap that's in the Twitter post.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   I think we ought to start taking the crap out that, you know, they call that in, I heard Paul Saffo, first guy, I heard to say this.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   He said, we need to pave the cow paths. That's how technology works at its best.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   You know, in other words, you figure out where the cows are going and then there are a few generations later. That's where I-80 goes, right, John, where we live.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   Yeah, except I prefer to have the cows.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   Tell me about it. I can see John's house right now, I think, from my window here.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   Are you in a car?
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   No, I'm in my study upstairs.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   Let me get my 30-ot-6.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   You're going to put the Confederate flag out the window.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   Well, it's interesting. It sounds like people are making motions in this direction.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   People get, I think, you know, we're seeing a real evolution of how people use RSS and how people- I love it, that people are exposing APIs like that.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   It's an incredible time of movement. Things are really, really moving now.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   Steve's very psyched. Right, Steve?
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   Yeah, I just-
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   Sounds like-
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   No, no, you have to listen very carefully, though. He just reads again.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   I mean, this is my show, or I would be- I would be unstoppable.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   Go ahead.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   Trust me. I've got to cut the coffee. I'll sit back. I'll relax.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   Well, all right, so this thing about Pounce.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   Now, I've been polling people this afternoon about who's going to win Ohio because I talk about this other thing that we can't talk about, like, called the election.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   You could talk about it? Oh, yeah.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   So this other thing, the election in Ohio, seems to be where it's coming down to.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   So I've asked, you know, who's going to win Ohio? What do you think's going to win Ohio on this call?
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   Oh, Baba.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   Oh, I don't know. It's- Hillary's still got the poll numbers, right?
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   Uh-huh.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   It's going to be a tough one. I'm predicting a tie in the- a- win in Texas for Obama to tie in Ohio.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   Okay, and Dvorak, you're not going to answer, right?
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   Well, I- I- I like to bet on these things, and I- and this one's, to me, is not- is- is a toss-up.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   Unproduced on that. Yeah.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   So I've not making any sort of-
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   There's no Vegas line. Is that what you're saying?
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   There's no line on this, yeah. You pick them, is the- is the ticket.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   Pick them.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   And will, uh, do you consider this the- I think, uh, Ohio for Clinton, but, uh, Texas for Obama?
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   Okay, so, oh, all right. So it's three to one, uh, Hillary.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   So now, the second poll that I, uh, uh, uh, ginned up was, uh, Twitter versus Pounce, one year from now.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   Which one will be, uh, the winner? Twitter. Uh, that's what I think.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   And it's not- 'cause it's not about API. Look, their functionality's been there for Pounce for a long time.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   No, but it is about API. It's about the fact that what Dave's doing, whether he wants to say so or not, is he- he's just trying to get Twitter to do what he's been wanting to get-
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   Well, he kind of intimated that. Yeah.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   Yeah, I mean, he- he- he- he intimated it, but, you know, is he really gonna be developing on Pounce?
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   That's not what I want, Steve. What I want is a two-party system. I want it- I want at least a two-party system.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   Yeah, and so what I- you know, you asked what we think is gonna happen versus what we want to have.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   But you guys are talking about technology, and I think you're missing the social side of this, which is- I mean, why is Facebook successful right now?
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   'Cause everybody's there. It's not gonna be successful forever, but at some point somebody will come along.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   I think that's why people are on Twitter. That's totally correct.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   I would hate to- I don't want to be on Twitter. I- I far preferred Pounce. I far preferred Jai-ku.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   Twitter is a piece of junk. It's down half the time. But it's where everybody is.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   But the reason it's down half the time is because it's where everybody is.
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   Well, we could argue that. I mean, you know, are you saying it's impossible to design something like this that would work, that would scale?
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   Eventually, if they get 300 million from Microsoft, though, it'll- you know, suddenly it'll work.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   Right. It's not scaling very well right now. But neither is past, to be honest.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   He reminded me of what's at Yogi Barrow, who said, you know, nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   I like the community on Twitter. I dislike the functionality on Twitter.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   Oh, you dislike the name Leo.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   Well, that was another issue, but I mean, I got over that.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   Can you get a settlement?
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   This is an aside for, you know, elegance and simplicity, right? Twitter just does-
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   Twitter is simple without being elegant.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   That's just what it is. But I mean, I think most people prefer, like Twitter, most people prefer Twitter.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   They would just like it to work.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   No.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   I mean, that's- I eventually gave up using it because I had one of these desktop clients and it seemed like every other message I was posting was just like going into the ether.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   That was for most of last week. Nothing I posted was seen anywhere.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   Let's just look at it. There's a fork in the red for Twitter here. Okay.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   If Twitter doesn't implement the payload functionality, then there will be applications that develop on pounds that will be unique to pounds.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   If they do implement the payload functionality, then pounds has got a problem.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   What do you think the audience, what you're talking about?
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   Okay. Right. So, like, I have an iPhone, right?
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   And so, if I go down to, you know, I'm going to take it a walk and I see some beautiful flowers or something on it.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   So, I take a picture of that, right? And then I say, I want to email this picture to Flickr, which is a basic feature that Flickr has.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   And so, I do that and I type in the title for it. I say, beautiful flowers.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   And that goes up to Flickr. Now, I've got a script that's sitting on one of my servers, which anybody can use.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   It's called Twittergram.com. And what it's doing is watching my Flickr account.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   And when a picture shows up there, it then sends a link to that picture to Twitter.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   So, everybody that subscribed to me on Twitter now sees that picture.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   It's a very simple idea. It says, well, Twitter works great for, you know, short text messages.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   Why not send pictures over Twitter, too? Right. That's a, that's what I want to do.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   That's enough other people want to do it. It just sort of makes sense that you want to do it.
[00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   Now, does Twitter do that or does Twitter not do that? That's the fundamental question.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   And pounds does do that. Yeah, pounds does it beautifully.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   And Twitter does it in a very ugly way. I can throw the URL into the message and ultimately,
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   and for right now, that's everybody's willing to live with that.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   But when you see how beautifully it works on pounds, you might say, oh, wow, I would like to have that.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   That's very elegant. I would like to have that in Twitter.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   That's what I say when I saw, I put, you know, post up yesterday.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   It's on tech meme right now. I just noticed, you know, basically, you can illustrate the benefit
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   from a user standpoint, very graphically. It's pretty versus ugly.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   And pretty counts in software. It really does. You know, do you have to compromise the simplicity of Twitter to do this?
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   Yeah, a little bit. You have to give up a little bit.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   Where do you have to compromise? I said a little bit.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   All right. And then a very little bit. How do you compromise a little bit?
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   A little bit. You put a, now it gets a little bit more complicated.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   Okay. So now there's a little icon on every--
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   Let me, why do you want to save Twitter? If you've got pounds, why not just go to pounds?
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   It's not my decision. You see, I don't give a bleep.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   Whether Twitter gets saved or pounds is the winner, it doesn't matter to me.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   Well, most users, though, who are not engulfed in all of this as you are, are just going to choose.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   They're going to go. They're going to say, and right now they're choosing Twitter for reasons I'm not sure I fully understand.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   I guess because that's where everybody is.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   I guess. I mean, of course that's why.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   Listen, some people use Blogger and some people use LiveJournal, right?
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   Why did some people choose to use LiveJournal when Blogger does everything everybody would like?
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   But that's different because Blog is not as much about community.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   Twitter and Pounds are all about community.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   I beg to differ. Live Journal is very much about community. That was the differentiator.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   That's what made it different. Why didn't everybody go to Blogger to LiveJournal?
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   Because some people like this mix of features better than that mix of features.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   Why didn't you put it on Twitter? Because it's the only app that's on the channel.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   It's it. Pounds had too many problems. It was invite only, and they're not directly comparable.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   They don't look the same, right?
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   The Pounds message is a big thing.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   The Twitter thing is a little thing.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   We already have a payload in text. It's called the Blog World.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   Why do we need to reduplicate that in one packet?
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   So you're in favor of 140 characters, period.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   It's not in favor of it.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   Am I in favor of these things they call paintings?
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   It seems kind of limiting the only information.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   Can I interrupt for a second?
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   Yes.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   I want to apologize to the audience because under most circumstances,
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   I'd be in here into this debate,
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   tapping these guys and wrap it up, or let's move on to the next topic.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   But there's a weak spot here, and I want to just mention it,
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   and I want to apologize in advance.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   I actually like listening to this kind of weird discussion,
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   so I'm kind of enjoying the banter, and you guys can all turn the podcast off as you don't.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   Thank you, John.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   I'm not going to do anything about it.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   Thank you for saying that, and I appreciate you're telling everybody to stop listening.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   I'm letting it go too, because I think it's just fascinating.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   I think it's actually a very important conversation.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   Yeah, we need to stop listening.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   By the way, Leo, I'm going to ask him if I can tell him that maybe they should stop listening,
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   but not until they go to audible.com.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   Does that help?
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   Yeah, stick around for the commercial.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   That's going to be the best part of the show today.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   No.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   This is fascinating stuff, and I think it really comes as very important stuff.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   No, it's interesting to me because there are these are seminal software systems out there
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   that are jockeying for all kinds of positions that are not generally well known by the public.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   I mean, they're known by all the insiders, and yeah, there's a lot of people, but still,
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   if you looked at true market share, it's not mass market.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   It's not even close.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   But until John de Vorex starts saying that it's absolutely boldness, it's not going to take off anyway.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   So, you know, we're just waiting for you, John.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   That's why you want to have Steve around.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   I think John said Twitter was bold to begin with.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   I think John is already on record as well.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   Okay.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   I mean, I didn't see that.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   I saw the blogging as boldness, podcasting as boldness.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   You know, I didn't want to go.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   I'll tell you what the thing is with Twitter.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   I've had too many guys who have found very interesting and practical uses for the product
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   for generating messages to a group of people that may be just subscribing to one feed.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   And I've seen other use, and generally speaking, people who just get on Twitter and they blab
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   and they're infected, they're at a stoplight or they want to show out the fact they got
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   a new cell phone that's got a keyboard and they talk about it or they say stupid things
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   that are just like, "Oh, I watched the movie last night.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   It sucked."
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   And things like that to me is just a bunch of hot air that is not necessary.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   That shouldn't even be in the cloud.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   But there are a lot of other actual practical uses that people are developing for some of these systems.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   They're actually quite fascinating whether, you know, the shooting a million photographs
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   and having them distributed over pounds.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   There's one of them, I'm not sure, but I can see where it could come in handy in the case of an emergency
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   or if you had an emergency crew or there was a police department that wanted to, you know,
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   had a bunch of guys with little cameras and you could coordinate this information.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   It was used as information.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   Yeah, I'm not going to, I mean, I think just part of it's both and part of it's really pretty cool.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:36.000]   But I mean, part of it is surely like, for me, what I find, I think, slightly not annoying
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:43.000]   but curious, is that there are so many degrees of doing almost the same thing in a slightly different way.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   Going from everything from like, you've got a blog, which is kind of more like the whole payload thing.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   It's more long-form.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   Then you've got like a ton blog, which is kind of like shorter, but it seems to be more like a pound stream.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   But the pound stream has got a little bit of like calendar on there as well.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   And then from the pound stream, you can sort of go on to like Twitter, which is kind of mostly just text anyway.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   And from Twitter, you've got text messages.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   And it seems like there's these, you know, and then at the other end as well, you've got Facebook,
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   which is basically the same friends feed and with all the applications that you've got.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   You've got adding your photos and all that kind of things.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   It seems like 10 different ways to do basically the same thing.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   I just- I don't think they are though.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   Do you really need to use all those different things?
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   Twitter's made for personality spamming in a way that nothing else is.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   My question is why is Twitter so sticky?
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   There's something sticky about Twitter that maybe it's just me, but I find it very difficult not to log into Twitter.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000]   Oh, it's one of the biggest puzzles out there.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   Twitter is something different for everybody who uses it.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   That's one of the things you see almost off the bat, you know?
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   Depending on who you follow or-
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   And how many people you follow versus how many people follow you?
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:04.000]   Like, okay, I was surprised to find out you don't have 65,000 followers, Leo, but that's what it says.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   You basically have what, like 7,000 followers?
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   Something like that, yeah.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   And how many people do you follow?
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   Just 200.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000]   Unlike Scoble who has 11,000 followers and followed.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   It's unthinkable to do that.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   Well, I don't know what you would- that would make it useless if you asked me.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000]   Pretty much, I agree.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   I generally try to keep it about 10%.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000]   So I subscribe follows 10% of the people who follow me.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000]   I just add- when somebody says something interesting or responsive, just add them.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   That's how it- but it's a very different thing from an RSS reader where you don't add people quite so easily as you would in Twitter.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000]   Twitter is a lot like an RSS reader more than it is like a blog, I think.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   If you follow the right people, it is.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   I mean, I found it a great resource for stories.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   What I found this fascinating is that I saw a guy who had like 500 followers and was following nobody.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   Zero.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000]   So for him, Twitter is a completely different animal.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   Yeah, Hillary is not following anybody.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   Barack is following everybody.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   No, it was.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000]   Somebody you know that does that.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   It's not, it was a person.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000]   I don't want to say who it is because I don't want to like make that an issue.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   But I found- and so if you ask those two people how- what Twitter is, you get a very, very different answer.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   So it's- and people have all these debates about what Twitter is.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.000]   You know, a lot of people think that it's a chat room, but it's totally not a chat room.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   It might be used very differently.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   So that's why I like it because this is a fascinating thing.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000]   It changes a lot all the time.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   I can't stop using it.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   It bugs the hell out of me.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:51.000]   The thing that I think is really sticky about it is that there are these layers of concentric circles that overlap each other.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   It's like a big Venn diagram.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:02.000]   And you may be thinking you're talking to a small group, but the people that you're talking to are talking to a whole bunch of other small groups.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   Yeah.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   And all of a sudden, Scoville pops in and then you're talking to 7,000 or Leo LaPorte's and it just expands in ways that are very much like, you know, those waves that people do at the ballpark.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   I mean, this is- this is- we don't understand what is really going on here yet.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000]   I don't think so.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:30.000]   I can tell you this much is that if fascism ever takes over this country, it's going to be using one of these mechanisms to fuddle the public with false information.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000]   That's very insightful, John.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   You know, you were talking before about government using it and sort of the boring use that everybody talks about it.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:42.000]   So the fire department will be using this to get information about what- where there's a fire.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   But this is a messiah.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000]   This is a messiah attack on Obama.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.000]   No, I'm-
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   Well, can I just say the point I was trying to make is that it'll be used for governance.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   It'll be used for people who use this kind of technology are going to run circles around the people who don't, so they'll get elected.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   And then this will be a whole other thing, you know.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000]   It'll be the meeting place for- What do you mean will?
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000]   That's what's happening right now.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:14.000]   Do you think Obama's building followers on Twitter and that's a significant number?
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   Steve Fins, that's a sure.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:26.000]   If you- if you follow Obama's Twitter feed, somebody or a bot follows you back within about a minute.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   Right.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000]   Instantly.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   Yeah.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000]   He's using the same bot that Scobel is no doubt.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   And you know, how do you harvest these $100 contributions that are all spur of the moment?
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   Yeah, and you know, it's funny.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000]   As soon as somebody contributes to Obama, and I've done this and I know you have Dave, you post it.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000]   And there is a certain mentality.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:52.000]   And I'll tell you, in some way, whether it's significant, I don't know.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:58.000]   I mean, it's not exactly a mass phenomenon, but there is definitely an Obama wave on Twitter.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   Absolutely.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:06.000]   Is that more to do with the technology or to do with the demographic of the people who really adopt us of that technology?
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.000]   How would you know? I have no idea.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.000]   Yeah.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   That's the question.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000]   It's observable.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000]   I think Obama's been very successful with his own kind of social network.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:20.000]   His my.obarm or whatever it is, which seems to have an awful lot of people on it.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   This is probably just an extension of it, isn't it?
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000]   Really.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   For a sort of online contributions.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:31.000]   I mean, you can also get a bomber and all kinds of, you know, they've been very good at widgetizing him on the web,
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000]   which I think is pretty impressive for a campaign.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   Wigitized presidency.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000]   I like it.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   You just see what my inbox looks like right now.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000]   Okay.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000]   I've got one guy subscribed to me on Friend Feed.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   One guy on Pounce wants to be my friend on Pounce.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   Another guy is following me on Twitter.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000]   Two more guys are following me on Twitter.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   Friend Feed Twitter.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000]   I mean, that's all I get in the email anymore.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   Okay.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000]   Let me play a little bit play the devil's advocate.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   This is it's just it's all personality spam.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000]   It's a big old echo chamber.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   Is it really any value in this the conversations that are going on in this 140 character world?
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000]   I mean, you find value in the simple.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000]   Yeah.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000]   Absolutely.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   Because people don't read blog posts anymore.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000]   Okay.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000]   And they don't listen to podcasts.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   We lost almost everybody.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000]   You know, the 200,000 people listen to your podcast.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000]   They download it.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000]   They're gone.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.000]   They're way way.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000]   But, but, but 140 characters.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000]   That's within the realm of possibility.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000]   Yeah.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   So you might be able to get an idea.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   I'm so jaded by the bloke zapase.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000]   You know, bloke is fair is in the.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000]   It's not that it's a.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000]   It's just it's just that you're only going to get skimmers for the most part.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000]   And heaven forbid we actually have some thoughtful content out there instead of these
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000]   140 characters.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000]   I try.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000]   I try man.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   I try.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000]   But I get flayed.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000]   Actually, okay.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000]   Now I'm going to back off.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.000]   And I do think that Twitter is the doorway to the more thoughtful character.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000]   Absolutely.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000]   Very frequently you'll follow a Twitter post to something more thoughtful.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:09.000]   And I have more access to the 140 characters or a vast waste of time.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.000]   That means it is now officially important.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000]   Yay.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000]   We have a watershed.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.320]   And I should point out that both I've posted and I know some others have posted already
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:21.800]   on Twitter and Pounce that we're having this conversation.
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:26.120]   There are a thousand people watching us on video right now and listening live.
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:27.760]   So just the coincidence.
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:29.160]   Is that a lot?
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:31.400]   Is that more than usually would be?
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:32.600]   Yeah.
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:33.840]   Not a lot more than usually would be.
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:40.000]   I noticed that there is a lag in somehow there's not an instantaneous response, which I
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.480]   would have thought there would have been when you post this stuff.
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:43.480]   There is a lag of some time.
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:46.480]   I don't think people are constantly monitoring.
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:47.560]   I thought I do.
[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:49.000]   I thought everybody else did.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000]   But what happens?
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.480]   The mechanics of the @ sign in Twitter are also very interesting.
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:59.240]   Some were the best to understand even if you stare at the screen all day like I do and
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:00.760]   try and figure it out.
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:02.000]   Oh, that's the least of it.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.800]   And then all of a sudden you get these hashtags.
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:05.640]   Yeah, I don't even know what those mean.
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:06.640]   What is it?
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:09.240]   And I'm following, you know, I'm streaming live via quick.
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:10.240]   Follow me now.
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:11.240]   What is that?
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:12.240]   Well, but.
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:14.240]   What's the spam on here?
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:17.760]   How about, you know, that's another thing when the spam, when the real spam machines
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.560]   get into full full play.
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:21.320]   Well, Twitter is spam free.
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:23.760]   You don't follow somebody who spams.
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:24.760]   You just leave them.
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:25.760]   Right.
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:27.760]   You block it and they're done.
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:29.760]   That's the, that's what somebody pointed out.
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:36.080]   What happens, what happens in one of these systems when some nefarious person or government
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:41.720]   or something similar gets a hold of the inside and starts posting for Dave Weiner or there's
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:45.440]   a panic situation in some city and somebody gets a hold of the feed.
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:48.360]   It's like, you know, in those, in those banana republics where they always say, you first
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:50.800]   thing you want to do is you want to take over the broadcasting station.
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:53.520]   You want to buy, get the, take over the radio.
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:15:01.240]   Somebody impersonating Robert Scoble with his little N95, you know, there are multiple
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:03.440]   failover channels on the internet.
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:04.440]   Exactly.
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:05.440]   Exactly.
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:07.240]   That would be Philip Seymour Hoffman.
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:08.240]   Exactly.
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:11.560]   I would love to see Hoffman play Scoble.
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:12.560]   Oh, you will.
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.560]   He'll get the laugh down.
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:15.560]   He'll get the laugh down.
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:17.120]   If he could do Capote, he could do Scoble.
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:18.120]   Let's go.
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:20.120]   Who plays who in the movie?
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:21.720]   Who plays Julio?
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:23.720]   This could not get any more insight base.
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:24.720]   I think Colin Farrell.
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.520]   Who in the book?
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:32.200]   What's interesting, I just, I do want to point this out that while about a thousand people
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:36.960]   now are fighting, it is going up fairly rapidly on the, on the stream.
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:38.920]   There's also a conversation going on on Twitter.
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:40.560]   They're responding to us on Twitter.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:41.560]   Oh, really?
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:42.560]   Yeah.
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:43.560]   Oh, man.
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:44.560]   You know what?
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:45.560]   Who cares?
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:48.840]   Well, at the end of the day, do I have an extra five bucks in my pocket?
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:49.840]   No.
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:50.840]   No, you're right.
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:54.360]   It may, it may, that's what, that's what my kind of my original premise is in, in some
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:57.800]   ways, this may just be a big ass echo chamber and who the hell cares.
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:00.840]   Would people have a paid for the people on Twitter?
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:01.840]   No.
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:02.840]   Ah, jeez.
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:03.840]   Who cares?
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:04.840]   There will be a reason to do it.
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:05.840]   I need help.
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:08.600]   I'll, I'll, the four hundred and forty characters.
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:10.520]   You want people to pay?
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:15.040]   That's, maybe that's the best, maybe that's the best part of Twitter of all is that there
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:17.120]   is no way to monetize it.
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:18.120]   It's too short.
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:19.120]   Yeah.
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:21.120]   You can't monetize it.
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.120]   There's not enough content.
[01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:23.120]   Yeah.
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:24.120]   You should say that with Google.
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:25.120]   Yeah.
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:26.120]   All right.
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:27.120]   Moving on.
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:28.120]   Although I, I don't know what else there is to talk about.
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:30.200]   I thought this was kind of an interesting conversation.
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:34.680]   Anybody want to get a last word in before I bring up my Microsoft's $1.35 billion fine.
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:38.040]   Ah, that's the sole European.
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:41.640]   Let us know when you're finished with them.
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:42.640]   Okay.
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:44.200]   I'm, I want to know what you mean by that.
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:47.800]   What do they get fined for for the Microsoft or something?
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:52.720]   The European Union has now leveled another fine, a $1.35 billion fine against Microsoft
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:57.520]   on Wednesday for anti-competitive actions, whatever, you know, the, for being Microsoft.
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:59.520]   Do you hit it on the, you hit the nail on the head.
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:06.840]   Well, when are you going to see Google get fined for the sound rate, just privacy violations?
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:07.840]   Which ones are you talking about?
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:12.240]   Oh, I'm just, this is my, you know, come over and listen to my show some time.
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:15.840]   Are you, are you, you have a link you've prepared to share with us?
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:16.840]   No.
[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:17.840]   Okay.
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:23.840]   Microsoft's now we got more than 2.3 billion in fines to the EU.
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:24.840]   Jump change for them.
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:25.840]   That's a good point.
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:27.840]   Should just pay it and move on.
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:29.440]   Mike, they have to do.
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:31.440]   There's no, hey, this, yeah.
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:33.840]   That's what they should do.
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:34.840]   Yes.
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:36.640]   In fact, it's not that chumpy in terms of change.
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:41.040]   And if I was a Microsoft, I mean, the, the, the fine they just got the 1.35 billion was
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:46.040]   because they were still failing to comply with the order that they laid down, you know,
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:47.040]   have them many years ago.
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:52.240]   If I was a Microsoft shareholder, I'd be like, who are Microsoft's lawyers that they cannot
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:57.040]   decode and comply with a legal order?
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:00.840]   I mean, they've just thrown one and a half, you know, whatever is one and a half.
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:01.840]   Yeah.
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:06.600]   But you know what my, my, my thinking is, is that they, Microsoft was told to, was told
[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:11.480]   to like, you know, open the kimono as it were and show, you know, how to interconnect with
[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:12.480]   the document.
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:13.480]   Which they have done.
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:14.480]   They published a 135 page document.
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:17.920]   They've got some of it done, but it's not, it wasn't all done.
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:21.680]   I think why it took so long is because Microsoft had to go in and clean up the code.
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:24.160]   I honestly, you're embarrassed by the comments.
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:27.760]   If they went in and they actually just blew this stuff out and people looked at it, they
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:30.800]   go, my God, this is a miracle of stuff even works.
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:32.960]   John, I have big news for you.
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:33.960]   Okay.
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:38.400]   So, I'm going to go to the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.400]   of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom

[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:28.240]   A payload! Thank you everybody! Another Twit!

[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:42.240]   Hey I just got a note Leo
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:46.240]   What? This is from a good friend of mine saying
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:48.240]   I'm listening to life to Twit!
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:52.240]   Could you tell Leo that everyone else's voice is noticeably lower than
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:57.240]   Leo's? His voice is booming and they have to strain to hear everyone else
[01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:01.240]   Well that's how I do it! That's how I roll baby!
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:04.240]   That's a feature not a bug! What are you talking about?
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:06.240]   I'm just trying to get the thing off but I have a hell of a time
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:08.240]   when blue screens like forget it
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:13.240]   I'm killing you!
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:16.240]   Round the morning!
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:18.240]   I'm on the Twit!
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:22.240]   I'm on the Twit! Alright! I'm on the Twit baby!
