[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500]   It's time for Twitch.
[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.420]   This week in tech, we've got a great panel, Wesley Faulkner, who's going to announce
[00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.520]   a new job.
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.400]   It was a very big three-letter company.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.020]   Christina Warren, who's got a great job at Microsoft, a senior cloud developer advocate,

[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.400]   Apple Samsung settlement.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.400]   It's over.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.000]   Our long nightmare is over.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.440]   And why you want a louder keyboard.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.840]   It's all coming up next on Twitch.
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.040]   Netcast, you love.

[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.800]   It's time for Twitch this week in tech, the show where we get together with the best tech
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.560]   journalists in the biz and talk about the week's tech news.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.420]   We're going to have a lot of fun today because we have a great panel starting with all the
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.280]   way to my left, Mr. Tech Burger.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.080]   And now I should call you Mr. FuelFix.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.600]   I'm helping with that.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.520]   I'm learning a lot about the energy industry.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:31.120]   They've got me doing some of our business website pages as well as tech burger.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.640]   And I'm having a good time.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.640]   It's really interesting.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.520]   Well, if you're in Houston, you can tell you the difference between upstream and downstream,
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.520]   Leo.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.720]   No, thanks.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.720]   If you're in...
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.360]   It doesn't sound interesting at all.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.920]   If you're in Houston, FuelFix is probably an important read, I would imagine.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.920]   Yeah.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.200]   It's the core of our energy coverage.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.200]   Interesting.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.920]   Houston Chronicle, a longtime Houston Chronicle guy.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.440]   And it's great to have you.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.000]   A longtime Twit member.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.960]   I remember sitting with Dwight in 2010 when the iPad was announced.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.480]   We won't bring up your verdict on the iPad, however.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.880]   Well, it got changed.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.120]   It's a much better product than it was then.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.120]   True.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.640]   That's a good point.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.600]   Also with us from Channel 9 and Microsoft.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.840]   Oh, we love her.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.840]   Christina Warren.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.240]   See your cloud dev advocate at Microsoft Filmgirl.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.240]   Hi, Christina.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.240]   Hey, Leo.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.240]   How are you?
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.240]   I'm great.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.240]   So nice to see you.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.040]   I see you on Channel 9 all the time now.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.040]   You're so good.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.520]   Thank you so much.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.520]   Loving it.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.520]   Loving it.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.520]   But it's a good time.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.520]   That's a good time.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.520]   So you and your honey are happy with the move to Seattle.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.560]   Yeah, he loves Seattle so much.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.200]   I still miss New York.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.240]   I think I will always miss New York, but I love the job and I love my team.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.160]   But he's very happy in the Pacific Northwest.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.240]   What's important to your husband's house?
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.240]   Yes.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.240]   No, it is.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.400]   Well, he kind of suffered through the whole time we were in New York.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.840]   So he didn't want to be in New York.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.840]   Not really.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.840]   Not really.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.120]   I mean, he liked it, but it got to the point where he was really not happy.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.160]   So that was actually one of the reasons why when I was approached, I started to kind of
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.000]   think seriously about it because I was like, well, we looked at cities that we would want
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   to live in.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.560]   And the hard thing was, as a journalist, there are kind of limited places where I could do
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.040]   what I did.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.040]   But we talked before, we said, well, Austin would be a place, Portland would be a place,
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.040]   Seattle would be a place.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.480]   We had a couple of different places.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.360]   And then Microsoft reached out and I was like, oh, well, this is interesting timing, especially
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.120]   with everything happening in the media world.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.600]   So it worked out well.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.960]   And it's been exciting, I think.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.960]   It's been very interesting.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.960]   And it's been fun.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.000]   I'm loving a lot of new skills.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   I work with awesome people.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   So it's been good.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.120]   It's really interesting how Microsoft, it's stock and its fortunes have improved since
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.120]   Christina Warren's.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.120]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:57.280]   It is completely not in relation to me at all, but I can say, yeah, that stock has gone
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.320]   up and I'm very grateful.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.880]   But yeah, it is absolutely not because of me.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.760]   Maybe that Nadella guy had a little something to do with it.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.480]   Maybe, maybe, maybe something.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.480]   I mean, yeah.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.800]   Actually, Microsoft had a really interesting time.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.440]   I mean, they just acquired GitHub.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.240]   They have done something that so few tech companies do, which is completely reinvent
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.800]   themselves, especially when you're a big hit, you know, you dominate the world with
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.480]   Windows and Office.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.480]   And then suddenly it's no longer about operating systems.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.200]   It's about the cloud and to make that pivot is remarkable.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.600]   Yeah, no, it is.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.960]   And it's been really interesting being on the Azure team.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.200]   And, you know, that's what I'm an advocate for and talking with the product people and
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.040]   the developers and obviously all the people in our communities and trying to get insights
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.360]   into how we can do even better.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.360]   But yeah, you're right.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.040]   It's really exciting and it's a challenge, right?
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.840]   Because we dominate in office and in Windows and we have a really big competitor in cloud
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.360]   and they are actually in our backyards.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:03.040]   You know, they're like literally like my personal apartment is closer to Amazon than it is
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.800]   to the Redmond campus where I'm recording this.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.320]   And so, you know, we've got to be on our toes and we have to be authentic.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.040]   And it's been really interesting for me, somebody who never would have necessarily seen myself
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:21.640]   working at Microsoft to see what the companies become and how real, you know, everybody at
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.080]   least that I've interacted with is it's about the transition.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.080]   And that's been really exciting.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.080]   It is.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.200]   It's one of the most exciting companies in tech right now, which is pretty surprising
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.200]   and amazing.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.800]   Now watch what happens to IBM stock because Wesley Fogg is here.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.040]   Wesley just took a new job.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.240]   He starts tomorrow, formerly the FSC.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.720]   And we thank FSC because they've been very supportive of you being on Twitch.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.720]   Now you're going to big blue.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.120]   Yeah, it's going to be super exciting.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.840]   I'm going to be joining a great team.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.600]   It's going to be here in Austin.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.960]   So I'm not moving, at least not cities anyway, moving houses.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.080]   Like I said before, we're in a, we're just setting up boxes everywhere in my new house
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.080]   here.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.080]   Congratulations.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.760]   It's going to be, it's going to be a great company.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.320]   They're doing really exciting things.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.920]   They're trying to make a startup within a giant corporations that's over 100 years
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.160]   old, which is, they're doing really good things.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.840]   Yeah, and some ways they're faced with a similar challenge to Microsoft.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.800]   You know, they need to reinvent themselves.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:26.480]   It's got to be hard to be an old tech company, including old tech company Google and Apple.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.440]   You've got to reinvent yourself much more often than you used to, much more often than
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.280]   US Steel has to, you know.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:37.200]   Yeah, but they've been really making some really big moves, but it's just more quiet
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:44.960]   and to larger, more senior people that actually here are in the know because, you know, Google
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.520]   helps with websites and, but I've been in power as companies and governments all around
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.520]   the world.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.040]   So it's going to be one of those things.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.240]   Is Watson the big thing, the AI and all of that?
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:01.520]   Yes, it seems, if you look at what Watson does in healthcare, it has changed things.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.720]   It's just that people just don't know about it.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.360]   And they just did a debate version of Watson where they could hold a debate.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.320]   And it held its own.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.320]   But they do.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:19.520]   And just being able to hear assertions and challenge them may even help us think differently.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.000]   Even from a government standpoint of coming up with a premise and being able to work it
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.600]   out with a computer before you bring it to the masses would be great.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:33.520]   Like if you think about debating is one of the things Watson would be like Jeopardy,
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.600]   very good at because it has a huge database of information.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:42.200]   And so it's really about kind of organizing that information in support of a debate argument.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:47.240]   And there's this always the saying saying you don't know what you don't know.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:54.800]   So being able to find a way of exposing that before you get the ire of the press or under
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.200]   criticalize that definitely is going to help.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.680]   What what critical eyes of the prep?
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.400]   What are you talking about?
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.400]   The enemy of the people.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.400]   Oh, that's us.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.400]   That's right.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.400]   That's us.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.560]   Actually, I shouldn't joke about it because of course there was another terrible shooting
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:18.000]   in the United States this weekend was in a newsroom of a newspaper in Baltimore area.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.560]   And so our hearts go out to all the people affected by that.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.280]   Just terrible, terrible thing.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:28.840]   And just reminds you being a journalist can be dangerous.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.840]   Often is.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:34.600]   Fortunately, it certainly made us much more cautious.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.600]   I bet.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:42.920]   When I when I left that day, I was headed out the front door and the publisher was talking
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:48.360]   to the to the receptionist at the front door, explained to her what they were going to do
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.080]   to improve security after that.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.080]   It was pretty pretty moving.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.880]   We went through that radio.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.760]   San Francisco radio station guy came in shot a number of people in the radio station many,
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.480]   many, many decades ago.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.000]   And it was this was this the talk.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   What was the movie?
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   The Oliver Stone film.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Oh, he may have.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.240]   Well, no, then there was another one in Colorado.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.840]   Very famous case and call that was the one I was thinking out.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.840]   That was radio.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.840]   That was radio.
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.480]   And it's scary that you could confuse them because there are so many.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.720]   It's a shame that we have to.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.880]   Oh, no, not that one.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:24.880]   The other one.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.880]   Yeah.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.960]   But, you know, we have, I mean, every radio station in San Francisco after that, you
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:34.800]   know, severely improved security, we have an armed guard at our door.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.880]   You can't if you're in media, you know that there are risks.
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:39.880]   Definitely.
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:45.880]   I remember when Charlie Hepdo happens, you know, so Mashable is in the same building as
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.800]   a gizmodo media group, which, you know, was then Gawker and the intercept.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:55.120]   And I believe all three publications published the Charlie Hepdo comic.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.560]   The cartoons after that terrible attack.
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.520]   And there were there were a number of bomb threats against that building.
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.240]   And so I it was one of those things because we're all in the same building.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:09.200]   And I felt I felt bad for MasterCard and Capital One and some of the other, you know, tenants
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.680]   who were kind of like, what did we, you know, what did we get into?
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.080]   But it becomes like a real thing.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.600]   Like you don't think about it until, you know, like you're talking about Leo, you know,
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:22.480]   the radio station thing or you see something that happened with the gazette, which is just
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.200]   terrible and or something else happens.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.960]   And you have to kind of assess to go, Oh, this is actually dangerous because I think
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.680]   a lot of us when we get into it, especially if we're not doing hard news, we're not,
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.800]   you know, in war zones, you don't necessarily think that you're doing something where your
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.200]   life could be at risk.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.200]   That's true.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.200]   And I always figured tech journalism is fairly safe.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.200]   Knock on, knock on wood.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.200]   Really.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:54.080]   No, but you know, I don't think we ruffle feathers that much in tech journalism.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.080]   Thank goodness.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.160]   A couple of big stories this week.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:03.240]   Not it wasn't a huge news week, but Apple and Samsung buried the hatchet.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:10.200]   That's kind of a surprising story after good Lord, seven years started in 2011.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.720]   It kind of following this is a twisted tale all by itself.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:18.760]   Apparently, Apple got a billion dollar ruling, then a series of appeals pushed the dispute
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.820]   to the Supreme Court.
[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:24.960]   It turned out lower courts had validated Samsung's patent.
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.040]   I mean, Apple's patent.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.840]   So it wasn't about the patents.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.960]   It ended up being what the damages would be.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:33.960]   It went back.
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.880]   There were a number of design patents, a number of utility patents.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:42.880]   Eventually, the verdict was whittled down to $539 million for Apple.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.280]   Samsung appealed on that.
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.720]   They reached an agreement before it could be litigated again that Judge Lucy Cohen, that
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:55.120]   last court case said, "You two get together and work this thing out."
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:00.840]   And while we don't know the terms, I think probably both companies lost their thirst
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:01.840]   for battle.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.840]   This was released.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.840]   Steve Jobs' battle, wasn't it?
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:09.920]   We realized that it would have been horrible if they actually got a settlement because I
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:16.680]   think the part they're working out is what percentage of the Samsung phones were due to
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.440]   the infringed Apple patents.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:25.400]   So if they were able to monetize saying, "Okay, we got the screen and this is worth this much,"
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:30.440]   it would have done an end-to-end around all the other companies in terms of patent infringement
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.280]   because they would have just done it.
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.720]   And if they got caught and said, "Oh, it's only been 5% of our design as yours."
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.720]   Oh, good.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.720]   We can do that.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.720]   Great.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.720]   Exactly.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.720]   And so if they did the settlement, if they didn't work it out before, then that could
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.520]   have totally screwed both companies over.
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.520]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:50.520]   So there was actually some economic incentive not to continue the battle.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:56.120]   But I think also you have to look at the phones and the devices that were cited in that case
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.120]   were all.
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:02.040]   I think the original thing started in 2010 is when some of the early kind of back and
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.040]   forth started.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.840]   And so you're looking at like it was like the Galaxy S3, I think, and it was some of
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.000]   the earlier phones.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.440]   And so from that point forward, after the first lawsuit, Samsung started to change things
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:20.400]   just enough so that they were, I guess, avoiding whatever patents everything may be.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:27.440]   If you look at a Galaxy S9, you can't say that's based on Apple unless you think that
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.440]   all slabs of glass with rounded corners are Apple's.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.440]   Right.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.440]   Well, exactly.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.440]   I mean, and at this point you could argue that if anything like the iPhone X.
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.440]   It was the other one.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.440]   Yeah.
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.440]   Exactly.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:41.240]   It looks a lot like the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S9 in some regards.
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:47.480]   But yeah, I mean, I think Wesley's point, there probably was some sort of economic thing.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:52.000]   But also at this point, it's gone back and forth between the courts so many times.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.160]   As you said, it was a Steve Jobs thing where he was really trying to fight two companies.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.960]   He said we're going thermonuclear on them.
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.400]   He was just like, I'm done.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.840]   But at a certain point, you're now litigating over phones that haven't been sold in seven
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.640]   years and damages and whatnot.
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.640]   And you're paying lawyers who only knows what.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.520]   And I'm sure that Judge Lucy Coe has been so tired of this case because she's been dragged
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.720]   into all of the variations.
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.840]   She's just like, okay, just settle this.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.920]   Just get it over with.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.800]   So finally, you know.
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.960]   Although not all of it, not all of it was look.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.480]   Some of it, I think the pinch to zoom was one of the issues as well.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.480]   Yes.
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.480]   Yes.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.480]   And a lot, right.
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:33.520]   And both of those are still found on all smartphones.
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:38.720]   So I suspect the lawyers probably would have loved to have continued it.
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:46.760]   But I agree with Leo and Christina that it really was Steve Jobs's fight and that's over.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.280]   It's interesting to look back.
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:56.160]   It's really from the Walter Isaacson book where the biography of Jobs, he said, "Steve's
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.760]   was livid in 2010 when HTC introduced."
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:01.080]   Remember the G1, the first Android phone?
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.520]   And it had touch.
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:10.120]   Apple sued Jobs, told Isaacson in an, this is the AP writing, in an expletive laced rant
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.240]   that Google's actions amounted to grand theft.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:17.720]   Quote, "I will spend my last dying breath if I need to and I will spend every penny of
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.880]   Apple's $40 billion in the bank to right this wrong.
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.400]   I'm going to destroy Android because it's a stolen product.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.120]   I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this."
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.120]   Holy cow.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:32.360]   And I think, keep in mind also that someone from Google was on the board of Apple at the
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.360]   time.
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.360]   Eric Schmidt.
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.360]   Eric Schmidt.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.360]   Eric Schmidt.
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.360]   It wasn't someone.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.360]   It was like the CEO, you know.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.360]   They had a partnership.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.360]   He was at the iPhone launch.
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:45.360]   And we know that Google, and I think we know this maybe from the trial, when Google saw
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.120]   the iPhone, they scrapped their plans for the Android phone.
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.640]   They've been planning on ripping off, it was a combination of a blackberry ripoff and
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.640]   a Windows mobile ripoff.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:57.160]   If you looked at their original Android phone, it had a keyboard and it basically looked
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.800]   like what the blackberry was at the time, but a lot of the interface things for what
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.200]   Windows mobile 6.5 did.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:08.840]   And as soon as they saw it, they're like, "We got to start over."
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.400]   There's a great book about that dogfight.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.400]   Eric Schmidt.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.400]   Oh, I love that book.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.400]   Yes.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.960]   And I think both companies realized that in the, there was collateral damage, as always
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:25.520]   there is in this kind of trial, where because of discovery, public is learning secrets about
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:30.080]   how the companies develop products, what Apple's thoughts were and all that stuff.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.880]   And Apple is so secretive.
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:35.320]   I was actually surprised that they pursued this as long as they don't need the half
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.320]   a billion dollars.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.320]   It's not like the money.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:42.760]   No, although it's funny for you to read that quote again, to go back to 2011, or 2010,
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.960]   or whenever Apple only had $40 billion in cash.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.360]   Yeah, they have $240 billion now or more.
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:52.160]   Yeah, it hasn't hurt Apple's bottom line.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.600]   But anyway, it's over.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:18:00.600]   And I think it's time to, it's like the end of the Vietnam War, just time to move on and
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.600]   think of other things.
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:05.280]   I don't think lawsuits in Silicon Valley are really the right way to go, honestly, in
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.680]   the long run.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:14.120]   Speaking of lawsuits, I am not happy about a California law, I'm sorry, a federal bill.
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:19.680]   I mean, get this story up, I don't have the link here, that just was proposed in the
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:26.960]   House of Representatives that would change the way patents work.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.760]   And this one is a little personal for me.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.560]   Do you remember the podcast troll?
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.560]   Oh, yes.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:39.040]   Here's a story from, this is actually from the Center for Protection of Intellectual Property,
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:45.840]   which is a conservative think tank that wants this bill to be passed.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.960]   The whole idea here was, when was this?
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:56.000]   A few years ago, there was a company down in Texas, a very popular place in Texas, East
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.480]   Texas, Tyler, Texas.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.480]   Where everybody sews.
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.120]   All the patent trolls.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:07.880]   Now we want patent trolls is kind of a weighted, weighted, we'll call them non-practicing entities
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:08.880]   and piece.
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:09.880]   Okay.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.880]   The patent trolls.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.160]   They're the companies that don't actually make anything.
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.160]   They're non-practicing.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:19.480]   They buy the rights to products so that they can go around demanding royalties.
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:23.360]   And there's a famous one that goes around to small businesses saying, "Do you have a
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.360]   copy machine?"
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:28.520]   Oh, we have the patent for copy machines.
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.880]   You have to pay us to use your copy machine.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:36.040]   And these companies usually ask for such a small amount, only $10,000 or $20,000, that
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:40.760]   it's more expensive to say no than it is just to give them some money.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:45.560]   So there was a patent troll in Tyler, Texas that was doing this for podcasts, as you remember.
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.360]   They went to Adam Corolla.
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.560]   They went to a lot of podcasters.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.080]   They asked us for $2 million.
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:55.520]   See, that was a strategic mistake, by the way, because if they'd asked us for $50,000,
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.320]   I might have said, "Well, better just to give them the money because it's going to cost
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.320]   me.
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.520]   We got lawyers.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.160]   We found out it would cost a million dollars.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.440]   We'd have to go to Texas to defend."
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.240]   And I was so incensed, and they were asking so much, I said, "Doesn't matter.
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.480]   We're going to do it."
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.800]   So we hired attorneys and everything.
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:15.040]   Adam Corolla, you remember, had a crowdfunding campaign to raise money.
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:22.600]   But what happened and what ended up destroying this company was the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:27.440]   They did something that is still currently law, but that this new bill would overturn
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.600]   called an interpartase appeal.
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:36.440]   They go to the patent office and say, "Hey, dudes, I know you approved this patent many
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:41.340]   years ago, but you see how they're trying to apply it now?
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.180]   Is it still a good patent?"
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.240]   And in the case of the podcast troll, they overturned it.
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.880]   The patent and trademark office said, "No, no, that's ridiculous."
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.800]   But that's a huge risk.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:56.120]   It's a huge risk when they do that, because if you lose that case, it strengthens the other
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.120]   party.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.120]   Right.
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:02.720]   You could say, "Well, see, the patent office agreed that it's a good patent."
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.280]   It's funny that you know this, Wesley, because that's exactly what our lawyers said, "Don't
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:09.000]   do that.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.040]   If you do that, you're running a huge risk."
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:18.240]   So we didn't, but we don't control the EFF and the EFF did.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.000]   And that's what EFF does.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.040]   I actually gave them several thousand dollars when they announced it.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.200]   I said, "Good.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.200]   Good luck."
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.200]   And they won.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:34.080]   And this bill, it's got a terrible name, too.
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:40.320]   It's called, let me find the name, Representative Massey introduced this, "The Restoring America's
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:48.680]   Leadership in Innovation Act of 2018, HR 6264.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.880]   It eliminates Interpartase Review.
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.240]   It eliminates Post-Grant Review.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.720]   It eliminates any appeal.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:02.720]   Essentially, it is a bill clearly designed to support people who have patents, including
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:08.000]   patent trolls, and to really reduce your ability to fight those trolls.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.800]   And it would have, in my opinion, exactly the opposite of supporting innovation.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:18.000]   The "Rizbit Agi-Pai."
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   Go ahead, Wesley.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.240]   I was just saying, "Rizbit Agi-Pai and his naming of the Freedom of Internet."
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.120]   Yeah, you know when they say it's about freedom, it's not.
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.120]   It's not.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.120]   Go ahead, Christina.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.800]   No, all I was going to say is that all the claim it's going to help spur innovation,
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.120]   all it really does is it helps spur people to file patent after patent after patent.
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.120]   Right.
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:39.520]   And then sit on it and either sell it to someone or do something else.
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:43.600]   It doesn't actually encourage anyone to innovate.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:47.960]   Because the sampling thing, as we were just talking about, I mean, we can talk that both
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:52.480]   companies were hurt in some ways by all of the protracted legal stuff.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:57.760]   And that if we're honest, both, yes, did Google steal blatantly from iOS?
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.760]   Absolutely.
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:02.000]   But has Apple also been able to steal blatantly some things from Google?
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   Yes.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.840]   And we as consumers, is the world better for both?
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:07.840]   Yes.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:15.720]   And in keeping things in a way where you can sue someone for something like a podcast or
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:20.120]   there was an early on, there was a patent troll who was trying to sue anybody who was doing
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.440]   anything in the App Store and trying to claim that if you were selling a mobile app that
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:28.040]   you were violating their patent, and Apple actually stood up and said, okay, we'll fight
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.040]   these companies.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:34.280]   But I knew a number of independent developers who were contacted by that, you know, NPD
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:38.600]   and were worried and didn't know what to do.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:43.160]   And if Apple hadn't stepped in and said, we'll take care of the legal things, that would
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:48.320]   just encourage people not to make apps, which is hardly encouraging innovation.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:56.920]   By the way, the guys who were going around to small businesses saying, do you use your
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.400]   copy or to scan documents?
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:03.920]   Oh, you owe us money because we patented that.
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:08.760]   Those guys also were put out of business by appealing to the patent office, a defense
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.600]   that would disappear if this bill passed.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.600]   So I don't know.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:16.120]   I mean, you might as well call it the patent troll act of 2018.
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.240]   I have no idea how likely it is to pass.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:26.600]   But if you're talking to your Congress critic anyway, you might mention HR 6264 and say,
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.520]   I don't think that's a good idea either.
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:32.160]   I mean, literally it would have put us out of business if we'd lost that case.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:38.920]   Wasn't there a proposed patent reform bill last year that was designed to crack down
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.400]   on patent trolls in general?
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.480]   Did that go anywhere?
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.040]   That's why this bill exists.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.040]   Yes.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.040]   This is in response?
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.040]   Yes.
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:51.200]   This bill exists because both the courts and Congress have done a lot to make it harder
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.600]   to be a patent troll.
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.200]   And apparently the patent trolls don't like it.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:25:03.640]   So they got representative Massey to suggest this revive the patent trolls act of 2018.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.640]   I agree.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.480]   There's definitely a lot of things wrong with the patent system.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.480]   Oh, God, yes.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.560]   When you look at drug prices.
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.560]   Oh, yes.
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:16.760]   I mean, it's totally crazy, but this is not the fix.
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:21.040]   No, frankly, this is a long conversation, but I don't think software patents are a good
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.040]   idea at all.
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:27.280]   No, I mean, that's there have been a couple of cases where people thought that they would
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.840]   be settled case law on the issue of software patents, and that's still so unsettled.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:35.760]   But yeah, I mean, your opinion isn't uncommon for people in the industry to, you know, it's
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.040]   a difficult area for sure.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.040]   It's complicated.
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.960]   It's a very complicated philosophical debate.
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:45.880]   People have some other time, but yeah, I mean, you could make a strong case that one of the
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:50.360]   reasons we have patent trolls is because of software patents.
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.480]   Let's take a little bit of break.
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:52.760]   There's lots more to talk about.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:55.960]   Apple says it's rebuilding maps from the ground up.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:02.240]   Dr. Dre owes its ex partner, the beats partner, the guy who invented beats $25 million.
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.400]   Are you wearing beats?
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.400]   No, those aren't beats.
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.400]   All right.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.840]   I had a check.
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.600]   You're very cool looking.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.600]   All right.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.560]   Those are nice looking headphones.
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:18.040]   Foxconn finally breaks ground on its Wisconsin plant.
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:22.040]   And a whole lot more.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.560]   But first a word from rocket mortgage.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.160]   Actually, you've heard me talk about rocket mortgage and quick and loans.
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.040]   And they've got a new thing that's really cool.
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.760]   You know, interest rates are going all over the place.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.440]   They're going up.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.280]   And there's a lot of unpredictability when you buy a home and you get a home loan these
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.280]   days.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:41.320]   There's a lot of anxiety and our friends at quick and loans don't like anxiety.
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.160]   They don't want you to be nervous.
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:47.520]   So they've created something they call the power buying process.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:48.760]   Quick and loans.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:49.760]   This out works.
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.160]   We'll verify your income assets and credit.
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.520]   They'll do that in less than 24 hours.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:59.040]   Once you get verified approval, it basically gives you the strength of a cash buyer.
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:03.240]   Once you're verified, you qualify for their all new exclusive rate shield approval.
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.920]   They'll lock up your rate for 90 days while you shop.
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.000]   You have 90 days at guaranteed rate.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   But here's the best part.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.360]   If rates go up, your rate stays the same.
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.360]   It doesn't change.
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.440]   If rates go down, your rate also drops.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.880]   So it's locked in as a maximum, but it could even go down.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:19.880]   This protects you.
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:24.360]   It means you have 90 days to find that home and not have to worry about shifting interest
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:25.360]   rates.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:29.720]   Of course, exactly the kind of thing you'd expect from America's best and largest mortgage
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:30.720]   lender.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:35.960]   All you have to do is go to rocket mortgage.com/twit2 rate shield approvals only valid on some
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.920]   30-year purchase transactions.
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:42.280]   Additional conditions or exclusions may apply based on quick and loans data in comparison
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.400]   to public data records.
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:48.480]   Equal housing lender licenses in all 50 states and MLS consumer access.org number 3030.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.160]   You know we love rocket mortgage.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.520]   And this is just one more reason to use it.
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:56.520]   Rocket Mortgage.com/twit2.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:01.080]   And we do thank Rocket Mortgage by Quick and Loans for supporting this week in tech.
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.080]   Yes, I hear a...
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.080]   Is that...
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:10.200]   I use Rocket Mortgage because I told you, and I had a problem with the system.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:14.880]   But what you don't say is that they'll give you a call or an email if you have any kind
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.880]   of problem.
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.880]   So customers...
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.480]   So you're not locked into the website.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:22.640]   So if you have like a little glitch or something, you can still get in touch with a human,
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.640]   which is pretty awesome.
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:24.640]   No, they have it kind of.
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.960]   You get the best of both worlds.
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:26.960]   That's really nice.
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:29.960]   And we're in the process right now of buying a house and we're using them.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:30.960]   Oh my God.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:31.960]   Excellent.
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.960]   Rocket Mortgage Party.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:38.760]   Makes me want to buy a house.
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:44.400]   Christina is a poor millennial who moved from New York City to Seattle and has given up on
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.040]   ever having homeownership.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.920]   I've given up on the dream of homeownership.
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.400]   Let's be real.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.400]   But if I do...
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.400]   If I ever am lucky enough, then I will definitely use Rocket Mortgage.
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.240]   Housing prices high in the...
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.240]   Oh my God.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.240]   Are they?
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.240]   Oh my God.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.240]   Yeah, no.
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.240]   It's the increase.
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.240]   It's something...
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:04.680]   It's like 2,000% I think in the last five years or something.
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.680]   What?
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:06.680]   Yeah, no.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.680]   It's the highest.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.640]   It's for the last, I think, 18 months.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.040]   It has been or it might be like 21 months at this point.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:18.440]   It is the highest average or like increase in the United States.
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.480]   Worse than the Bay Area?
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.640]   So the prices in the Bay Area are higher for sure.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:31.800]   But the rate in which prices are rising in Seattle are the biggest anywhere.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.800]   Interesting.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:38.160]   Yeah, it's not as expensive as New York or the Bay Area at all.
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.400]   But it is a lot more than you would think.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:49.080]   And then the increase is key-pappening so much that a place that was valued at 450,000
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:52.560]   10 years ago is easily over a million now.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:58.400]   And so people who bought places right after the financial crisis, right after the real
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:02.560]   estate bust, can't afford to move because they could never afford the place that they're
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.560]   in now.
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.560]   Yeah.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:05.800]   So it's one of those types of things.
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:09.760]   And then you have a lot of foreign buyers who come in and pay cash.
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:16.680]   So even if you have a mortgage, even if you're able to get a loan, you're oftentimes...
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:19.760]   So someone who's sending will pay cash.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:24.200]   And so it can be hard even for people who have the money to find a place.
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.200]   It's kind of bad.
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:29.240]   Although I have to point out the article in The New York Times yesterday that said, "San
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.680]   Francisco is so expensive.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:34.400]   You can have a six figure income and still be low income."
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.400]   I know.
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.400]   Yeah, it is nothing like that.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.000]   Although, it is not that level.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   No, but I've seen that.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.880]   But it is one of those things where when I look at how much I would need for a mortgage
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.480]   to get a place and whatnot, especially like that's part of town.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.840]   I would want to live in.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:48.840]   It's just ridiculous.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.160]   So I'm just going to rent.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:57.200]   Federal government classifieds a family of four in the Bay Area earning $117,400 as low
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.200]   income.
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.600]   Low income.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.800]   But when you see what houses are selling and how much they're selling for...
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:08.000]   I was going to say, if your average mortgage or if your average rent is $4,400 or something
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.800]   like that, and for a family of four, you're going to need at least three bedrooms or whatever.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.280]   Median home price over a million bucks.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:19.520]   The federal government says a fair market rent for a two bedroom in San Francisco's
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.240]   Bay Area is $3,000 for a two bedroom apartment.
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:27.640]   I don't want to tell you what my college graduate son is paying.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:32.480]   They've got three of them jammed into a two bedroom apartment and they're each paying
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.600]   $1,700 bucks.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:39.320]   Which means that the rent for that three bedroom in San Francisco is like $5,000 for a two
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.320]   bedroom.
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:41.320]   For a two bedroom.
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:42.320]   Yeah, that's what I was saying.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:43.320]   $100 is low.
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.320]   No, it's insane.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.360]   And you're not talking about huge units.
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:47.400]   I mean, that's the big thing.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.200]   So I actually pay more.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.000]   It's fair to peg this to tech, right?
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.480]   I mean, if it's happening in Seattle...
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:53.480]   Oh, yes.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:55.480]   I bet it's happening in areas of Boston.
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.480]   You owe me that, definitely.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.480]   Absolutely.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.480]   Without a doubt.
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.480]   Without a doubt.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:04.000]   And it's also happening in Houston because what you used to have a reputation for being
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:11.400]   inexpensive, but everybody wants to be inside the loop, the loop 610, and it's densifying.
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.360]   So there's less properties available.
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:19.920]   When we moved out of a townhouse about four years ago, they tore down some small houses
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:24.000]   next to it that probably would have sold for $125,000.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.080]   They were little shacks, essentially.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:31.120]   And built condo and built townhouses next to us that were $800,000.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.600]   So it's happening everywhere, particularly in urban areas.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:40.400]   Well, more people are coming up your way, Christina, because Amazon just spent almost
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:45.760]   a billion dollars to buy an online pharmacy called PillPack.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:46.960]   Our listeners might know that.
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:47.960]   We were doing ads for PillPack.
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:52.280]   I wish I could get a little cut in some of these deals.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:57.400]   Amazon bought Ring and one of our sponsors for more than a billion, I think.
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:01.080]   Apple bought Texture for $400 million and another one of our sponsors.
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:04.920]   Now they buy PillPack a sponsor for a billion dollars.
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:08.640]   I helped build these companies from the crowd up.
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:13.640]   Amazon has only made two acquisitions in 2018, and both of them are twin sponsors.
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.480]   Twin sponsors, yeah.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:18.160]   I don't know what that means, but they're watching you.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.640]   That means that analysts need to watch Leo's sponsor list.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:24.880]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:33.160]   From your mouth to whoever, to John Doar's ear, Amazon buying PillPack is the strongest
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:37.280]   indication yet of Amazon's interest in pushing into healthcare.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:41.280]   As you know, they announced a partnership with Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway and
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:44.200]   JP Morgan to do a health insurance company.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:49.040]   Oh, it's just for Amazon employees right now.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:54.360]   They were applying for pharmacy licenses all around the country about a year or two
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.360]   ago.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:58.760]   Now they don't need to because they've got PillPack.
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.320]   PillPack, yep.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:07.160]   They're going to get a ton of information from this acquisition because they'll get insights
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:12.480]   of what the negotiated rates for all the insurers are on drugs, which is going to
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.480]   inform their play.
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:19.680]   They're going to get a more accurate count of households because if my grandmother lives
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:25.520]   with me and I get the medication sent here, they'll know who, because the names are tied
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:29.480]   to the medications, even for kids, even for people who are older, they'll get all that
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.480]   information.
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:38.640]   And also, PillPack doesn't just do prescriptions, they do vitamins and over-the-counter drugs.
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:43.360]   So they'll be able to get a scrape off all that with their leverage buying power and be
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.800]   able to make even more money.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:50.720]   You're so smart because you tempted to look at any acquisition as just simply a business
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:53.440]   acquisition, but for Amazon, data is everything.
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:59.120]   And if you think about it too, it means so the CBS at NIDIL, right?
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:00.400]   That's a big one.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:07.440]   And that was seen in some ways as kind of anticipating Amazon getting more into both prescriptions
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:08.440]   and healthcare.
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:15.560]   And not all drugs can have online or buy mail prescriptions, but increasingly that's
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:16.560]   becoming an option.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:21.920]   And the maximum insurers will even penalize you if you don't do a buy mail prescription.
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:26.280]   If you actually go to a pharmacy, I know that when I was with United Healthcare, I had
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:29.640]   to opt into a thing to be able to use an actual pharmacy because they really wanted
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.360]   me to send stuff in the mail.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:38.840]   And so you can see Amazon's not an insurer yet, but you can see them probably getting
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:44.560]   the data, like Wesley's saying, being able to have all that accurate information to then
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:48.880]   make direct deals with the insurers and other things.
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:56.040]   And also start to anticipate if they're ever able to cohabitate where your prime now
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:00.480]   stuff is, you can just imagine, you know, in a few years being able to do a prime now
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.640]   to get your prescription delivered to you.
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:07.400]   Great, Raven, your chat room says he can't wait for the Prozac Dash button.
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.800]   Yes, seriously.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:12.800]   I need some quick.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.800]   Xanax button.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:15.800]   Xanax.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:18.480]   I need Xanax now.
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.480]   It's interesting.
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.800]   Walgreens, I'm not Walgreens.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:26.000]   Walmart apparently was bidding for pill pack as well, which is why the price got so high.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.400]   Which makes total sense because, you know, Walmart has been one of the biggest pharmacies
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:34.400]   and biggest parts, kind of the drug industry for a really long time.
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:39.760]   And so, you know, they are actively through jet.com and Bonobos and some other other things
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:44.000]   trying to take on Amazon in the online sphere of granted.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   They're coming at it a little bit late.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:52.120]   So that's interesting that they didn't bid more that Amazon was willing to go above.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:53.120]   That's really interesting.
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:58.720]   When you combine Rite Aid, Walgreens and CVS Health, three big pharmacies, they lost
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:02.840]   $12.8 billion in market value the day this was announced.
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:03.840]   Huge.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:04.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:11.560]   The market immediately saw what Amazon was up to and said, "They may have won."
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:12.560]   Pill pack is awesome.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.440]   We used it for quite a while.
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:21.720]   And it's, but although I noticed that in an analyst call, the guy from Walgreens said,
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:26.120]   "Well, the pharmacy world is much more complex than the delivery of packages of pill packages."
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.120]   Yeah.
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:28.120]   It's much more complex.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.120]   I'm sure it is.
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:33.120]   And honestly, though, I hadn't thought about this until you were just saying that, Leo,
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:38.440]   but I think this makes the Whole Foods acquisition so much smarter.
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:41.520]   Because now they actually have retail space.
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:45.080]   So before, you know, that was the big thing with Amazon is they didn't have, yeah, they
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:46.280]   might have their own pop-ups.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:50.680]   But now I'm not saying that every Whole Foods will have a pharmacy or a pill pack, you know,
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:51.680]   or in it.
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:56.600]   But you could imagine especially big locations where there are a lot of people where it might
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:00.200]   make sense for them to build, you know, an Amazon health, you know, something.
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.200]   Oh, heck.
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.920]   All you need really is a place where you could drop off your prescription.
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.440]   They said, "Don't ramble mail it to you.
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.360]   It's going to be your customer."
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:11.880]   And pill pack has a certain amount of lock-in because they renew the prescriptions automatically.
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.160]   They send you the prescriptions.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:19.000]   Once you're in the system, it's kind of a, it's a just, you know, a nurse show alone
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.240]   will keep you as a customer.
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.480]   So it's a good move on Amazon's part.
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:26.720]   And since they do vitamins, you expect in Whole Foods that they'll have like a fitness
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:31.640]   expert or a nutritionist to be able to say, "Yeah."
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:34.920]   And then they'll start sending you pill packs with just the vitamins that they think will
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:35.920]   help you.
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:36.920]   There's a...
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:37.920]   Yeah.
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:41.720]   The stocks that should have gone down may have been grocery stores because, you know, every
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:46.960]   Kroger now has a... has not only a pharmacy, but a lot of them have little clinics in
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:47.960]   them.
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:51.280]   And certainly if you were going to do that with Whole Foods, particularly with something
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:55.440]   that was very health-oriented or holistically health-oriented, which would be a good way
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:00.640]   for Amazon to differentiate itself, you could see that it could really have even more impact
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:01.920]   on the grocery business.
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.120]   Should we be scared of Amazon?
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:05.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:08.000]   But I mean, we're scared of all of them.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.680]   I mean, but you know what I mean?
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:10.680]   Like...
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.360]   But I mean, it just, it seems like Amazon's...
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:16.720]   I mean, look, first of all, Jeff Bezos, richest man in the world.
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:19.320]   He's not stated goal, but he's pretty obvious.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:23.960]   His goal is to take us a fraction of all financial transactions across the board.
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:28.520]   You know, just giving 1% of everything that goes on and I'll be happy.
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:31.680]   And he's moving very closely, very quickly into that.
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:36.820]   We know that Amazon, when it enters a market, depresses the market for every other company
[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:40.280]   in that market and really changed first publishing.
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:46.200]   I mean, that's the best example is how many cities don't have bookstores anymore.
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:50.120]   If you're a book publisher, you hate Amazon because you no longer control the price of
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:51.160]   your products.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:55.600]   If you're an author, you might love Amazon because you don't need a publisher anymore.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.200]   They've completely changed how books work.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:01.480]   And I imagine every market that they enter, this is going to happen.
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.520]   At what point...
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:04.640]   This is what worries me.
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:07.240]   Does Amazon become the company store?
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.480]   You know that old song?
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:12.360]   Oh, Ma's told to the company store where this is...
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.880]   You just buy everything from Amazon.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.680]   And not all of that retailers exist.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.680]   For many people it already is.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.680]   Yeah, buy everything from Amazon.
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:20.680]   Same.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:21.680]   I buy everything from Amazon.
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:25.720]   And I mean, I think what you're saying is absolutely accurate.
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:28.680]   I guess my only pushback on that would be I think you could have said the same thing
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.280]   about Walmart a decade ago.
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:37.400]   And in fact, still in many small towns, Walmart came in after mining places or manufacturing
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.960]   in Lapton and huge super stores came up and everyone worked there.
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.040]   Everyone got their health insurance there.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.040]   That was everyone.
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:47.720]   But their paycheck there was literally the place where you work and you end up spending
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:51.480]   all your money, which to me is actually a little bit more insidious than what Amazon's
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:52.480]   doing.
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.600]   But Walmart was trying to model first.
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:56.600]   Amazon's...
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:01.840]   The big innovation is the distribution and the fact that they now have the, you know,
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:05.560]   the couriers and the delivery and just the huge number of warehouses.
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:09.120]   But yeah, I mean, I think it's a valid thing to ask is that they literally are kind of
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:10.920]   touching every aspect of everything.
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:15.560]   And I think that it's interesting you've seen like with bookstores, the first people that
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:18.620]   really kind of put the small independent bookstores out of business were Barnes and
[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:19.620]   Noble and Borders.
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:23.120]   And it was the huge super bookstores that had the cut down prices.
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:27.360]   And then it was, you know, some of them were part of leverage buyouts.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.120]   Some of them had bad real estate deals, whatever.
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:33.920]   They couldn't keep up with the demand and people moved to other methods and then, you
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:38.080]   know, borders went out of business, Barnes and Noble closes down certain stores.
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:41.880]   But you did then do kind of see this resurgence in certain pockets of markets, certainly not
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:45.720]   everywhere of the independent places cropping up again.
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:51.480]   And so I wonder, like, I'm not trying to defend Amazon, but I do wonder how much of
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:56.280]   it is on Amazon and how much of it is a combination of Amazon and really what Amazon benefited
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:03.160]   from was the huge big box explosion of the 90s in the early 2000s that they're just writing
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:06.960]   that way of taking it to the next level.
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.800]   You know, but I do you write off Walmart?
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:11.600]   Is it over for Walmart or have they put together a good response?
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:15.280]   They bought JIT.com two years ago for $3 billion.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.040]   That gave them an e-commerce arm.
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:20.760]   Yeah, no, you don't write them off, but it's certainly different, right?
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:24.240]   And I think that, you know, it's interesting when you look at what Walmart's doing in terms
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:27.280]   of e-commerce, let's look at certain markets like New York.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:30.200]   And if you actually look at their acquisition strategy, it's really interesting because
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:34.720]   they're going after brands that are completely 180 from what the Walmart brand is.
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:35.720]   So you did the web on both.
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:40.720]   They bought, they bought JIT even.
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:41.720]   High quality brands.
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:46.720]   Yeah, they just started this new pilot program kind of subscription service thing for rich
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:49.160]   people in New York.
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:53.720]   The irony there is that Walmart is not allowed to operate in New York City because the city
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:56.720]   council and the public will not allow it.
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:59.880]   So they literally cannot have a store in New York City.
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:03.240]   So if you want to go to Walmart and you're in Manhattan, you have to go to Jersey.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:05.680]   You have to go to like, you know, Long Island.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:10.920]   So, but, you know, but the brand has a totally different connotation.
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:16.520]   I think that that's honestly probably where Amazon is the most disastrous to Walmart is
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:21.680]   that their brand doesn't really have any sort of, I guess, kind of value or.
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:22.680]   I guess.
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.360]   I've seen it as a cheap skate store.
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:26.720]   Yeah, but also like a dime store.
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:30.800]   Where everyone uses Amazon, whereas Walmart is really popular in certain pockets of the
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:35.800]   country, like, you know, famously, they'd really gone after the South and had always kind of
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:39.360]   skewed large cities because they didn't really like those markets and they didn't want the
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:40.360]   unions.
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:42.800]   They didn't want to pay the wages.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:47.040]   For me, that's honestly my biggest concern with Amazon isn't so much that they become
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:49.280]   the company store where that's where we get everything.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:53.120]   But what does this do to the wages and the labor situation of the people who work there,
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:54.760]   especially their contractors?
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:58.320]   Dwight, you were saying that you believe.
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.920]   Do you believe Walmart is putting up a good defense?
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:02.560]   Yes, I think so.
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:07.560]   And particularly, one of the things that they're trying to leverage is the whole notion of
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:10.480]   combining online with a physical presence.
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:16.640]   If you go into, you buy something online from Amazon, I mean, from Walmart, you can then
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:20.040]   the next day or even the same day go into the store and pick it up.
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:25.000]   In Houston, they've got several stores that have set up these kind of towers in the middle
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.760]   of the store and rather than going up and waiting in line to pick up your online item,
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:34.480]   you walk up, there's a kiosk, you put your name in and a code and the door pops open
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:38.320]   and there's the item that you bought online.
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:40.160]   So it's very frictionless.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:43.400]   They're experimenting with all kinds of things.
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:48.920]   It's probably an uphill battle in terms of catching online commerce, mindshare.
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:51.640]   They are, I think they're putting up a very smart fight.
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:56.040]   Obviously, is it a coincidence that both Walmart and Amazon are accused of appalling labor
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:45:00.080]   practices or is that just part of the part of the business?
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:06.040]   Well, I think Walmart has made their, much of their money on having the cheapest price
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:11.880]   and that does not make people feel loyal to that brand because they'll just go where
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:14.640]   the cheapest price is just Walmart usually has the cheapest price.
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:15.640]   That's an excellent point.
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:21.760]   Yeah, well, what Walmart really should do is lean hard into what Amazon is not known
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.120]   for, which is their people.
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:27.760]   So the experience at Walmart is also bad.
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:31.520]   And that is something that they really should scale, making sure that when people go into
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:34.720]   the store, that it's a really good experience.
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:39.640]   Walmart's complete strategy is to drive more people into the store.
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:46.400]   When their online presence is to try to force people to do the order online, pick it up
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:47.400]   at the store.
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:49.880]   And when you pick up the store, they don't pick up at the front of the store.
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:50.880]   You have to go all the way in the back.
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:54.960]   So you have to walk completely through the store, then walk all the way back through the
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:46:00.720]   store on the way out so that you can, so they could pick up all those other purchases.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:05.000]   So like all those impulse buys at the register, you'll want to get one of those or, oh, I
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.360]   need to get toilet paper while I'm also picking this up.
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:11.520]   So their whole drive is to get people to go through the store.
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:13.520]   And so they get those additional purchases.
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.360]   So that's interesting.
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:19.360]   Here in Houston, the pickup thing is right up front.
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:23.560]   So when you walk in, it's right there in front of you.
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:24.560]   Let's walk.
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:25.560]   Are you happy?
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:27.560]   We put you in a green field.
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:28.560]   Yeah.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.560]   Yeah.
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:33.520]   And also those towers are towards the front of the store as well that they've been experimenting
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.440]   with those automated towers.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.440]   So that's interesting.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.440]   I'll just say here.
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:42.840]   Isn't that the advantage of Amazon is, and maybe it's just got on my curmudgeon, there's
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:45.120]   no people involved.
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:46.960]   There's no contact with humans.
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:48.960]   I kind of like that.
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:51.600]   Although sometimes you do want that, you know, or if you're wanting to make a return
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.680]   or something, but Amazon's customer service is pretty good.
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:55.320]   Well, let's really think about this.
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.320]   It's a good conversation.
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:58.080]   What is the future of retail?
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:00.320]   Is there a future for brick and mortar retail?
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:05.400]   Is it, you know, I've thought maybe that, and I think you see this.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:08.800]   It's a little bit in some areas, downtown Petaluma.
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:10.720]   You know, retail is dying.
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:14.480]   The places that survive are places that provide more experiential.
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:17.800]   You know, you're not just there to get a product.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:21.240]   And as to your point, Wesley, you're not there to save money.
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:22.640]   But you're there for an experience.
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:25.600]   Movie theaters are trying to do that too, to get people back into the movie theater,
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.600]   which is really dying.
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:30.040]   Is that what does the future of retail look like?
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.960]   Yeah, I think that's part of it.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:35.000]   I mean, I also think what's interesting is you've seen this kind of shift where you have
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.640]   companies like Warby Parker and, you know, Casper and other things that are known for
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:43.680]   being online and then they set up stores where people go and can actually see them in person.
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:44.680]   And there is something-
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:47.760]   Well, sponsors probably both about to be acquired by Amazon, I don't know.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:48.760]   Probably.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:54.640]   But, you know, but it's one of those interesting things of, there's a term for it, like showcasing
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:55.640]   or something like that.
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:56.640]   Showrooming.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:57.640]   Showroom.
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:58.640]   Yes.
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:04.200]   This is actually in the, I'm told in the Torah, it is, it's considered a sin.
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:09.200]   It's called the shopkeepers law that if you go into a shop and you get the shopkeeper
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:14.400]   to help you understand, to purchase and choose a product and then go out and buy it somewhere
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:17.080]   else, that's a sin.
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:18.680]   That's what people do all the time now.
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:20.680]   They showroom and then they go buy on Amazon.
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:21.680]   Yeah, totally.
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:26.560]   But what's interesting is you see these brands and these companies that are primarily online
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:29.080]   who are now opening up, you know, pop-ups or small places where-
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:30.080]   Just to do that.
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:37.040]   A lot of times you have to actually still order it online, but before you buy a mattress,
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:41.080]   before you buy a sound system, before you buy certain other things, it does help if
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:42.760]   you can see it in person.
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:46.640]   And so maybe there's some sort of hybrid, you know, kind of showrooming model.
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:47.640]   I don't know.
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:50.000]   But I think experiential, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.560]   The problem with that is it doesn't scale.
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:53.560]   You know, I think that works for some types of products.
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:54.560]   Yeah.
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:55.560]   Well, it is expensive.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:58.920]   And also you have to kind of, you have a certain type of customer who's going to want
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:48:59.920]   to pay more for that experience.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:03.800]   Leslie, did you ever go to the Austin Whole Foods?
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:06.040]   Wasn't that like there's restaurants in there?
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:07.760]   Oh, it's awesome.
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:14.040]   And during the Christmas season, they do a temporary ice skating rink right in front.
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:15.040]   Oh my God.
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:19.040]   They have a wine tasting bar.
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.560]   They have car chargers.
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:22.880]   So if you have an electric vehicle, you could charge there.
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:25.080]   They want the upscale trade, don't they?
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:33.640]   And then the corporate offices are on top and then back they have a culinary, like a chef
[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:36.560]   cooking lessons.
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:39.160]   So you can learn how to cook better.
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:41.120]   Of course, using their products.
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:42.120]   It's a great place.
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:43.640]   It's an amazing place.
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:46.480]   So if you have a, if you go to Austin, I would definitely go to the headquarters.
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:51.240]   I was wondering if that maybe was one of the reasons Amazon was interested in Whole Foods
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:56.520]   is this whole idea of experiential shopping, but it doesn't scale very well.
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:58.600]   And everybody who works there is super smart.
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:49:59.840]   You ask about a product.
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:01.360]   They can tell you where it is.
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:04.320]   They can tell you why it's better than the one that's to it.
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:06.680]   They really do that well.
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:08.560]   And Walmart really should do that.
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:15.320]   I've gone through many Walmarts and it's always been no one knows where things are.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:17.800]   Things are falling off into the aisle.
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:20.320]   It takes forever to get cleaned up.
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:24.440]   And no one knows how much things cost and they just scan it and move on.
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:27.120]   And as you say, you don't go there for customer service.
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:28.880]   You go there for cheap goods.
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:29.880]   Yeah.
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:34.040]   Because it's midnight and it's open.
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:35.040]   Don't ever go there.
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.040]   Don't go there.
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:37.040]   It's disgusting.
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:38.040]   It's too big.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:41.480]   It's just want some pretzels.
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:43.160]   I gotta get out of here.
[00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:46.000]   There's no people of Whole Foods website.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   That's a good point.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.240]   People along there should be.
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:49.240]   There should be.
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:52.240]   There would be a different kind of website.
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:53.240]   It would be different.
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:55.240]   People of Whole Foods, people of Trader Joe's.
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:56.240]   It's interesting.
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:59.000]   So Seattle proper does not have Walmart either.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.640]   Again, you've got to go to like Red Bend or Kirkland or wherever.
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:03.400]   But you definitely have a whole food.
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:05.440]   You definitely have a trading Joe's.
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:06.440]   Oh yeah.
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:07.440]   You've got a Mardstrom.
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:08.920]   Yes, we do.
[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:10.880]   We have the Nordstrom.
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:15.360]   That as a Nordstrom alkali to missed it very much in New York.
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:17.080]   I was very happy with that.
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:21.240]   But yeah, unfortunately I haven't been to a Walmart in so long.
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:25.600]   I obviously been to them in the South, but it's been a long time since I've been to a
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:26.600]   Walmart.
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:32.360]   But yeah, I feel like one of the big advantages they have that Amazon slowly is encroaching
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:36.960]   on is the fact that if you need something, you can go get it.
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:39.680]   That's the one thing that brick and mortar still kind of has going for it.
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:43.920]   But I think it's hard, especially for big ticket items where people will just go and
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:44.920]   look at it in person.
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:49.240]   You need to see it or increasingly they just learned to trust online reviews.
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:55.360]   And it's a lot easier to find to choose a product on Amazon because you can read all
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:57.360]   the reviews.
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:00.640]   In some ways there's reverse showing showrooming going on.
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:03.320]   I wanted to get a picnic basket.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:08.160]   I could have gone down to, you know, William Sonoma and bought an $80, $180 picnic basket.
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:11.720]   But I just bought one for 50 bucks on Amazon that got good reviews.
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:16.800]   On the other hand, I wanted to give my son Anthony Bourdain's book when Bourdain passed
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:17.800]   away.
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:21.720]   I went to the bookstore about a week later, the guy said, "Oh yeah, we're all sold out."
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.120]   We got a run on it.
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:27.440]   And I thought, if, as he said, "I can order it for you."
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:28.600]   I said, "Yeah, I can order it.
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:30.720]   I can get it faster on Amazon."
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:37.000]   If I were a bookstore, I would have a hundred, I would buy him from Amazon.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:41.640]   I would get a hundred cases of that because you know there's demand, right?
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:42.640]   You got it.
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:47.680]   I think retail's got to start getting smarter if they're going to succeed against Amazon.
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:48.680]   That's for sure.
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:49.680]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:53.000]   And honestly, I'll answer my own question.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   I think it's all over.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.480]   I think Amazon's going to just dominate completely.
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:00.080]   I really do.
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:03.280]   Let's take a little break from the tech burger.
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.280]   It's Dwight Silverman.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.440]   Do you do your radio show still Dwight?
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:07.720]   Or have you stopped doing that?
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:08.720]   No.
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:11.120]   The show I left in 2014.
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:12.120]   I believe.
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:15.280]   And then about two years later, oh, that's...
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:16.640]   He's in my forest.
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:20.040]   Dwight made the mistake of sitting in front of a green screen.
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:21.040]   No, no.
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:22.040]   It's no mistake.
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:23.040]   Look at that.
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:26.120]   Oh, you're at the Frank Lloyd Wright house.
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:27.120]   What's that called?
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:28.120]   Waterfall.
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:29.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:30.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:32.120]   Nice choice, Carsten.
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.120]   Cool.
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:34.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:35.120]   Oh, it's refreshing.
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:36.120]   So, yeah.
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:37.120]   We...
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:38.120]   So what was the question?
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:39.120]   I forgot.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:40.120]   Tech Burger.
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:41.120]   Radio show.
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:42.120]   That's...
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:43.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:45.480]   So the radio show kind of ended on its own.
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:50.440]   The guy who started at J. Lee decided out, he had been doing it for more than 25 years,
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:51.440]   I believe.
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:53.160]   And he decided he had enough.
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:56.880]   Like, occasionally we have a reunion.
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:00.720]   We get together and have a party with all of our favorites.
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:03.160]   That's more accurate there.
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:07.960]   We get together and have a party with our listeners, our top listeners.
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:08.960]   And we've...
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:12.600]   We discuss occasionally like going, taking over the radio station where we used to be
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:14.600]   for an hour every now and then.
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:15.600]   It just...
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:16.760]   It was an Houston public radio, right?
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:17.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:20.880]   It was on KPFT in the Pacific Station here.
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:21.880]   How fun.
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:22.880]   25 years.
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:23.880]   That's nothing.
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:24.880]   What a lightweight.
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:25.880]   Yeah.
[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:26.880]   Yeah.
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:29.920]   But doing this, you know, I started in radio in 1976.
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:31.560]   Are you doing the...
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:32.560]   Are you...
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:36.520]   Do you have any form of the original show you started the first?
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:38.080]   Is the tech guy kind of that?
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:41.600]   No, tech guy's only since 2004.
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:45.520]   My first call in tech show was in '92 with Devorak.
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:50.400]   And I think somewhere somehow I got to find a tape of Devorak on computers.
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.040]   I do have a little...
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:54.200]   I have some snippets that I found.
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:56.840]   I should play them of John going, "Eh."
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:55:01.440]   "I write columns all the time."
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:02.920]   But I don't know if I have a whole show.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:04.400]   Somewhere I'll have to find that.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:06.040]   But I've been doing radios for a long.
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:07.040]   25 years, absolutely.
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:08.040]   Yeah, I do.
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:09.600]   I remember when I started in radio, I thought...
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:12.200]   I saw jobs and said, "You must have three to five years experience."
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:14.000]   I thought, "I'll never have that much."
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.080]   How do you get that much experience?
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:20.920]   Christina Warren is also here.
[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:23.960]   She's film girl, the senior cloud dev advocate at Microsoft.
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:27.680]   You could see her on Channel 9, Microsoft's great video channel.
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:31.640]   It's always a pleasure to have you, Christina, and your giant microphone.
[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:32.640]   And my giant microphone.
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:35.400]   Yeah, no, it looks bigger than it is.
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:39.120]   Yes, something about this positioning.
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:40.560]   Because I'm at my office.
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:41.640]   It's perspective.
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:42.640]   It is, yes.
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:45.760]   I'm at my Microsoft office and at my home office.
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:50.800]   So I'm using a Blue Yeti rather than what I usually use, which is the heel that you sent
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:51.800]   me a number of years ago.
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:52.800]   Oh, nice.
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:53.800]   Yeah, this is good.
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:54.800]   I like this.
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:55.800]   It's good.
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:56.960]   A lot of people use Yetis.
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:57.960]   That's probably the most popular.
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:59.800]   Yeah, no, I mean, it's a good one.
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:00.800]   I mean, it's $100.
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:03.360]   You can sometimes get it cheaper.
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:05.440]   And it's a good USB mic.
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:13.280]   I'm actually giving a workshop on podcasting a women's tech conference in August.
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:19.200]   And that I have a whole, I'm trying to put together a list of recommendation stuff, things
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:20.200]   that won't break the bank.
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:22.760]   And that's definitely going to be number one on the list.
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:25.840]   Just like the easy way to do it by Yeti.
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:28.640]   Is that going to be open to the public or you want to?
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:30.920]   Well, no, I think people can register now.
[00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:32.520]   So it's called Right Speed Code.
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:38.720]   And it's kind of an organization that focuses on helping women in tech focus on those three
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:41.120]   areas, writing, speaking, and coding.
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:45.360]   And I'm going to be doing, like I said, a workshop on podcasting.
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:47.720]   I don't know if it will be recorded.
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:50.920]   I will have the slides online that anybody can look at after the fact.
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:51.920]   But yeah.
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:52.920]   That's neat.
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:53.920]   It's rightspeacode.com.
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:59.080]   If you want to know more, how cool is that?
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:00.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:07.400]   And of course, we're great to have Wesley Faulkner on the eve of his brand new job doing development
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:08.560]   relations for IBM.
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:10.080]   They know you're going to be there on Monday, right?
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:11.560]   They know you're coming in.
[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:13.120]   I'll ask security.
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:14.120]   Okay.
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:16.960]   I don't feel the way this is the first public announcement of it.
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:18.560]   So that's exciting.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:19.560]   Congratulations.
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:20.560]   That's wonderful.
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:21.560]   Thank you.
[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:22.560]   Thank you so much.
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:23.560]   I showed a brought to you by Mughsoft.
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:24.560]   We love Mughsoft.
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:26.800]   I was on the line with the Mughsoft guys.
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:29.680]   I think Thursday or Friday, I was talking to them.
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:35.280]   And what I love about it is Mughsoft is all about empowering the IT professional, making
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:39.280]   you the hero using Mughsoft.
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:45.040]   Now sometimes being an IT person means you're inundated with alerts and tickets and it's
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:49.480]   like alarms are going off and it's crazy.
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:51.080]   And it makes it hard to be productive, right?
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:52.080]   It's stressful.
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:55.600]   But this is why you want to know about Mughsoft AI ops.
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:59.880]   So intelligence for IT operations is really machine learning.
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:01.600]   That's really what I want to call it.
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:05.520]   It reduces those IT alerts and tickets by up to 90%.
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:09.800]   You get rid of nine out of 10 of them guaranteed.
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:12.240]   Only the actionable work items.
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:15.800]   You know, because what happens is it's a cascade.
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:16.960]   Something breaks.
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:17.960]   That's the thing you have to fix.
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:21.880]   But then there's all these alerts associated with it that just end up being noise.
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:25.360]   What you want to do is cluster those events into correlated.
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:27.360]   They call them situations.
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:29.680]   So you don't have to look at another alert or ticket ever again.
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:32.160]   You just say, oh, this is what needs to be fixed.
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:33.640]   Everything will be better.
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:36.120]   It's developed for the enterprise.
[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:37.840]   It requires no rules.
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:41.120]   Mughsoft uses no filters or models to maintain.
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:42.760]   It integrates with your existing tools.
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:45.720]   It literally learns.
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:50.120]   Machine learning learns how to solve the problem.
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:51.120]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:52.880]   Mughsoft AI ops has your back.
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:56.800]   You'll hear to replace you, hear to make you the hero using machine learning.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:59.960]   Lower the frequency and duration of repeat incidents.
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:02.360]   Get back to what you do best.
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:06.280]   We've mentioned before HCL technologies that we have on the website, there's a ton of case
[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:07.280]   studies.
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:10.040]   HCL is a global IT managed service provider.
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:14.360]   They use Mughsoft AI ops as the event management layer in their dry ice platform, which is
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:19.760]   an awesome kind of platform to help manage service providers.
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:24.200]   Having Mughsoft AI ops in there has streamlined operational workflows, reduced time in the
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:27.400]   detect to correct life cycle of instant tickets.
[00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:31.000]   They've actually got a 33% reduction in meantime to restore.
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:34.480]   It means they can support more customers with service quality and keeping the operational
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:37.800]   costs low and efficiency high use.
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:44.080]   The best smarts to make your life better and make you a support hero with Mughsoft AI ops.
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:48.280]   You can reduce your IT tickets and alerts by up to 90% right now.
[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:51.880]   Visit Mughsoft.com to learn more and sign up for a demo.
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:54.720]   Mughsoft, M-double-O-G-S-O-F-T.com.
[00:59:54.720 --> 01:00:01.880]   They're really great guys and they care a lot about the IT Pro.
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:05.640]   It's good to have them on your side.
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:06.640]   Has anybody played?
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:10.400]   I bet you, Christina, you seem like the type that's played with the MIMOG.
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:11.640]   Have you installed the iOS?
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:12.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:13.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:14.640]   So I have not.
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:15.640]   Okay, no.
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:16.640]   I haven't installed it on my iPhone 10.
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:21.680]   I think for either, I think I'm waiting for the next developer beta because there were
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:22.680]   a couple of issues.
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:23.880]   There's lots of issues, yeah.
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:24.880]   Yes.
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:28.720]   And that's the thing is that it's like my, now that it used to be I could get around
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:33.600]   it for work reasons because it was work to have the beta on my phone or I would have
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:37.280]   a secondary phone on loan that would have it.
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.640]   Now I get concerned.
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:42.800]   I'm like, okay, I need my phone for my two-factor auth and for certain other things.
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:46.560]   And so I get concerned with the betas.
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.000]   But I have played with it on other people's devices.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   Actually, Jeremy Bughal from Emojipedia.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.600]   Oh, Jeremy's great.
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:54.600]   I love him.
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:55.600]   Yeah, isn't he the best?
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:00.600]   When I was in London a couple of weeks ago, he created Emojie for me and I love it.
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:06.280]   I'm honestly like that and that in dark mode and Mojave were like the two things that
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:09.600]   I was the most excited about from WWDC, like, honestly.
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.540]   I do want to warn people.
[01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:15.160]   Every time when I start up my phone in the morning because I have iOS 12 on it, I have
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.760]   to wait about five seconds.
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.660]   It just freezes.
[01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:21.400]   It's got all sorts of little problems like that where stuff gets stuck.
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:23.880]   It's a early preview, even though it's public.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.880]   And Mojave fried my hard drive.
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:28.040]   I tried to install it on my iMac Pro.
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:30.400]   And I had to re-inst, I had to format and reinstall them.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.400]   So I'm going to stick with it.
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.200]   Yeah, I put it in a partition.
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:35.800]   So I had it running on.
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:36.800]   Yeah.
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.680]   That's what I was like, again, same thing.
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:44.260]   I was like, okay, I can't, my work MacBook can't mess that up.
[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:45.260]   So I just created a partition.
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:48.780]   I really want dark mode, but it was a silly reason to do that.
[01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:49.780]   And I regret it.
[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:50.780]   Dark mode is awesome.
[01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:51.780]   Oh, you like it?
[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:52.780]   I do.
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:55.780]   I have it on my Mac mini, which is my secondary machine.
[01:01:55.780 --> 01:02:01.660]   And it's been a couple of times when it wouldn't boot and I, you know, press the power button
[01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:03.460]   a few times and finally got it going.
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:06.460]   But dark mode is definitely very cool.
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:11.880]   Apple has capitulated in the keyboard war and finally admitted there's a problem with
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:13.480]   the MacBook Pro keyboards.
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.000]   Anybody here have a problem with those new butterfly keys?
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.480]   I have not.
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:20.400]   However, three of my coworkers have.
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:21.400]   Wow.
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:22.400]   Yeah.
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:26.240]   I think it's safe to say there is an issue, right?
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.000]   Oh, yeah, without a doubt.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   No, definitely.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   Without a doubt.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.920]   Like anybody who I think tries to claim otherwise, I mean, look, they would not do
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:37.220]   what they've done, which is to base up the acknowledge the issue, even though I have
[01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:41.940]   some problems with, you know, some of the, I guess, terms and conditions of getting
[01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:46.500]   repair, but they wouldn't be doing that going all the way back to the 2015 MacBook
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.380]   if there was not something.
[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:50.460]   But yeah, no, I mean, I haven't experienced it myself.
[01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:57.140]   I did manage to get cookie crumbs from an air from an exploded airline cookie in the
[01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:58.140]   lighting courts.
[01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:02.420]   I mean, that doesn't sound good at all.
[01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:03.420]   Yeah.
[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:08.320]   I find it sweetened and send it, put it on Twitter because it was funny.
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:09.320]   Compressed air.
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:10.320]   It was fine.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:11.320]   But I was then very concerned.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:14.400]   It was like, oh my God, I'm going to have like crumbs all underneath this keyboard and
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.560]   it's going to be ruined.
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:21.360]   But no, I have three different coworkers who have had to get theirs repaired.
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:23.440]   And these weren't like even 2016 touch bars.
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.880]   These were like 2017 models.
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:25.880]   So there's something.
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:29.880]   Well, Wesley, you're going to like this and Dwight, you're going to be old enough to appreciate
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:30.880]   it.
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:36.860]   So I'm going to be looking at this for a ridiculous amount of money, a 1990 IBM model.
[01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:37.860]   Oh my God.
[01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:38.860]   Oh man.
[01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:39.860]   Recondition.
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:40.860]   I want to extra microphone.
[01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:43.460]   No, it's the noisiest keyboard alive.
[01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:45.460]   It's a buckling spring keyboard.
[01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:51.660]   Yeah, I have an Apple extended too, which is like the same type of thing.
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:53.020]   This guy restores these.
[01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:55.940]   It's clickykeyboards.com.
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:04:02.240]   He finds them on eBay and stuff, takes them apart, reassembles them, cleans them.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:03.840]   I'll let you know when it comes.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.840]   I just had to.
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:07.840]   Not that it'll charge for it.
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:10.120]   Oh, you don't even want to know.
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:11.120]   You don't even.
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:12.120]   It depends.
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:14.440]   For one thing, it's getting harder to find them.
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.200]   So the price is starting to go up.
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:22.120]   The one I got was, I don't even want to admit it, $200.
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:25.280]   But it's not, it will never wear out, right?
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:26.280]   I mean, this keyboard is.
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.880]   Does he give you a dongle?
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:29.880]   No, yeah.
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.200]   No, because it's a PS2 keyboard.
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.860]   So you have to buy a PS2 to USB.
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:35.580]   He sells them, $16.
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:36.580]   Yeah.
[01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:42.180]   He does go as low as he's having a sale on some modelms from 91.
[01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:43.180]   But they don't have a cable.
[01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:44.740]   So that's kind of not good.
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:45.740]   That's $165.
[01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:49.360]   But I mean, the guy, actually, I feel like it's a good price because he's got to buy the
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:50.360]   keyboard.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:53.420]   He literally takes it apart, cleans it.
[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:54.620]   He replaced screws.
[01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:55.620]   Amazing.
[01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:58.460]   I mean, there were rivets he put screws in instead.
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:00.980]   He puts a lot of work into this.
[01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:03.080]   So it's kind of a labor of love.
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.080]   This is the one I got.
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:05.080]   That's awesome.
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.080]   Yeah, this is the one I got.
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.080]   And honestly, $200 is a lot.
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:10.900]   But if you look at the market for mechanical keyboards right now, which is so hot.
[01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:11.900]   Yeah.
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:13.620]   That's not a brand new one, 165 bucks.
[01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:15.260]   And it's not the buckling key, right?
[01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:16.900]   Yeah, I was going to say exactly.
[01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:18.340]   Usually they aren't the buckling ones.
[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:21.900]   And but yeah, I have a number of friends and coworkers who are really into mechanical
[01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:22.900]   keyboards.
[01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:24.140]   And it is an expensive hobby.
[01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:25.140]   You'll see me coming.
[01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:27.700]   You'll hear me coming.
[01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:32.660]   So I didn't realize this, but I always knew the name buckling key, buckling spring, but
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:35.220]   there is actually like a regular spring.
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:38.300]   And when you press the thing down, you know how the spring goes like this, this, this,
[01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:40.220]   and then it deforms.
[01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:43.340]   And that's when it clicks and makes the contact.
[01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:48.780]   So you're deforming a spring every time you're typing a key.
[01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:50.080]   Kind of crazy.
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:53.960]   But this is how this is why I can't use some MacBook Pro.
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:58.440]   No, because you're like, you're like, ah, this is this is not enough travel.
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:00.760]   I don't mind the keys to be honest.
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:05.040]   I just, obviously there's some sort of design issue.
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:07.560]   I feel like it's stubbing my fingers.
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:09.240]   So many people hate the keyboard.
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:10.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:11.240]   No, no, so many people hate them.
[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:16.640]   I mean, like when I was first reviewing the Mac book within 2015 and 2016, I thought
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:19.360]   it was a little shallow and I didn't love it on the Mac book pro with the touch bar.
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:24.200]   I actually, because it felt like it anyway, I think it's just a, you know, an illusion,
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:26.080]   but it feels like you have a little more travel.
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.600]   And I like that fine.
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:30.880]   Do I prefer the, you know, older, chiclet, MacBook keyboards?
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:33.680]   Yes, but I didn't have an issue with it.
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:38.760]   What I have an issue with is, you know, than not working and a piece of dust being able
[01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:43.840]   to force someone to have to be without the computer for a week because the entire bottom
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:49.160]   portion has to be replaced, which is just insane.
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:52.200]   Here's a, here's a, a GIF.
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:53.200]   Let's see.
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:54.840]   This is where I found out about these keys.
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:55.840]   Here's a GIF of a buckle.
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:56.840]   Oh my God.
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:59.960]   It literally, the spring actually buckles.
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:01.400]   That's amazing.
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:02.400]   Yeah.
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:05.840]   No wonder it's loud.
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:07.240]   It looks loud.
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.240]   Just chum.
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.720]   Sounds like a newsroom.
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:10.720]   Yeah.
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:11.720]   Click the cloud.
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:15.560]   I was going to say, I was going to say that's like, remember when I took a typing class when
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:17.600]   I was like 10 years old?
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:21.040]   Those were the types of keys, keyboards that we all typed on.
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:25.280]   Wesley, when you get your, I presume you go in and you're going to have a desk and they're
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:29.400]   going to have like a brand new laptop on the desk and all that stuff, right?
[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:33.680]   They kind of, when you start a headroom to see if they have any of these keyboards,
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:35.360]   I would say some backroom somewhere.
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:39.600]   Look, I don't mind this MacBook, but can you get me a model M keyboard?
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:40.960]   You must have one somewhere.
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:41.960]   Right?
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:42.960]   Yeah.
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:46.240]   Well, I haven't started yet, but I bet I knew a guy a week from now.
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:47.240]   Yeah.
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:48.240]   Make friends.
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:49.240]   Make friends, Wesley.
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:51.240]   That's the most important thing.
[01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:52.240]   Find friends.
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:54.640]   And make sure you have, make sure you have all of our email address.
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:55.720]   Yes, seriously.
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:08:01.440]   So Dwight, you remember, I mean, these were 1991.
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:04.760]   It would have been, you know, the PC came out in '84.
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:09.800]   It would have been, you know, I don't know, an AT or something.
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:10.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:11.800]   I remember these.
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:12.800]   Yeah.
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:18.480]   You know, who used to make a really good loud clicky keyboard was Compaq here in Houston.
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:20.480]   And I had been to their factory.
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:24.400]   They showed me how they did the testing on it.
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:30.280]   And I like theirs because theirs was actually like a little louder than the IBM.
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:31.280]   I like that a lot.
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:32.280]   It's serious.
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:37.840]   I don't, you know, my wife has, I have the previous generation design, MacBook Pro,
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:38.840]   and I love it.
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:45.320]   My wife has the newest one, and she likes the keyboard, but I think there's this constant
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:48.240]   anxiety because is it going to happen now?
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:49.240]   Right.
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:50.600]   You know, is it going to go out now?
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:55.720]   We have some friend who lives in Mexico who bought the, one of the first versions of the
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:09:02.960]   MacBook that had it, and almost immediately her space bar had this problem.
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:04.160]   Well, and the issue is...
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:05.560]   In Mexico was a problem.
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:09.240]   Yeah, and the issue is like on the model, you could pry off the key caps, you could blow
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:11.000]   air into it and all that stuff.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.160]   These keyboards were not really designed to be repaired at all.
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:19.400]   In many cases, Apple just actually swaps out the whole top part of the computer.
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:20.400]   That's why it's a set $100.
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:21.400]   They did with hers.
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:22.400]   Yeah.
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:24.360]   But she had to come back to the States to get it done.
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:25.360]   That's poor design.
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:26.920]   I placed it to it in Mexico.
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:28.720]   I just feel like that's bad design.
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:31.400]   To design something that really can't be fixed.
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:37.080]   Well, especially something like the keyboard, and to be clear, the earlier models were not
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:38.480]   the easiest to repair.
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:45.200]   So if you go back, I guess, to the 2010 MacBook Pros and the ones earlier than that, those
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:48.880]   you could remove the keys from if you needed to, although it was very easy to break.
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:55.760]   But the ones from the 2013, 2012 onward, you can definitely like the MacBook Airs.
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:00.400]   You can definitely break that if you are trying to replace a key cap yourself.
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:04.160]   But it's not going to require what the new ones do.
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:10.520]   And to me, I get the aesthetic for thinnest and wanting to have the solid piece of aluminium
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:11.520]   and all that.
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:17.640]   But as you say, Leo, you do have to question the design because this isn't something that
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:19.080]   is never going to need repairing.
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:20.160]   This is a keyboard.
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:27.560]   It's one of the most probably, I would think, that in the screen and maybe some of the internal
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:33.920]   components are probably the top three things that get repaired on a MacBook.
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:37.520]   Most people who are bringing it in, I would say the keyboard, regardless of what year
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:42.160]   you have, is probably one of the more common issues that people have with any laptop.
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:46.440]   And so to make it so that you can't even do it in store, you literally have to ship it
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:49.800]   off, that's what's ridiculous to me.
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:55.400]   And all companies, all PC manufacturers, they do this durability testing where if you're
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:11:00.680]   making chairs, you have this artificial butt that just mashes down on the same thing with
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:06.200]   the keyboards, they do these to see how long it'll go before, meantime, the failure.
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.720]   They test all this.
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:14.200]   And so I don't see how they did not pick this up in testing way before the public did.
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:17.960]   Yeah, the only thing I can gather is that they just, you know, when they were doing their
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:20.800]   testing in their labs or whatever, you know, they don't have dust.
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.760]   They don't have real old time debris.
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:23.760]   Right.
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:24.760]   That's right.
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:28.920]   So if it's not cookies, you know, which, like, even if it's just regular stuff, I mean,
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:32.920]   just in the course of using it, that it can happen.
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:37.520]   And it's one of those things that I've talked to people who are ridiculously anal, retentive
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:39.760]   with their devices, who have had the issue.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:42.920]   I've talked to people who, you know, don't care and haven't had the issue.
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:47.040]   I mean, so it seems to kind of be willy-nilly, but the fact that, you know, a speck of dust
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:50.840]   can do it, the fact that, I mean, what was so funny to me, and it was Casey Johnson who
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:54.480]   really, you know, made this story, what it is, and the outline, when she pointed to that
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:58.560]   help document that Apple has, where they, like, show how you can take a can of compressed
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:01.640]   air and, like, spray and, like, you know, like a z-formation.
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:04.360]   It's a special angle and a special movement.
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:05.360]   Yeah.
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:07.760]   And when I saw that, I was like, okay, I'm an Apple stand.
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:11.440]   I'm somebody who will carry water and, like, will defend the company a lot, even though
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.880]   I obviously don't work for the money or any of that.
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:14.880]   But I'm looking at that.
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:15.880]   I'm like, rolling my eyes.
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:16.880]   I'm like, are you serious?
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:21.080]   If that's in your help, Doc, that's something you actually have to put in your documentation.
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.080]   That's a problem.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:27.080]   To me, is acknowledgement of a design problem if you've got to actually create a graphic.
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:28.400]   Well, and Wesley, you're right.
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:33.120]   I mean, we may actually learn that Apple knew because there's three class action lawsuits,
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:37.640]   and really the kind of the critical key to the suits is did Apple know about this before
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:38.640]   they released it?
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:43.480]   Because that's when they really could be, there could be some serious damages if they
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:45.320]   knew about this ahead of time.
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:48.880]   So I'm sure that's one of the things that's going to be a big issue in discovery.
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:49.880]   Yeah.
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:54.120]   I guess as they did, but they figured it was too late to change the design.
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:58.280]   And so they're like, we can't miss the ship date, so we have to go.
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:02.600]   Someone, someone's higher up said, let's ship it, just ship it.
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:07.320]   Although, although, as Christina said, that's not how they test keyboards.
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:09.240]   They don't test keyboards with dirt and grit.
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:10.240]   But I'm on an airplane.
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:15.000]   They test them with a little robot that goes up and down, up and down, up and down, and
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.080]   that's their test for it.
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:19.400]   And one of their posts is cobbled.
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:23.880]   Cookies in a bag crumpled up and see what happens.
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:26.120]   Kyle, we need to know what other code is.
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:27.120]   Yeah.
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:28.120]   Yeah.
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:32.640]   There's enough transitioning from I worked at this company, then I worked it this way,
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:36.280]   now into Apple, that someone would change those practices.
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:44.440]   I'm guessing they have enough of that cross-polarization that they would know what would be the best
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.440]   practices for testing this thing.
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:47.440]   Yeah.
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:48.440]   I fix it.
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:53.920]   Kyle Wiens, the founder of I Fix It, who also sponsor Vars, and we love Kyle, says
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:56.280]   it's design anorexia.
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:00.840]   He said, making a product slimmer and slimmer at the cost of usefulness, functionalality,
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:04.560]   serviceability, and the environment is just not right.
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:06.560]   They did, they really did some stuff.
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:12.360]   They took a keycap, they injected a grain of sand, and they showed how even the tiny
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:17.800]   little grain of sand can block the action of the key, how it's impossible even with
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:20.480]   compressed air to get it out.
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:24.400]   It wedges under the butterfly lever, preventing it from depressing.
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:29.040]   And with the space bar, particularly, there's no way to remove the keycap without breaking
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.040]   it.
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:33.000]   You have, well, the space bar will break.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.080]   And oh, and here's the worst part.
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:41.040]   When they designed it this way, they glued the battery to the keyboard that when they
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:45.840]   designed the retina MacBook Pro, the, I mean, sorry, the MacBook, the battery is glued
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:46.840]   to the keyboard.
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:48.720]   So you can't just replace the keyboard.
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:51.160]   You have to replace a big chunk of that.
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:54.400]   That's why it's so expensive.
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:55.760]   And they knew about it.
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:58.880]   He says, you know, we knew us immediately.
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:03.840]   When we tested it, we downgraded Apple from a seven out of 10 repairability score to a
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:09.040]   two, which is, in fact, the subsequent update went down to a one out of 10.
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:11.640]   The lowest notebook had ever earned at that point.
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:15.080]   Finally, at the end, he says, you know, you should really look at some Dell or HP laptops.
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:19.920]   They're making some very good stuff that's repairable.
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:23.920]   Kyle's always been, you know, an advocate for consumers and the ability to repair stuff.
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:24.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:25.920]   No, no, he has.
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:28.040]   And he's been really kind of leading the whole, you know, right to repair act stuff and all
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:29.040]   of those things.
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.040]   And obviously they're, they're guides.
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:35.160]   I mean, I think we all love them from the gadget porn perspective of seeing, you know,
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:37.160]   that how they're taken apart when it's made up.
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:40.080]   It is also really good for consumers.
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:46.680]   And as, you know, you're pointing out earlier, you're friend in Mexico, you know, who makes
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:49.000]   it very difficult to get to an official Apple repair place.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.000]   Like it's not just people wanting to be cheaper doing it themselves.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.360]   It's that Apple doesn't have service centers that are accessible everywhere.
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:59.520]   And if you've got something like a keyboard, that's a real problem.
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:05.280]   A jury on Wednesday found that Dr. Dre, Jimmy Iovine, both of whom became Apple employees
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:08.520]   when Apple bought Beats and Beats Electronics.
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:14.960]   Oh, a former partner, $25.2 million in royalties.
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:21.120]   Stephen Lamar and his company, Jibe Audio, the suit said that Lamar came to Dr. Dre in
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:27.080]   2006 with the idea for celebrity endorsed headphones.
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:31.880]   He got royalties, but only for the first Beats headphone.
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:35.240]   But now the jury says, no, no, you owe him a little more.
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:38.680]   You owe, he said, I want $130 million.
[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:45.400]   But the jury said, well, $25 million now, and as sales continue, you'll get some of that
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:46.880]   as well.
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:51.680]   So Apple did not respond, but you know, Apple can afford $25 million.
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:55.800]   What's interesting about this is that when I first saw the headline, I'd assume that
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:58.200]   it was with the monster guys.
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:16:59.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:01.480]   You know, who also sued them, didn't they?
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:02.480]   Yes.
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:04.960]   And I think they tried to or something like that, although I think what happened there
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:08.600]   was it was just really bad businesses, decisions all the way around.
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:14.040]   But that's what I'd assume it was with the, you know, monster made the first Beats headphones.
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:15.040]   Yes.
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.040]   Yeah.
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:19.440]   Well, yeah, no, they, they, you know, did a lot of the design and some of the other things,
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:23.880]   somebody that they hired, I guess, anyway, did the design and then Dre and Beats or
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:28.720]   Dre and I, you know, had an ownership stake, then HTC bought an ownership stake, then
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:33.720]   I being bought it back and then they ended up buying all of monster out, basically.
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:40.360]   And so then when the company sold to Apple, you know, obviously, no Lee was very, very
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:41.360]   upset.
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:48.760]   There was a, there's like a great classic gizmodo story from Sam, I can't think of that.
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:49.760]   Little bit, yeah.
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:55.440]   Sam Biddle wrote like before the Apple thing happened about the whole saga, which is fascinating.
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:56.720]   But that's what I'd assumed it was about.
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:00.200]   So I, I'd forgotten that there was another company before they approached the monster.
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:01.200]   Yeah.
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:02.200]   Even with a form monster.
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:03.200]   Yeah.
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:05.680]   The monster's lawsuit failed, by the way, against Beats.
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:06.680]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:10.120]   Again, again, I think that that was because I think what happened is it was just like there
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:11.120]   was, it was bad contract.
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:14.760]   All of us, whoever the monsters lawyers were just, you know, it was just bad business.
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:20.800]   Apple is a baby headline too, because it's not Dr. Dre specifically is the, the previous
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:23.000]   entity is not specifically.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000]   Yeah.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.640]   Dre was the celebrity endorser.
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.800]   Well, she is also an owner.
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:31.520]   So I think the reason he and I being money because they got money from Apple.
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:34.360]   And he was the first rap billionaire, I think.
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:36.120]   I think he tweeted that, right?
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:38.560]   Oh, he says, yeah, I mean, yeah, and that's probably accurate.
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:42.120]   I mean, I don't know if, you know, if you look at all of Jay Z's stuff, if that would
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:45.560]   have, you know, with, with, with a Deaf Jam and whatnot.
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:49.360]   But yeah, definitely.
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:55.160]   I never thought we'd be debating who was the first rap billionaire on Twitter, but it's
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:56.160]   tech.
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:57.160]   It's tech.
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:58.160]   Apple breaking ground.
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:02.040]   Foxconn, rather breaking ground on a plant in Wisconsin.
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:07.960]   Remember they had pledged what was $30 billion to President Trump?
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:09.680]   This is a $10 billion factory.
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:12.000]   They say we'll create thousands of jobs.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.840]   It'll manufacture LCD screen panels.
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:18.840]   For TVs.
[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:24.360]   Yeah, ironically, not for iPhones, but for sharp, which, which Foxconn owns and they
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:28.480]   also own a significant stake of Visio, and that's where the panels will go.
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:30.880]   Can I just go off on this for just one second?
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:31.880]   Please do.
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:40.480]   So, so first of all, the, the, the, the, the, the, the state gave them $3 billion to do
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:41.480]   this.
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:42.480]   In tax breaks.
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:43.480]   In tax breaks.
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:44.480]   Yeah.
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:50.160]   And then at the signing, at the ceremony, Trump said that it'll bring 12,000 jobs.
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:53.560]   And when he tweeted it out, he said 15,000 jobs.
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:54.560]   It's a lot of jobs.
[01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:58.520]   But if you go back to last year, it's supposed to be 3,000 jobs.
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:19:59.520]   It's growing.
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:05.040]   And it's just like, it's, it's, it's so they're inflating this at the same time.
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:07.760]   Harley is like losing, right.
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:11.800]   They're, they're reducing their, their, their workforce there.
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:18.640]   And so I think there's a lot of eyes on this for this to be a win and they keep blowing
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:19.640]   up the numbers.
[01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:20.640]   But if there's a lot of.
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:21.640]   Wesley.
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:25.240]   And Barbie once said, math is hard.
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:26.240]   Okay.
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:29.600]   I'm just, I'm just saying.
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:32.080]   It's not math.
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:34.080]   It's imagination.
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.080]   Imagination is easy.
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:36.080]   It's hard.
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:37.080]   Apples.
[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:38.080]   Rebid.
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:45.440]   This actually felt like, okay, you guys tell me, Matthew Panzareno, who is a tech crunch
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:51.560]   reporter, but also I think beloved by Apple got a scoop that really basically is a PR
[01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:56.240]   release from Apple saying Apple maps is going to be so great.
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:21:00.680]   It's going to be so good.
[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:03.840]   Their rebuilding maps.
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:09.640]   For a long time maps used other companies map data, Tom, Tom and others, Apple is for
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:13.200]   the first time going to be using first party data gathered by this.
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.400]   I thought this was interesting.
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:16.560]   iPhones.
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:17.800]   Like you and me.
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:21.280]   Oh, oh, but it's a privacy first methodology.
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:25.960]   And it's own fleet of cars, kind of like Google's Street View cars.
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:30.360]   The new product will launch in the San Francisco and the Bay Area soon, I guess with the iOS
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:31.360]   12 beta.
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:36.960]   I haven't tried it yet and will cover Northern California by fall.
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:41.400]   But this is a long piece on the remaking of Apple maps, which sounds to me almost like
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:46.120]   the Apple apology tour for the Mac Pro, which Matthew was also a part of.
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:50.720]   Well, Leo, it makes a lot of sense because, you know, Apple increasingly is trying to
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:53.880]   own its own data.
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:58.720]   It's trying to own its all of the components for the iPhone.
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:02.880]   And I think that it sees, it knows the value in mapping.
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:08.240]   And so while yet maybe a press release, I think it's a really interesting press release.
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:12.560]   And one that kind of shows that what they want to do is maintain a lot of control over
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:13.560]   that.
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:16.760]   I mean, that's a really valuable thing to have that kind of location data.
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:22.960]   And they're finally making use in the same way Android does this with Google Maps.
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:25.840]   They use that data from Android in the same way.
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:29.520]   So I think it's a smart move by Apple.
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:32.200]   And hopefully it will make maps better.
[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:36.600]   I started, I put a radio in my car that uses CarPlay.
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:42.960]   And I've started using Apple Maps exclusively when I'm in my car just to see how good it
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:43.960]   is.
[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:48.800]   It's on a par in terms of directions in the places I go with Google Maps.
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:51.320]   So I think it has gotten better.
[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:53.040]   And hopefully this will help too.
[01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:54.720]   Yeah, I live in the Bay Area.
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.160]   So it's always going to be good here.
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:57.400]   So I don't know how.
[01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:59.560]   I think in big urban areas it is.
[01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:03.800]   The kind of places where I've seen it fall down as if I'm out in the booties, you're
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:07.440]   out around Branham or Legrange, you're out there.
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:09.040]   It doesn't do as well there.
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:13.120]   But if you're in a city, it's usually excellent.
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:18.360]   Because anyone tied this back to their ambitions to have their own self-driving car tech.
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:19.360]   Yes.
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:21.040]   They found out that their maps weren't good enough.
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:22.040]   That's right.
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.040]   And that they might-
[01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:24.040]   You know what?
[01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:25.040]   That's probably a good point.
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:26.040]   Matthew does.
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:27.040]   He mentions it specifically.
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:28.040]   Yeah.
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:29.040]   Yeah.
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:31.080]   You can't have a self-driving car unless you have maps.
[01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:33.320]   You've got to get into that.
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:37.040]   And their privacy first said that what they're doing is they're not looking at your destination
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:38.040]   and where you're coming from.
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:41.360]   But they're not telling you how they're determining those.
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:46.960]   Like is it 5 feet from the beginning point or is it 5%?
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:48.880]   This is what Eddy Q told Panzorina.
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:53.560]   We specifically don't collect data even from point A to point B. We collect data when we
[01:23:53.560 --> 01:24:01.600]   do it in an anonymous fashion.
[01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:02.760]   But we don't collect data.
[01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:06.480]   But when we do it, we do it in an anonymous fashion in subsections of the whole.
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:08.120]   But we don't collect data.
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:11.800]   So we couldn't even say there's a person that went from point A to point B. We're collecting
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:13.600]   segments of it.
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:14.600]   I don't.
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:16.600]   How thick are those red parts in that chart?
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:17.600]   Yeah.
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:18.600]   What does that mean?
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:19.600]   What does this mean?
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:20.600]   It doesn't-
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:24.200]   Also, I can appreciate what they're saying for privacy reasons.
[01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:26.400]   And I get that that's a sales pitch.
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:27.880]   And for some people, it's the value add.
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:31.360]   But the reason that Google Maps has been good for so long and I kind of went on a mini
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:36.080]   Twitter kind of not rant but kind of had a threat about it was because, I mean, Google's
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:38.560]   been doing this for a decade, right?
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:39.560]   Like they were in-
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:42.120]   And they don't hide it, by the way.
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:46.800]   You can look at your Google location information and see everywhere you've been for years.
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:47.800]   Yes.
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:50.640]   But what I'm saying though is that part of the reason Google is so good is not just that
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:52.080]   they had the cars going around.
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:55.640]   A, they had for many, many years, they closed it a number of years ago, but they had an
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:25:00.720]   open map maker data where anyone could kind of plot their own areas.
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:04.720]   And that was hugely beneficial in areas like parts of the world that had never had updated
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:08.280]   mapping and where the existing third party data didn't exist.
[01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:11.000]   So you had people who would update things automatically.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.960]   And then they started gathering really early on even before the iPhone.
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:17.760]   And I think actually from the iPhone, I think that was one of the reasons why Apple dropped
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:24.360]   Google Maps from the default thing was that they were grabbing information from users
[01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:27.440]   and able to kind of build that into their whole systems.
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:31.720]   And so that's one of the reasons why, frankly, it's so much better.
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:35.360]   And but you're right, there is a kind of a lot of fuzziness of, okay, well, how much
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.360]   data are you collecting?
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:39.840]   And the part of me is like, well, I appreciate that you're not collecting my data or so you
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:40.840]   claim.
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:43.880]   But if you're collecting part of it, and if this is all going to be anonymized, I'd
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:49.600]   really rather not be stuck on an access road where we have to go and reverse a mile because
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:54.040]   the Apple Maps directions to get to the lake took us through this place where yes, we did
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:55.480]   actually, this is a true story.
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:57.040]   This has happened last 4th of July.
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:05.240]   We had to go and reverse a mile on a back road kind of thing because it took us a very wrong
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:06.240]   route.
[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:09.920]   And now, I don't know, Google wasn't much better, but it was better.
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:15.400]   And this is kind of like the mountains kind of part of Washington state, which isn't
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:20.000]   well mapped by any of these companies, but the Apple Maps was particularly egregious in
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000]   that case.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:28.000]   So I almost prefer Google's system where you can go to google.com/dashboard, you can see
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.600]   all the data they've collected.
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:34.840]   There's a button that you can turn off location history, so you have a choice, but I have
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:36.360]   it on because I think it's useful.
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:41.640]   And if it helps them make maps more power to them, I just looked on Tuesday, this is
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:44.800]   what I did, Tuesday, February 6, 2016.
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:47.960]   This is exactly all the places I went.
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:48.960]   Here's the map of it.
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:51.640]   I didn't even do a playback and watch it move around.
[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:52.960]   And I know it was on a bicycle.
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:54.360]   I just picked this at random.
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:59.560]   I even have Google's pictures I took when I was doing this.
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:01.200]   And you can delete it.
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:03.560]   You can have Google not collected.
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:04.840]   But at least they tell you.
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:09.440]   Apple is like, well, we don't collect data, but if we did, it wouldn't be very much data,
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:13.760]   but they don't give you the option to say no, I guess they do in location history.
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:17.240]   But I would almost prefer the up frontness of Google and all this.
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:19.240]   I don't think it's so bad.
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:23.880]   Looking at the little chart with the little red things, what I suspect they're doing is
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:27.480]   you back out of your driveway, you're going a certain speed.
[01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:29.480]   They know you're at your destination.
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:34.320]   You pull into the street, you speed up, you get past, you know, 25 miles an hour and they
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:36.240]   go, OK, now they're traveling.
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:37.240]   Take data.
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:38.240]   Take data.
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:42.200]   And that's when, and for a map, that's the important thing.
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:44.400]   You want to know the route.
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:47.200]   You don't necessarily need to know the A to B.
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:49.120]   So that actually makes a lot of sense.
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:51.080]   It's OK for them to do this.
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:53.600]   Why don't they just say it though?
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:59.840]   He kind of did, but it wasn't, I mean, it was PR speak.
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:06.080]   The other thing is, the other thing is it's telling that in the next version of iOS, in
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:12.760]   iOS 12, and its extension into CarPlay, they will start allowing third party mapping programs,
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:15.440]   including Waze and Google Maps.
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:25.440]   So they are going to let you use other apps, finally, which I really look forward to.
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:31.160]   We're going to take a little break to talk about Casper Matrices, ironically.
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:34.520]   Before we do that, though, let me show you a little movie we made of some of the fun stuff
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:37.160]   that happened this week on Twitch.
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:39.040]   Previously on Twitch.
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:40.960]   Jeff Jarvis, you got back in time.
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:41.960]   Nice to see you.
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:42.960]   Well, not really.
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:43.960]   I was late.
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:47.200]   I'm going to sneak above my lower third.
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:50.080]   You finally got your whole title in here.
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:51.320]   All about Android.
[01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:55.920]   We often argue about iPhone, iOS, Android, which one's better, which one?
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:57.960]   Why can't you not have both?
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:04.040]   This is a iPhone case that has an Android device running on the back of it.
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:07.320]   It's called the iSmartcase, and it was funded on an E.M.E.G.O. last year.
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:09.240]   I put in it's now available.
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:10.240]   I'm...
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:13.000]   That's a movie.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000]   Go England.
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000]   Aha.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000]   iOS today.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.640]   It's me in my car.
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:22.640]   Driving.
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:25.240]   I'm on my way.
[01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:27.440]   My running.
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:32.480]   I know in some countries and cultures, sticking your tongue out is rude.
[01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:36.400]   And I'm not trying to be rude to Megan, but that's a new feature of the Mimojis.
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:37.800]   You noted something right away.
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:38.800]   Yes.
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:39.800]   Is that I have no ear holes.
[01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:40.800]   Yes.
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:41.800]   Completely accurate.
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:44.800]   You see, you have no ear holes.
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:47.440]   Ear holes are for listening.
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:48.440]   They're for listening.
[01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:49.440]   Who listens?
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:50.440]   Not me.
[01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:51.440]   Twit.
[01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:54.360]   You heard me.
[01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:57.920]   There was one project that I always wanted to do, but they wouldn't let me do because of
[01:29:57.920 --> 01:29:58.920]   the insurance.
[01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:02.760]   And then here I have a, a vat of molten lead.
[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:05.080]   I didn't think you were actually going to bring that.
[01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:06.080]   I know, right?
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:07.080]   Let's go ahead and do this.
[01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:09.760]   I should be able to wet my hands slightly.
[01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:11.360]   This is extremely dangerous.
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:12.840]   It's extremely dangerous.
[01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:14.440]   So I've got this vat of lead.
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:17.440]   Here's my wet hand and oh, my God.
[01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:18.440]   Oh, see that?
[01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:19.440]   Wow.
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:20.440]   It totally works.
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:22.400]   It verifies that that physical principle works.
[01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:23.400]   Wow.
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:24.400]   I can't even explain what just happened.
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:25.400]   I know.
[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:26.400]   You would have to see it to believe it.
[01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:27.400]   You'd have to see it.
[01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:28.400]   You'd have to see it.
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:29.400]   You'd have to see it.
[01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:30.400]   You'd have to see it.
[01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:31.400]   You'd have to see it.
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:32.400]   You'd have to see it.
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:33.400]   You'd have to see it.
[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:34.400]   You'd have to see it.
[01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:35.400]   You'd have to see it.
[01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:36.400]   And you'll never see it.
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:37.400]   That's the last show, wasn't it?
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:38.400]   Yeah.
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:39.400]   Yeah.
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:41.200]   He's gone back to, he got called.
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:42.200]   He's gone back to--
[01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:43.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:44.200]   We're Rome.
[01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:45.200]   Yes.
[01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:46.200]   Wow.
[01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:47.200]   How long is his--
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:48.200]   It's his--
[01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:49.200]   It's eternal.
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:50.200]   It's eternal.
[01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:52.000]   No, I realize what I mean.
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.200]   I mean, this particular assignment.
[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:55.600]   No, he'll be there forever.
[01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:56.600]   I don't know.
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:57.600]   He doesn't say he's coming back.
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:59.240]   He just says I'm going to Rome.
[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:00.800]   I don't think it works.
[01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:01.800]   It's not like the army.
[01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:02.800]   It's not like you said.
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:05.800]   Oh, you're going to be a two-year or a two-year or a duty at the Vatican.
[01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:06.800]   That's my thought.
[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:10.400]   I thought that they assigned you to new parishes every couple of years or whatever.
[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:11.400]   But I guess it could be like a--
[01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:12.400]   I don't know.
[01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:14.400]   I think once the pope calls you, you just kind of--
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:15.480]   No, I think you're right.
[01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:17.200]   I think the pope is like--
[01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:19.840]   Was that you, Wesley?
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:21.840]   My kids, sorry about that.
[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:22.840]   They're so cute.
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:23.840]   I'm looking.
[01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:25.840]   I know it's not Dwight.
[01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:27.480]   I'm pretty sure it's not Christina.
[01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:31.320]   It's got to be Wesley.
[01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:33.120]   Do they like it in place?
[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:35.520]   Yes, it has stairs.
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:38.440]   Oh, they just are fascinated with stairs.
[01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:41.240]   When you get to be my age, you don't want stairs.
[01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:44.600]   Are we going to see them coming in doing this in a few minutes?
[01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:45.600]   They're still in the--
[01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:49.240]   And Wesley's not wearing any pants.
[01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:51.880]   All right, show it.
[01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:57.080]   Hey, show it to you by-- oh my goodness, I love my Casper.
[01:31:57.080 --> 01:32:00.480]   Casper Mattresses, an online retailer-- and wait till you hear the deal we've got for
[01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:05.360]   you today-- an online retailer, premium mattresses for a fraction of the cost, Casper, really
[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:06.600]   started this trend.
[01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:12.280]   They realized that the mark-up, the middleman markup at a mattress store is so absurd that
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:17.240]   they could revolutionize the industry by just getting rid of resellers and selling directly
[01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:18.360]   to you.
[01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:20.840]   And what an amazing solution that's been.
[01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:25.600]   And you do save the original Casper mattresses and obsessively engineered mattress at a fair
[01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:30.280]   price, combining multiple supportive memory foams for a sleep surface with just the right
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:32.480]   sink, just the right bounce.
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:35.040]   Plus it's breathable design, let's you sleep cool.
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:39.760]   On a hot summer night, like tonight, you will be so happy you have a Casper mattress.
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:41.520]   You just regulate your temperature to the night.
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:43.040]   You're very cool.
[01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:45.800]   Long lasting comfort, long lasting support.
[01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:46.800]   You can buy it online.
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:51.120]   And as I always tell you, it's completely risk-free because you get 100 days.
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:55.880]   So instead of lying on a mattress in a showroom, you can lie on it, experience the mattress
[01:32:55.880 --> 01:32:58.520]   in real life in your house for 100 days.
[01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:01.680]   If at any time you say, "Nah, it's not right for me," you call them, they'll take it back,
[01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:03.680]   they'll refund you every penny.
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:06.720]   And they'll take care of it.
[01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:10.200]   Casper mattresses uphold the highest environmental production standards you know because when
[01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:12.880]   you open the box, it smells fresh and clean.
[01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:15.800]   Some mattresses, you've got to air them out, not the Casper.
[01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:17.800]   They're always made in the USA.
[01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:23.720]   Free shipping and returns in the US, in Canada, and in the UK.
[01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:27.200]   Get a Casper mattress today for a limited time.
[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:29.000]   Get this.
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.200]   We've never had a deal this good.
[01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:35.920]   Give up to $225 off your order by visiting Casper.com/savings.
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:36.920]   This is limited time.
[01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:41.800]   It's this week only through July 9th terms and conditions to apply.
[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:45.800]   Casper.com/savings up to $225 off.
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:49.520]   If you've been thinking, if you've been dreaming, if you've been dying to get a Casper mattress,
[01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:51.720]   now is the time.
[01:33:51.720 --> 01:34:02.840]   But only through July 9th, Casper.com/savings.
[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:15.200]   Bring this up because there's a... if did you ever take one of those, which Game of Thrones,
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:17.740]   character are you quizzes?
[01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:24.400]   Or you, Christina, nametest.com, the website behind the quizzes, apparently had a flaw
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:30.800]   that publicly exposed information from 120 million monthly users.
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:39.440]   If you deleted the app, even if you deleted the app, this is a medium article by Inti.
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:47.880]   I'm going to mispronounce your name, Inti the Soutclair, who discovered this, by the
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:50.800]   way, he is Jasmine.
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:53.040]   That's his date, Princess.
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:35:01.200]   It discovered this that in the URL that is sent, it's all public, it's all unencrypted,
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:04.480]   any third party could request it, and it's been going on for years.
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:09.640]   This is just one more fabulous way.
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:13.880]   You asked me Wesley before the show what my current Facebook status is.
[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:15.280]   It changes all the time.
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:17.320]   It's complicated.
[01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:24.600]   Right now I'm deactivated because I just...
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:31.000]   I don't want to bury the one great thing about this article is that it was all a result of
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.800]   Facebook's book bounty program.
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:39.920]   This was allegedly caught before anyone else got the data.
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:41.080]   Thank God for researchers.
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:43.600]   Thank God for book bounties.
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:47.320]   That's a really good point, Wesley, because there's a lot of effort to shut people like
[01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:48.320]   this down.
[01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:51.320]   Oh, he's a hacker.
[01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:55.960]   He got $8,000 donated to the Freedom of the Press Foundation, so that's good.
[01:35:55.960 --> 01:36:01.640]   Now we don't know that nobody got it, but just that this was fixed before it was published,
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:06.400]   but that doesn't mean other people hadn't discovered it and didn't say anything about
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:07.400]   it.
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:09.840]   Yes, good point, Wesley.
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:10.840]   Hi, Inti.
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:13.120]   Thank you for confirming the fix.
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:15.720]   So he got a nice little bounty.
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:21.280]   He got $4,000 and then they matched it and donated a total of $8,000 to the Freedom of
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:23.040]   the Press Foundation.
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:26.120]   Nice.
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:27.120]   He says, "I have no answer."
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:28.120]   Go ahead.
[01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:32.440]   Well, they do another website where you can look up to see if your data was part of this.
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:35.440]   I mean, I think, yeah, exactly.
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:37.440]   Actually, somebody should just build a quiz.
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:38.440]   Yeah.
[01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:40.600]   Which of your data was stolen?
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:41.600]   Which of your data?
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:43.600]   Which of your data was stolen?
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:44.600]   Exactly.
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:46.640]   Which of gave all your data away?
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:51.560]   This is the Raise Your Blood Pressure segment of the show.
[01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:59.160]   The SEC is now going after an engineer at Equifax for insider trading.
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:00.880]   But the CFO, yeah.
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:01.880]   It's fine.
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:02.880]   The execs, they're fine.
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:03.880]   They're getting their...
[01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:04.880]   Yeah.
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:05.880]   They're fine.
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:08.080]   But a website engineer that Equifax asks...
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:10.320]   This is about the Equifax data breach, right?
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:15.040]   Equifax asked the engineer to design a site for a company, some other company, that had
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:18.360]   a data breach to help customers find out.
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:21.920]   He started designing the site and he said, "This is not for some other company.
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:23.680]   This is for Equifax."
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:26.440]   So he shorted the stock.
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:30.920]   And when Equifax then a week or two later announced it, he made $35,000.
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:32.080]   He's in trouble.
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:33.080]   Right.
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:36.920]   The CFO, you know, these things happen.
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:42.760]   By the way, has Equifax ever been punished, fined, or in any way, dinged?
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:43.760]   No.
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:44.760]   No.
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:47.960]   In fact, the government gave them another contract that apparently there hadn't been
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:50.920]   another bid on and it was confirmed that, "Oh yeah, the government's going to continue
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:51.920]   to work with them."
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:53.920]   No, it's insane.
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:59.240]   At some point, you just give up.
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:01.080]   I don't know what to say about all this stuff.
[01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:04.760]   No, I mean, I just kind of have this point, like, is this reality.
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:06.440]   We have to accept reality.
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:10.760]   Reality number one is that your Facebook data has been breached in some way because of either
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:14.720]   something you've done or more likely because of something that one of your friends or someone
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:16.800]   that you added to your friends list is done.
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:21.960]   The number two thing is that your social security number is public because of all the
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:28.120]   numerous breaches and because Equifax is such a show.
[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:32.320]   There's a word before that that I can't say on Squit.
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:40.880]   So, yeah, as sad as it is, I almost have just been like, "Yeah, I will likely be the victim
[01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:41.880]   of identity theft.
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:48.400]   We all will have to watch our credit reports for the best of our lives."
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:52.400]   It kind of points out how bad and dumb credit reports are in general and I kind of feel
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:57.000]   like maybe this would be a good time to just kind of reset the whole system, but I don't
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.000]   know.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:02.440]   It also shows the weakness of the CPB, the consumer protection there.
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:03.760]   Even weaker now.
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:04.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:10.120]   This is like a textbook case that they should go after this company and put some safeguards
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:15.360]   in and punish them, but right now they just get away with this.
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:20.620]   There's been a lot of talk, particularly in the Senate, about wanting to see fines for
[01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:25.680]   Equifax and there's been discussion of legislation, but nothing has happened.
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:31.200]   Equifax says we've spent or will have spent $275 million in remediation.
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:33.880]   I'm sure they're going to get a nice tax write-off for that.
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:37.880]   I know they're making money because one of the things they offered everybody is free
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:42.560]   credit monitoring, but it was only for a year and then I'm sure it automatically renews
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:48.400]   and you're paying Equifax now to keep an eye on your credit report.
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:50.960]   I'm sure they made more than they lost.
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:56.760]   It's a good, try the data breach technique.
[01:39:56.760 --> 01:40:01.720]   Bruce Schnire, a good article on his blog, manipulative social media practices.
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:05.480]   He calls out a Norwegian Consumer Council report.
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:08.640]   We have to research this in Norway.
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:14.280]   The executive summary, Facebook and Google have privacy intrusive defaults where users
[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:19.760]   who want the privacy-friendly option have to go through a significantly longer process.
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:23.960]   They even obscure some of these settings so the user cannot know that more privacy-entrusive
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:26.360]   option was pre-selected.
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:31.320]   The pop-ups from Facebook, Google and Windows 10 have design symbols and wording, this is
[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:38.680]   really interesting, that nudge consumers away from the privacy-friendly choices.
[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:42.960]   Choices are worded to compel users to make certain choices while key information is omitted
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:44.560]   or downplayed.
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:47.320]   None of them lets the user freely postpone decisions.
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:48.320]   Decide now.
[01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:49.680]   You have to decide now.
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:53.440]   So Facebook and Google threaten users with loss of functionality or deletion of the user
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:41:00.320]   account if the user does not choose the privacy-entrusive option.
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:01.320]   Water is also wet.
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:02.320]   I don't know.
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:03.320]   Yes.
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:06.760]   And in this news, water also wet.
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:10.120]   Schnire, who's great, says I'm a big fan of the Norwegian Consumer Council.
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:12.840]   They've published some excellent research.
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:15.640]   And just add that to you.
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:20.480]   I mean, we know about this from A/B testing, that you can be coerced without your knowledge
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:22.560]   into clicking a certain choice.
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:28.400]   The colors, the shapes of the buttons, the verbiage all can contribute to pushing you
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:29.960]   in the direction that you may not even know.
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:32.920]   Yeah, I think they call them like dark patterns or something like that.
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:34.160]   That's exactly right.
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:40.840]   And in terms of ads, Facebook gets paid per click or per view.
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:43.240]   They want to have that engagement.
[01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:47.120]   So when someone clicks on an ad, they get that money.
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:52.480]   So they're not going to encourage people to see, for instance, this is how you opt out
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:53.520]   of seeing these ads.
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:55.760]   This is how you see more ads.
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:59.200]   They want you to lean the other way around.
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:00.680]   It's in their best interest.
[01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:05.080]   And that's why when people say there's going to be transparency and advertising, you have
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:09.880]   to go up to the hamburger menu and click and then find and go down and figure out how
[01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:10.880]   you're targeted.
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:13.240]   They want you to go through all these steps.
[01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:17.400]   But if you wanted to buy that product, there's a buy button right at the bottom.
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:18.960]   It's just how they make it.
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:20.480]   Yeah, why not?
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:21.480]   Why not?
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:22.480]   Yeah.
[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:28.560]   Twitter has now an ad transparency setter, ads.twitter.com/transparency.
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:31.960]   When you search for any advertiser, you can see all the ads that are currently running on
[01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:36.000]   Twitter, including promoted only tweets or if an ad was suspended and why.
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:40.640]   So this is a response to dark ads where a company buys ads, but only the people who
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:42.880]   are targeted by those ads can see them.
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:47.320]   Now you can- Yeah, Facebook just did something similar with their video ads anyway.
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:49.960]   I know that some people were mad because they're like, "Oh, no, all your competitors
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:51.240]   can see you're what your ads are."
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:57.640]   I'm like, "Well, if your ad is that, if your idea is that hidden, I think you've got
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:42:58.640]   bigger problems.
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:01.400]   If someone's seeing your ad is going to make them steal it."
[01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:02.400]   Yeah.
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:07.960]   All of this, of course, due to GDPR and increased heat from Congress, and I think this is all
[01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:10.720]   a good thing.
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:13.320]   The more the companies reveal the better.
[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:14.320]   All right.
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:17.320]   But I think Twitter is like seven days of history.
[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:18.920]   Yeah, it doesn't go back far.
[01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:19.920]   Yeah, but it's far.
[01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:20.920]   Yeah.
[01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:24.720]   So you'll need a third party that keeps eye on this so they can understand patterns because
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:28.920]   if someone says, "Oh, we don't want these concurrent ads, we do this, wait a couple
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:32.080]   days, wait a week or so," and then do another ad.
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:34.840]   There's going to be someone needs to keep an eye on this hopefully.
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:35.840]   Yes.
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:42.120]   So a great and first and investigated journalism will help expose the really bad actors as
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:43.680]   we go through this trend.
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:48.440]   But it's not going to be easy for us people who are just casually looking at this site
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:49.440]   even.
[01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:50.440]   And I do want to-
[01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:51.440]   I know you're right.
[01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:52.440]   Yeah.
[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:53.920]   So somebody step up, right?
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:54.920]   Volunteers, anybody?
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:55.920]   Yeah.
[01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:58.760]   Although what's funny about that is as you were saying that Wesley was thinking that
[01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:02.440]   probably violates the terms of service in some way, the API things.
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:08.720]   So yeah, hopefully some investigative journalism unit or somebody will start something to start
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:11.720]   monitoring that stuff and archiving it someplace.
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:14.280]   You should be able to scrape that.
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:15.280]   I mean, you should.
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:20.600]   I'm just saying I could just see them go, "No, no, no," the same way they did with
[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:23.760]   like, "Plittle whoops" and things like that.
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:24.760]   Yeah.
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:25.760]   Hey, I buried the lead.
[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:26.760]   I have to apologize.
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:31.120]   Yesterday there was a big epic rocket launch in Fortnite.
[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:32.120]   How did I miss-
[01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:33.120]   [laughter]
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:40.640]   It's funny to read- speaking of tweets, the tweets about it because apparently the killing
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:43.280]   stopped for a moment when the rocket went up.
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:45.440]   It opened a dimensional rift.
[01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:51.280]   A one-time event, people logged in and a lot of people were pissed because they got
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:54.840]   killed before the rocket went up and they missed it.
[01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:55.840]   Aw.
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:56.840]   Aw.
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:45:01.600]   So who else got killed before the rocket launch asks Mr. Knox?
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:05.960]   The Fortnite rocket launch was awesome and I can't wait for the next season, but whoever
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:09.280]   killed me, I hope you stub your toe on a door.
[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:10.760]   What happened with the rocket in Fortnite?
[01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:14.600]   I was too far away to see what happened and some idiot killed me.
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:18.960]   I just got killed walking- see the key was to let everybody look at the rocket and snipe
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:19.960]   them all.
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:22.120]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:26.040]   So the person who killed me is the rocket was launching in Fortnite and I won't say the
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:27.040]   words.
[01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:29.480]   This is why I stick to playing Redneck Rampage.
[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:30.480]   [laughter]
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:31.480]   Oh really?
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:32.480]   Is that your game?
[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:34.280]   I loved Redneck Rampage.
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:39.120]   It was why the buggy is first-person shooter ever, but it was hilarious.
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:40.440]   It's fun and that's the key.
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:41.440]   Oh yeah, no, that was a good game.
[01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:47.480]   That was the one that took the inverse of the big hunter or whatever, like the big game
[01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:51.080]   hunter or whatnot where instead you were like the deer going after the hunters.
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:52.080]   Is that right?
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:53.080]   No, no, Redneck Rampage.
[01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:54.080]   Whoa, sorry.
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:55.080]   Redneck Rampage.
[01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:58.400]   That was the game, not me.
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:45:59.400]   That's right.
[01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:05.640]   Redneck Rampage was essentially a first-person shooter with Rednecks.
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:08.800]   You ride around in a pickup truck and you-
[01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:10.200]   Do you recognize that?
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:12.000]   The minute that happened you went on.
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.240]   Yes, I know exactly what's going on.
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:15.240]   That's awesome.
[01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:18.800]   And you can fire explosive chickens.
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:19.800]   Oh, yes.
[01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:20.800]   Nice.
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:23.360]   It was a great game.
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:25.200]   Those were the days, kids.
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:30.040]   When men were men and games were creepy.
[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:33.080]   Let's see.
[01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:34.680]   You were talking about Wi-Fi.
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:42.120]   Wi-Fi security Dwight was mentioning the new 802.11AX and that'll be coming out sometime
[01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:43.680]   next year you said Dwight?
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:48.760]   Well, late next year you'll probably see the earlier, the earliest routers.
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:55.720]   WPA3, which is the security protocol that was written about this week by the Verge,
[01:46:55.720 --> 01:47:01.000]   myself and others, will come sooner.
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:05.880]   On some devices that have powerful enough processors it may come as an upgrade, like
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:08.560]   for example, some of the best routers now.
[01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:15.520]   But WPA3 fixes a lot of really interesting issues, including one feature of it allows
[01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:22.240]   you if you are in a coffee shop, which of course now is a very insecure place with Wi-Fi.
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:27.880]   If you're in a coffee shop and you have a WPA3 device and the router uses WPA3, you
[01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:31.880]   can actually connect securely without a password.
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:32.880]   Oh, interesting.
[01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:34.800]   How do they do that?
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:35.800]   It's an open protocol.
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:38.080]   It sees WPA3.
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:44.160]   The open security protocol is turned on in it and the two devices do a handshake and connect
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:45.160]   securely.
[01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:48.600]   They agree on a password in the kind of share.
[01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:53.200]   So is the traffic then private to anybody else in the coffee shop?
[01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:58.520]   Yes, unless of course you can still be hit with a man in the middle attack where it looks
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:00.080]   like the coffee shop.
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:01.080]   Right.
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:02.360]   Nothing can prevent that.
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:06.800]   But once you connect to it, it's hard to jump in and sniff packets.
[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:14.120]   Perfect forward secrecy as well, which means even if your keys are lost later, they can't
[01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:17.720]   go back and read older data, that's important.
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:18.720]   So that'll be good.
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:24.840]   WPA3 coming soon to some existing routers, but it will be required in AX routers, right?
[01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:29.400]   The chances are for most people who have a router in their home now, you're not really
[01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:32.200]   going to be able to have a software upgrade for that.
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:37.080]   It's the newer, higher-end ones with processors that can handle it that will.
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:44.280]   But you won't really see the full rollout of WPA3 until probably later next year.
[01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:49.680]   And at that point, a lot of people may go through their repurchase cycle for buying a
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:51.800]   new router, and that would be a time to do it.
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:57.440]   Or you could just wait till AX, which is another year and a half away from that.
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:05.160]   California's deadline for ballot propositions in the fall, in November, was June 28th this
[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:06.160]   week.
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:09.360]   And a couple of things happened because of that deadline.
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:16.240]   One, a ballot measure to eliminate daylight saving time in California will make the ballot.
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:17.240]   Nice.
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:18.400]   That's got to be a yes, right?
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:19.680]   Who would vote against that?
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:21.240]   Who likes time changes?
[01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:22.240]   Farmers.
[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:23.240]   Farmers don't even like it.
[01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:24.240]   I don't know.
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:26.400]   I've always heard it was the farmers fault that we had to begin with.
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:29.120]   Poor farmers are getting blamed for daylight saving time.
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:30.280]   There's no...
[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:33.520]   It's a huge hassle in OS's.
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:38.480]   I remember when Microsoft had to do all the changes.
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:42.160]   And in terms of OS's, it sucks.
[01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:43.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:46.400]   When they changed the date, I remember both Microsoft and Apple both had to...
[01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:48.040]   It was like five or six years ago.
[01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:51.040]   I actually remember it was that South by because it happened during South by it happened a
[01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:54.040]   week earlier than usual, and there had to be emergency updates.
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:55.040]   Right.
[01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:59.040]   So Apple always screws up everyone's alarm.
[01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:02.880]   They disable alarms and people don't know when wakes up the next day.
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:07.640]   Well, not to mention the fact that the Monday after time changes, there are more accidents,
[01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:09.120]   more heart attacks.
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:10.320]   It's stressful.
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:14.200]   And it's particularly stressful when you spring forward because you lose an hour.
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:15.440]   So let's just...
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:16.440]   You can't legally...
[01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:17.440]   I think...
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:18.880]   No state can say we're not gonna...
[01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:22.200]   We're gonna stay in saving time because the...
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:24.680]   Your time zone is a national thing.
[01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:27.520]   And so Congress would have to say, "Oh, you're in a new time zone."
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:31.120]   So California will stay in daylight in standard time.
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:34.680]   It just won't spring forward, which is I think...
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:35.680]   Indiana...
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:37.480]   There's one state in daylight.
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:38.480]   Indiana doesn't.
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:40.120]   Arizona doesn't.
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:42.200]   I think Hawaii doesn't.
[01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:43.880]   There's a few states that don't do that.
[01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:46.560]   Yeah, Arizona doesn't because they don't want any more sunlight.
[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:48.840]   They got enough as it is.
[01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:49.840]   That's right.
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:54.600]   The other thing that happened is that California state legislature actually did something because
[01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:59.920]   had they not done something, a real estate developer had gotten a ballot measure in November
[01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:03.840]   that was a very tough data privacy law.
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:05.600]   And the legislature...
[01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:11.760]   But he agreed with the legislature, if you passed this law before midnight June 28th,
[01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:13.240]   then I'll withdraw the ballot measure.
[01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:16.400]   They did with hours to spare.
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:17.700]   And he did.
[01:51:17.700 --> 01:51:19.280]   So we won't be able to vote on this in the fall.
[01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:23.320]   And I think that one of the reasons given that the legislature rushed on this is because
[01:51:23.320 --> 01:51:27.240]   it's much harder to change a ballot measure.
[01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:33.040]   With this state law, the legislature can weaken it whenever they want.
[01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:35.280]   It is a good law though, based on GDPR.
[01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:39.600]   It's a California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018.
[01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:43.840]   Companies that store large amounts of personal information, including Google and Facebook,
[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:48.360]   will be just like with GDPR required to disclose the type of data they collect and allow you
[01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:52.440]   to opt out of having their data sold.
[01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:58.760]   So unless they water it down at some point in the future, it's not going to happen immediately
[01:51:58.760 --> 01:51:59.960]   to give companies time.
[01:51:59.960 --> 01:52:02.160]   Just like GDPR, the companies will have a couple of years.
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:06.440]   It won't be fully in effect until January 1st, 2020.
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:08.640]   How closely does it attract GDPR?
[01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:11.880]   Some of the features of GDPR?
[01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:12.880]   It's similar.
[01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:16.520]   I haven't seen it point by point comparison.
[01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:19.160]   Because a lot of companies are already there because of their...
[01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:20.160]   Exactly.
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:21.160]   Exactly.
[01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:22.560]   They're not there fully.
[01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:27.080]   Companies like AT&T and Amazon, what a surprise.
[01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:29.880]   Poured millions of dollars into opposition marketing.
[01:52:29.880 --> 01:52:30.880]   Shocking.
[01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:32.080]   What a shock.
[01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:33.520]   What a shock.
[01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:38.240]   However, the legislature decided, well, at least if we pass it, we can change it.
[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:43.840]   If it wins in the polls in November, we're in deep due to.
[01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:46.360]   So watch with interest to see what's going on.
[01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:47.360]   So good news.
[01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:50.320]   And I suspect just like GDPR really changed everybody.
[01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:53.640]   If California has a bill like that, that means everybody operating in the US is going to
[01:52:53.640 --> 01:52:54.640]   have to adhere to this.
[01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:55.640]   So it's good to see.
[01:52:55.640 --> 01:52:56.640]   Yeah.
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:52:57.640]   It's going to make it much, much...
[01:52:57.640 --> 01:52:59.880]   Well, at the very least, what you'll see, because you have had a couple of instances
[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:06.600]   of various sites that are refusing to serve content in Europe because of GDPR.
[01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:07.840]   And fine.
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:10.040]   But they're not going to be able to not serve California.
[01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:11.040]   Yes.
[01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:12.040]   Precisely.
[01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:13.040]   Yeah.
[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:17.640]   Although I just saw a study that said a lot of companies are kind of...
[01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:21.520]   They're not really doing the opt-in stuff with GDPR because they're just going to wait
[01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:22.520]   and see.
[01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:23.960]   They're not...
[01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:27.880]   You're supposed to require people to agree if you're going to collect data about them.
[01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:30.280]   And then just going to wait and see.
[01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:31.280]   Let's see what happens.
[01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:34.600]   Let's see how aggressively this gets pursued by me.
[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:38.520]   It's like these companies aren't realizing that the people in Europe are litigious about
[01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:39.520]   things like this.
[01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:40.520]   Yes.
[01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:43.400]   And don't mind going through the courts.
[01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:49.080]   I mean, that seems like a bad wager or like I guess thing to take.
[01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:52.040]   I wouldn't make that bet myself.
[01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:55.160]   Let's take a break and then I'm going to put Christina on the spot.
[01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:56.160]   All right.
[01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:57.000]   Stay tuned.
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:58.000]   Okay.
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.160]   But I'm already thinking about dinner.
[01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:01.720]   In fact, it's almost dinner time.
[01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:03.280]   I know you guys...
[01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:05.360]   It's probably his dinner time.
[01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:08.120]   And if I were in Austin in Houston right now, I'd be doing barbecue.
[01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:11.360]   But because I'm here in California, I'm going to be cooking some blue apron.
[01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:12.360]   I love my bro.
[01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:14.120]   I have three blue aprons waiting.
[01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:15.440]   I might do a seared steak.
[01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:18.000]   There's a chicken with tahini that looks awfully good.
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.120]   We subscribe to Blue Apron.
[01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:22.720]   We get our blue apron box on Wednesday and it's really fun.
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:27.320]   Everything you need to make three different meals, you choose the meals at a time.
[01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:28.320]   You go to the Blue Apron site.
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:31.400]   They've got a menu with dozens of new recipes every week.
[01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:34.360]   You could choose based on your subscription to three or four recipes.
[01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:38.720]   Of course, you can always say not this week if you're going to be out of town or something.
[01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:40.120]   But we get three usually.
[01:54:40.120 --> 01:54:41.120]   And I love it.
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:42.120]   I'm working home.
[01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:44.840]   I've been working hard, slaving over a hot twit.
[01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:45.840]   And now I get home and everything.
[01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:46.840]   I get all the stuff I need.
[01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:48.840]   I don't have to do any shopping meal planning.
[01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:51.680]   I could put together an amazing meal.
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:53.640]   And by the way, they're doing grill meals now too.
[01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:55.680]   So I'll probably fire up the grill.
[01:54:55.680 --> 01:54:58.920]   Maybe I'll do the honey chipotle glaze chicken with poblano and lime rice.
[01:54:58.920 --> 01:54:59.920]   Doesn't that sound good?
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:02.120]   Oh, it's great on the grill.
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:04.600]   You can add that smoky depth to your dinner.
[01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:06.360]   Enjoy the beautiful weather.
[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:08.560]   Get those perfect grill marks.
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:11.320]   The great ingredients, you always get exactly what you need.
[01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:13.280]   No more, no less.
[01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:15.240]   So there's no waste.
[01:55:15.240 --> 01:55:17.280]   And it's fun to cook.
[01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:18.720]   And everything smells great.
[01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:20.840]   People get so excited.
[01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:24.120]   Here's a customer favorite sweet chili beef and vegetable stir fry.
[01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:27.760]   We do a lot of the blue eber and stir fryers because their vegetables are beautiful.
[01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:30.280]   I've never seen perfect, perfect.
[01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:32.880]   Chrissy Teigen, celebrity recipe.
[01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:38.360]   That's the chipotle lime chicken fajitas with sauteed mushrooms and sweet peppers.
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:43.120]   There's always vegetarian recipes too like barbecue vegetable flatbread with Swiss cheese.
[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:44.280]   I don't think we have that one.
[01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:47.000]   I think we have, I think we have all meat this week.
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:52.920]   I'm, I can't wait to get home and fire up the grill and make a delicious blue apron.
[01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:53.920]   Here's the deal.
[01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:54.920]   Check out this week's menu.
[01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:57.040]   Go to blueapron.com/twit.

[01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:08.200]   I'm loving my blue apron, the number one fresh ingredient recipe delivery service and the
[01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:09.200]   country.
[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:10.880]   And we are so happy.
[01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:12.640]   We are so happy.
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:20.280]   Blueapron.com/twit, your first three meals free and free shipping blueapron.com/twit.
[01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:24.080]   So I know you don't know anything about Project Andromeda.
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:25.080]   Watch your carefully.
[01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:26.080]   See if you're eyeshipped.
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:27.080]   No, I know nothing.
[01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:31.080]   I know nothing but it sounds cool and I'm happy to hear you guys talk about it.
[01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:32.080]   Definitely sounds cool.
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:33.680]   No, they don't tell you.
[01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:37.680]   This is actually, we've been talking about this a lot on Windows Weekly for some time.
[01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:39.560]   It's a mysterious surface device.
[01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:42.600]   Microsoft's been working on for at least two years.
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:49.280]   It has now appeared at patents in operating system references multiple times, dual display
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:56.000]   design, and the Verge, Tom Warren, who's really good on this stuff, got an internal document
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.520]   that said it's going to be pocketable and even more interesting.
[01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:03.080]   When you open it up, the screen, flexible screen will stretch over the hinge.
[01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:07.720]   So it will be the size of a phone, but the screen will be the size of a tablet.
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:09.720]   Ten inch screen maybe.
[01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:12.440]   Take my money.
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:13.960]   I know.
[01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:17.400]   Microsoft, of course, has nothing to say about it.
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:20.880]   It's being worked on secretly.
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:21.880]   You never know.
[01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:28.480]   Remember the Surface Mini, which was actually manufactured in warehouses when Satya Nadella
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:30.440]   said, "And the career?"
[01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:32.080]   Yeah, I think the career.
[01:57:32.080 --> 01:57:33.080]   Yeah, the career.
[01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:34.080]   That was a concept.
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:36.400]   Yeah, the career looks like the career a little bit, right?
[01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:37.960]   Except smaller.
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:39.920]   Yeah.
[01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:41.280]   How big was the career?
[01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:44.840]   I think the career was like a note tab.
[01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:48.880]   It was like two iPad rows next to each other.
[01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:51.000]   That even would be interesting.
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:52.000]   I don't remember.
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.600]   Was the career going to have one LCD screen and one e-ink screen?
[01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:55.600]   I can't remember.
[01:57:55.600 --> 01:57:56.600]   They were two LCDs.
[01:57:56.600 --> 01:57:57.600]   And you would drag stuff around.
[01:57:57.600 --> 01:57:58.600]   Yeah.
[01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:01.000]   And you could write on it and have the handwriting recognition.
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:05.000]   It had a lot of the pinch-to-zoom stuff that you saw on the iPad.
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:08.960]   Because if I remember incorrectly, the career was before the iPad.
[01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:12.360]   But yeah, it was an amazing conversation.
[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:13.360]   Just to know.
[01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:17.720]   I think you're just the age that probably about middle school you started using AOL Instant
[01:58:17.720 --> 01:58:18.720]   Messenger.
[01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:19.720]   Yes.
[01:58:19.720 --> 01:58:21.120]   I know it.
[01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:22.120]   You'll be glad to know.
[01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:23.120]   AIM is back.
[01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:26.200]   AOL shut down the service in December.
[01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:33.320]   But there's a new project called AIM Phoenix, which looks exactly like AIM.
[01:58:33.320 --> 01:58:36.760]   They didn't even update the UI because it's nostalgic, right?
[01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:37.760]   It's like software.
[01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:39.080]   It is the original software.
[01:58:39.080 --> 01:58:43.720]   Oh, so if you go and download it, what they've done is set up a server.
[01:58:43.720 --> 01:58:47.480]   And then you essentially repoint the client at their server.
[01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:49.360]   Oh, so it's like a new relay.
[01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:50.360]   That's smart.
[01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:51.360]   Right.
[01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:52.360]   If you go to--
[01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:53.360]   But there isn't a--
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:54.360]   Go ahead.
[01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:56.960]   They don't make a Mac version available at their site.
[01:58:56.960 --> 01:58:59.160]   You have to kind of go and find an old Mac version.
[01:58:59.160 --> 01:59:04.000]   But there are several Windows versions they have for download there in case you can't
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:05.000]   find one that works.
[01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:06.000]   That's so awesome.
[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:09.240]   You have to use a new username or can you use your old username?
[01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:10.240]   Like, how does that work?
[01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:11.400]   You have to start over.
[01:59:11.400 --> 01:59:13.160]   So I've already claimed these Silverman.
[01:59:13.160 --> 01:59:14.160]   Oh, you did.
[01:59:14.160 --> 01:59:15.160]   Nice.
[01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:16.160]   Nice.
[01:59:16.160 --> 01:59:17.160]   What was your username?
[01:59:17.160 --> 01:59:18.160]   Wait a minute.
[01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:20.080]   Go get it and then tell us what your username was.
[01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:24.320]   No, I mean, they want to take TV freak.
[01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:25.320]   They can.
[01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:26.320]   That's fine.
[01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:27.320]   TV freak.
[01:59:27.320 --> 01:59:28.560]   Your film girl now.
[01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:29.560]   You've grown up.
[01:59:29.560 --> 01:59:30.560]   You're all grown up.
[01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:31.560]   TV freak.
[01:59:31.560 --> 01:59:32.960]   It was TV freak with a pH.
[01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:33.960]   Oh.
[01:59:33.960 --> 01:59:34.960]   Yeah.
[01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:42.200]   My daughter, who's a little younger than you, was got a base, not a life.
[01:59:42.200 --> 01:59:47.280]   She played the base for five minutes, but she was cool, right?
[01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:48.280]   Yeah.
[01:59:48.280 --> 01:59:50.840]   Dwight, did you read the privacy statement?
[01:59:50.840 --> 01:59:51.840]   Uh-oh.
[01:59:51.840 --> 01:59:55.000]   You don't ruin it for me, Wesley.
[01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:56.280]   All right.
[01:59:56.280 --> 01:59:57.280]   Let's see.
[01:59:57.280 --> 01:59:59.280]   What does the privacy statement say?
[01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:01.280]   Well, I don't know.
[02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:03.880]   Oh, you read either.
[02:00:03.880 --> 02:00:07.040]   Oddly enough, there is no privacy statement.
[02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:12.520]   The web says through Dine DNS, so they're using Dine DNS to do it.
[02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:14.720]   It's clearly like a hack, you know.
[02:00:14.720 --> 02:00:15.720]   It's a just a.
[02:00:15.720 --> 02:00:16.720]   Oh, yeah, totally.
[02:00:16.720 --> 02:00:17.720]   Yeah.
[02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:18.720]   Yeah.
[02:00:18.720 --> 02:00:21.000]   Well, if you remember back in the day with AIM, so you used to have all these like AIM add-ons.
[02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:24.200]   Like there was AIM plus and there was like all these other things that you could have.
[02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:28.000]   Like they would add additional features so that you could, you know, like do certain
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:32.900]   offline things and have like different away messages and people would hack the actual
[02:00:32.900 --> 02:00:35.200]   AIM program to do stuff.
[02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:40.520]   And then AOL would patch the client to not make that stuff work.
[02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:42.440]   And it was a whole cat and mouse game.
[02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:43.440]   Yeah.
[02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:45.520]   That was kind of how Trillion started, I believe.
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:48.360]   I was a big fan of Dead Aim, which removed ads.
[02:00:48.360 --> 02:00:49.360]   Yes, yes, yes.
[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:50.360]   Dead Aim, yes, yes.
[02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:53.800]   Dead Aim was, do I do a teenage girl in the 90s?
[02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:55.560]   I don't, I still am.
[02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:56.560]   Okay.
[02:00:56.560 --> 02:00:57.560]   Love it.
[02:00:57.560 --> 02:00:58.560]   Love it.
[02:00:58.560 --> 02:00:59.560]   Do I have to go ahead?
[02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:00.560]   Just checking.
[02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:03.360]   No, Dead Aim was, no, because it was so much better because you could use certain stuff
[02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:05.520]   like keep logs and like it just, it was better.
[02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:06.520]   It was good.
[02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:10.840]   We actually used, we actually used Dead Aim at the, I mean, not Dead Aim, we used AIM at
[02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:13.320]   the Chronicle to communicate with each other.
[02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:14.320]   Right.
[02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:15.960]   When, um, that makes sense.
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:21.440]   The early, uh, these paper computer systems, which were, uh, you know, client server computer
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:26.280]   systems, had built in messaging and we used it a lot when we went to PC systems, they
[02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:27.280]   didn't have that.
[02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:30.440]   And so we started using AIM to communicate with each other.
[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:36.680]   And we did, I had AIM on my computer until last year, really, when they killed it.
[02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:39.240]   You know, I had, I had, um, I had AIDEM forever.
[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:40.240]   Oh, yeah.
[02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:41.240]   I loved AIDEM, yeah.
[02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:42.240]   Yeah.
[02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:44.520]   You know, and, and had, you know, that was so great because you could have like, you know,
[02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:48.880]   your Google Messenger and your aim and, you know, at the time, like Apple used AIMs back
[02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:54.720]   in for a, or Jabber, whatever for a, for, uh, for a mobile me messages or whatever.
[02:01:54.720 --> 02:01:58.360]   So if you had like a, the dot Mac accounts or whatever, um, you know, you could do that
[02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:02.320]   for, for that chat, but, uh, yeah.
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:03.320]   And that's Trillion.
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:05.320]   Trillion, Trillion was good.
[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:06.320]   Trillion.
[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:07.320]   Yeah.
[02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:12.720]   Pigeon, you know, in, in Mojave, there is still a setting where you can add an AOL account.
[02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:14.280]   They have not removed that.
[02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:15.280]   So that would work with this.
[02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:18.680]   You could, uh, you could, cause you just have to set, set up the proxy.
[02:02:18.680 --> 02:02:19.680]   Yeah.
[02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:20.680]   I have to try that.
[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:22.680]   It'd be kind of fun.
[02:02:22.680 --> 02:02:24.520]   Uh, a sad note.
[02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:26.680]   We like to end the show on a sad note.
[02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:33.920]   Uh, yesterday, the end of stumble upon another nostalgic trip down memory lane.
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:37.240]   You young people don't remember, but back in the old days.
[02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:38.240]   Yeah.
[02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:42.760]   We used to get a lot of, Nashville used to get a lot of traffic from stumble upon actually.
[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:43.760]   That must have been a space.
[02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:47.640]   There was a time when, when they, when people wouldn't, it actually would.
[02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:49.480]   We had like, some old buttons on our website.
[02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:54.480]   So, uh, but actually, but before anybody feels too bad, Garrett Camp, who, uh, found a
[02:02:54.480 --> 02:02:58.640]   stumble upon, sold it, bought it back, uh, also co-founded Uber.
[02:02:58.640 --> 02:02:59.640]   So he's fine.
[02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:01.760]   Oh, not bad.
[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:02.760]   Not bad.
[02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:03.760]   Yeah.
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:08.000]   The stumble button, you'd press it and get a random website every time.
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:11.360]   Stumble upon FARC and, uh, slash dot.
[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:13.360]   That was a three big traffic drivers.
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:15.760]   We're back to FARC still around slash dot.
[02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:16.760]   FARC is still around.
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:17.760]   Yep.
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:18.760]   Yeah.
[02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:20.880]   In fact, Drew ran for governor last year, lost.
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:21.880]   Thank goodness.
[02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:26.520]   But you want to be the governor of Kentucky.
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:30.760]   Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes this edition of this week in tech, Wesley Faulkner.
[02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:32.760]   Congratulations on the new job.
[02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:34.520]   Congratulations on the move.
[02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:35.520]   Thank you.
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:36.520]   Very exciting for you.
[02:03:36.520 --> 02:03:40.000]   You'll be working on developer relations at IBM.
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:44.200]   If you're a developer, what developer of what, like what kind of stuff?
[02:03:44.200 --> 02:03:45.200]   So IBM systems.
[02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:51.680]   So if you are in charge of a infrastructure for your company, uh, that is looking to be
[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:58.720]   on the forefront of cutting edge technology that includes quantum computing, that includes
[02:03:58.720 --> 02:04:00.720]   a machine learning, all that stuff.
[02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:02.280]   Uh, that's what I'll be.
[02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:03.280]   Nice.
[02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:04.280]   Oh, that's exciting.
[02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:05.280]   Isn't that exciting?
[02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:06.960]   Congratulations on the new job.
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:07.960]   That's really great.
[02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:08.960]   Thank you.
[02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:11.200]   That's a great night before.
[02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:12.200]   Good luck.
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:13.560]   Yeah, I won't be sleeping tonight.
[02:04:13.560 --> 02:04:14.560]   Nope.
[02:04:14.560 --> 02:04:16.880]   First, like the first day of school.
[02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:17.880]   Yeah.
[02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:21.560]   I haven't had a new job in decades.
[02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:24.320]   And I hope to God I never have one.
[02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:26.320]   That would be bad.
[02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:28.560]   Chris, for an eight years.
[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:29.560]   Really?
[02:04:29.560 --> 02:04:30.560]   It's been eight years.
[02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:31.560]   You're a FSC for years?
[02:04:31.560 --> 02:04:34.720]   No, I'm saying for you for me to get your money back.
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:38.800]   Uh, my, to get the money back for the move to the new studio.
[02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:39.800]   Oh, eight years.
[02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:43.560]   Yeah, I guess the new studio is kind of like a new job, new studio.
[02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:44.560]   Yeah.
[02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:45.560]   I can't retire.
[02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:46.560]   It's not to get my money back.
[02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:49.040]   We just have a lease for eight years, so I can't leave.
[02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:52.880]   I have to pay rent on this studio.
[02:04:52.880 --> 02:04:55.920]   And I might be, I'll just move in here.
[02:04:55.920 --> 02:04:56.920]   Just live here.
[02:04:56.920 --> 02:04:57.920]   Yeah.
[02:04:57.920 --> 02:05:00.120]   Christina Warren, it's great to have you.
[02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:02.520]   She's film girl on the Twitter film underscore girl.
[02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:04.880]   That's better than what is it?
[02:05:04.880 --> 02:05:05.880]   TV free.
[02:05:05.880 --> 02:05:06.880]   TV free for the pH.
[02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:07.880]   Yeah.
[02:05:07.880 --> 02:05:10.720]   What TV show was your big go-to show?
[02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:13.040]   Was it Gossip Girl or is that two of us?
[02:05:13.040 --> 02:05:15.200]   That was later, although I was very into Gossip Girl.
[02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:18.600]   Meryl's Place, Dawson's Creek were both big ones for me.
[02:05:18.600 --> 02:05:20.240]   90210 or is that too old?
[02:05:20.240 --> 02:05:21.240]   90210, I love 90210.
[02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:23.800]   Yeah, but Meryl's Place, I liked better than 90210.
[02:05:23.800 --> 02:05:27.280]   But that was the spinoff with Heather Locklear.
[02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:29.880]   And it was, I was, I was a little young for it.
[02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:32.800]   I'll be honest, but it was my favorite show.
[02:05:32.800 --> 02:05:37.840]   And in fact, if you find somewhere on like the all.tv.meryl's Place, like news group
[02:05:37.840 --> 02:05:43.360]   groups, there's some sort of message from like a nine year old me, which was my first
[02:05:43.360 --> 02:05:44.360]   time like on the internet.
[02:05:44.360 --> 02:05:47.200]   I found it like 10 years ago or something.
[02:05:47.200 --> 02:05:49.480]   And it was kind of horrifying.
[02:05:49.480 --> 02:05:51.000]   Where Heather Locklear was in trouble.
[02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:52.000]   Oh, yeah.
[02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:53.000]   No, I know.
[02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:54.000]   I saw that's really sad.
[02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:55.000]   That's too bad.
[02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:56.000]   Yeah.
[02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:57.760]   It happens, you know?
[02:05:57.760 --> 02:05:58.760]   Yeah.
[02:05:58.760 --> 02:06:03.040]   I know I went through a period, you know, being a child star and all.
[02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:07.040]   Dwight Silverman, he is with the Houston Cro- he's in the out.
[02:06:07.040 --> 02:06:08.040]   There we go.
[02:06:08.040 --> 02:06:09.040]   That's what I want.
[02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:10.040]   Very refreshing.
[02:06:10.040 --> 02:06:11.040]   That's what I want.
[02:06:11.040 --> 02:06:12.040]   He's right there.
[02:06:12.040 --> 02:06:15.600]   He works the Houston Chronicle branch office in Zermatt.
[02:06:15.600 --> 02:06:23.000]   He is also in charge of the tech burger and he's working on the fuel fix or whatever
[02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:24.000]   it's called.
[02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:25.000]   Yeah.
[02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:26.000]   It's great to have you.
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:27.200]   So, so nice to see you.
[02:06:27.200 --> 02:06:29.360]   Anything else you want to plug?
[02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:33.240]   No, no, I think that you've, you hit all the high points, Leo.
[02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:34.840]   I just love doing the show.
[02:06:34.840 --> 02:06:35.840]   Thank you.
[02:06:35.840 --> 02:06:37.240]   I've done it with Christina before.
[02:06:37.240 --> 02:06:38.240]   She's great.
[02:06:38.240 --> 02:06:41.640]   And Wesley, the next time I'm in Austin, can I look yet?
[02:06:41.640 --> 02:06:42.640]   Oh, absolutely.
[02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:43.640]   Yeah.
[02:06:43.640 --> 02:06:44.640]   I'm happy.
[02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:45.640]   Great.
[02:06:45.640 --> 02:06:46.640]   Let's go.
[02:06:46.640 --> 02:06:48.040]   You can go visit him and talk to Watson and they're going to Watson in the closet.
[02:06:48.040 --> 02:06:49.640]   It's really cool.
[02:06:49.640 --> 02:06:51.440]   Can we, can we go to Scholz Garden?
[02:06:51.440 --> 02:06:52.440]   Oh, yeah.
[02:06:52.440 --> 02:06:53.440]   Oh, now we're starting.
[02:06:53.440 --> 02:06:54.440]   Right off.
[02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:56.640]   You're off in a little K. Yeah, let's do it.
[02:06:56.640 --> 02:06:57.640]   Yeah.
[02:06:57.640 --> 02:06:59.680]   I think we should have a party at the next South's pie.
[02:06:59.680 --> 02:07:01.240]   We all get together and do a show.
[02:07:01.240 --> 02:07:02.240]   Yeah.
[02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:03.240]   That sounds good.
[02:07:03.240 --> 02:07:04.240]   Yeah.
[02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:05.240]   Doesn't that sound like fun?
[02:07:05.240 --> 02:07:07.280]   It's just a spring.
[02:07:07.280 --> 02:07:10.800]   This weekend tech comes to you every Sunday afternoon, about 3 p.m.
[02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:12.200]   Pacific, 6 p.m.
[02:07:12.200 --> 02:07:14.000]   Eastern Time, 2200 UTC.
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.400]   If you want to watch, there's a few ways you can do it.
[02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:17.400]   You can always join us in the studio.
[02:07:17.400 --> 02:07:19.160]   A wonderful studio audience.
[02:07:19.160 --> 02:07:23.400]   Well, there were really only four fans in the studio, but they brought their families.
[02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:24.400]   Awesome.
[02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:25.400]   Yeah.
[02:07:25.400 --> 02:07:27.360]   So, and you know what?
[02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:32.840]   They were a very, a very patient group from Plano, Texas.
[02:07:32.840 --> 02:07:34.360]   We had the wind family.
[02:07:34.360 --> 02:07:35.360]   Nice to have you.
[02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:36.600]   Thank you for coming.
[02:07:36.600 --> 02:07:39.360]   How did the, did you enjoy it?
[02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:40.360]   Yeah.
[02:07:40.360 --> 02:07:45.880]   Uh, dad did, uh, from, from Fort Lauderdale.
[02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:47.880]   We had the Walker family, the teenage girls.
[02:07:47.880 --> 02:07:49.440]   Did you, did you have a great fun?
[02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:51.440]   Yeah, they're just pretending.
[02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:53.160]   Yeah, they're just pretending.
[02:07:53.160 --> 02:07:55.160]   Brian Beverly from Venetian.
[02:07:55.160 --> 02:07:57.280]   It's check under your seats.
[02:07:57.280 --> 02:07:59.880]   Everybody will find a copy of AIM.
[02:07:59.880 --> 02:08:00.880]   Whoa.
[02:08:00.880 --> 02:08:05.160]   An AOL disc for you and for you and for you and you get an AOL disc.
[02:08:05.160 --> 02:08:07.520]   Can you get an AOL disc?
[02:08:07.520 --> 02:08:09.320]   Uh, she'd do that.
[02:08:09.320 --> 02:08:10.320]   You should do that, Leo.
[02:08:10.320 --> 02:08:11.320]   That would be actually really good for that.
[02:08:11.320 --> 02:08:13.040]   I could probably do that.
[02:08:13.040 --> 02:08:15.360]   I bet I have a few.
[02:08:15.360 --> 02:08:17.600]   Next time, let's do that.
[02:08:17.600 --> 02:08:21.040]   If you want to be here, maybe even get an AOL disc, all you have to do is email tickets
[02:08:21.040 --> 02:08:22.040]   at quit.tv.
[02:08:22.040 --> 02:08:24.320]   There's no charge for the tickets, but we do want to know that you're going to be here
[02:08:24.320 --> 02:08:26.360]   so we could put a seat out for you.
[02:08:26.360 --> 02:08:27.360]   Thank you for coming.
[02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:28.360]   It's great to have you.

[02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:44.320]   but that's okay.
