[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.600]   It's time for Twit this weekend tech and joining us in studio to talk about this week's tech news.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.600]   Mr. Jim, louder back, the CEO of Revision3.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.600]   It's great to see you again, Jimmy.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.600]   My friend.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.600]   Nice to be here too.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.600]   We were reminiscing before the show. We go way back to '94.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.600]   I think it's '92 or '92.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.600]   I think '92.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.600]   People say, "I've been working with Leo for 17 years off and on."
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.600]   She's the wheeze.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.600]   It's a long time.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.600]   You were MPC Lab, magazine labs.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.600]   PC week labs.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.600]   PC week labs, that's right.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.600]   And Ziffdavis hired me for "Wretch that I Am" to do a show called the Personal Computing Show,
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.600]   which we worked on together with Gina Smith,
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.600]   who is on assignment at CES, but she won't tell anybody where.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.600]   Whoa.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.600]   So she's back in the game.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.600]   Cool.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.600]   Good for you.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.600]   Let's say hello also to Natalie Morris, newly named, newly coined.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.600]   You may remember her as Natalie Del Conte.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.600]   Hey, Natalie!
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.600]   The artist formerly known as Del Conte.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.600]   Yes, that's true.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.600]   It's Morris now.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   So it's now official.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.600]   You know, we know you had a baby.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.600]   What's your baby's name?
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.600]   His name's Miles.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.600]   That's right.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.600]   Miles.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.600]   And Miles Dad, Clayton Morris of Fox and Friends.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.600]   Yes.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.600]   And you happens to be your husband or did you just take his name?
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.600]   No, I didn't just take the name.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.600]   That would be kind of presumptuous, I suppose.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.600]   We did in fact get married.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.600]   Congratulations.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.600]   So I think since I saw you last you got married.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.600]   So it's not Del Conte anymore.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.600]   That's great.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.600]   I still own the Twitter handle.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.600]   But don't tweet from there anymore.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.600]   So is your Twitter handle now Natalie Morris?
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.400]   That's the great thing about Twitter is you can just change your username whenever you want
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.400]   to and not lose your followers.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.680]   It was really great of them to have the foresight to design that into their system.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.680]   I think.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.400]   I wonder if it was foresight or just yeah.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.400]   Whoops, we forgot that part.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.400]   Well, anyway, I think we could give them the credit.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.080]   So if you want to change your name anytime soon, you're free to keep your followers.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.880]   I have changed the capitalization.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.280]   That's all I've ever changed.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.400]   I choose the inner cap on my name.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.400]   Interesting.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.400]   How long did you do that?
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.560]   I go back and forth.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.560]   You know what's bad though is you lose your little check mark, your verified check mark
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.800]   if you do stuff like that.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.240]   So you don't want to do that too much.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.480]   Then they come back later and they do it.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:59.320]   Natalie works for CBS of course and you still do Buzz out loud once in a while.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.680]   Sometimes not quite as often.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.680]   You're in New York now.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.560]   I do a lot more than I do Buzz out loud.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.200]   So but my daily shows is loaded which you can find at cnop.com/loaded.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.200]   Loaded.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.040]   She's loaded.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.600]   So here with us it's great to have him.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.720]   I'm going to work very hard to pronounce his name.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.520]   Well I know his name Marshall Kirkpatrick.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.840]   Well see now I screwed that up.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.520]   Marshall Kirkpatrick.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.600]   Hey Leo.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:35.800]   But the company he works for is readwrightweb.com.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.200]   Hey I got it.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.200]   That's awesome.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.200]   Thanks.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.600]   Feel free to wear it out.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.600]   We'd white web.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.600]   Oh no.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.520]   A great site actually if you are following what's going on on the internet.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.520]   Thank you.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.520]   Yeah.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.480]   And Marshall does the news portion of readwrightweb.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.480]   It's true.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.400]   I'm I've got the same Twitter name I always have.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:04.480]   I just checked and @Mr. Neckbeard is already taken so I won't be switching that and keeping
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.480]   my followers.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:11.040]   So what do we think the big story I you know I'm not even going to presume what do we think
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.320]   the big story of the week was this week.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.520]   I know what a big story for me was Yahoo saying we're going to get rid of delicious.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.120]   Actually Yahoo didn't say it.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:29.320]   They had it on a slide at a Yahoo all hands meeting a slide that leaked out of Yahoo.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.760]   And then the people that delicious said no no no we're not going to kill it.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.760]   We just want to sell it to somebody who won't kill it.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.240]   It's just painting for the fjords.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.200]   It's it's not dead yet.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.200]   I'm dead yet.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.080]   I don't know.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.440]   I actually probably use delicious more than most.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.640]   I don't think bookmark services are particularly vital.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.600]   I use it a lot.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.600]   Do you?
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.600]   I do too.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.600]   Oh, okay.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.280]   Maybe it's those of us who cover text stories use it.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:01.720]   Yeah, I love it for recipes and travel when I want to remember hotels or things like that
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.720]   abroad.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.200]   I'll bookmark on delicious and I feel like it just hasn't gone that far because it's
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.360]   still too hard to do it really relied on the plugin ecosystem which most people don't
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.360]   do.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.400]   And I think Yahoo could have made that really consumer friendly for some reason.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.400]   They just didn't.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.280]   It's just like one of those things where you know a company buys another company that's
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.040]   cool and does absolutely zero with it.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.040]   It's frustrating.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.040]   They never improved.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.040]   They just let it.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.480]   The only thing they did as far as I could tell is change d e l dot icio dot us to delicious
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.480]   dot com which in and of itself is valuable.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.880]   But a lot easier to remember than delicious.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.280]   Well, the trouble and they added universal login from Yahoo.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.280]   Right.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.280]   Which broke it which broke a lot of third party.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.280]   They started you using a lot.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.160]   The trouble with all of it is that Yahoo never really figured out who they were and they
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.160]   bought all these companies.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.240]   Do you think that they're this is really the beginning and they laid off what four percent
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.880]   of their workforce which isn't that many but what I thought was interesting is that four
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.320]   percent of their workforce was what about 400 people.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.320]   I had no idea that they had that few people working there.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.320]   Yahoo.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.480]   And you think four percent of the workforce is going to be thousands.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.880]   How many Google's got what 40 or 50,000 employees.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.360]   Yahoo is not that big.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.600]   They got to be done like what they have a lot of properties and many of these properties
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.680]   like our buzz Yahoo buzz which I thought was was a huge success.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.320]   In fact, I remember very well that one of the one of the things people would say is well,
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.320]   you think dig is big.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.760]   You should see how big buzz is.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.640]   I mean many, many more users but mostly because of you know my Yahoo, you know the homepage
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.640]   and so forth.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.880]   That's going to be phased out.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:40.240]   What is what and it's really feels like Yahoo's just it's shut off the lights and go to bed.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.400]   Is that your take on it Marshall?
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.760]   Oh, I don't know that that's the case.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:52.400]   I mean my personal interest in it wanes every time a more developer focused, you know, really
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.360]   innovative little startup project gets shut down.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:01.440]   But it is it remains one of the most popular domains on the web.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.400]   It's big an email.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.000]   I think that they're going to be doing okay.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.800]   Although we used to say the same thing about my space.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.160]   You know, not so long ago they still have a lot of traffic.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:18.480]   But I'd I expect it to be a slow demise if it turns out to be a demise and maybe they'll
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.640]   just turn out to be the media media and advertising company that they've wanted to be for some
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.640]   time.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:29.640]   So my blog log going to be phased out Yahoo bookmarks Yahoo picks merge instead of phased
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.080]   out upcoming, which I really liked as a invite site.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:38.920]   I use upcoming all the time fire Eagle, which was their location aggregation site.
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.560]   Then they said, well, we're not going to kill delicious.
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.760]   We're going to we're going to sell it.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.280]   And by the way, Kevin Rose just tweeted that he wants to buy it.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.200]   I think he'd be a good person to buy it.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.200]   He's friends with Joshua.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.200]   Yeah, he probably could bring Joshua Shachter back.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.200]   He definitely bring him back.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.720]   A guy who started it or tried to.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:58.120]   You know the problem with Yahoo overall though Leo and back in 2005, they offered me a job
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.000]   to come in and start Yahoo tech.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Oh, really?
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.520]   But yeah, but one of the things that I thought so I was talking about as a video thing, you
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.920]   mean, or just Yahoo tech.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.640]   This is like Yahoo finance.
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.360]   Yeah, so Yahoo tech.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.960]   This is when we were both at PC mag.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.640]   We were both at PC mag because the guy.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.240]   My boss, I think people don't know that.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.240]   I didn't know that.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.400]   Jimmy used to be my boss when I was a writer at PC mag.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.560]   He used to be my boss too.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.040]   Did he used to be your boss Marshall?
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.320]   Of course, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:32.320]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:38.320]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:43.320]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.320]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:53.320]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:10:00.320]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:06.320]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:11.320]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:15.320]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:20.320]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.320]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:32.320]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:37.320]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.320]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:46.320]   some of the geolocation stuff, Yahoo pipes, Yahoo query language,
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:51.320]   things like that are really in the interface libraries,
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.320]   some of the developer focused stuff that they're doing at Yahoo is real
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:11:00.320]   original and very widely appreciated, if not a big driver of revenue.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:05.320]   You know, one of the things people said anonymously about Yahoo is that it was
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.320]   a very meeting driven culture, that you really didn't spend much time on your
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.320]   product, you spent most of your time in meetings defending your product.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.320]   Yeah, and trying to get other people to do it, like if you wanted a design done for
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.320]   your product, you couldn't have a designer on staff, you had to go to the
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.320]   central design room and get on somebody's schedule to get them to give you the time
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.320]   to, and the same thing went with everything.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:30.320]   Something Google, you know, Google seems to be starting to suffer the same kind of
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:36.320]   arterial sclerosis that happens to these big companies, but in order to avoid that,
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.320]   they do have at least these kind of units that work autonomously.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:46.320]   And I think the idea is to keep a startup mentality in these groups,
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:51.320]   and there's a problem with that too, because you see Google products launch
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.320]   like last week, four products launch all at the same time, because there's no
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.320]   coordination, they're all kind of on their own when they're done, they launch.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.320]   It's difficult, you look at Microsoft, I think that's part of the problem at
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.320]   Microsoft was there are a lot of individual fiefdoms, all of which competing with
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.320]   one another, and it was got pretty vicious in there.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:13.320]   So it's very difficult to get in tech, at least, a company to grow, become big and
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.320]   keep that nimbleness, that spirit of entrepreneurship.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.320]   It's hard to do.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:22.320]   But I will say that at least the PR people at Google know what's launching when
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.320]   it's going to launch.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.320]   So someone is keeping track of everything.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:29.320]   Whereas at Yahoo, if you wanted to say, "Hey, what are you going to do this?
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.320]   Or when are you going to do that?"
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.320]   They had like four different PR agencies working for them.
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:38.320]   They never knew who represented, say Flickr versus who represented Yahoo maps.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.320]   You could never find someone that you wanted to talk to.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.320]   So it was sort of interesting.
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.320]   It showed that no one knew what the whole company was doing.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:50.320]   It was the right foot, never, or what's the same, right hand, never knew what the
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.320]   left hand was doing.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.320]   Let alone the feet.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.320]   Right.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.320]   Yeah, well, it's true, Google, they do know what's going on, but they don't have
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.320]   any control of it.
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.320]   So last week they announced what?
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:07.320]   They announced Google Books, the CR48, the Nexus S, and I mean all at the same time,
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.320]   which you would normally, if you were Apple, see maybe Apple's an example of a
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.320]   company that has very tight control of this.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.320]   Although think about the way Apple built the Mac, right?
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:19.320]   Steve Jobs took the guys who built the original Mac and put them in a separate
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:23.320]   building off campus, put up a piracy flag, said, "We're not part of the
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.320]   company."
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.320]   And it worked.
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.320]   It did work.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.320]   It did work.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:31.320]   Apple succeeds at avoiding this because it's just one guy.
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.320]   Everybody works for one guy and he says what goes?
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.320]   And boy, you don't launch a product unless Steve Jobs says it goes, right?
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.320]   Well, he also has the product vision to enable successful things to launch.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.320]   Does have that.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.320]   I mean, you know, you can say whatever you want about Karl Bartz.
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:49.320]   She was really good at Autodesk, but she doesn't seem to have the product vision
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.320]   for what they need at Yahoo.
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:55.320]   I love this and, Marshall, you wrote about this in Read, Write, web Yahoo.
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:01.320]   Blamed the press for the whole delicious debacle.
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.320]   You know, you shouldn't have published that story.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.320]   It's your fault.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.320]   And now delicious is dead.
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.320]   That was unfortunate for sure.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.320]   We're for the media.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.320]   We'll see.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.320]   Hopefully the tools will remain available and people will keep using them,
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:26.320]   but I'm sure, you know, every, every one of those missteps led more people away
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.320]   from, from contributing content to, to delicious.
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:34.320]   You point out that I think this is a good model that when that Google gave the wave code to
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.320]   the Apache Foundation, they open sourced it.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.320]   Maybe that's what you do with delicious.
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.320]   Possibly though there was, there was an article that just hit tech meme a few minutes ago
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:48.320]   from a former delicious engineer who said that that really wasn't viable
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:57.320]   because there was enough proprietary Yahoo code in there that that's going to be a lot easier said than done.
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:02.320]   And one of the other things that we have pointed out and that other people have pointed out is the fact that apparently
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:07.320]   Yahoo has fired most of the people who knew how to run the machines there.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.320]   And so what are they selling?
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.320]   Now that's a tough thing to sell too.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.320]   And it's such a, it's such a crying shame.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:22.320]   You know, Gabriel Vera from TechMim called Delicious, an uber seminal app for all of Web 2.0.
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:26.320]   And, and I, it wasn't just a bookmarking service.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:34.320]   It was a really potent tool and a symbol and one of the coolest things that came out in that early era of Web 2.0.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.320]   And it's, it's just tragic to see what's happened to it.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.320]   I'm using a pin board now.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.320]   In fact, we're going to interview the guy who created pin board on net at night on Tuesday.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.320]   And he uses the delicious API.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.320]   So there is, you know, there is a delicious API that's public.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:54.320]   And as a result, pin board, which is very simple, very clean, very, you know, kind of fundamental and basic,
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:16:01.320]   to me feels like delicious would have been had they allowed it to improve and get better and so forth.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:10.320]   Well, Leo, are you able to in pin boards see the, see other people's bookmarks and see not the most popular
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.320]   URL categorized with certain keywords?
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.320]   Yes.
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.320]   Can it delicious?
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.320]   Yes.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.320]   There's public and private posts.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:22.320]   If you go to the pin board.i, it's pin board.in.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.320]   Go to the front page.
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.320]   They have popular.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.320]   Now the popular is not as good as delicious because there's not as many people using it.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:31.320]   The other thing they did, which I thought was kind of interesting, I think it's just one guy.
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.320]   Is he charges?
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:37.320]   It's not free, but he charges .001 cents per user.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:44.320]   So if your user 10,000, you pay a buck or whatever it is and the more users, the more you pay.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.320]   So I paid $7.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.320]   So there's more.
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.320]   It's incentive to get in early.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.320]   It does import from a delicious.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.320]   But there's some features that I liked and delicious.
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:17:00.320]   You know, I loved it that with delicious, you could use four colon and tag something and put it in somebody's inbox.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.320]   I don't see that inbox feature here.
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:08.320]   There's also Dgo, D-I-I-G-O, which actually has a lot more features.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.320]   It seems like a lot more elaborate.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.320]   I use Evernote.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.320]   Really for your book marking.
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.320]   And I used to use furl.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.320]   If you remember that, I was like furl.
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:23.320]   Furl is much better and when they shut that down, then I migrated over to delicious and now I have to go to Evernote.
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:32.320]   I feel like I'm being chased all over the web and I feel like it's because no one will do this in a way that's simple enough for the general consumer to get on board with.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.320]   I think that's part of the problem.
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.320]   I think that's part of the problem is that nobody even understands why you would do it.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:41.320]   There's no, nobody's been able to make this kind of a clear, you disagree, Marshall?
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.320]   I do. Yeah.
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:56.320]   I think back to conversations I've had with a lot of non-technical family members where I told them you can bookmark things on the Internet so that you can access your bookmarks for many computer and their eyes light up.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:09.320]   And that simplest value proposition I think is compelling and it's just a matter of letting people know that it's out there and then making it a friendly enough place to be once they first arrive.
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:13.320]   Well, here's a, I have a friend who planned her whole wedding by bookmarking on her computer.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.320]   I was like, what if your computer crashes?
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.320]   You won't know where to get to your dress, your cake, like all of that stuff.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.320]   And she's like, no, it's fine.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.320]   It'll be fine.
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.320]   Here's Never Crash.
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:22.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:27.320]   Well, you know, maybe what we're saying here and you brought it up with Pinboard is you have to pay for Pinboard.
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.320]   Maybe what we're seeing here.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.320]   I don't mind that, but exactly.
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.320]   Maybe we're seeing the end of the free web.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.320]   This is a great service.
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.320]   We all love it.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.320]   I've never paid a dime for Delicious.
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.320]   Natalie, did you ever pay a dime for Delicious?
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.320]   No.
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.320]   And there was really no way for Delicious to make money.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.320]   How do you monetize?
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.320]   There's no ads.
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.320]   If it's a good enough service, you should pay for it.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.320]   That's right.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.320]   And maybe what Kevin is doing is right.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.320]   He likes it enough that he wants to buy the company.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.320]   It's like Victor Kaim.
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.320]   Buying the razor, the Remington.
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:57.320]   Kevin is always been, you know, he's friends with Joshua Shactor who wrote Delicious.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.320]   He's always been kind of a fan.
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:05.320]   Dig in some ways has some similar, it actually is kind of complimentary to dig.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.320]   So maybe that's the way to do it.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.320]   I don't know.
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:14.320]   Well, Delicious has at times at least influenced Yahoo's search results.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.320]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.320]   And so there was some monetization going on there.
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.320]   It was definitely providing value to the company.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.320]   That's interesting.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.320]   Okay.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.320]   But obviously not enough value.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.320]   Yep.
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.320]   They let everyone go.
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.320]   Well, when you start bleeding, is Yahoo bleeding?
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.320]   Well, they're not doing search anymore either.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.960]   Well, you know what, to make another Monty Python reference, Yahoo reminds me of the night
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.320]   with his arms and his legs cut off saying, I'll bite your head off.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.320]   Come back here.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:43.320]   So really is, I mean, it's hard to imagine Yahoo not being around.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:48.320]   But they obviously made a huge mistake when they turned down a $31 billion, whatever it
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.320]   was, bid.
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.320]   What was it?
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.320]   Was it 31?
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.320]   Some huge amounts of microsoft.
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.320]   And they said, that's not enough.
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.320]   Whoops.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.320]   They got to be thinking.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.320]   Well, and then taking that.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:04.320]   You know, look at them merging with AOL, which is not going to happen, right?
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.320]   That was the next step.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.320]   Right.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.320]   They were going to AOL.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.320]   The rumors were there that they were dancing together.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.320]   Yeah.
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.320]   But it's hard to dance with somebody with no arms and no legs.
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.320]   Well, AOL's not exactly hopping around either.
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.320]   Yeah, at least they have a.
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.320]   They have a plan.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.320]   They have a plan.
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:23.320]   No, but they're putting a lot of money, like I said, into content, into various channels.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.320]   Like this is the fashion channel.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:29.600]   And this is, you know, and I really like Lindsey Campbell's new show, The Daily or something
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.600]   like that.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.120]   Like I've been actually going back to AOL to read and watch some of this stuff because
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.440]   I think they're doing a good job at that.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.440]   So it's a new identity.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.480]   But how's that working out for them when you look at the revenue side and yeah, they're
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.960]   in the middle of a turnaround, but they haven't been able to move the needle with all the
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:51.160]   content, whether it's on seed or local or anything else, it still hasn't caused them
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.800]   because their revenue is still declining.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.040]   That's a problem.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.200]   We are talking with Natalie Del Morris.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.640]   I do that all the time.
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.000]   I get it one of these days.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.800]   Natalie Morris, Marshall Kirkpatrick and Jim Lauterback, you're watching a tweet coming
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:06.800]   up.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.560]   Are your smartphone apps spying on you?
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.600]   Apparently they are.
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.640]   Before we do that, I would like to mention our friends at squarespace.com.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.040]   Natalie site is on Squarespace.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.040]   It is.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.040]   You like it?
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.040]   I do.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.040]   You can tell the truth.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.040]   I have a few actually.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.840]   I have a mommy blog as well on Squarespace.
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.840]   What's that?
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.840]   Mommybeta.com.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.640]   How neat.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   So why did you choose Squarespace besides the fact they probably gave you a free site?
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.080]   No, they didn't actually.
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.080]   And they noticed that I was using it and they're like, hey, we would have just, you
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.360]   know, paid for this.
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.600]   But I didn't want any kind of...
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.040]   No, I think it's appropriate.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:48.400]   And because, you know, I blog with three other girlfriends there, there's four of us who
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:53.200]   just became moms this year and all sort of chronicled our lives together on mommybeta.com.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:57.920]   And I wanted it to be easy for them because I felt like some of the other blogging solutions
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:01.360]   out there were little two, you know, they're not tech reporters.
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:05.480]   They're PR really smart girls, but I just wanted something that was easy.
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.720]   What a great picture.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.880]   It's Alex's picture when she was pregnant.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.880]   That's fantastic.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:10.880]   I love that.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:11.880]   Isn't that cute?
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.880]   Yeah, that's really neat.
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.880]   Yeah.
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.640]   Clayton bought that was me at first and he's like, "Who's that guy?"
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.640]   I'm taking pictures.
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:20.400]   Why is he holding your stomach?
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.000]   And where is his shirt?
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.320]   So here's the neat thing about...
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:29.200]   One of the things I really like about Squarespace is you can't look at this site and say it's
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.600]   a Squarespace blog.
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.240]   It's a website and it's unique and it looks...
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.120]   You know, the design is unique.
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.840]   And that's the thing I like about so much about Squarespace.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.080]   Squarespace, you start with...
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:44.280]   In fact, go right now, squarespace.com/twit.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:48.880]   And you can take a look at a whole bunch of information about how it works and what
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.280]   the templates are and so forth.
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.280]   Squarespace.com/twit.
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:57.720]   The thing about Squarespace is it's hosting, yes, but it's also software.
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.560]   And so the software is always up to date.
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:00.560]   Security is always patched.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.120]   Very big businesses use Squarespace.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:06.080]   Keel's one of my favorite places.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.080]   I love Keels.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.880]   We're Easterners, so we know about Keels.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:09.880]   My wife loves Keels.
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.440]   Yeah, Keels is fantastic.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.800]   They use Squarespace.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:13.800]   And their site looks unique.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:14.800]   They all look unique.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:18.120]   You start with...
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:24.400]   It all starts with the same, I think about 50 or 60 designer templates, but then the customization
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.960]   is infinite.
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:30.080]   You can do anything you want with Ajax, with drag and drop.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:33.680]   If you know CSS, of course, you can use it in JavaScript, but you don't have to.
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:38.480]   You don't have to be a designer to create an incredibly professional looking unique site.
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:43.200]   If you look at the examples, you'll see how many great Squarespace sites there are out
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.200]   there.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.560]   Then of course, it's easy to post with that iPhone app.
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:50.040]   You can not only post, but you can moderate comments, kill spam, that kind of thing.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.320]   Great stats, so you know exactly who's visiting.
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.320]   They've got photo galleries.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.840]   A lot of photographers use Squarespace for their portfolios.
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:03.040]   Farm building, data collection, intuitive editing, and very simple connections to the social
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.320]   sites we all use.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.920]   You can totally integrate it.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.440]   I want you to try it right now.
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:08.440]   Absolutely free.
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.440]   Just go to squarespace.com/twick.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.680]   Click that great big green button that says "try it for free."
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:13.680]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:16.920]   You just give it a name, a password, an email address, and to those letters.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.360]   Alex Lindsey went to a restaurant.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.360]   He loved.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:21.360]   He said, "Where's your website?"
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.360]   They said, "We don't have a website."
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.360]   He said, "Well, you do now."
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.800]   He literally half an hour later made his Squarespace site for free and said, "I'm
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:27.800]   not going to do that."
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.800]   Look, if you guys want to keep it, here's a password.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.960]   That's the kind of thing you can do with Squarespace.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.480]   I'm sure knowing Alex was a fantastic site.
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.800]   I hope they took him up on it.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:42.160]   After two weeks, if you decide you want to keep the site, pricing's very affordable.
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:47.760]   If you use the offer code TWIT, you'll save 10% off all of these prices.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:51.080]   If you're somebody like Natalie, where you have other authors, they have multiple author
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:55.400]   sites, do you know what this audiences thing is, Natalie?
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.160]   Because I don't really...
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.280]   You have different looks depending on the audience?
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.680]   Yeah, it's kind of a weird...
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.240]   That actually is not.
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.880]   I haven't found the easiest thing to figure out.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:11.120]   Since you create a password protected area of your website, so different members can
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.120]   have different parts of the site.
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.720]   I guess if you wanted to pay some, this would be great.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.720]   Exactly.
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.040]   Different people have different...
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.040]   Editors.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.040]   Permissions.
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.040]   Yeah, different editors.
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.040]   It's really neat.
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:26.400]   It's $12, but again, use the offer code TWIT and you'll save 10%.
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:32.920]   Not for the first month, the first year, but for the life of your site, squarespace.com/twits.
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:37.840]   Really the easy way to create a great website.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:43.080]   Not just iPhones, not just Android phones, but apparently smartphone apps in general now
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:47.800]   are really paying attention to what you're doing in the Wall Street Journal, to an investigation
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:54.280]   and found out that apps like PaperToss and TextPlus are actually passing information
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:57.840]   about us to the advertiser.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:02.760]   The Journal tested 101 apps from Apple and Android to see which apps were reporting personal
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.600]   data advertisers.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:11.280]   Over half sent the iPhone's unique identification number to companies without user consent.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.880]   Just under half sent data on the phone's location.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:20.680]   5% of the apps reported age and gender information to the advertisers.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:25.040]   Is this something you agree to when you download these apps?
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:29.480]   When you sign the agreement or is this something we should expect?
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.120]   Is it par for the course?
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:39.240]   Marshall, is this a bad thing or a good thing?
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.240]   Have I lost your audio?
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.560]   I think I've lost your audio, Marshall.
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:42.560]   Did you mute yourself?
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.760]   Yes, I did.
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:45.760]   Sorry about that.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:46.760]   Go ahead.
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:51.680]   So this Wall Street Journal series about online privacy has been driving me crazy for months.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:55.200]   Some of it's completely BS.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:01.720]   And the parts of it that aren't are really couched in fear-mongering and anti-innovation
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.720]   language.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:07.960]   The federal government has picked up the gauntlet a little bit here and is talking about things
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:15.360]   like a do not track requirement and a privacy policy round table and when the federal government
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:21.160]   talks about these issues, they almost without fail are also mentioning the incredible potential
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:25.920]   for innovation that user activity data provides.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:31.040]   They never leave that out in all the documents I've read and most media coverage, and especially
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:35.240]   this Wall Street Journal stuff, never talks about the upside.
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:40.680]   It's all boogie man, you know, fear-based advertising.
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:44.120]   Well and let's not forget Rupert Murdoch owns the Wall Street Journal and has a little bit
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.360]   of investment in the internet failing.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.760]   I think you're going to lose that one Rupert.
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:52.680]   On the other hand, I do think that of all the articles I've read, this one seems to have
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.000]   a pretty good point.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.960]   Do we agree that paper toss should send my personal information to an advertiser?
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:03.320]   Is that something that everybody understands is going to happen?
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:10.480]   People don't understand it for sure, but the kind of backlash that could come as a result
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.720]   of it, I'm real concerned about too.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:17.360]   My friend and mentor, Margeline Hochstra over in Amsterdam just sent me a link to an app
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:23.720]   called Firewall IP that you can use if you've got a jailbroken iPhone and it will show you
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:29.480]   all of those outgoing requests that you may not be aware of and allow you to approve or
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.760]   deny them one at a time.
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:40.880]   The general points out that most of these sites do not have a privacy policy and neither Apple
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:46.200]   nor Google requires a privacy policy on the part of apps.
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.000]   So I guess is let the buyer beware.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.360]   Well, you know, I had a lot of these apps when they install and I've seen this on a couple
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.200]   of different types of phones.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.200]   They do say, you know, this app is asking for this and this.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.040]   Android Ted, Android definitely tells you that.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:03.480]   Yeah, as does the rim, Blackberries and I've been playing around with a Nokia device and
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:07.440]   seem to do the same thing, but you still don't really know what you're giving up.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.440]   And it's not granular.
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.440]   I mean, it's not.
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:13.280]   It's just saying this site, you know, this app uses your, you know, internet connection,
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:18.960]   but it doesn't say it uses it to transmit everything you're doing back to the home office.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:25.320]   Well, and I think they are these apps are taking too much of an advantage of the personal
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:30.560]   difference because your phone has the most personal information on you of anything, right?
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.560]   It knows where you are.
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:32.560]   It knows what you do.
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:38.400]   It knows who you call and giving that out without your explicit authorization.
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.440]   I think is wrong.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.080]   And I think that we're going to see a backlash.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.080]   We're seeing it already.
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:45.680]   Look at the don't, you know, do not follow stuff on the internet that the FTC is doing.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:51.560]   Angry Birds on the iPhone sends your unique identifier, which by the way, cannot be modified
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:55.600]   sends your unique identifier, maybe that, okay, maybe that's okay, and your location.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:00.600]   Now, why does Angry Birds, why does chilling go need my location and what do they do
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.600]   with it?
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.440]   They say we don't do anything with it, but then why do you say why do you take it?
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:11.640]   Well, on the, so the less admirable side of the coin there would be to geo target advertisements,
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:17.560]   right, I suppose, on the other side of the coin, perhaps more favorably, they could use
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:25.640]   that sort of information to team you up with other players of the game in your area.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:31.240]   Now, but I, well, okay, you know, the sky is the limit and it's up to some of these
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:34.560]   people who are getting this data to do something with it that's interesting.
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:39.320]   But I got a point out that Angry Birds on the iPhone has no ads.
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:40.320]   It's a paid application.
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.320]   No, you too.
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.320]   I got it right here.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.920]   And it doesn't, it doesn't have team play.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.800]   It doesn't, it doesn't have any of that geographic stuff.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.040]   Birds and pigs.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.040]   It's it.
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.680]   So I still don't understand.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.160]   Birds and pigs.
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:58.280]   There's no need to know which phone is that this is a, maybe they think you need caffeine
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.280]   as you're seriously planning.
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.560]   Hey, there's a Starbucks.
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.640]   So this is the phone all over Europe.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:08.680]   When I was in Paris for Le Webb, they're the heavy, heavy promotion from the Nokia
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.680]   and eight.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.200]   This is their hot new smartphone, Symbian, right?
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.200]   Hold it in your hand.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.200]   I want you to feel.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.200]   Feel hot.
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.320]   I mean, I mean, it's really heated up.
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:19.680]   They're a little bit of an issue with battery because it's been sitting in, in basically
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:23.800]   my pocket for two hours and it's been really warming up and draining the battery.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:26.400]   It's a little bit, it's an underwhelming form factor.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.040]   It's a little bit thick.
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.840]   It's got a 12 megapixel camera on the phone.
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:31.840]   Oh, that's why.
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:32.840]   And they've always, and Carl Zeiss glass.
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.240]   They've always done a good job on the cameras.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:38.120]   The other thing about that is it is gorilla glass on the front.
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:42.000]   And I really like that because I always scratch my phones.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Right.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.320]   So on gorilla glass, you can almost drive a nail into it and not scratch it.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:51.240]   It's got a front, looks like it's got a front facing camera and a flash on the front.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.480]   That's kind of kooky.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.760]   What do you think?
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:56.560]   You think it's a good phone?
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:57.560]   Too early.
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:58.560]   I'm going to give up your...
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:31:59.560]   I can't give up my iPhone.
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.160]   I'll give up my blackberry for it.
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:05.120]   I have the Nexus S here, which I like the plain Google experience.
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.120]   I think it's just fantastic.
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.400]   It does not have gorilla glass though, which I was surprised by.
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.640]   It doesn't have that no scratch glass.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:12.640]   Right.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:13.640]   I think it's one actually had gorilla glass.
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:14.640]   It didn't really.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.640]   That's interesting.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:16.640]   It did.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:17.640]   And the iPhone does too, right?
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:18.640]   It has like a sapphire or some sort of...
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.160]   Although my son immediately, both my son and daughter have iPhones that are completely
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.160]   shutters.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:26.240]   The Corning makes this gorilla glass and it is really...
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:31.280]   I think it's a real breakthrough for clear glass at CES.
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:34.360]   You should go buy Corning and check out gorilla glass because they're going to be there.
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:37.920]   They're going to be showing off gorilla glass and talk to them about what it does.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:42.920]   We...
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:46.920]   Was it mobile expo?
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:47.920]   Mobile focus.
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:51.320]   The gorilla glass people were there and he stopped on it with his motorcycle boot and
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.320]   smashed it.
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.320]   It did, really?
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.320]   Well, that's a huge, huge case.
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.320]   Nobody's going to stop on their phone.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:02.080]   Wait, was he trying to prove that it couldn't be broken and then he broke it?
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.080]   Yeah.
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.520]   And he was really embarrassed.
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.760]   He thought I would be mad at it.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.680]   I was actually happy for him.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:09.960]   I thought, good job.
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.080]   Well done, Burke.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.560]   It's the Titanic of phones.
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:14.560]   Yeah.
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:18.600]   Apple doesn't do gorilla glass exactly, but it does apparently have a hardened glass.
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:19.760]   Although, in the galaxy, yes.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.280]   I'm told the galaxy does have gorilla glass, so maybe this does.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.280]   Really?
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.280]   I look up.
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.280]   I don't think it does.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.280]   Okay.
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.280]   Corning, we'll have to ask Corning.
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.280]   New Google Maps on here.
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:32.680]   If you looked at the new Maps 5, if you have an Android phone, not yet on iPhone.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:33.680]   That is so cool.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:34.680]   Isn't that kind of neat?
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.680]   They use Vectors.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:39.120]   The line function is what I'm most excited about.
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:41.120]   Because you don't have to be connected.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.760]   You can just download the Maps for where you are, which is another thing to try and
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:44.760]   see.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:45.920]   Yes, because we all know that there's the bandwidth.
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:46.920]   There's terrible.
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:50.800]   You do have to be connected to get your initial directions.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.440]   But then if you lose connection, then your Maps will continue because that's happened
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:57.080]   to me so many times where I'll get lost.
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:58.080]   And like, where's the turn?
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.080]   I don't know.
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.600]   And because you've lost your connection.
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:01.600]   It's great.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.840]   So I guess I must have cashed the Maps.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:08.280]   And these are instead of bit Maps, which used to be, it's now vector based.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:12.120]   So when you zoom in, it's instant and you don't, you know, it just redraws it, which
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.120]   is really great.
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.920]   You don't have to wait for it.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.880]   No-key Maps use the same technology.
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.080]   They're also vector based.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.080]   Let's be honest.
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.520]   Yeah, the only map on here I downloaded California and Vermont.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:22.520]   It's cool.
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:23.520]   I have those Maps on here.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.000]   It's kind of a silly feature.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.280]   I mean, come on.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.280]   Of course you could do that.
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.600]   And then this is nice.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.840]   You now can use a pinch to twist the map.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:37.480]   And if you use two fingers, it'll change the angle kind of, Allah, Google Earth.
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:41.120]   And if you're in an area where they've modeled the buildings, obviously, in here in Petaluma,
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.760]   we haven't done SketchUp to model the buildings.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:47.320]   But if you go to New York City, the buildings will actually kind of almost looks like pop
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:50.600]   out of the phone as you tilt as you tilt that way.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:51.600]   And that's kind of fun.
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:52.600]   It's a gimmick.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:55.720]   But how useful is the most useful thing is offline Maps, right?
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:57.560]   That's the thing that we should get excited about.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:58.560]   Yeah.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:02.600]   The thing about vector Maps is they don't have to, every time you pinch or zoom, it has
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.600]   to reload a new map if it's not using that technology.
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.320]   But now that map is cached.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:11.160]   And so you can move it around and you don't have to wait for a brand new connection to
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.160]   the server.
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.160]   Yeah, you saw how snappy it was.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.160]   Exactly.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.160]   It's pretty cool.
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.160]   Yeah.
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.000]   This is Gingerbread, which is 2.3.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.880]   And big improvements in the performance, I have to say, on the Android phone.
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:28.600]   I think that's something that Apple people often say, use as a negative on the Android
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:33.880]   phones is the kind of the slightest lag when you move stuff around.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:36.320]   And I think that that's been kind of handled.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:40.960]   We have the S. We've got a review up on app judgment at Rivest 3 on that.
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:41.960]   Yeah.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.840]   And I played with it a little bit, a couple of guys at the office, waited in line at Best
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:48.200]   Buy on Friday to pick one up with some other people.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.200]   That's impressive.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.200]   I like it.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:51.200]   I've been very happy with it.
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.120]   You know, there's some missing features you can't add an SD card.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.040]   It doesn't have a light, a notification light.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.360]   Apparently Samsung doesn't like those.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.680]   These aren't physical buttons.
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.240]   They're kind of electronic buttons.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:01.240]   But I don't mind that.
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:02.760]   I kind of I don't like the physical buttons.
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:06.280]   The new keyboard is much better on the Nexus S.
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:11.280]   Do you think it's interesting that Google went from HTC as the maker of the Nexus 1
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.280]   to Samsung?
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.280]   I do think it's interesting.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.280]   I wonder what that means.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:17.680]   It may be nothing, but I always like looking for conspiracies.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:21.600]   I like I have to say I like the Galaxy S line in general.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.280]   And I love the AMOLED screens.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.680]   Don't you love the AMOLED screens?
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:25.680]   Oh, I love it.
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.160]   Oh, I love the end of the minute.
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.720]   They just want everyone to have a year, have a turn.
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:30.720]   It's like prom queen.
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.200]   Samsung is the prom queen.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.200]   LG Max.
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.840]   It'll be Motorola.
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:36.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:43.000]   You know, it's pretty clear that this isn't a phone that Google wants to make money on
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   or even sell.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.720]   They just have to have something that's a reference.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.120]   You know what's cool about that phone?
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.080]   And I don't know if you can show it, but turn on it side.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:52.160]   It's got this convexity to it or concavity to it.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.320]   It's kind of a kind of slopey.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.320]   It's kind of weird.
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:37:00.240]   If you can really tell, and it's apparently just the glass, I fix it, tore it down and
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.240]   said, no, you know what?
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:04.160]   The panel underneath, the LCD is flat.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.960]   But there's a slightest-- why do you think they do that?
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:06.960]   Is that for glare?
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:07.960]   I have no idea.
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:09.720]   I just think it's cool.
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:10.960]   It's like going up to 11.
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:11.960]   It's like our glass curve.
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:12.960]   It's good.
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.960]   No, it's said something in the press release about that, how it's just so much more comfortable.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:20.840]   Oh, well, yeah, because it now fits the contours of my cheek.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:21.840]   Right.
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:22.840]   It's not curved enough.
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.840]   This occurs here at Square Jawed.
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:24.840]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:25.840]   They're round cheeks.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:29.280]   They really-- they'd have to make this center like a bowling ball.
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.360]   I must be-- I don't know.
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.360]   So much more comfortable.
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:37.880]   You know, you really shouldn't be holding that up to your head anyway.
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:38.880]   Let's see.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:42.040]   What else is new in the world of technology?
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.720]   Big lunar eclipse coming up on Monday.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:44.720]   Oh, my.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.200]   Still my beauty heart.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:49.800]   Oh, how exciting.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.640]   How is lunar eclipse part of technology, Leo?
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.760]   This is like the most natural event you can get.
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:58.360]   Anything that geeks would be interested in.
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.760]   Ah, OK.
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:00.760]   Huh?
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:01.760]   We're going to webcat it.
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.920]   We're going to webcat the lunar eclipse.
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:04.920]   Look, the moon.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:05.920]   It's disappearing.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.720]   Leo report will interview the man on the moon.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.240]   Oh, I know what the big story is.
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.120]   Do we talk about this last week?
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:14.720]   Mark Zuckerberg, man of the year.
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:19.040]   Is there some old paper magazine that's going out of business, is that right?
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.440]   I can't remember.
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:24.480]   Man of the year, Mark Zuckerberg, with the creepiest picture you've ever seen on the
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.480]   front page at time.
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:26.480]   Time.
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:31.840]   It looks like we shouldn't call him man like boy of the year.
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:32.840]   Sorry.
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:33.840]   Or Mark.
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:34.840]   Man.
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:35.840]   Giant genius of the year.
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:36.840]   I don't know.
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:37.760]   You just get dissed big time.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.520]   There are pictures of him as a baby.
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:42.520]   He's the man.
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:47.920]   He's very young and he's the richest billionaire.
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.600]   The youngest billionaire, the richest youngest billionaire.
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:51.600]   I don't know.
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:56.560]   Well, but the market for his shares certainly indicates that he's a billionaire.
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:00.800]   But does he have a billion dollars in the bank or does he have shares in a non-liquid?
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:06.640]   Did you, he's selling his, he's selling his or actually I guess leasing the house that
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.640]   he's been living in.
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.680]   And it's very modest.
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:10.680]   It's nothing fancy.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:11.680]   It's not a mensium.
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.720]   Of course, he's moving somewhere, which is probably quite a mansion.
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:15.720]   So I don't know.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:20.160]   Let me let, let me show you just for those of you watching the video at home, let me see
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.880]   if I could find the, the cover picture.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:27.200]   Would you find it a little weird to live in Mark Zuckerberg's house given that, you know,
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.680]   people are probably tracking him down and there's probably going to be stalkers coming
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:30.680]   over who don't know he's moved.
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:31.680]   He's moving.
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:34.160]   You're looking in the wind out, you know, and you're brushing your teeth.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.200]   It's like, that's not Mark Zuckerberg here.
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:39.240]   Don't you think that's kind of creepy that cover?
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.240]   It's like he's.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:41.240]   Stop poking.
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:42.240]   He doesn't live here anymore.
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:44.920]   Yeah, it's like he's staring at you.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:45.920]   Stop poking.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:48.840]   Don't you think he's kind of staring and like, don't his eyes follow you as you move?
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:49.840]   Look.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:50.840]   His eyes follow you.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.840]   It's kind of like the Haunted Mansion.
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:56.480]   And why does this picture exist?
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:57.480]   He posed for it.
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.480]   In some capacity.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.480]   I think it's HDR.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:01.480]   Hmm.
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:09.640]   Oh, now laugh if you will, but that young guy right there, any other year, if it weren't
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:15.120]   for WikiLeaks, I think that that people wouldn't object to Zuckerberg.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.520]   He's getting person of the air work.
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:25.320]   I mean, he brought easy publishing and personalized subscription, syndication reading, you know,
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:31.160]   the power of RSS in the form of the newsfeed to 500 people, 500 billion people all around
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:32.160]   the world.
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.160]   He's totally changed the world.
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.160]   No, you know what?
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:35.160]   I actually agree with you.
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:39.120]   In fact, I argued this point on this week in Google.
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:43.120]   He certainly was a strong candidate for the person of the year.
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.360]   And Facebook is an amazing story, really.
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.360]   Let's face it.
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:51.240]   It's a absolutely technology person of the year, but it must have been a pretty low beat year
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:55.800]   if these are overall worldwide person of half a billion users.
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:56.800]   And you're right, Marshall.
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.160]   He made it easy to publish fees.
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:02.240]   They do more pictures, serve more pictures than Flickr and everyone else combined.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:07.800]   I mean, this is a significant, should Julian Assange be the person of the year?
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.080]   Well, okay.
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:13.160]   It's a significant win for introverts everywhere.
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:19.880]   I'm watching you voting for Kim Jong-il and Anwar Alalaki.
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:25.720]   So I mean, there's some more truly global people who make it possible not just to share
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:28.320]   my baby photos with my mother-in-law.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.840]   I beg to differ.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.080]   I think it's enough.
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.720]   The politicians have had enough press and enough attention.
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:37.360]   It's kind of always the default as a politician gets this.
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:41.120]   And I don't think politicians make as much of a difference in day-to-day lives as somebody
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.120]   like Mark Zuckerberg does.
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.120]   What about some show up?
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:47.480]   Think of all the people who got laid because of Facebook.
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:49.480]   I didn't hear that say it.
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:50.480]   No, don't say it again.
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:53.200]   Leo, we're talking Time magazine, not Playboy magazine.
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:59.880]   I think Mark has done more to bring people together, old college, old college flames,
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:00.880]   high school girlfriends.
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:06.400]   Yes, I'm not saying that's not valuable, but I think we should also look at the way this
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:09.200]   award has sort of been diluted anyway.
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:13.680]   Like two years ago, there was a big mirror and a picture and it said, "You," like we
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:15.080]   were all person of the year.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:19.560]   So it's almost something I barely care about anymore at all.
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:22.240]   Leo, remember when the personal computer was the person with the ear?
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:24.960]   Remember when you were the person of the ear?
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:25.960]   You.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:26.960]   You, all of us you.
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.960]   That's what you did with the mirror.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:29.960]   Like Natalie said, totally.
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:33.080]   Oh, I think that you're making too much light of it.
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:38.200]   Call me an overly serious guy, but really, I mean, the printing press can be used to print
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:42.440]   silly things, but that doesn't mean that it is a silly tool.
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.440]   Really?
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.440]   What does it do?
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:51.440]   I mean, I agree he's an important guy, but what does it do?
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:55.680]   It makes people in supermarkets get excited and say, "Yeah, we really do appreciate this
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:56.680]   Facebook thing."
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:00.360]   Well, and that's the whole point of a cover of a magazine is to sell the magazine.
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:01.360]   Well, it certainly will do.
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:02.360]   Right?
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:05.520]   So they'd pick a person of the year, not because that's the best, most interesting or the
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.640]   person who's done the most for the human race.
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:11.880]   It's the person most likely to sell the most copies of the magazine at the supermarket.
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:12.880]   Right.
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.160]   It's not even crowd sourced.
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:17.120]   It's just what time thinks, what their editors think.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.240]   Well, and they really want to do something like this.
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:23.640]   Come up with the final list and throw it on their, sorry to say it, Facebook page.
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:26.720]   You know who I think the person of the year should be?
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:27.720]   The old Spice guy.
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:30.680]   Man, I think he's great.
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.240]   He's on a horse.
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:34.240]   That's the person.
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.240]   All right.
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.240]   You're right.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.240]   That's truthfully.
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.760]   I'm going to say that.
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:43.840]   He would sell a lot more grocery store copies of Time magazine if you put that guy.
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:47.400]   Oh, I saw him should be person of the year.
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.400]   Do you think so?
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:49.400]   Uh-huh.
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:52.480]   I think probably if you're talking about somebody who's not merely--
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:55.040]   Not more sell magazines, but I think you're right.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:44:03.040]   Not merely done important things, but in some ways really changed how we think of journalism.
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:08.960]   As Jay Rosen said, the first transnational, post-national journalistic entity, I think
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.720]   that you could make a case for Assange.
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:15.480]   Well, he's also brought us to the point of really trying to think about should everything.
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:17.720]   I mean, everything be transparent.
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:19.480]   Yeah, what is-- yes.
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:20.920]   And well, this is a great conversation.
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:25.800]   Let's have that in a second because I think transparency is a kind of an interesting subject.
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:29.440]   But before we do that, I would like to talk a little bit about Gazelle.
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:34.280]   I know a lot of you are settled with old gadgets you'd like to get rid of, maybe an old iPhone
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:35.280]   or two.
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.880]   Perhaps you'd like to get the new iPhone.
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:40.360]   Gazelle is a great place to get rid of your old gadgets.
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:41.800]   Don't sell it.
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:48.200]   Gazelle.com is the place to go right now if you want to know more about Gazelle.
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:49.920]   You can buy and sell electronics.
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:55.520]   If you go to the website, you'll be able to enter in your old gear.
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:59.760]   Well, Jim, give me a gadget, an old gadget that you have lying around.
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:00.760]   An old gadget.
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:01.760]   The house so you don't need anymore.
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:02.760]   You don't want anymore.
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.160]   Well, now my BlackBerry 9700.
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:05.400]   The perfect example.
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:09.920]   No, no, let's say you're going to keep that in 98.
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:11.880]   So you have an old-- an 8, rather.
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:14.200]   So you have an old-- it's a curve, right?
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:16.120]   Yeah, just put a BlackBerry curve, sure.
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:19.080]   Let's see, the old curve.
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:22.480]   And 83.10, there's quite a few curves, aren't there?
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:25.400]   Let me look at all the different curves.
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:28.520]   See which one, the 8,000, the 5,000.
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:29.520]   Which one?
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:30.520]   It's this one, right?
[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:31.520]   Yeah, it's that one.
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:32.520]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:33.520]   Yeah, that's the ticket.
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:34.520]   Yeah, it is.
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:39.720]   So you can see, they have all the different models in here.
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:42.880]   You click Sell It Now, and then it's going to ask you a few questions, because it make
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.200]   a call for your water damage?
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:46.200]   No.
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.200]   No?
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.200]   Really?
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:49.200]   Would you drop it in the toilet?
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.200]   We have the ocean.
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:51.200]   The ocean.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.200]   Let's say it's good condition.
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:53.920]   You have the AC-adapted research.
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:54.920]   I sure do.
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:55.920]   Yeah, yeah, all that stuff.
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.040]   By the way, this is fun.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.040]   Look at the graph.
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.440]   They show you the value as it's been plummeting.
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:01.440]   That's it.
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:03.880]   What side graph is it?
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:05.920]   Let's calculate how much you're going to get.
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:06.920]   $65.
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:07.920]   That's pretty cool.
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:08.920]   That's good.
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:09.920]   Now, so here's what happens.
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:10.920]   You say, OK, I'll accept that offer.
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.400]   You can, by the way, add more.
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:14.280]   Get a box.
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:15.680]   You check out.
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:17.480]   They will print out a mailing labor.
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:18.480]   They pay the postage.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:21.520]   You send all that stuff back in a box.
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:22.840]   They send you a check.
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:26.920]   Or you can get a Amazon credit or PayPal credit.
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:29.920]   I think there are a variety of different ways you can get paid.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.800]   It's just a great way to get rid of your gadgets.
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:35.360]   If it's so old and junky that they can't sell it, they'll tell you ahead of time.
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:40.400]   And then they'll recycle it and they do it responsibly using EPA-certified green recyclers.
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:44.360]   They guarantee no landfill, no international transportation.
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:47.680]   They break it down and they take care of it responsibly and appropriately.
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:49.840]   Now, here's one more feature that I like about Gazelle.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:55.000]   If you're a nonprofit, instead of having a bake sale, have a gadget sale.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.480]   Turn your gadgets into cash for your cause.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:02.680]   They'll even give you a web page, a personalized gadget drive web page.
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:03.880]   You could send donors there.
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:06.200]   The donors send their gadgets to Gazelle.
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:09.080]   Gazelle sends your charity the check.
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:12.360]   Great way to raise money for all sorts of causes.
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:13.640]   Great recycling.
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:14.640]   Sell your gadgets.
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:16.320]   Gazelle, I love it.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.320]   Don't sell it.
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:21.600]   You offer code TWIT, by the way, at the end when you're checking out and you get a 5% bonus
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:24.200]   payment for your used gadgets.
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:27.240]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:30.000]   Gazelle.com.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.800]   Let's talk about transparency because I think you're right.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:37.320]   I think that's really what the WikiLeaks message is.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:43.640]   Is that in the day of the internet, there's no room for secrets, even for governmental
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:44.640]   secrets.
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:47.280]   I think that's the case.
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:48.280]   I think it's becoming the way.
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:49.280]   That is what I think.
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:50.280]   That's the message.
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.000]   But is it right or not?
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.720]   I think that's more interesting.
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:59.160]   Should there be things that are better off left unknown to everybody?
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:04.040]   You or certainly about me, but I mean really about the rest of the world?
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:07.240]   Look, I could defend you right to have some private life.
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:08.240]   I think that that's fine.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:12.840]   But do you think governments?
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:13.840]   It depends.
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:15.320]   I can argue both sides of this, but I'll take it.
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:16.320]   I can too, actually.
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:17.320]   I'll take the side of things.
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:22.960]   Should be private because many things happen in backgrounds based on trust between leaders
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:26.320]   that they may not be able to say out loud.
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:33.400]   If all of their thoughts are all out loud, that I think could slow things down or could
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:34.400]   cause problems.
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:35.400]   I could argue the other side.
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:37.800]   I think that's a fundamental mistrust of the people.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:38.800]   Really, I think-
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:42.440]   I'm not talking about the US, but other parts of the world.
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:47.080]   The US is whose ox is being gored right now.
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:49.680]   What do you think of that alert?
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:50.680]   There's a certain-
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:51.680]   Oh, go ahead, Marshall.
[00:48:51.680 --> 00:49:00.720]   I wonder if there's a certain point where an organization loses enough trust that their
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:09.000]   assurances that they're acting in secret in good faith don't carry any water anymore.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.960]   I'm not sure that the WikiLeaks either is arguing completely against secrecy.
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:17.960]   They've gone through and redacted a bunch of names and details in partnership with the
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:23.600]   media outlets that they're publishing alongside of.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:29.360]   I think about the revelation that the United States is looking for blackmail material to
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:35.520]   use against people participating in climate change negotiations who want stricter controls
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:37.960]   on climate change.
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:39.560]   Wow, that's quite a revelation.
[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:41.040]   I didn't see that.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:42.040]   Wow.
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:45.480]   Yeah, I mean, the list just keeps going on.
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:50.080]   But that's just think about that one so that there's something tangible there.
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:52.240]   We have the right to know that, don't you think?
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:53.240]   I think so.
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:57.400]   And I can see why government, our government would love to hide that.
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:04.560]   The State Department cover up of human sex trafficking by private military contractors
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:10.560]   in Afghanistan reported by the Houston Chronicle as a result of WikiLeaks.
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:13.560]   A lot of people linked to that source that came out.
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:17.360]   I think that deserves light a day.
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:23.640]   And there are, I'd like to know some real tangible harms that have been done as a result
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:25.400]   of the disclosure.
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:29.120]   I think there's tangible examples of things that have been disclosed that needed to be
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:30.360]   disclosed.
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:35.120]   But in most cases, it feels like it's a philosophical argument on the other side.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:40.960]   Or in worst case scenario, a case where the government says this is bad and people go
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:46.000]   along with it just because they're told that it's a terrible thing to have secrets disclosed.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.040]   But I'd like to know some specific secrets that should not have been disclosed and what
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:58.200]   the harm beyond just harm to US interests, but harm to people's lives has been as a result
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:50:59.200]   of that disclosure.
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:05.160]   I think it's a lot of just sort of dirty laundry where the things that Hillary Clinton is asking
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:10.640]   her staff information about that kind of thing, it's embarrassing.
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:16.040]   And I am definitely all for making the government more of an open source community where information
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:18.440]   is actually not private, but we can all discuss it.
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:20.800]   The problem is we don't live in that society.
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:26.320]   So if only one person has their laundry aired and other people don't, that's why we're
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:27.960]   so uncomfortable with it, I think.
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:33.920]   And I do feel like we would feel a lot differently as a country if this were a Middle Eastern
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:37.920]   country who had their dirty laundry out.
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:38.920]   We'd be laughing.
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:41.960]   Well, the other part of it I think that's interesting is WikiLeaks is now moving from
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:44.480]   government to business.
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:47.480]   And think about, you know, NDA statements that you've signed.
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:48.920]   I mean, I run a business.
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:53.520]   I wouldn't want everything that we're planning on doing to be completely transparent and open
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:54.520]   to everybody.
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:56.840]   And I'm just a small business where probably doesn't even matter that much.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:58.560]   Well, and that's a good point.
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:01.760]   But I think that's the difference between government and business.
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:04.600]   Government, I don't have a problem with you having secrets.
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:07.760]   I have a little bit of a problem with a government having secrets.
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:09.720]   So that is, there is a difference.
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:15.400]   But there are secrets, I don't know, I was playing Call of Duty Black Ops last night.
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:17.400]   Oh, I'd keep that secret for you.
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:19.400]   That was not the secret I wanted to reveal.
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:22.840]   You know, the central character is this guy and, you know, the Cold War goes down to the
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:27.560]   Bay of Pigs and tries to, you know, does all this stuff, tries to, you know, and at that
[00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:31.480]   time during the Cold War, were there secrets that we shouldn't have told?
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:32.480]   I don't know.
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:36.120]   I just think the stuff that we were doing then, would we have been better off having
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:37.120]   everyone know it?
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:38.120]   Maybe we wouldn't have gotten to the Vietnam War.
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:39.120]   Exactly.
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:40.120]   There's a lot of representation myself here.
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:45.160]   There's a lot of reprehensible stuff that went on that probably wouldn't have happened.
[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:46.160]   Had we not?
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:49.560]   Well, many wars are built on assumptions and propaganda.
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:54.560]   And I think this memo that Michael Moore posted on The Huffington Post about why he posted
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:59.240]   bail for Julian Assange makes a great point that a lot of this information wouldn't have
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:01.920]   been so many, there wouldn't have been so many smoke and mirrors.
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:03.440]   And is that right?
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:05.000]   Is there really weapons of mass instruction?
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:09.280]   Like we would have known, we would have had more information, which we can all agree
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:13.600]   on, I think, is a good thing, at least that part.
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:18.080]   We certainly, the government has lost our trust in the post-Watergate era.
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:21.320]   I don't think there's anybody who trusts government anymore.
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:29.400]   And so I think in that case, then revealing the secrets of the government is only a good
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.400]   thing, right?
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.080]   If you don't trust him, you got to watch him.
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:35.360]   And how can you watch him if we don't know what's going on?
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:39.680]   I mean, so many news broadcasts are built on this.
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:41.680]   Like, you know, we're telling you the truth.
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:42.680]   We dug it all up.
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:47.600]   You know, and that's just, they don't have any more information than the rest of us had.
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:52.360]   They just make it our business, their business to, you know, dissect more and read more and
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:53.560]   pay more attention.
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:58.840]   But if there really was more information out there, then maybe the news networks would
[00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:00.400]   have something to work with.
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:01.400]   Right.
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:03.640]   Well, in fact, maybe we don't need news networks, right?
[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.080]   I mean, we've got this guy.
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:07.160]   Do we even have news networks anymore?
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:08.160]   I mean, really?
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.160]   Well, we do.
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:10.160]   Oh, right.
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:12.600]   Yeah, I mean, they're called news networks.
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:17.560]   I don't know if they take serious, they're not news networks in the Edward R. Murrow sense.
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:19.040]   What's the news network, are they?
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:21.760]   Well, we don't have networks in the Edward R. Murrow sense anymore.
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:25.760]   We have a zillion different, but anybody can be a broadcaster.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:26.760]   Right.
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:27.760]   Right.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:35.040]   I wonder, though, and then to take it to the next level, I wonder if this internet media
[00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:39.920]   stuff, if we can replace, you know, if we can still do news and investigative journalism,
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:43.600]   you and I both run internet networks, we don't have the resources to do the kind of thing
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:46.000]   that the old networks used to do.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.640]   Yeah, but I think they're still--
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:48.640]   Neither did the old networks.
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:49.640]   Yeah.
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:51.280]   Somebody works for a network.
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:54.000]   But Huffington Post is now putting a lot of money into--
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.600]   15 million, I think, in an investigative journalism.
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:58.960]   So does investigative journalism sell?
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:04.000]   I fear that that's a token amount of money that they're doing specifically to respond
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   to this complaint.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.840]   You think they're attracting attention to themselves?
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:08.840]   Oh, really?
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:09.840]   In the Huffington Post?
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:15.880]   Well, I was talking to somebody whose friend is a-- I don't want to name names or give
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:21.280]   you enough information to make this person track downable, former investigative reporter
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:26.080]   for a major network who has taken a job doing investigative reporting for Rupert Murdoch's
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:31.080]   Daily, the 99 cent week iPad publication is very excited about it.
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:36.360]   He actually turned down a real job with a major network to do this.
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:40.800]   And maybe there is-- you know, maybe there's-- with the paywall, there's a way to keep journalism
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:44.400]   alive, or is it hopeless?
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.720]   I certainly don't think we get a lot of journalism now.
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:50.400]   So I think you would have to ask yourselves to answer that question is, would you pay
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:55.400]   for this iPad app, this 99 cents a week or whatever it is?
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:56.400]   Would you?
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:57.400]   Would you?
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:58.400]   I wouldn't.
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:55:59.400]   Oh, you're not going to-- yeah, because the internet gives me everything.
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:00.400]   The web gives me--
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:01.400]   I got it.
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:02.400]   I got it.
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:03.400]   Well, it depends on the content that you want.
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:04.400]   I pay a lot of money for the economist.
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:05.400]   That's true.
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:06.400]   That's well worth it.
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:08.440]   Yeah, because it's worth it to me.
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:13.120]   So if you're the kind of person who really appreciates news corp reporting, then you'd
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:14.120]   pay for it.
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:15.120]   Are you saying something about me, Natalie?
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:18.120]   You want to come right out and say it?
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:19.120]   No.
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.120]   No.
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:21.120]   I get everything I need.
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:22.120]   I get everything I need.
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:24.120]   It's for you to be my login to the economist, Jim.
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:26.120]   Gosh darn it.
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:30.480]   Well, it's your facts and me some of their articles.
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:33.320]   So I saw an interesting story relating to this.
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:36.760]   YouTube supposedly talks to buy next to new networks.
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:39.400]   Did you see that New York Times reporting that story?
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:43.000]   We didn't talk about that at all in the office.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.720]   Revision 3 in the same kind of business as next new networks.
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:48.880]   Although they're more of an aggregator than you are.
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:50.240]   They produce a bunch of their own shows.
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.240]   They do.
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:52.240]   They do.
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:55.160]   Although, I think, and I don't really know anything about it, they are a competitive
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:57:01.080]   company, but I don't think that YouTube is going to get into the content creation game.
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:04.120]   That would be the speculation if they bought somebody like next new networks.
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:09.000]   If they wanted to get into the content creation game, I could see them with all of their money
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.880]   going out and buying end them all or free mantle.
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:14.880]   Buy the actual content.
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:18.680]   Buy someone who's got a bigger audience footprint.
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:22.240]   What if you could take survivor and put survivor on YouTube?
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:24.240]   You'd have to buy the guy at Mark Burnett.
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:28.400]   Well, I would be willing to bet that YouTube is spending a lot of time, people from YouTube
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:32.640]   are spending a lot of time in Hollywood talking to Mark Burnett and all of these guys saying,
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:34.600]   let's do something that's web-based.
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:36.320]   Don't you think?
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:40.520]   I think they are only just beginning to do that because they hired Robert Kinkle from
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:41.520]   Netflix.
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:42.520]   That's right.
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:45.840]   We've got all the deals with Netflix to get to line up all the content from all the big
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:46.840]   networks.
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:49.200]   I don't think they were doing much at all before.
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:54.560]   Because YouTube for a long time, right after Google bought them, they turned them from
[00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:58.840]   a media company into an algorithm company, into a technology company.
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:04.360]   I believe that they are slowly turning back to thinking they might be more of a media company,
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:07.280]   but I still don't think that they are going to get into the business of creating their
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:08.600]   own content.
[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:14.520]   Last month Eric Schmidt was asked if he'd consider acquiring web video companies, content
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:15.520]   creators.
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:16.560]   He says, "You never say never.
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:22.040]   We tried not to cross that line, but to actually own the content is an important decision.
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:24.320]   He's acknowledging that would be a big step for Google.
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:26.120]   We're always debating these things."
[00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:29.720]   He says, "Schmidt, the good news right now is there's enough of these little digital
[00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:32.040]   studios that can raise capital."
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:33.040]   He's talking about you.
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:34.040]   He's talking about you.
[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:35.040]   What do you think?
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:36.040]   What do you think?
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:37.040]   What do you think?
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:38.040]   What do you think?
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:39.040]   Google's not coming knocking at my door.
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:40.640]   I can tell you that right now.
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:43.560]   He said though that they say YouTube is a viable distribution point.
[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:44.560]   Eric Schmidt.
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:46.480]   Hello Eric, how are you?
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:47.480]   And that's true.
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:49.840]   Certainly you and I both do a video on YouTube.
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:53.440]   I'm sure Natalie is CBS puts everything that you do on YouTube, right?
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:55.440]   I mean, why wouldn't you?
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:58.360]   Well, Viacom doesn't because they have that suit going on.
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:58:59.360]   So stupid.
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:00.400]   That's just stupid.
[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:03.000]   That's just stupid.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.840]   So I think that YouTube doesn't need to buy this stuff.
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:10.760]   They already have the most powerful channel in the world.
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:13.400]   I don't even understand why they would go to next new networks.
[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:17.600]   Maybe they'd make a deal with next new networks, a distribution deal, but why buy them?
[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:21.360]   And why am I just one vertical a video?
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:22.520]   Why start there?
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:24.520]   Why not just make their own stuff?
[00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:25.520]   Why not start with news?
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:29.800]   Why not start with, I don't know, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me.
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:34.240]   They already send the number one Google video is the Ben & Tritters song, which is a next
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:36.960]   new networks video.
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:39.640]   That's number one in 2010, the Gregory Brothers.
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:43.120]   There are so many videos that get so much traffic.
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:47.800]   That may be the number one video, but as a percent of overall traffic on YouTube, it's
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:50.120]   got to be like a fly in the ointment.
[00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:51.120]   Yeah.
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:52.120]   60 million views.
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:53.320]   I'll take it.
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:54.320]   That's nothing.
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:55.680]   That's network numbers, dude.
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:56.680]   That's nothing for YouTube.
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:58.040]   That's sign film numbers.
[00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:01.920]   The number two video was, anybody guesses?
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.280]   Kesha.
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:04.280]   You know.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.440]   Actually, I didn't think it was Kesha.
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.120]   I thought it was Justin Bieber.
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:09.120]   No, it was Kesha.
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:10.120]   Glitter puke.
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:13.640]   Oh, but the other interesting thing about views, views to me are less important than
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:14.880]   quality of audience.
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.400]   It's actually wasn't Kesha.
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.960]   It was a parody of Kesha.
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.720]   It was a parody of Kesha.
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.200]   There's no dollar sign I should have known.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:27.520]   It was a parody of Kesha from another next new network show called the Key of Awesome.
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:32.680]   So maybe that's why this rumor started.
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:34.080]   Google said, "Hey, who's in charge here?
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:36.240]   Who's running this show?"
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:37.920]   We'd like more of that.
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:44.480]   Maybe, but they see, I mean, there's so many, like the little kid who did the Lady Gaga
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:45.480]   video.
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:46.480]   Like that kid was very talented.
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.120]   And now he's got a record label.
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:49.120]   Right.
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:51.400]   Google's not sitting there saying who's talented and we're going to pick them up and make
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:55.080]   them a star or else they would have picked up that little kid and you know, leave me
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.080]   free.
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:59.800]   I'd rather be in YouTube's position and just be the place everybody goes to.
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:02.560]   On the other hand, they got to monetize a lot of bandwidth.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:04.080]   I can only imagine the amount of bandwidth.
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.400]   Yeah, but look, they have so much volume.
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:10.680]   And if you're going to go out and cherry pick content, you know, you're right Natalie,
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:15.240]   why not pick up Annoying Orange or Ray William Johnson or, you know, some of those folks
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:19.280]   because they're also, I mean, Ray William Johnson delivers more aggregate views probably.
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.320]   I mean, he is definitely up there.
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:23.640]   He's funny as is Annoying Orange.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:25.240]   Annoying Orange is hilarious.
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:29.160]   And those are the people who are driving real sustainable views and have built sustainable
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.160]   channels.
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.040]   So if you're going to start buying some of them, I think you're right.
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.880]   Why not just buy a bunch of them?
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:38.920]   Yeah, I think this was Adam Curry's idea back when I used to work for him is that he would,
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:42.200]   you know, find everything that was cool on the internet and curate it for you, which
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.160]   I think was a good idea.
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:46.400]   That's how Yahoo started.
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:49.120]   And then he just got too big for him.
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:50.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:55.720]   And I just can't do that and people like the agency of finding it themselves.
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:58.360]   So I don't think that they want to serve it to you.
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:00.600]   They love the idea that you find it all yourself.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:01.600]   Yeah.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:08.920]   I want to see YouTube to be a media organization start hiring some political scientists and
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:13.800]   long term foreign policy journalists to dig through the 250,000 weeky leaks cables like
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:15.640]   the New York Times and the Guardian House.
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:16.840]   Yeah, maybe that's what media.
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:20.240]   That's what you do is you support, you know, important journalistic, you know, and you
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.240]   can do it.
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:22.240]   You know, I think it's a great thing.
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.240]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.240]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.240]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:26.240]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.240]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.240]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:29.240]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:30.240]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.240]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:32.240]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:33.240]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:34.240]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.240]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:36.240]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:37.240]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:38.240]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.240]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.240]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.240]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:42.240]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:03:08.240]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:15.240]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:22.240]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:29.240]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:36.240]   I think it's a great thing.
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:41.240]   Every time I play a video from a copyrighted source, they pull my video off of YouTube.
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:42.240]   That's all I know.
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.240]   That's the algorithm coming up.
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:44.240]   I know.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.240]   Jeez.
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:46.240]   Jeez.
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:49.240]   Let us talk a little bit about Audible.com.
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:51.240]   That is a great sponsor.
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:56.240]   I know for us for the last five, four, five years, I'm a big Audible fan.
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:59.240]   I just was looking at my Audible catalog over 400 books over the last 10 years.
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:02.240]   I joined Audible almost exactly 10 years ago.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:03.240]   I love it.
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:05.240]   I have the two Book of Months account.
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:07.240]   That's the one I want to set you up with.
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:09.240]   They call it the Platinum Plan.
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:11.240]   That's for heavy duty readers.
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.240]   You go to Audible.com/twit2.
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:14.240]   Sign up for the Platinum Plan.
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:15.240]   You first two books are free.
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:19.240]   You can cancel any time in the books you use to keep for life.
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:25.240]   If you have a couple of books you're interested in reading, but like me, you find it a little
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:29.240]   hard to find time to read, this is going to be a lifesaver for you.
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:34.240]   Whether it's Tom Clancy or Charles Dickens, James Patterson or Terry Pratt.
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:36.240]   They've got it all.
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:42.240]   A great collection of over 80,000 I think at the last count.
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:47.240]   A book's in all sorts of categories.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:49.240]   Look, Baba Bowie's got a book.
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:50.240]   My wife bought it.
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.240]   Did she?
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:52.240]   She did.
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:53.240]   She loves Howard Stern.
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:54.240]   Really?
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.240]   Loves everything out.
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.240]   You know, Baba Bowie actually I think narrates it.
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:58.240]   So that's the nice thing about Audible.
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:00.240]   You can hear it in his own voice.
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:02.240]   You know, he's a tech head.
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:05.240]   He's got his own sort of internet tech show.
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:07.240]   He calls himself the tech no beaver.
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:08.240]   He views gadgets.
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:10.240]   My wife said, "Oh, yeah.
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.240]   You should talk to him and bring him under revision three."
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:13.240]   Oh, okay.
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:14.240]   Yeah, okay.
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:17.240]   Actually, Jeff Jarv is a big fan too.
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:20.240]   He has my same agent, Gary Delabate.
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:23.240]   Can you put him in touch with me, Natalie?
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:24.240]   Here's a great one.
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:25.240]   Yeah, I actually can.
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:30.240]   If you want him on a regular basis, give me a move over Veronica.
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:32.240]   Yeah, here it comes.
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:34.240]   Here comes Baba Bowie.
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:35.240]   Here's a recommendation.
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:36.240]   I'm sure the audience would love that.
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:38.240]   This is one of my favorite science.
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.240]   For me, Veronica, in the beaver suit.
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.240]   Oh, I like that.
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:44.240]   So we've been saying, "Will you come and be in the beaver suit?"
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:47.240]   You're saying when he does tech beaver, he wears a beaver suit?
[01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.240]   Yeah, he does.
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:50.240]   Oh, geez, Louise.
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:52.240]   It's weird.
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.240]   I want to plug a book here.
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:59.240]   Peter F. Hamilton, if you ever read any of his stuff, if you like sci-fi, you will love
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:00.240]   his stuff.
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:06.240]   Pandora's Star and it's sequel, Judas Unchained are now out on Audible and you can get them
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:07.240]   free.
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:11.240]   I'm talking 37 hours and 22 minutes for Pandora's Star.
[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:15.240]   And I think Judas Unchained, yeah, it's 40 hours, even longer than 50.
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:20.240]   So we're talking right now free, 70 plus hours of reading.
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:23.240]   If you've got a long commute, this is the best solution.
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:27.240]   Also, check it out at Audible.com, the best of 2010, the editors, picks and customer
[01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:28.240]   favorites.
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.320]   These are the best audiobooks of the year.
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:35.240]   The hard part with Audible, just limiting yourself to two books a month, but that's what I'm going
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:36.240]   to make you do.
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:38.800]   Go to Audible.com/twit2, at least they're free.
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.000]   Pick your first two books.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   Listen, and I think you will find that Audible is just a great way to read in our busy lives.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:52.320]   Whenever you're in the car, at the gym, doing housework, on your iPod, your iPhone, your
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:57.640]   Android phone, on your Kindle, pretty much any device you can listen to great performances.
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:58.720]   And that's what's really key.
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:00.600]   These aren't some dry reader.
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:01.600]   These are performances.
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:04.840]   I want to hear there's a new Terry Pratchett book.
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:06.960]   Terry Pratchett is the best, by the way.
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:07.960]   He's amazing.
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:08.960]   Yeah.
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:09.960]   I show where midnight.
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:11.440]   Let's just, I just want to Steven Briggs reads this.
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:15.200]   I'm just going to play a little bit of this just to give you a sense of the performance
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:20.440]   of geological outcropped themselves, even if this one was mostly covered in grass and
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:23.120]   the grass was mostly covered in sheep.
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:27.440]   And today, the sheep on the downs were left by themselves to do whatever it was that they
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:32.000]   did when they were by themselves, which would presumably be pretty much the same as they
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.120]   did if you were watching them.
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:37.400]   And the sheep usually fussed and heard it and generally watched over.
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:40.240]   I have to tell you, Steven Briggs reads a lot of these Terry Pratchett books.
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:44.620]   You can almost all of them are unaudible and boy, he's, I'm now, you know, that's the
[01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:46.160]   voice of Terry Pratchett to me in my hand.
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:47.880]   I've read all the books, but I've never listened to them.
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:48.880]   You've got to listen to them.
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:49.880]   It's an entirely different experience.
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:51.880]   It's funny when you're driving along and chuckling.
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:56.600]   People look over and go, uh, don't look now, but he's laughing.
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:58.920]   Audible.com/twit2 get your two free books.
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:01.880]   Please don't waste any time.
[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:02.880]   Get them today.
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:06.040]   I'm sure you'll find a time to listen 400 plus books now.
[01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.760]   I'm listening to Keith Richards, autobiography right now.
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:10.480]   I got to try that sentence for the author.
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:11.480]   I've never read any of it.
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:12.480]   I've never read any of it.
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:14.440]   Oh, you would like, and you like hard sci-fi.
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:15.440]   Yeah.
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:16.440]   You like scientific.
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:19.480]   Yeah, you, you would love, start with a fallen dragon.
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:20.480]   Okay.
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:22.080]   That's one volume because the other stuff is like three of them.
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:23.080]   Fallen dragon.
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:24.080]   Awesome.
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:25.080]   Awesome.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:30.760]   By the way, a meck man is saying when sheep, when humans aren't around sheep play pool.
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:32.520]   So I didn't know that.
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:35.120]   Who gave them the pool table?
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.120]   That's what I wanted.
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:37.120]   I don't know.
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:38.120]   Uh, let's see.
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:42.440]   What other stories are in the news today checking the Google Docs?
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:49.160]   Yes, a Japanese woman so incensed by Google Street View showing her private items on the
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:51.040]   washing line.
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:54.600]   She's suing Google.
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:56.400]   She says I was overwhelmed with anxiety.
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:09:02.840]   Well, I remember this is in Japan where the sale of, of underwear is, is very, you know,
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:03.840]   prolific.
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:06.680]   Oh, you know, you know, you buy.
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:07.680]   You're not interested in that.
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:12.600]   You mean the underwear purchases per capita are far higher than any other nation.
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:13.600]   Far higher than any other nation.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:14.600]   Of the name of the developed world?
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:15.600]   Absolutely.
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:19.160]   Super well with anxiety that I might be the target of a sex crime.
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:20.920]   It caused me to lose my job.
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:23.320]   I had to move.
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:25.480]   I had to move.
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:29.880]   Could you make the argument that the people around her could already see those underwear
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:34.120]   and may have still wanted to commit sex crimes against her?
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:35.120]   That's a good point.
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:41.240]   And if they're facing the street, anybody who walked by could see the more drove by could
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.360]   see them, right?
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:44.360]   She should move to Germany.
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:45.960]   Then she just blur it out.
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:53.720]   It's a little part for me to this story was that she was, she was suing and demanding
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:57.720]   a grand total of $7,000.
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:59.640]   What about the naked guy in the trunk?
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:03.160]   Why isn't he suing?
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:06.920]   Maybe she should just sue for some new underwear and call it even.
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:08.880]   Okay.
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:13.200]   So I'm told down by somebody who's actually been to Japan that they do not in fact have
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:14.640]   vending machines for panties.
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:17.000]   I thought they did.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.800]   It's an urban legend.
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:24.960]   How does that person know that you know laterally there may be somewhere they do?
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:25.960]   Yeah.
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:26.960]   There are some where they do.
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:27.960]   Yeah.
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:28.960]   Somewhere undergarments.
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:32.960]   Apple says we're going to open our Mac App Store January 6th.
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:39.760]   Prices will range from free to $15 for some of the Apple iWork apps.
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:42.680]   Is this a complete change in the way we buy computing software?
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:46.480]   What's the difference between that and download.com?
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:47.480]   See net sight.
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:48.480]   Thank you.
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:49.480]   That's right.
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:52.600]   I think there's a difference from the point of view of the software publisher because basically
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:55.760]   you have to get Apple's approval to get in the store, but then you get publicized by
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:56.760]   Apple.
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:00.000]   Apple takes 30%, but they handle the whole transaction.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.320]   They do all the downloading, all the bandwidth is theirs.
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.280]   So it is a smoother transaction.
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:11.520]   And I think if you're a software developer, your hope could be fear is that pretty soon
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:14.440]   that's how everybody's going to buy their software.
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:17.080]   So you have to be in it just as you have to be in it on the iPhone.
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:18.080]   No way.
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:22.000]   This is like digital rivers, this company that does this online where they you know you
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   can buy some Antex Norton products, you can buy all this stuff.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.080]   I can see where it makes sense in a closed environment with a new operating system, but
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:33.840]   this is like saying I'm Intel and I'm going to build the app store for netbooks, which
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.760]   they tried to do by the way.
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:37.880]   And I don't know anybody who uses it.
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:40.000]   It is basically a download.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.160]   It's two cows.
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.160]   It's download.com.
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:43.160]   So it's not a big deal.
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:44.880]   I don't think it is.
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:52.440]   And this just in here's video of a panty vending machine.
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:53.440]   In Japan.
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:54.440]   Okay.
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:57.720]   It was kind of a travel log.
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:00.440]   I don't know what is doing out in the woods or out of the field.
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:01.440]   I don't know.
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:08.040]   Maybe maybe the vending machine is is zoom in 24 hour panty vending machine.
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:09.040]   That's the translation.
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:10.040]   All right.
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:11.040]   I'm sorry.
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.040]   I brought up.
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:14.320]   I apologize to everyone.
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:15.320]   Please accept.
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:16.320]   Wait a minute.
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.960]   No, there really is a you know, you often need panties after working the field.
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:21.040]   Look at that 3000 yen.
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.960]   That's exactly how much that woman was asking for.
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:26.760]   You could always just carry a diaper bag.
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.240]   How many of you show me?
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:29.240]   I really do a new mommy.
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:30.240]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.240]   New mommy.
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:32.880]   I'm a new mom.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:36.280]   So anybody seen Tron yet Tron legacy?
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:37.280]   Anybody show hands?
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:38.280]   No.
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:40.800]   No, no, you got you got better things to do Natalie.
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:43.000]   Marshall we're counting on Mr. neck beard.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.680]   Have you seen?
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:47.040]   No personal grooming.
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:51.480]   That takes all my free time.
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:53.320]   Then unable to go and watch it.
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:55.480]   So the reviews are mixed.
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:58.840]   Some people say it's not a great movie, but the video effects special effects are great.
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:01.360]   Apparently you should see it on iMacs 3D.
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.080]   That's what everybody agrees.
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:05.080]   I don't know.
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:10.920]   Okay, I just sounds like our review is it is unmoving and and insufficiently compelling
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:11.920]   to go and watch.
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:14.880]   Well, you know, what are the guys that we work with who's a does a lot of comic book stuff
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:18.480]   went and went to the midnight show Thursday came back and it was the most amazing thing
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:19.880]   ever and then everyone would love it.
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:21.200]   But this is the same guy.
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:22.960]   He said the same thing about Scott Pilgrim.
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:23.960]   Oh dear.
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:26.000]   I don't trust him at all then.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.240]   For the comic book fans, absolutely you should go see it.
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:32.480]   But is this a movie that's going to be at the same level of say Wally?
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:33.480]   I doubt it.
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:40.280]   So, you know, I got those Gunner Tron inspired 3D glasses and I think it's so funny that
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:45.560]   the movie studio that glass manufacturers are now selling you 3D glasses that you'll
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:47.280]   just keep with you your own personal ones.
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:49.520]   You don't have to use the loners.
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:52.920]   Yeah, because who wants you know, I don't know if I want to watch somebody else.
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:56.240]   Do they disinfect those in between showings?
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:57.240]   I think so.
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:59.040]   That's why they're wrapped in plastic, right?
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:00.640]   Oh, they're wrapped in plastic at your theater?
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:02.320]   Yeah, yeah, they're wrapped in plastic.
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:03.520]   Oh, yeah, sure.
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:05.440]   Sanitized for your protection.
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:10.200]   I believe that.
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:14.960]   They give them the plastic wrapping machine, but not the dishwashing sanitizing machine.
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:20.160]   Perhaps I always bring a vat of acid to dip mine in before I put them on research from
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:22.520]   researchers from Harvard.
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:28.240]   I've collaborated with Google to analyze the massive library of digitized books in the
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:30.800]   Google Books collection.
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.480]   Why?
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:40.120]   Because they're trying to figure out the half life of a celebrity among other things.
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:46.040]   Starting with books that come out in the year 1500, going all the way up to modern books,
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:53.720]   about 1.4 billion words a year, actually by 2000, it's 8 billion words a year.
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:59.360]   They performed a data analysis looking for what they called engrams, short phrases of
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:01.680]   up to five words.
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:07.040]   The procedure allows them to detect trends in the US, the frequency of the word slavery,
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:10.640]   for instance, peak during the Civil War, that's what you'd expect, but then had a resurgence
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:13.000]   during the Civil Rights Movement in the 60s.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.920]   That's also kind of what you'd expect.
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:20.240]   They call it their culture realm, like a genome.
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:23.000]   It's a culture realm.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:32.320]   For instance, you could see here the popularity of various foods, steak, sausage, ice cream,
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:38.400]   hamburger, pizza, pasta, and sushi, ice cream peaking in 1950, going through a downtrend
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:39.400]   in 1960.
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:43.800]   But it's back on top in the year 2000, baby.
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:46.560]   Pizza really taken off from 1950 on.
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:50.120]   You know, Marshall, this is what they're doing instead of funding investigative journalism.
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:51.120]   Yeah.
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:52.640]   So this is really cool, actually.
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:55.040]   I spent a lot of time with this.
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:58.920]   You know, carrots versus celery is a fascinating one.
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:02.560]   Celery, I thought it was pulling away into the lead and carrot came right on back.
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:04.120]   Carrot comes right on back, baby.
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:06.760]   This is like one of those races at the ball game.
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:11.600]   You know, between the innings, carrots, and grams, Google Labs.com.
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:13.920]   So give us some sample searches.
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:19.720]   Here's one for punk rock and rock and roll cocaine, heroin, marijuana, methamphetamine
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:22.320]   as an interesting one.
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:26.880]   Cocaine, marriage, you want to take the big leap in the air.
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:28.880]   In and this one.
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:34.320]   I just want all this Huxley, Timothy Leary.
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:35.320]   Look at that.
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:36.320]   Look at that.
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:40.760]   Cocaine just taking off in the 90s, but plummeting now.
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:41.760]   But it's in books.
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:43.240]   It's not on the web, right?
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:44.240]   This is books.
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:47.040]   Well, because the web started in 1980.
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:51.760]   Yeah, but the website.com does does this for, you know, I think more relevant way.
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:52.760]   The psychos.
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:55.920]   Yeah, but that's only in the last, you know, 15 years that the web's been around.
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:59.600]   This is this goes back to 1800.
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:02.680]   Racism classes, sexism and homophobia is a fun one.
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:03.680]   Okay.
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:04.680]   I'm not going to type that in.
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:05.680]   Maybe it's a towner.
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:06.680]   Too many letters.
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:07.680]   I mean, hours of fun.
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:10.840]   Yeah, you're coming up with all the ones that are depressing me.
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:12.000]   Well, give us one.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.000]   Okay.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.400]   Here are unicorns and mermaids.
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:17.840]   I did unicorns, mermaids and angels.
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:21.360]   Yeah, hobbits and unicorns.
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:22.360]   Oh, unicorns.
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:24.280]   Angels have been coming down.
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:26.840]   They do skew the result, don't they?
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:29.360]   Angels are so powerful that they ruin it.
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:33.800]   But look at here's unicorns in blue mermaids in red mermaids really just taking off.
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.400]   How about baseball, football and hockey?
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:36.400]   I did that one.
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:37.400]   Yeah.
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:39.600]   And see looking and football still ahead.
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:41.200]   Although baseball catching up.
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:42.200]   Marshall, you're right.
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:43.400]   This is hours of fun.
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:44.400]   Yeah.
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:48.200]   Radio television, newspapers, magazines, stuff like that.
[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:53.960]   Radio took a big jump around World War II and internet is still just a tiny blip at the
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:58.880]   very end of the graph when you compare it to other mediums.
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:17:59.880]   Interesting.
[01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:00.880]   Is it as big?
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:01.880]   No, it's this is that's the yellow one.
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:03.120]   It's the little one down here at the bottom.
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:04.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:06.120]   The internet is where it's at.
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:10.040]   But character and celery are still way bigger.
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:12.440]   I did cats, dogs and ferrets.
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:13.440]   Yeah.
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.040]   And dogs are clearly the leader.
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:17.440]   Ferrets never really got off the ground.
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:20.520]   They had a little bump back in 1810.
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:21.920]   Here's celery versus broccoli.
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:22.920]   Wow.
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:29.080]   You really can you really it is hours of fun Marshall and grams that Google labs.com.
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:33.000]   Thanks to you know, just a search for groovy is a fun one.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.520]   Like how oh yeah, you could just do one word.
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:35.520]   You don't have to do.
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:36.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:39.040]   Groovy has really gone through peaks and valleys.
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:41.040]   It's on the.
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:42.040]   It's on the.
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:47.800]   It's Hobbits and wizards and yeah, wizards went out through the test of time.
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:53.120]   Leo, I think we need to discuss a spinoff show on this theme this weekend in engram.
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:56.040]   Well, we've been looking as we can engrams twin.
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:19:00.880]   We've been looking for a game show and I think this could be the basis of a game show.
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:03.360]   Like you you predict what the trends are something like that.
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:04.800]   I did news sports and weather.
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:05.800]   Yeah.
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:06.800]   Yep.
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:07.800]   And news is still on top.
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:11.200]   But but but what's coming up is climbing up and the other is going down.
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:13.400]   Nobody cares about the weather books on the weather.
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:16.520]   Not as interesting now that we actually have modern weather forecasting.
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:20.520]   You do you do have a you do have a point Natalie that it's it's just books.
[01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:22.000]   So I don't know.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.800]   Maybe if you did newspapers that would be a little bit more topic better for topical
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:26.800]   subjects.
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:27.800]   Yeah.
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:28.800]   That kind of thing.
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:29.800]   Have you ever done a Google fight Google fight.com.
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:30.800]   Yeah.
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:31.800]   Little search the internet.
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:32.800]   Yeah.
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:33.800]   That's that's fun.
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:34.800]   One, two.
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:38.480]   I used to do it until I lost big time to just be heard.
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:41.120]   Oh, no, there's a lot of people I lose to.
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:42.560]   Let's do let's do you and me.
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:43.560]   What do you say kid?
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:48.600]   Oh, well, it depends if you use my new name, then I'm not going to have that much.
[01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:51.920]   Is this is this the site you recommend?
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:52.920]   Google fight.
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:53.920]   Yeah.
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:54.920]   Okay.
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:57.920]   So Natalie, I'll do Del Connie.
[01:19:57.920 --> 01:19:59.400]   You're still going to win.
[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:01.280]   I will not do Devorak and Laport.
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:02.280]   Oh, good.
[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:03.280]   All right.
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:06.240]   Let's let's over the years he's coming on strong fight.
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:07.240]   Here they are.
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:08.240]   They're fighting it out.
[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:09.240]   It's all right.
[01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:12.800]   It's all right to the body at the winner is Natalie Del Connie.
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:14.560]   Look at that.
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:15.560]   Jesus.
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:16.560]   Crikey.
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:17.560]   All right.
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.040]   Let's put let's put somebody I can beat in there.
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.720]   John C. Devorak.
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:23.080]   And they're fighting.
[01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:24.480]   I know this is such an old site.
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:27.520]   I can't believe we're actually doing this, but what the hell?
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:28.520]   What's that?
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:29.520]   All right.
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:30.520]   And bye bye, John.
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:31.520]   Bye bye.
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:32.520]   You win.
[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:35.320]   Hey, let's do iPhone versus Android.
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:40.160]   Oh, now we're making a little more topical, aren't we?
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:42.680]   But Android means a lot more than just the.
[01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:44.640]   Well, what would you suggest?
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:47.080]   Let's do Julian Assange and Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:48.080]   Okay.
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:49.080]   There you go.
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:51.080]   This is what Time Magazine should have done.
[01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:52.080]   There you go.
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:53.080]   Zuckerberg Assange.
[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:55.080]   I don't think they cared about numbers.
[01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:57.240]   I think that was that was proven by the way.
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:21:01.280]   We used to use this to do our magazine covers at PCMag.
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:02.520]   Whoa.
[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.520]   Assange be winner of Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:06.080]   Actually, we didn't do that, but we should have.
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:07.080]   You should have.
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:08.080]   Well, there you go.
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:10.280]   Windows versus Mac.
[01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:12.600]   Natalie Delaconti at CBS.
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:14.360]   She's looted, man.
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:15.360]   Yes.
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:17.320]   What is the website for that?
[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:18.320]   CNET.com/loaded.
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:22.320]   And what do you talk about on CNET.com/loaded?
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:24.160]   It's just your daily tech news wrap up.
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:26.960]   It's like daily little tiny mini twits.
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:30.160]   So it's about three minutes a day of what's new and what's going on.
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.960]   So you do that five days a week?
[01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:32.960]   I do.
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:34.320]   Fifteen minutes worth of news.
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.880]   And it takes me three hours to do all of that.
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:37.880]   Well, yeah.
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:38.880]   You're so much more efficient.
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:39.880]   Keep it tight.
[01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:41.840]   So much more efficient than I am.
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:44.360]   And Miles is thriving.
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:45.360]   He's doing well.
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:46.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.360]   He slept the whole time.
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:48.360]   The whole time.
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:49.360]   Oh, what a sweet boy.
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:50.360]   I see the Christmas tree.
[01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:51.360]   That giant present.
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:53.240]   Is that for him or is that for you?
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:54.240]   It is actually.
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:56.240]   That's a it's an exercise there.
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:57.240]   But don't tell him.
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:59.040]   How old is he?
[01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:00.760]   He's four and a half months.
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:03.680]   I think that he with the secret is safe.
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:04.680]   Yeah.
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:05.680]   Does he still believe in Santa?
[01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:10.880]   Oh, see, that's the argument in my household is because I don't want to lie to him and
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:12.600]   and you're not one of those.
[01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:13.600]   Sorry.
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:14.840]   Yeah, you don't want to lie to him.
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:15.840]   What do you mean?
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:17.520]   I'm like, we got lied to our child.
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:19.800]   And he's like, it's an important part of tradition.
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:21.480]   It's not a lie.
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:22.480]   I'm the Scrooge.
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:23.480]   Yeah.
[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:24.480]   It's not a lie.
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:25.920]   It's like saying the giants are better than the Phillies.
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:28.160]   It's just it's just a fact.
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:29.160]   Well, that's true.
[01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:31.520]   We'll go to the wiggly leaks of Christmas.
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:32.520]   There you go.
[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:33.520]   She's all for transparency.
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:35.000]   She's all for transparency.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.160]   Don't let my kid on Wikipedia.
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:38.160]   He'll know.
[01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:39.400]   He'll know he's been lied to.
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:40.840]   You know what my wife says?
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:44.920]   She says, well, you get to choose whether you believe in Santa or not.
[01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:50.280]   But if you believe in him, you get presents.
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:55.120]   Last year on loaded, I said something about like, you know, Google the NORAD Santa track.
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:56.120]   I love that.
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:57.120]   Yeah.
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:58.480]   I said, I covered it unloaded.
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:01.800]   And I was like, that is, if you believe in Santa, which of course we all know, you know,
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:02.800]   I said something like that.
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:05.520]   And so many people are like, I watched that with my kids.
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:07.520]   What's wrong with you?
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:09.320]   What's wrong with you?
[01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:10.320]   I've been friends.
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:15.800]   Santa is real and we can tell because you know, look at with the federal government,
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:21.040]   spend millions of dollars tracking Santa if you weren't real.
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:24.120]   How do you know they spend millions of dollars, by the way?
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:25.720]   Did you read that on WikiLeaks?
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:26.720]   What?
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:27.720]   Yes.
[01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:28.720]   The Santa tracker.
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:31.920]   Santa tracker is real and Santa don't WikiLeaks.
[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:34.040]   Jim Latterback CEO of revision three.
[01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:35.040]   What's your newest show?
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:36.040]   Give me a plug.
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:38.640]   newest show that let's see.
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:42.320]   We just launched death battle, which is.
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:45.520]   It was only a matter of time.
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.880]   It's a it's a bad we're doing it with the guys at screw attack.
[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:52.920]   And it is a battle between two video game characters.
[01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:56.240]   The first one being Sheamus from Metroid.
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:58.400]   And wait, I got to remember the other one.
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.400]   That sounds pretty cool.
[01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:00.400]   It is kind of fun.
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:01.400]   We've got it.
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:03.160]   It doesn't sound like it has a long life though.
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:05.880]   I mean, do they battle every time?
[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:07.080]   It's just fun.
[01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:10.120]   I mean, how many how many episodes can you do?
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:11.120]   Is it?
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:12.720]   How many you can do lots?
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:13.720]   It's different.
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:14.720]   Is it different people each time?
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:15.720]   It's different people each time.
[01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:18.120]   Oh, I was going to say if it's always the same two people, that wouldn't be very.
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:19.120]   Right.
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.120]   Exactly.
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:21.120]   So it's two different.
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:23.360]   It's Sheamus versus Boba Fett.
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:25.120]   I'd always like to see those guys go.
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:26.120]   Who would win?
[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:27.120]   Smack each other down.
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:28.120]   Who would win in a death battle?
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:29.120]   You have to watch the show.
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:30.120]   There you go.
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:31.120]   Death Battle.
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:32.120]   To find out.
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:33.120]   Revision3.com/deathbattle.
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:36.960]   And I will say one thing for you, Natalie, you know, it's there are a lot of big events
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:39.320]   coming up in your child's life.
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:41.880]   First time they walk, first time they say mama.
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:45.040]   My son's 11 just had a major event this week actually yesterday.
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:46.040]   What?
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:47.040]   What did Sam?
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:48.040]   What happened to Sam?
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:49.040]   He posted his first YouTube video.
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:50.040]   Wow.
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:51.040]   And what is it about?
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:52.040]   I'm so proud.
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:53.040]   I actually was really proud.
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:54.040]   It was great.
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:59.040]   It's about a particular glitch on Halo Reach.
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:00.040]   Wow.
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:02.040]   How do you get?
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:03.040]   Yeah.
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:04.040]   Wow.
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:05.720]   So lots of lots of big moments coming up in your child's life.
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:10.600]   One of them will be when they post on YouTube and given, you know, probably without your
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:11.600]   permission.
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:12.600]   But when they do it, it'll happen.
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:13.600]   It'll happen.
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:14.600]   It'll be very useful.
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:16.800]   Well, Miles is on YouTube, but all of his videos are unlisted.
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:17.800]   Right.
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:21.240]   He's rolling over, which he does expertly now.
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:25.320]   If David after Dennis, if that guy had figured out how to do it, I'd be at a lot of money
[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:26.320]   now.
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:29.480]   You should post a public public.
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:31.640]   You know what?
[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:33.080]   They're going to do it anyway.
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:34.560]   My feeling is they're going to do it anyway.
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:35.680]   They might as well do it with you.
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:38.880]   I was thinking about that today because my kids are now growing Abby's back from college
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:41.240]   and Henry's, you know, it's off at a ski thing.
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:42.320]   He's 16.
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:46.560]   And I realized that the best I wish I'd I'm going to give you this advice Natalie.
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:51.120]   And I wish I had known this when I was, you know, at your stage in life, just act like
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:54.240]   every day is the last time you're going to see him.
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:55.240]   Because eventually it's true.
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:56.240]   I know.
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:26:01.320]   I'm not going to comment when I when I tweeted someone's too cool to wear the baby Bjorn and
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:03.640]   you wrote back on Google buzz.
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:05.880]   Tell them to wear it because I would still wear my kids.
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:06.880]   I would.
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:08.680]   And it doesn't last.
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:09.680]   You cannot wear that thing.
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:10.760]   It's not going to last long.
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:11.760]   It's over.
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:16.040]   I still have, you know, until my credit card, I was wearing a baby Bjorn when I posed for
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:22.160]   the Bank of America and some of them that they've been using the same picture now for
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:23.160]   16 years.
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:25.160]   But on some of them, you can just see the top of Henry's head.
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:28.400]   I remember when I remember when you had that baby.
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:31.200]   Yeah, I know they're all grown now.
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:35.040]   So enjoy it Natalie as if you know, you don't know it's got long.
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:36.040]   It's going to last.
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:39.080]   Oh, on the other hand, it'll be over before too long.
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:40.600]   Well, thank goodness.
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:43.240]   Or the thing is the all start coming back to live at home.
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:45.240]   I'm very grateful for my.
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:50.040]   Marshall Kilpatrick someday you will mate and have children.
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:52.040]   We assume it's possible.
[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:54.240]   I don't know how my wife feels about that.
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:56.440]   I'm just teasing you.
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:59.960]   Oh, wow.
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:01.080]   It's really great to talk to you.
[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:02.280]   Thank you, Marshall, for joining us.
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:03.280]   We really appreciate it.
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:06.240]   Marshall is at read write web.com.
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:08.000]   Any plugs you'd like to put out?
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:13.400]   Oh, it's a 24 hour nerdathon over at Read Write Web and we invite you to come and contribute
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:16.080]   your nerdly habits.
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:21.400]   Plus, don't forget speaking of WikiLeaks, go check out Glenn Greenwald's coverage on
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:26.120]   Salon of Bradley Manning, the young guy.
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:27.640]   The private, privately living.
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:30.400]   Yeah, really not what you would expect.
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:31.840]   Oh, interesting.
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:37.520]   Really good coverage, very explicitly dissident stuff on his part.
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:41.120]   He wasn't a bandl when he released that.
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:42.600]   He knew what he was doing in other words.
[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:44.600]   He was political.
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:45.600]   Yep.
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:46.600]   Very interesting.
[01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:47.600]   By a lot of--
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:50.600]   He's been in the can for six months now in solitary.
[01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:51.600]   Wow.
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:54.160]   No conviction.
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:55.400]   But is there a trial going on?
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:57.000]   What's the status?
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.600]   Oh, I think he's awaiting trial still.
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:00.600]   Okay.
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:01.600]   Okay.
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:02.600]   Very interesting.
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:03.600]   Yeah, it really is.
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:05.400]   Marshall Greenwald's doing great.
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:06.400]   Thanks very much for having me on.
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:07.400]   We really appreciate it.
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:08.400]   So great.
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:09.400]   We'll have you back very soon.
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:10.400]   Very soon.
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:11.400]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:12.840]   A couple of reminders.
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:15.600]   First of all, this is the last tweet of 2010.
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:18.120]   We're going to do a best of next week.
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:21.160]   And all of you voted for your best clips from the past year.
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:23.520]   Some very good stuff in the best of.
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:29.360]   Also, Christmas Eve will release our holiday special featuring Jonathan Hodgeman, Jonathan
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:31.520]   Colton and Sam and Dave.
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:32.520]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:33.520]   Paul and Storm.
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:34.520]   We couldn't get Sam and Dave.
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:35.520]   So we got Paul and Storm.
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:38.000]   That's coming up at Christmas Eve.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:44.280]   And Tom Merritt and I hosted and there were several bottles of Jaeger consumed during
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:45.920]   the making of that.
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:47.240]   So that was a lot of fun.
[01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:48.240]   Wow.
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:49.240]   It's right.
[01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:50.240]   Jaeger, my sternie.
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:51.240]   That's a blast from the past.
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:52.240]   Yeah.
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:55.160]   Well, Storm was drinking it and so we ran out and got some of our own.
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:56.320]   To do a Jaeger lose?
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:57.320]   Yeah.
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:00.320]   Our coverage of CES starts January 5th.
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:07.640]   We're taking a whole team out there, Tom Merritt, Sarah Lane and Brian Brushwood as well as myself
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:10.280]   will be out there covering CES wall to wall.
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:14.160]   So if you can't get to the Consumer Electronics Show, our coverage starts January 5th.
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:16.480]   We have a big booth there and all set up.
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:20.840]   We've got two live views to a stream and I think the Daily Gizwiz will be there.
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:23.400]   A lot of our hosts will be out there as a matter of fact.
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:24.400]   So that should be a lot of fun.
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:26.640]   Starting January 5th at live.twit.tv.
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:28.280]   It's yes, that time again.
[01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:30.000]   Hard to believe the Consumer Electronics Show is back.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.400]   Are you going to get to skip it this year?
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:32.400]   Oh, no, I'm going.
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:33.400]   I'm out Wednesday to Saturday.
[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:34.400]   Come by.
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:35.400]   I will.
[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:36.400]   We'll be doing Twitter on Saturday afternoon.
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:37.400]   Please come on.
[01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:38.400]   Everybody for joining us.
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:39.400]   We'll see you next time.
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:40.400]   Another Twit.
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:41.400]   And we'll see you next year.
[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:43.400]   Another Twit is in the can.
[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:47.800]   I thought about it, you know, like, oh, people will know me as this name.
[01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:49.360]   But you know, people are following your career.
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:51.720]   How easy is it to just say that's not her name anymore?
[01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:53.320]   A name is easy to remember.
[01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:54.680]   I don't think it's such a big deal.
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:58.720]   But Natalie, how come NatalieMoris.com resolved to Natalie Del Conti.
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:29:59.720]   That's where it's going.
[01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:01.720]   Yeah, because I just started it over.
[01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:03.720]   The Internet has a long memory.
[01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:04.720]   That's what.
[01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:09.720]   Long memory.
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:11.720]   That's what.
[01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:12.720]   Let's go round.
