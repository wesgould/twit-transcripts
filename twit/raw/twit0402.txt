[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   What a week this has been. Unbelievable. Let me, before we get into it, introduce our panel.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   And we'll start all the way, Chad, all the way to the left with Jason Hiner, techrepublic.com. Jason, great to have you back.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Hey, always great to be here, Leo.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   From Louisville, right? Or is it Knoxville?
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Oh, excellent. Louisville, Kentucky. You even said Louisville, not Louisville.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Louisville. Louisville. I also say Balmer.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Excellent. Excellent.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Nice to have you, Jason.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   I say that once in a while, too.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Louisville. I learned that when I went to Louisville.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And you know, they have a giant bat in front of the Louisville Slugger place. And I got a bat.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Oh, yeah. And he said, no, if you're going to use this bat, you got to say it right. It's Louisville.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   I said, all right. That's really exciting. Now, John C. Dvorak is also here. He's actually texting at this point. He's so bored.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Yes, that's true. I see you found a... Now, is this a Bordeaux? It says Poliac. Poliac. Poliac. Poliac. Is that a Bordeaux? No.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   You know it is.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Okay, it is. Haute de Pont-Tay-Canay.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Yeah, it's the second wine from these guys.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Is it good?
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   It's not as good as the first wine is. Killer.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   You know, well, he gave us a couple of bottles maybe today. It was from Dane Atkinson, the guy who started Squarespace.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And he's got a new company called Sumall.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   And he's bringing you wine.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   And he's bringing us wine. You know why? Because it was the eighth anniversary of Twit this week. Eight years ago, August... I'm sorry, April 17th, 2005.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   The very first Twit. We're now at episode 402. And you've been a part of it since the fourth or fifth episode.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Third.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Long time. So thank you. It's good to have you, John C. Dvorak. ChannelDvorak.com.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   I've heard this.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   No Agenda Show. TwiceWeekly.com.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   TwiceWeekly.com.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Also here from NSFW, and of course in charge of all scavenger hunts nationwide.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Sure. At the Go Game.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   At the Go Game. Mr. Justin Robert Young, who will now be on the Album Art because of your contribution this week on YouTube.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Finally. Yes. No. So I'll be on the NSFW Show Album Art. And by the way, me and Brian Brushwood, my co-host on NSFW, currently have the number one comedy album on iTunes.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   You know, I saw that. I was blown away. What's the name of it again?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Night Attack 2. Enjoy the Garden. It is the sequel to the album that we did about a year and a half ago.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   When you say comedy, what do you mean?
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Comedy is, I guess, loosely defined as me and Brian talking to each other, but people seem to like it and we've been really pleased by the reaction to it.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Why don't you work up some material?
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Look at this.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Which one is wearing the Mexican wrestler hat? That's me. That's you?
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   In a ill-fitting lucha libre mask with my hair spilling out.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   And that doesn't look like Brian with a mustache. Who is that?
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   That's Brian. Yeah, Brian with some...
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   With regular hair?
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   It's like a masquerade kind of top classes and mustache.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   True, the sequel to the world famous Night Attack 1.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Yeah, Night Attack 1 got up to number four on the billboard charts for comedy.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Did you call it Night Attack 1?
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   It was called just Night Attack.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Oh, because I thought that would be prescient if you didn't know that you were going to do another one.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   We were really like Babe Ruth calling our shot there. This is one of many.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Yeah, but so thank you to everybody who picked it up and if you like me and Brian braying at each other like animals, then go get them.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   $3.99, why not?
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   I mean, jeez.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Can we, Chad, let's prepare, Chad Johnson, our producers here, let's prepare a clip from that if you could find anything that has...
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Okay. I don't know if that's going to be possible.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   It's not good.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   That is not profane.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   It's going to be dirty.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Dirty?
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Yeah, dirty.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Dirty?
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Okay, you work dirty? Do you work blue?
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   We work blue, very blue, yeah.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   And you're wearing a t-shirt that says "Dragon has lasers."
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Oh, yeah, so my friend Andrew Main got me this. It's Elon Musk.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   He wrote a quote from one of the SpaceX press conferences he did where he was saying that the dragon has lasers doing the Dr. Evil.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   That is a geek shirt if I ever saw one.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Yeah, no, I'm a geek.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   And we're really pleased to welcome for the first time ever on this stage, Lauren Good of all things D. She's wondering why she's here right now.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   I forgot my Elon Musk t-shirt, unfortunately.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Oh, Lauren.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Lauren covers consumer gear for all things D. And we're so glad to have you.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   And as I told you before the show, you got a bunch of egos on this show, and that's just John.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Hey, you know, that's like a ripoff of the joke I told earlier that nobody obviously didn't get on this tape.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Yeah, that's how I do it.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   My joke was that it was a little different, but you said there's four egos.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Mine was better.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   No, no, it wasn't.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   I thought mine was anyway. Lauren, just jump right in anytime.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   It's just a cheap shot.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Not necessary for you to be polite in any way.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   So you're telling me there's a bunch of dudes with egos sitting around the roundtable here talking about tech.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Yeah, yeah, you never had anything ever experienced anything like that before.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   This be your first time doing that.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Hey, we should mention this in all seriousness.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   This was a hell of a horrible week.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Boy, with an amazing conclusion, I was glued to TV pretty much all the week long, and we have many friends and listeners and viewers in the Boston area.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   And we're just glad you made it out.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Most of you made it out.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   OK, what a story.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   And I'm not going to get into the politics of it because I know we could get John going on.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   We shouldn't be. We're not talking tech.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   And there was tech involved.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   You know, it's interesting that the police said there was no facial facial recognition software applied to hundreds of thousands of photographs.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Because, of course, the Boston Marathon, not only are there security cameras everywhere, but there's lots of photographers did not come up with that face, even though they had those faces in their databases in the Department of Motor Vehicles database.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   There was an FBI investigation. The older brother, they weren't able to come up with it.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   It was a human being looking at one video over and over 400 times that came up with the identity.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Makes you wonder.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Well, it's good news in some ways.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   I also read an article in Slate that said this is a reason why we should have more cameras in public.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   We haven't got enough.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Well, we got a ton of footage of what happened because we had video.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Why do we need more?
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Well, because everywhere should have them.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Not just down in Boston.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   The toilet and everything?
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   No, everywhere public.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   The Journal had a really good story yesterday morning that said that the US actually has met the quote unquote standard so far of London, which is, I think, been long considered to have the most surveillance of anywhere in the world.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   We're as bad as London.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   No, we're right up there.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   It's a very inexact number.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   We don't know exactly how many cameras there are, but we have the more advanced technology now.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   But like you said, it looks like the video recognition didn't even play into this.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   It was, but it was the video, but it was the video that was taken by those security cameras of these two guys very coolly walking up with their backpacks, putting them down, walking away in the video.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   They show the explosion.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   One of them was there, didn't even was no shock at all.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Knew it was going to happen that this was pretty damning this video, and it was because of security video.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   So I guess the question I'm asking is private.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Pardon me?
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Those are private cameras, though, right?
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Those are private cameras.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   They weren't, whereas in London, it's all public cameras.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   There's cameras everywhere on light pools and all kinds of public infrastructure.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   And that's because they're terrified of terror, right?
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   They've had bombs.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   And so this is a security.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   So what I'm saying is the guy who writes in Slate Right saying we need more cameras.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   This is a good thing.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   This is not a vision of privacy.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   You're in public.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   If this is valuable in preventing and detecting crime, shouldn't we have more?
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Well, there's two points here.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   There's either a should we be comfortable having these cameras around?
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   And I think at this point we have all take when we have so many cameras everywhere on our phones, like, you know, in private businesses.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   I think we have kind of agreed to sort of come to peace with the fact that we don't have privacy like that in a public space anymore.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   It just does not exist.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   But in terms of a municipal idea to go and put more city cameras there, I mean, I don't know where that stops, you know, before we can record every square inch of.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   And is there anything wrong with that?
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Wasted taxpayers money.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   That's the problem.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   I don't know how good of a solution that it is, especially when really what the cops are doing is just going around to all these places that are already recording things for their own private businesses and saying turn over the tapes,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   which is what Lord and Taylor did, I assume fairly happily.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   I don't know whether they put up a fight or anything, but it seems like that would be the more pressing or the better solution.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   What do you think, Jason?
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Well, the only thing is with that is is just from a security standpoint, not from a privacy standpoint, right, is that then all you have is the patchwork of all of these cameras that that just might happen to be here or there.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Whereas London, if you look at it, is a network where they've planned out.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Right.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Let's make sure we have one here and one there and so that we have coverage and we can check we're not going to miss something.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Whereas if we're relying on private ones, just like I said, taking the privacy argument out of it, just from a purely practical and planning standpoint, it's not as efficient or as accurate.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Right.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   To plan it that way or just rely on, OK, there's a bunch of private organizations out there that have these going.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Well, and who's going to watch all these cameras?
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Right.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   You're going to.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   I mean, I don't know what they do in England, but do they have thousands of police sitting watching these all day?
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Well, this is going to have to come into it soon.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Right.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   And these are the things are already working on where you take a once you know what this suspect is.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Now, first, there's the discovery.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   In this case, they knew there was a certain time period.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   I'm sure there were just a bunch of people looking during that time period to see what they could see and who they could find.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Once they did that and they could identify a face, you know, the future of video is search where you can take that face and then you put that in and you have algorithms searching to match that face with other like faces or description, you know, rough characteristics.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   And so we're not there yet, but that's where this is trending.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   The IRS this week said that we have the right IRS has the right to go through your email without a warrant in the process of looking for information about tax frauds.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Obviously, they would then feel like they have the right to look at every video.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   And yet I got to say, I don't feel like if you're in public, you have the right or expectation of anonymity, do you?
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   You're in public.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   You're walking down the street.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   I mean, the Constitution has no protection of privacy.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   It's not unconstitutional. Our chairman says unconstitutional.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   No, it's true.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   There's not there's no there's no one you're in public.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   It's not I agree.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   So you have cameras in the bathroom.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   But why not?
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   We'll fight that.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Why not?
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   That's where all the crime takes place in the nightclubs.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   Pro cameras out of the bathroom.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   I think that the public should be they should have cameras in the bathroom because that's where all the crime in the nightclubs takes place.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   People snort and coke and the rest of it doing deals in the bathrooms because they know it's safe there.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Put cameras there. I have a feeling that a lot of politicians are not going to like that.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Especially that's where they live.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Do deals.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   The old the old wide stance.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   We have a really cool.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   I don't know if you guys have a story.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Gizmodo had it and I think a couple other outlets had it as well about the thermal imaging technology that went into finding the bombing suspect.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Supposedly hiding out in the well.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Now, don't give me this no agenda thing, John.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   I don't want to hear you say this is all staged as a distraction.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   This didn't really happen.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   There's no way.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   If you listen to the last two no agenda shows.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Oh, no, no, no. Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   I'm just saying.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   I won't let you do it.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   That's ridiculous.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   This obviously happened.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   And there was a very clear.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   We know it happened, but we don't.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   We have no.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   We never saw the kid planting the thing in the garbage can.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   They had all these cameras everywhere.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Where was the they showed the kids standing there?
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Apparently that video exists.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   They haven't.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   OK, oh, man.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   Anyway, the thermal image we all saw, Lauren, of this kid.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   And it's amazing in the boat.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   He's under a tarp.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   You can see the outline of his body.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   What I find interesting is that every police department and every metropolitan area since 9/11 has been spending millions of dollars on this kind of technology in as part of its anti-terrorist efforts.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   Right.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   The fact that the Boston PD, I presume it was a Boston PD, had a helicopter with a forward looking thermal imaging in it is pretty impressive.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   I think it was state police.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Was it?
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Yeah, it was Massachusetts State Police.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   All right.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   They also had, of course, night vision, very expensive night vision goggles on those tax squad officers.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   Three hundred fifty million dollars to catch an 18 year old kid that was bleeding to death.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   OK, sounds good.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Well, terrorize the whole city of Boston, shut that baby down because his 18 year old menace to society is sleeping almost dying in some guy's boat in his backyard.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   But that's worth the money.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   That's worth the money.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   They didn't know that.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   They didn't know that.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   He was driving around with bombs and hand grenade.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Oh, bombs and grenades.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Sure he was.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   Homemade hand grenades.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   You've been talking to Adam Curry too often.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   I'm just saying, what homemade hand grenades did we see?
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Everybody saw it, they were throwing them out of the car and they shoot up.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Did you think it was worth the effort?
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   I mean, we needed 150 cops on the same street in gear and military gear, some machine guns to catch this one guy.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   Ten cops could have done the job.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   I think that there would be, if you were to take a opinion poll, yes, many people would think I hurt.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   And thank you.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   If you got hurt, a couple of cops got shot and one cop could have been shot by another cop for all we know.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   After that, nobody got hurt.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   They did the right thing.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   That shoot up was not predictable.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   But they did the right thing.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   I think that it's fine to use that much force.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   You do raise an interesting question because in effect, martial law was declared in Boston.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Yeah, and everybody went in hiding.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   And I don't know if people really use that phrase, but that's what happened.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   We had two kids killed in Richmond.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   I didn't see anybody going out of their way to do anything about that.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   We've seen many murders all over Oakland all year long.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   I don't see them shutting down the city and trying to capture any of these people.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   What about the Mexican gangs, the Mexican mafia?
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   These operations are terrorists.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   I don't see anybody going out of their way to put a stop to it.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   But meanwhile, they shut down Boston for one 18-year-old, 19-year-old kid who's bleeding to death.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   This whole thing is really suspicious.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Why do you think they did it, John?
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   I just don't, you know --
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Oh, God. Oh, God.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   No, no, no, he's right.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   We don't want to hear no agenda thesis.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   But if you're interested --
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   But we did predict it was going to happen by one day, by the way.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   On Show 500, we said on that -- because it's a six-week FBI cycle.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Every six weeks and next time is May 27th, they pull something like this.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   They?
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Yes, the FBI.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   The FBI.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   No, no, don't engage him.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   [Laughter]
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   If you're interested in this, noagendashow.com, there's a lot of this, and it's a very complicated issue, and I'm not going to weigh in on this at all.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Good.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   And besides --
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   I get chewed out for bringing this stuff up on the show.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   No, I have never chewed you out.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   No, no, by Adam.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   Oh.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   [Laughter]
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   What are you talking about no agenda stuff for on the show?
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   And besides, I do think there's a tech story.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   It was very interesting to watch the amount of technology that was used, the infrared cameras.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   It's surprising that face recognition wasn't very useful, but the fact that -- now, what about Reddit getting involved in this?
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   I would say to me the most fascinating tech angle on this was with the media, and not only if you looked at how much crap CNN got for their reporting, how much they were vilified on social media, yet a 194% increase in ratings for CNN over the time of this manhunt.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   That's when CNN kicks ass.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Yeah, but how does that compare to the other networks?
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   I'm sure -- I don't know.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   They were just -- they were barely below -- so they have been slipping, trending below MSNBC over the last two years.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   They jumped above MSNBC.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   They were barely behind Fox News in terms of overall ratings.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   They were huge considering where they had been over the last couple weeks.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   But yet, if you were to follow our bubble of humanity, the tech-centric peoples of the world, you would think that this was the biggest embarrassment in the history of the networks because of the dark-skinned male thing.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   The dark-skinned male thing from John King and just -- they were a clown show according to --
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   Everybody from Twitter to CNN to Reddit got something wrong.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   Yes.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   And unfortunately -- that's just the way it is now with the instantaneous news cycle and the rush to get stuff on the air.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   I think we're all learning now, you don't believe everything you hear.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   You don't believe everything you read.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   It wasn't --
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   What I thought was interesting on Reddit is that they very quickly formed a subreddit with those images and said, let's see if we can help the police track these guys down.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Now, they made mistakes.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Including fingering a guy who was a missing person from Brown University and then jumping up and down that they had got it right when somebody mentioned it on the police scanner.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   But then they corrected it.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   Sure. Yeah.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   I mean, to me all media is just trying to get information out in the best way that your medium allows you to do it.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   What's different now is that we get this stuff instantaneously.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   And the immediacy with which we can publish it before that whole process of working through things and speaking with sources and confirming and getting your facts straight, especially if you worked in print.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   I mean, that wasn't going to appear until a significant number of hours before the next morning anyway.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   Maybe with TV it was always a little bit more instantaneous.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   But yeah, now it's just you just hit send on Twitter and all of a sudden you're contributing to the conversation and there's a good chance you might be wrong.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   But now I think what's interesting is that 24-hour news networks find themselves in a very, very curious position because their great strength has always been being there first and being there constantly.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   That you can always go to a place where you are going to see people talking about this.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   And now, I mean, their great strength has never been accuracy.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   It's always been the fact that you can show visual images and that they're there first.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   Now, they're not good at either of those anymore.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   They're not the best at either of those.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   In fact, people kept telling me if you want to know what's going on, go to Twitter.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   I didn't watch a frame of 24-hour news networks, not because I like the commentary on it.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Well, wait a minute now.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   If you just criticized them and you said you didn't watch any of it, how do you know it wasn't any good?
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   No, no, I'm just saying I watched it.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   He's right.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   It was terrible.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   You're talking CNN or MSNBC, which is really bad.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Both were terrible.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   I ended up watching NBC because at least Brian Williams made some attempt to kind of not speculate randomly and wildly.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   But he didn't have 24 hours a day to fill either.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Sure.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   And Pete Williams did an amazing job.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   I feel bad for him.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   I feel bad for him.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   They were trying to do old school reporting.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   What was I thought very interesting was a lot of people were listening to police scanners.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Ustream was broadcasting the police scanner.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Twitter, there were a lot of people retweeting what they were saying on the scanners.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   And then at one point, Boston police said, please stop tweeting our scanner information.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   We're worried that the suspect may be watching.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   And not crazy because both the suspects had Twitter.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   The older one was tweeting after.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   I mean, tweeted at a Ted parody account, which just tells you how much of a Boston story this is.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   The perpetrator of this heinous act wrote fake story, replied fake story to a Ted parody account after this whole thing had happened.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   So it wasn't crazy they were looking at their Twitter.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   He's not convicted yet.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   So alleged perpetrator.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Alleged.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   Allegedly.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   Yes.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   The guy doesn't even have Miranda rights.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   I think we can call him guilty.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   But you might as well just put Hitler in office the way you're talking.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Did you see Erica Hill?
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   No, what did Erica Hill do?
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Now, Erica Hill is, of course, our friend. We worked with her at Tech News today.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   No, what was it called?
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   Tech Live.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   She was an anchor there.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   She was my news anchor at Tech TV on the call for help.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   Went on to fame and fortune.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   Started CNN.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   CNN.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   She was the anchor at CBS this morning.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   But where is she now?
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   Well, she got out of work.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   No, no.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   They got they changed again because CBS can't get anything right in the morning.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   For some reason, they get everything else is fine.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   She went to work for NBC.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   She was going to do the weekend today.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   But now they and this was like I feel bad for her because she ended up as a stand up outside with the mic, you know, yacking away on Sharpton's show.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   Oh, dear.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   That's on MSNBC.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   It's the guy who he yells the whole show.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   And he can't.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   The whole show is done like this.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   I don't know if he's deaf or what, but he does the whole show like this.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Sharpton's been yelling since the late 60s.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   It's the worst show in the world.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   And she so they poor.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   So they put Erica out on the street just before they rounded up these guys and cars are zooming by her and she almost gets hit.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   Oh, and it's like, oh, man, poor Erica.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   It was not it was not broadcast news.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Finest hour.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   It was pretty.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Was it social media's finest hour?
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   No, no.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   Was it reddits?
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   Somebody in the chat room said as a redditor, I think the best thing reddit did was send pizza to the police department in Boston.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   I'm for that.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   It was nobody's finest hour.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   You got to admire, though.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   I know you may not agree with me, John, but the police from all different districts who did, in fact, get the guy.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   They took him alive.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   It must have been a very scary thing knowing how long that last.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   Brother had a.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   Oh, so I'm just bringing it up.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Oh, man.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Let's move on.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   CNN really hurt their brand on this.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   I thought I think so, too.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   They went they went quicker to, you know, information than than really any of the others.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   And they were wrong.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   They made a lot of mistakes as a result.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   But even Brian Williams got a number of things wrong.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   And then they went and they were talking about how, yeah, and now the police are saying, you know, don't go stop reporting their stuff from the police scanners when they were the ones doing it just a minute ago.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   Right.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   And so don't you do it.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   We want to do it.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   But do you think that it would have been as egregious if CNN also hadn't gotten the Supreme Health Supreme Court health care ruling wrong, too?
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   I mean, this is now it seems like it's maybe it's not trend yet.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   She has a point.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Three times.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   But also, I.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   Yeah, well, I don't think I don't think they hurt their brand.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   I thought their brand was fading.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   That's why their ratings already.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   Well, it's true.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   All this was his confirmation.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   They did nothing to help it.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   But the real winners in this, I thought were actually some of the more local, local media.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   Right.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   Boston.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   HTH did great.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   A lot of the Boston.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   No, I got the Globes Twitter was was stellar.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   I thought that they were the Boston.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   The Globes Twitter was great.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   Can I just point out, though, that while all this is going on and we're all glued to this, CISPA passed the house.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   That was clever.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   Of course.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   Do you think they were there actually did that on purpose?
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   No, I think it was that was just when it was scheduled to be voted on.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   It's convenient, though.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   It's nice, though, that it was nice that they slipped it in.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   So CISPA.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   By the way, everybody is for this thing.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   I mean, no one's for it.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   I'm so shocked.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   Microsoft.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Everyone is on board with this thing.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   So what is CISPA?
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   Well, so we're a bunch of it's a fascist law.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   It's essentially combining corporations with the government, which is the corporatism, which is fascism in the in the traditional sense.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   And that's what now that's what we've got.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   I like the sharing word.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   By the way, as soon as you see that name, you know we're in trouble.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   Sharing.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   It would allow for the sharing of Internet traffic.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   I'm reading from Wikipedia.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   It would allow for the sharing of Internet traffic information between the U.S.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   government and technology and manufacturing companies in order to help the government investigate cyber threats and ensure the security.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   What's wrong with ensuring the security of networks against cyber attack?
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   That sounds like a good thing.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Sure.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   No, it sounds fantastic.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   I mean, again, it's it's all sounds good.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   Let's see who's for and against.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   So EFF, Electronic Frontier Foundation against ACLU against Fight for the Future against even libertarian and conservative groups like the Competitive Enterprise Institute, Tech Freedom, Freedom Works, Americans for Limited Government, Liberty Coalition and the American Conservative Union are against.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   Why would you say even in that sentence?
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   Well, it's the left and the right combined.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   As usual.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   But who's for it?
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Microsoft, Facebook, AT&T, IBM, Apple and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   Well, and these are all people that have stakes in the game that could theoretically benefit from draconian measures.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   Is this SOPA part two?
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   I think it's going to end up as SOPA part two.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   I think that you're going to see.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   So the point is not cybercrime.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   That's a red herring.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   The point is to stop piracy.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   I think it's just to stop crime.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   Crime, including piracy.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   I mean, the law enforcement agencies, especially at the highest levels in this country, since they've tried to put these eavesdropping systems in, which they ended up installing, are just looking for ways that they can stop crime before it happens.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   It's not like pre-crime, but actually spy on everybody.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   And then it makes your job easier.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   If you're working in law enforcement, you really don't like to do any work.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   You have to go out in the street with a gun.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   It could be dangerous.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   It's better to catch these things, nip them in the bud by spying on the entire U.S. population.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   So that's kind of what I've been thinking about was, OK, who's pushing this?
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   Who needs this?
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Right. That's what I was trying to untangle as I looked at this.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   And that's actually similar to what John said.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   I have to think it is law enforcement that wants to be able to do warrantless searches.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   Right. And that has to be who's pushing this.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   Why would Google and Microsoft support it, though?
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   That's what's curious.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   It seems to me like they would support it because it heats off them.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   Same with Facebook.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   I mean, there's a certain exemption of liability then on the part of the tech companies
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   when it's the government that is requesting access to this private information
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   as opposed to the big bad tech company that wants you to share everything.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   Let me correct myself, though.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Google did support an earlier version of this bill.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   They have not taken a position on the current version.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   They say they might need some work, but Microsoft, Facebook, AT&T and everybody else is.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   It's interesting because this passed the House a year ago.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   They couldn't get it through the Senate.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   In fact, President Obama said he would veto it.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   It passed last year, 248 to 168.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   Passed this week to 88 to 127, increased House support,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   despite the fact the president still says he'll veto it.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   Is he going to?
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   Well, I don't know.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   It might get killed in the Senate.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   It probably will get killed in the Senate.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   They couldn't get it through the Senate last year.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   The Senate has been killing everything.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   So, I mean, it's going to be...
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   They're killing it.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   I think it could be.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   The Senate, they're killing it.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   They could.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   No dog, you're killing it right now, Senate.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   Yeah, I guess so.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   I see you're being funny.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   I didn't get it.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   I get it now.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   That's good.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   That's great.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   Just to explain, Lauren, that John and I have worked together for many, many years.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   And I've never heard him do a bit like that ever.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   Anyway, what do we do?
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   Should we...
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   I mean, there's a lot of anti-Syspa websites.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   Should we...
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   Some have talked about another internet blackout as we do this stuff.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   Listen, I am not for Syspa.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   I'm not convinced of that.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   But, I mean, how many times are we going to change our avatars and...
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   I'm not changing mine.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   I went to the blue-green thing and I've stuck with that.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   Can I...
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   I'm still the red equals sign.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   Is it time to change?
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   I'm not sure.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   This is the kind of thing, though, that companies that are going to the cloud are really scared
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   of.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   Because what it means is if you have Google Apps or if you have Microsoft 365, Office 365,
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   and your data is there, and instead of you being subpoenaed for your data, for eDiscovery,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   and then you get to get your data together and submit it to the government, instead they're
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   going to go straight to Google.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   They're going to go straight to Office and they're going to get your data, your company
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   data, your customer data before you even know about it.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   So, this is...
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   So, you remember that Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook funded a new little political action committee
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   that Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft also supporting.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   It's called TechNet.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   This is the letter written by TechNet to the House committee that was drafting the bill.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   This is from Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Facebook.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   The bill recognizes the need for effective cybersecurity legislation.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   I'm for cybersecurity.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   Who isn't?
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   That encourages voluntary, not on your part, by the way, but on the part of the companies
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   with your information.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   Oh yeah, voluntary.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   Voluntary, bidirectional.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   You just like the word "buy."
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   I mean, it's steaming up in this bill.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   Real, voluntary, bidirectional, real-time sharing of actionable cyber threat information to protect
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   networks.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   If it's to protect networks...
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   Actionable.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   But voluntary, bidirectional, real-time...
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   Sounds like gobbledygooks.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   What did we just learn about voluntary, bidirectional, real-time information sharing on Twitter,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   Reddit, CNN, and MSNBC?
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   It sucks.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   It sounds like the way that somebody would solve a problem on Star Trek.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   Prone to error.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   Activate the bidirectional sharing.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Anon, of course...
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   Switching to B.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   Anonymous is calling for an Internet blackout tomorrow.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   #CispaBlackout.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   What is that supposed to mean?
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   What kind of a blackout?
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   You're going to stop using the net?
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   Well, what we did with Sopa, remember, a lot of sites went dark.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   This was something that Alexis Ohanian, founder of Reddit, created and was very effective.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   We didn't go dark, but we went black and white, which I thought was pretty effective that
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   day.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   Oh, the half-way thing.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   No.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   You were still protesting, but you weren't going to put yourself out of business.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   Well, I mean, the point was...
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   Let the money roll in.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   The point was to get the money continuing to roll in.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   We had meant information to share with our audience about...
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   I see.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   And really, I mean, the more important element of that was calling your Congress people,
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   educating yourself on the bill and making your voice heard.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   And that's what we should do now.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   Yes?
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   I don't know.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   That's what I did for Sopa.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Does the fight go now to the Senate?
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   I called my representatives.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Do you write your...
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   It goes now to the Senate, but a few people believe that it actually will pass in the Senate,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   but if it does, the White House has said it would veto it.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.800]   You've got, as you mentioned, the ACLU speaking out against it, saying that it's too extreme.
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:15.840]   The EFF, Electronic Frontier Foundation, saying that it grants these broad new powers and
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:16.840]   it's...
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:21.840]   They just hate it.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:22.960]   The front page of the...
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:26.280]   Let me go back to it, of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.280]   Shameful.
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:30.560]   CISPA passes in the House, battle moves to the Senate.
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:35.840]   If you go to eff.org, you could read about it.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:39.400]   Their issue is that it undermines privacy, frankly.
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:44.080]   It seems unlikely, but this is kind of a war of attrition, right?
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:48.800]   It is related to the stuff that we saw last year.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:54.160]   And obviously law enforcement is, it feels like, is behind this and keeps pushing this.
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:34:00.840]   And if it fails and it's likely to fail, it's clearly not the end of this.
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:04.080]   No, no, this is going on forever until it passes.
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.120]   I think they're going to keep hammering on that wall.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:09.280]   Yeah, they just keep changing the name until they get the perfect name.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:13.240]   Every time something happens, as happened in Boston this week, it makes it a little
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:17.600]   bit easier, a little bit easier as people get more and more afraid.
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:21.920]   And eventually it's going to happen because people are going to say, "Well, we're just
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:25.240]   going to give up these personal freedoms because we need the security."
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:26.240]   Do you not agree?
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:28.600]   I mean, that's what happened with the Patriot Act.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.600]   Right.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:36.320]   I mean, everything that was in the Patriot Act, law enforcement wanted for years and
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:40.320]   years and years, but you couldn't get it done until you had a big reason to say, "That's
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.320]   why we need it."
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:45.240]   So all the technically savvy people watching now who understand why this is not a good
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:49.600]   bill need to write their member of Congress, especially their senator, and write to the
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:50.600]   White House and say...
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:51.600]   I like to call them.
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:52.600]   You know, don't email.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:53.600]   "Hey, Bill."
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:58.600]   They want a postcard postmarked from their district or a letter.
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:59.600]   Now, EFF...
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:00.600]   Email's useless.
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.080]   Because they can't verify it's your constituent.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.200]   Yeah, it could be for anyone.
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.840]   Last time during the Big Soap of Blackout...
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:06.840]   Calling's great.
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:11.240]   Yeah, I called then, I think it was Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Marco Rubio's office
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:13.640]   and asked them to please stop it.
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.640]   I turned the station black and white.
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.640]   Where do you live?
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:18.320]   I used to live in South Florida, so in Broward County.
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.320]   Marco Rubio.
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.520]   That's a good man.
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.280]   I feel like he should be hunting gators.
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.280]   Rasslin' 'em.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.280]   Rasslin' 'em.
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:28.360]   We're gonna take a break.
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.360]   We have a great panel.
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:32.560]   I'm so glad Lauren has realized that...
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:33.560]   Just jump right in.
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.960]   She'll never be here again.
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:36.960]   We're thrilled to have you, Lauren.
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.920]   Good from all things D. Justin Robert Young.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:39.920]   Thanks for having me.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:40.920]   Yeah, it's great to have you.
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:41.920]   We're not done, by the way.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.160]   This thing is gonna go on for at least another couple hours.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.960]   So if you wanna get a snack, maybe a power bar...
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.800]   We still have to talk about the chickens.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.240]   The marathon has just begun.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.280]   Jason Hiner from techrepublic.com.
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.280]   John C. Dvorak.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.280]   Dvorak.org/blog.
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:55.760]   I snuck that one in.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:56.760]   Good one.
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:57.760]   That's a drink for people.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:58.760]   Boom.
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:35:59.760]   Belt.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:04.640]   And speaking of Belts, Justin Robert Young, NSFW, one of the contributors to the number
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.560]   one comedy album of the year.
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:08.560]   Yes.
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:09.560]   You know what?
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.840]   I wanna see you and Brushwood accepting a Grammy Award for that album.
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.640]   I certainly don't think that's true.
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:14.640]   That's my dream.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:15.640]   That's a false dream.
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:16.640]   I know them.
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:17.640]   The one in the wrestling mask.
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:18.640]   That's my dream.
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.640]   The one in the wrestling mask.
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:21.640]   That's my friend.
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:22.640]   They won't take your call after that.
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:23.640]   We actually have a clip if you're ready for it.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.640]   Let's hear it.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:25.640]   Are you gonna beep it?
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:26.640]   Yeah.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:27.640]   Okay.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:34.320]   So if you were going to turn into an animal, what would it be?
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.320]   For what purpose?
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:37.840]   Like just to roam the plains for a day?
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:41.880]   All of a sudden, on your door comes a gentle rapping.
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:42.880]   Hello.
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.960]   It's Monkey Paw.
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.960]   It's me, the animal fairy.
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:51.960]   I don't know if I'm the animal fairy.
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.560]   Animal fairy is dressed in...
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.840]   For those of you listening on, we're actually seeing them...
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:56.840]   He looks like a homeless person.
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:57.840]   Sock puppets.
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:58.840]   Sock puppets.
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:36:59.840]   I'm pretty sure this is a homeless person.
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:03.320]   He's got one glass eye that spins around whimsically like...
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.320]   Like an iMootie.
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.320]   Like an iMootie.
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:06.320]   Sure.
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.320]   I'm the animal fairy.
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:08.320]   I've got magic powers.
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.320]   Who does this?
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:12.320]   This is Jackie Hearn in the chat room.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:13.320]   Jackie, we love you.
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.320]   Well, first off, do you have any food?
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.320]   No, I don't.
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.320]   I'm going to shut the door on your face now.
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.320]   Too bad.
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:24.920]   By the way, when I said your door, I meant your bedroom door, not your front door.
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.880]   I've already been through your fridge and I've ate food.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:28.880]   I was testing your honesty.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.360]   He's turning into the spoon guy now.
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.080]   All right, we're going to...
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.080]   That's enough.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.080]   That's enough.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:35.080]   That's enough.
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:36.080]   You can find it in the iTunes.
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.080]   It goes on for days, apparently.
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.080]   You want more of that.
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.080]   Two hours of nonsense.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.080]   Only $4.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.080]   It's a good deal.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.080]   Hey, that's a $1 per dollar ratio.
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:43.080]   You're rocking and rolling, baby.
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.080]   Fantastic.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:50.840]   Our show today brought to you by people who pay actually greenbacks American US dollars
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:51.840]   to be on this show.
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.680]   I'm talking about Stamps.com.
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:54.920]   Not Bitcoins.
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:55.920]   Not Bitcoins.
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.520]   No, sir, re.
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:01.880]   This is good old fashioned American dollars, but you're going to save some money and you're
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:03.760]   going to most importantly save time.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:07.800]   Business time is money and going to the post office is probably not a high priority for
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.480]   you or your employees.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:15.920]   If you do mailing in your business, invoices, mailers, if you're doing fulfillment shipping
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:19.680]   products, maybe you're an Etsy seller or eBay seller, you got to know about Stamps.com.
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:20.840]   It's postage on demand.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:24.720]   It prints real US postage from your computer, from your printer.
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:25.720]   You don't need a postage meter.
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:26.720]   You don't need ink.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:27.720]   You don't need anything.
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.520]   You just need a Stamps.com account.
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:31.160]   I got to tell you, they do everything for you.
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.800]   They fill in the return address.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:36.240]   You can print right on the envelope with the postage, the return address, and it'll even
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:39.960]   take the address of your recipient from the webpage if you're selling on Amazon, eBay,
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:42.680]   Etsy, PayPal, many, many more sites.
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:45.680]   Or if you're using QuickBooks or your address book, it'll just put it all in there.
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:47.800]   So boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, prints out those envelopes.
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.920]   You can have your logo on it.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:50.200]   It really looks good.
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:54.080]   Any class of mail, media mail, first class mail, priority, domestic, international, it
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:55.080]   doesn't matter.
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:56.080]   Stamps.com will do it.
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:58.480]   In fact, they'll even fill out the forms on the international mail.
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:02.080]   If you do an express or priority mail, they'll send an email to the recipient saying, "Here's
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.480]   the tracking number."
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:07.040]   This is professional fulfillment, and you do it right from your own desk.
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:09.160]   You don't even have to get up and go to the post office with the package.
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.680]   The mail carrier comes and gets it.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.720]   You can schedule a free pickup anytime.
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:13.720]   Stamps.com.
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:14.720]   Now here's the deal.
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:18.960]   Go to Stamps.com, and instead of spending time at the post office, you're going to
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.560]   spend time growing your business.
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:23.560]   You're going to click that radio microphone in the upper right-hand corner, and you're
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:29.000]   going to enter our offer code TWIT, T-W-I-T, and you're going to get a $110 bonus offer.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   This is a very good deal.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.040]   You get that scale, the digital scale, the USB scale.
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:37.520]   You get the $55 in free postage to be used over the first few months of your account.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:41.200]   You get a supply kit, and of course, a four-week trial of Stamps.com.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.200]   Absolutely free.
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.480]   Stamps.com.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.480]   Try it today.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.680]   Use the offer code TWIT for the best deal.
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.760]   Much better than the one on the front page.
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:53.760]   I'm like, "All right."
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:54.760]   Stamps.com.
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:40:00.480]   Android, according to Eric Schmidt, on track for 1 billion total activations later this
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:07.040]   year, he says, they are now activating, what was it, 1.5 million phones a day?
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:12.020]   This was at the Dive Into Mobile, All Things D, Dive Into Mobile conference this week.
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:13.020]   That's an amazing number.
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:14.020]   Crazy talk.
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:15.020]   Crazy talk.
[00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:16.020]   Cray?
[00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:17.020]   A billion.
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:18.020]   Yeah.
[00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:23.720]   I mean, I think the thing you have to remember is a lot of these ... I'm an Android fan.
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:28.160]   I'm not bashing Android here, but a lot of these are people who don't realize they have
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:29.160]   smartphones, right?
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:34.880]   I mean, they're mostly making calls with this and occasionally texting and that kind of ... it's
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:37.360]   just Android is the new standard OS.
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.360]   It's cheap.
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:39.360]   It's a free OS.
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.360]   Right.
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.360]   Right.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:44.880]   Phone companies in the third world nations that need to make a cheap phone, this is what
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:45.880]   they choose.
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:46.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:47.880]   And in the US too, right?
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:50.880]   There are lots of people with Android phones that aren't using them like smartphones.
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:41:00.440]   That's why usage numbers in terms of apps downloaded and other statistics like web time and those
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:04.480]   kinds of things, Apple's still doing well.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.720]   Mobile Safari's dominant on the web.
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:07.720]   Yeah.
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:08.720]   Yes.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:12.720]   And it's because people are maxing those out as smartphones.
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:15.600]   They're using them as smartphones.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:20.000]   And that's not a knock against Android because Android is obviously winning the foot war
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.200]   there.
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:26.440]   But there are lots of people who are going to sort of grow into smartphone usage with
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.960]   an Android device in this way.
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:34.920]   And they aren't already sort of maximum power users for whatever that's worth.
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:38.200]   I got to tell you though, I just got the HTC One.
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.200]   I love it.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:43.880]   And thanks to Google Now, which I think is the killer app for Android by the way.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:45.480]   I know the Giants won the game.
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:47.480]   I like that thing.
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:50.480]   Google Now knows what I'm interested in.
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:54.080]   Somebody was telling me they were visiting a city and it told them how long it was going
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:57.160]   to take to get to the airport just because it knew where they were and knew what they
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.560]   were up to.
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:59.560]   But is that creepy?
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:00.560]   Is that scare people?
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:04.840]   Well, I mean, that's the constant double edged sword argument with Google, right?
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:10.880]   Is that they are at times clumsily handling you or handing you information based on your
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:11.880]   interests.
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:16.360]   But the fact that they are taking so much information in how you interact on the web
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:17.840]   is a little unnerving.
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:23.200]   But I think that I agree philosophically, we're moving far closer to the point where we care
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:27.840]   less about the fact that everything we do online is tracked because that's been true
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.000]   for a very, very long time.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   It's always been true.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   I think Google Now is brilliant.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.400]   I think Google Now is brilliant.
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:37.880]   I mean, it is one of those things that has a major aha moment.
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:41.440]   There's a lot of things nowadays that especially those of us that have been using technology
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:46.960]   for so long, there's not things that surprise us that much.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:51.120]   Google Now, when you sort of realize and you have your aha and it sort of puts a ticket
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:55.360]   up for you or tells you you need to leave for that meeting, it's going to take you 25
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:56.360]   minutes to get there.
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:01.160]   Then all of a sudden you're like, holy crap, how did it know that?
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:03.160]   And yeah, I think it's excellent.
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:04.160]   Lauren, you were saying-
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:07.040]   Well, I was just going to say evidence of the fact that people care less and less is
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:14.040]   when you look at the number of third party apps that are trying to do the same kind of
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:19.160]   notifications on your smartphone and predictive things like that.
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:24.040]   We're seeing that with smart calendars and personal assistance for the iPhone apps that
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:25.960]   are touting themselves as that.
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:29.040]   People are, consumers download these apps and then they say, do you mind if we access
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.040]   your contacts?
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.920]   Do you mind if we access your Facebook and your Gmail and everything else?
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:35.240]   And people say, sure, because that's how you're going to do, this app is going to do what it's
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.240]   supposed to do.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:40.320]   And you can just look at the, it's still a small number, but the growing number of consumers
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:43.920]   that are willing to give away all that data just to get an app working properly.
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:48.800]   I tend to agree with, was it Justin that said, I tend to agree with Justin that you're seeing
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.480]   the standard for privacy go down.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:57.200]   Well, I guess is it maybe just that we are upset when we are collected, when data is
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:00.120]   collected for us and then it doesn't do something we like, right?
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:04.160]   Like if it collects all this data and then gives us a good product, we're like, yay,
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.160]   give me some value.
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:06.160]   Take more data.
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:07.160]   Absolutely.
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.160]   Absolutely.
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.160]   It's when it's like, oh, I can-
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:12.400]   Yeah, and if it doesn't warn you and you miss the train and you're like, oh, stupid app
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:14.360]   didn't Google Now didn't do what it was supposed to do.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:17.400]   Or just like the cookies that, stupid Google Now.
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:24.680]   Or just like all the Google ads, the display ads on websites that do nothing but inundate
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:28.760]   me with billboards for services that I just subscribed to.
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:29.760]   We don't worry.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:30.760]   Yeah, I find that in ours.
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:31.760]   You just bought something.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:32.760]   They keep trying to sell you it again.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:33.760]   It's like, it's trying to give you value.
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:38.520]   What I like about Google Now is I look, I'm going to go someplace at the next day.
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:42.920]   I look something up on the Google Maps on Google and then when I get to my phone, the
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:46.080]   phone knows I looked this place up and it already has a navigator ready.
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:47.080]   Right.
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:48.080]   Isn't that great?
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:52.320]   Yeah, but I think you're going to see more of that across mobile devices and web browsers
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:53.320]   in the future.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:56.360]   And I think that is a pretty cool feature of Google Now right now, but it wouldn't be
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:45:01.480]   surprised if you just see more, you look up something at home and it sends it to your
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:04.160]   mobile device provided that you're using the same system.
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:07.200]   So Facebook's trying to go ahead, Jason.
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:08.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:10.640]   Safari Safari is going to be doing it soon, right?
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.520]   No, it's not because Apple.
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:15.720]   No, I think this is one of the things that Apple is clear.
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:17.400]   It wants to distinguish itself from.
[00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:18.400]   Where's that echo coming from?
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:19.400]   It's coming from Google.
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:20.400]   It's Google.
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.400]   Google's echoing me.
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:24.960]   No, I think Apple is very clear.
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.440]   We don't want to do this because it's it.
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:30.800]   We want to make sure people understand that we're not snooping on them.
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.320]   Do you think that's what Apple's trying to do?
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:33.320]   I don't know.
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:36.020]   I mean, I know app can do it because Apple won't let them.
[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:37.720]   So it's got to be Apple or nothing.
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:43.120]   Well, I think Apple, I mean, this is part of the reason why I think they are contributing
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:46.120]   to the fact that they've lost their edge in not only Google.
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:47.880]   Look at the stock market.
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.960]   Google went up on Friday and Apple 5 percent.
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:51.960]   Apple went down one percent.
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:52.960]   Oh, gee.
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:54.680]   Some of that's due to Google's earnings call.
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:46:00.120]   But why do the fact that people are not excited for the next Apple product?
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:03.280]   You know, it doesn't have it's a it's a quiet period for Apple.
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:06.840]   Look, Apple is going to really is going to have some big announcements, you know, coming
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:07.840]   this spring.
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:10.720]   And I hope that's going to get people excited again.
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:13.240]   I would be shocked if that didn't happen.
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:14.240]   I know.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:16.440]   Yeah, I agree with you.
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.720]   I have total faith that they will.
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:19.720]   I don't.
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:20.720]   However, I don't.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:24.960]   It has not happened in the last couple of years.
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:29.420]   When it comes to Apple, though, are you going to say I'm biased?
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:31.800]   You know, I think you're biased.
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:35.300]   No, really, because you have more like I'm jilted.
[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:37.160]   It's more like I love Macintosh.
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:38.160]   I loved it.
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:41.680]   When the iPhone came out, I abandoned my Blackberry and I bought an iPhone about every iPhone
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:42.680]   after that.
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:43.680]   And then they banned you.
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:45.280]   They have nothing to do with that.
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:47.360]   No, I'm not that blackballed.
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:48.600]   I'm not that petty.
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:51.760]   I do think, though, that I am not alone in this.
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:52.760]   Feel a little jilted.
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:54.920]   I bought a Mac Pro two and a half years ago.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:55.920]   Never updated.
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.200]   I have the newest iMac.
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:58.520]   I have the newest iPad.
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:00.560]   But I don't feel like I'm seeing that kind of innovation.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:05.240]   And I think those of us who expected Apple to come up with a great product every time
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:06.320]   are going to be disappointed.
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:08.440]   I don't think that I think that time is over.
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:09.440]   It's been software.
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:12.360]   It's not because Steve Jobs is gone.
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:16.320]   It's because time has changed.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:19.760]   All this talk is the best thing that could happen to Apple because all we're doing is
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:20.760]   we're lowering the expectations.
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:21.760]   Right?
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:22.760]   Yeah, they better hope we do.
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:23.760]   I don't think we're lowering the expectations.
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:24.760]   I agree.
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:27.840]   Justin, I think you were just trying to say that it's about the software.
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:29.720]   And I tend to completely agree with that.
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:34.620]   I mean, some of the stuff that Google is throwing out there now is a little bit for the high
[00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:35.620]   tech crowd.
[00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:39.000]   And some of it feels maybe a little bit gimmicky on some newer devices.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   Right?
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   The Samsung.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   Don't blame Google for that.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   That's Samsung.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   Again, they're leaving the show.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.840]   But I do think that a lot of innovation going on right now on the software side and Apple's
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:56.360]   going to have to work really hard to make something special that we're going to see.
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:48:01.760]   It might not just be about a different sized iPhone or a cheaper model of iPhone or something
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:02.760]   like that.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:05.480]   It might have something to do with how innovative the software is.
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:10.760]   I think Apple has a problem because they've backed themselves into a corner.
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:16.880]   And because of the privacy things they've said, they can't do a Google Now.
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:19.880]   Some of the things they've committed to in terms of the iPhone, keeping it closed to
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:23.200]   developers and stuff, they have actually backed themselves into a corner.
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:25.800]   And I think it becomes very hard for them to innovate at this point.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:27.800]   You're not going to see a five and a half inch iPhone.
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:28.800]   Look at the native apps.
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:31.800]   Look at the native apps on iPhone.
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:33.220]   Look at Calendar.
[00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:34.760]   Look at Mail.
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:38.960]   Look at where some of the smaller acquisitions and innovation is going on right now.
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:41.720]   Look at what happened with YouTube last summer.
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:43.720]   That was a native app on the iPhone until then.
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:46.660]   Look at all the... look at the Weather app.
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:47.660]   Some people just say, "Well, why isn't it a widget?
[00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:50.760]   And why is it always 70 degrees in Cupertino?"
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:55.640]   They're little things like this, but you're starting to see other companies leapfrog.
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:57.840]   Who's making the best software on iOS today?
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:48:59.040]   It's Google.
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:00.560]   It's Path.
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:01.560]   It's not Apple.
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:05.120]   In fact, Apple software is fairly weak compared to the best of class.
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:08.480]   In fact, Apple's lost the home screen battle.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:13.120]   And if you look at Siri versus Google Voice, Google has... they started out behind and
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:14.200]   they've pulled ahead.
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:15.480]   I think Apple has shown...
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:16.960]   I might be the only happy Siri user.
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:17.960]   They're in trouble.
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:18.960]   They're in trouble.
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:19.960]   I love Siri.
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:20.960]   I use Siri every day.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:24.160]   Look, I agree with a lot of the points that have been made.
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:30.120]   But think about all of the people that Apple has, all of the things that have happened
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:33.520]   at the company over the past six months to a year.
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:36.600]   We've gone through this really long, quiet period with them.
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:37.600]   Think about the last time...
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:41.960]   I mean, the iPhone 5 was the last big announcement in the fall.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:46.520]   I've got to be thinking that they're working on a lot of things and probably making some
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:50.600]   fundamental changes because obviously, for all the reasons that you guys have talked
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:56.360]   about, they have major threats coming at them and they have to deal with it.
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:57.360]   And so...
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:02.040]   I find your romantic notion of Apple charming.
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:04.080]   I'm with him.
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:05.720]   I think you guys are living in hope.
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:06.720]   That's the old Apple.
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:07.720]   I agree with you.
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:08.800]   Apple's done that time after time.
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:10.560]   I don't think they're going to do it this time.
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:11.560]   It's not hopeful.
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:12.560]   This time we'll know, right?
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:13.560]   We'll know.
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:14.560]   They're going to know this spring.
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.560]   They're going to obviously have some announcements.
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:20.080]   When are they going to upgrade the Mac?
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:25.560]   The pressure is on them to deliver innovation and they've got to deliver it with software
[00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:29.520]   and services really more than hardware, as Lauren was getting at.
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:30.520]   And we'll see.
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:35.320]   I mean, because they've put a lot of effort into whatever they're working on.
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:37.360]   And this is sort of the first...
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:42.560]   We're sort of getting past what Steve Jobs had been working on stuff right now.
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:46.520]   That's about what we're about to see this spring and it's going to tell us a lot about
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:47.680]   where Apple is.
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:52.260]   We may learn as soon as Tuesday because of course Apple's earnings call is coming up
[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:53.260]   this Tuesday.
[00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:56.160]   And that's what's tanking the stock price.
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:00.360]   It's nervousness because we have no reason to think they're going to have a bad quarter.
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:06.160]   They had a bad quarter last quarter, but historically that's been a tough quarter for them, Q1.
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:09.040]   Look, nobody wants Apple to succeed more than I do.
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.040]   We need competition.
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.040]   I love Apple.
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:14.240]   I bought a lot of Apple hardware over the last 20 years.
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:19.280]   I want them to succeed, but I just think that they've lost their mojo.
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:22.320]   That's my opinion and we'll see what happens.
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:23.320]   You're not the only one who thinks that.
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:24.320]   Obviously, the stock market thinks that.
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:25.320]   Oh no, certainly not.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:27.000]   The stock market thinks that.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:32.120]   I don't want them to succeed, but I think it's also maybe a little too soon to count
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:33.120]   them out.
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:34.120]   I think we've got to see what they do this spring.
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:36.080]   That's going to tell us a lot about where they're at.
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:37.080]   I want them to succeed.
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:38.080]   I'm not a journalist.
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:39.080]   I can say that.
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:40.080]   I want them to succeed.
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:41.080]   I'm a fan of one company.
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.080]   I want everybody to succeed.
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:43.080]   You can be a journalist and say that.
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.600]   People do it all the time, apparently.
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:45.760]   It's actually good for journalists.
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.840]   It's good for humans to have competition.
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:49.280]   We don't want Google to be number one.
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:50.280]   We don't want Facebook to be number one.
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:52.080]   I put Facebook home on this phone.
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:53.080]   Oh, you did?
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:54.080]   Holy cow.
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.080]   I was just about to tell you.
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.080]   Holy cow.
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:57.080]   Oh my gosh.
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.080]   Was that a blunder?
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:00.080]   Is that a bad cow or a good cow?
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:01.080]   Intervention.
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:02.080]   Intervention.
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:03.080]   I took it off.
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:04.080]   How's your chat head going?
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:05.080]   Do you like it, Lauren?
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.080]   What do you think?
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:09.000]   I haven't really used it yet, but I'm curious what you think about chat head.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   It's not on here right now.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.680]   I have to push a button to make it on here.
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:12.680]   Chat head?
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:13.680]   Chat heads.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:14.680]   Chat heads.
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:17.920]   You can get chat heads now, by the way, on iOS as well.
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:22.400]   So chat heads is once you start a conversation, and by the way, the new Facebook Messenger
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:23.720]   doesn't just use the internet.
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:25.960]   It will also use SMS.
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:26.960]   It's cross platform.
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:32.020]   But once you start a conversation, the little Dvorak head would stay on my screen persistently
[00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:33.320]   on top of other apps.
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:34.320]   Who wants that?
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:35.320]   At all times.
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:37.800]   It's a little weird and it does it on iOS, but you have to be in Facebook.
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:38.800]   That's exactly what I want.
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:44.040]   I want Facebook friends to be able to interrupt me at any time, no matter what I'm doing in
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:45.040]   any app.
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.280]   I'll tell you what though.
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:51.440]   I think we just might be on the other side of a generational line when it comes to communication.
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:55.880]   I mean, you saw today it's in the rundown, but WhatsApp is saying that they have comparable
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:56.880]   traffic.
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:57.880]   They're bigger than Twitter.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:58.880]   Comparable traffic to Twitter.
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:05.720]   And there is a generation for whom just relies on iPod touches and just all they want to
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:10.280]   do is communicate with people, their friends, without having on Wi-Fi networks.
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:13.280]   How come the heads not wiggling around and moving?
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.200]   That's because they don't have real work to do.
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:16.840]   Like tell them to go do their homework.
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:17.840]   Right?
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:18.840]   I mean, get the hose.
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:19.840]   Okay, sure.
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:24.000]   Let me show you the Facebook home and I'll show you a couple of things that I have problems
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   with.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.400]   So my Facebook timeline becomes the front page.
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:29.520]   This is the front page of the phone at all times.
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:33.080]   If you want to run an app, but if you don't want to do something with Facebook but want
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:34.080]   to run an app.
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:35.080]   Look at that thing.
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:36.080]   I'll give you a second.
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:37.480]   Well, I turn it up, but I'll turn that down.
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:42.640]   You have to drag your head to apps, to messenger.
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:46.840]   If I drag it to apps, I get a subset, not even a full set of the apps by default.
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:51.200]   I have to go over here to see all my apps and it's not easy to do.
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:55.680]   Facebook said this is people-centric, not app-centric.
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:57.120]   And it really is like your Facebook home page.
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:59.240]   Because they have control of people, not apps.
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:00.240]   It's like your Facebook home page.
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.840]   And I can swipe people off.
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:02.840]   Woo!
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:05.920]   I mean, it's beautiful.
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:09.240]   You can't do this on an iPhone because Apple won't give you this kind of control.
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:13.000]   So if you want chat heads on the iPhone, you have to be running the Facebook app at all
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.400]   times.
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:15.920]   I can like without leaving.
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:19.240]   I can like or comment on an image.
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:23.640]   So these are all images that are coming in through your feed.
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:25.360]   So I think it's beautiful.
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:30.280]   I don't know if you'd want to live in it because you're basically Facebook and then it's hard
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:31.280]   to get.
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:32.280]   You want to Google search?
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:34.800]   You swipe, go over, do this, check this.
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:35.800]   That's what they want.
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:38.000]   It sounds like a car accident waiting to happen.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.120]   Yeah, well, I wouldn't do it while I'm driving.
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:42.600]   Would you be sucked into the Facebook home to be driving?
[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:44.120]   Actually, now it's kind of compelling.
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:47.800]   I'm enjoying these large images of my friends here.
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:49.120]   This is really...
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:50.360]   Leo, wake up.
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:51.360]   Oh, sorry.
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:53.120]   Hey, some people got Google Glass, not me.
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:54.120]   Did you?
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:55.120]   Did you?
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:56.120]   No.
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:57.120]   Did you?
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:58.120]   Did you?
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:54:59.120]   I thought you did.
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:00.120]   I did not.
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:01.120]   I thought you said you had...
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:02.120]   Robert Scoble got Glass.
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:03.120]   I thought you said there was a devs though, right?
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:04.120]   No.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:05.120]   Oh, Scoble?
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:06.120]   They're giving it to Google?
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:07.120]   Why is Scoble getting one?
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:10.320]   You know, I think it's because he might chat about it a bit.
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:11.320]   Well, I have a little radio show.
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:12.320]   So what?
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:13.320]   He's got more clout than Scoble.
[00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:14.320]   True.
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:15.320]   They don't like me.
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:16.320]   That's all.
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:17.320]   I'm just saying.
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:18.320]   Well, you're kind of standoffish.
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:19.320]   I'm a whiner.
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:20.320]   No?
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:21.320]   No?
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:22.320]   No, you're standoffish.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:23.320]   Well, anyway.
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:24.320]   You don't answer your email.
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:25.320]   You probably were given an opportunity.
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:30.360]   At Google I/O, we got the reservation on number 737.
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:32.400]   I've got the paperweight to prove it.
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.400]   They have been sending...
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:36.080]   There's 2,000 people who got those reservations at Google I/O.
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:37.720]   They've been sending them out.
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:40.160]   But according to Drew Ohlenoff, who got his and is a much higher number than I...
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:41.720]   This was last year's Google I/O?
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:43.720]   He's a much...
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:44.720]   He says they're not sending it out in order.
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:45.720]   I got...
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:47.720]   Drew got his, but did I get mine?
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:48.720]   No.
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:49.720]   But I'm not...
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:50.720]   So what was Drew's number?
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:51.720]   Much higher than mine.
[00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:52.720]   So you have 737.
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:53.720]   I've seen this.
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:54.720]   I know.
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:55.720]   So what happened between you...
[00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:56.720]   Robert didn't even have a number.
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:57.720]   What happened between you and Google?
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:58.720]   Oh, you're trying to egg me on again.
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:55:59.720]   No, I'm not.
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:01.840]   I'm trying to see something bad happen between the two of you.
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:02.840]   We're going to take a break.
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:03.840]   We'll talk about Glass.
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:06.120]   And already, I knew this would happen.
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:07.600]   I know there's only a handful of people who have it.
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:14.040]   We're already seeing the social networks flooded with hashtags #seenthroughglass and bad pictures
[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:17.920]   of people's families at a weird angle because it's taken from your eyebrow.
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:18.920]   It's just the beginning, folks.
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:20.400]   The beginning of the end.
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:21.400]   It's horrible.
[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:22.880]   We'll talk about it.
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:25.840]   And if you're worried about cameras everywhere, wait until everybody's wearing Google Glass.
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:26.840]   Oh, yes.
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:28.760]   Constant streaming.
[00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:29.760]   Constant streaming.
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:30.760]   Spurned again.
[00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:35.640]   Actually, I think the reason I'm not going to get the Glass is because Jason, Jason Howell,
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:36.920]   is he having a baby right now?
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:37.920]   Is his wife having a baby?
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:38.920]   I don't know.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:39.920]   I finally gave up a walk down.
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:40.920]   There should be a website.
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:42.800]   Yeah, does Jason have a baby yet?
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:43.800]   No.
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:49.240]   Because I think that the problem is that the email from Google is going to go to him and
[00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:50.240]   he's got a newborn baby.
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.800]   He's not going to be paying attention to this.
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:53.200]   It's going to go right to the baby.
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:58.720]   Our show today brought to you by our friends at Citrix GoToMeeting is The Way We Meet.
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:03.560]   Right now, anytime we're meeting with clients, it's great for clients and for colleagues.
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:06.980]   So if I want to do a sales pitch to somebody and say, hey, wouldn't it be great if you
[00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:08.560]   bought ads on Twitter?
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:09.920]   We got a PowerPoint presentation.
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:11.360]   We got a media package.
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:12.360]   We'll set up the call.
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:13.360]   And it's so easy to do.
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:15.000]   I send them a link in the email.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   They don't have to do anything.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.680]   They don't even have to install the software ahead of time.
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:18.680]   They click the link.
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:19.680]   The software installs.
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:22.040]   Thirty seconds later, they're seeing my screen.
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:23.280]   So they're seeing the presentation.
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:28.360]   But even better, they're seeing my face because with HD faces now, we've got a beautiful HD
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:30.880]   imagery.
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:34.080]   I see their face, which I'm telling you, if you're doing a pitch, it's great because
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:37.200]   you can see if their arms are folded, if they're smiling, if they're frowning.
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:41.160]   When you're doing team meetings, I know people keep GoToMeeting running all day because
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:43.280]   their team is spread out all over.
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:44.280]   It's how they stay in touch.
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:46.160]   It's how they work together.
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:47.160]   It's just fantastic.
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:50.000]   GoToMeeting.com is The Way To Meet.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:53.520]   If you're not using it in your business, you really got to try this.
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:59.040]   One of the best things is you can now meet, attend meetings on not just your laptop or
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:03.240]   your desktop, Mac or PC, but anywhere, smartphone, tablet.
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:05.520]   You can present from your iPad.
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:10.320]   You can join a meeting using the built-in internet connection, the camera and the microphone
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:13.120]   on your iPad or your smartphone.
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:16.160]   It just really makes it more efficient.
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:20.000]   Projects take weeks, decisions that take days, all done then and there because you're all
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:24.360]   meeting together and having a croissant at the same time.
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:27.120]   That's what I'm looking for in meetings.
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:28.360]   Free croissants.
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:29.360]   We love GoToMeeting.
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:30.360]   We use it like crazy.
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:33.320]   You want to try it 30 days free, visit GoToMeeting.com.
[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:37.000]   The try it free button promo code is TWIT.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.840]   If your boss is not cognizant, is not aware, you must try.
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:42.720]   Tell them or her about it because it really is great.
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:43.720]   GoToMeeting.com.
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:47.800]   Anybody want to make predictions on Apple's earnings call on Tuesday?
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:48.800]   Will it be up?
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:49.800]   Will it be down?
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:50.800]   They'll be up.
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:51.800]   They will be because you know what?
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:55.920]   They had such a bad Q1 as expected.
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:58.640]   You mean they'll be up on Q1 or up year over year?
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:58:59.640]   Well, that's an interesting question.
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:00.640]   Probably year over year.
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:01.640]   I'm guessing.
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:02.640]   It's been the trend.
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:03.640]   Can I ask you a couple of questions?
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:04.640]   Sales will be fine.
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:05.640]   Sales will be fine.
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:06.640]   Sales will be okay.
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:08.920]   People still love in the US the iPhone and the iPad.
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:09.920]   Yes, John C. Dvorak.
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:10.920]   What's this?
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:11.920]   It's funny.
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:12.920]   You found the box, didn't you?
[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:13.920]   Yeah.
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:14.920]   Albinos.
[00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:15.920]   Hecho in Cuba.
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:16.920]   They're cojibas.
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:17.920]   That's empty.
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:20.360]   I have them at home.
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:21.360]   They smell the box.
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:22.800]   It's really they're amazing cigars.
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:23.800]   You smell the box.
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:24.800]   Hold on.
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:27.280]   I want to thank Paul who sent me these.
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:30.000]   He sent me an interesting email.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:34.900]   I sent you an email about four years ago offering to invest $1.3 million into Twitter to help
[00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:37.200]   you build the studio and so forth.
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:38.200]   Who was this?
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:43.320]   He said, "You never responded to my email, so I invested in Florida Real Estate and lost
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:46.160]   it all, but I'm still sending you a box of cigars."
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:48.160]   Who is this guy?
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:49.160]   I need to meet Paul.
[00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:50.160]   I know.
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:51.160]   Exactly.
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:54.400]   By the way, you didn't respond to the guy who wanted to give you $1.3 million.
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:56.520]   I thought he was a Nigerian prince.
[00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:57.520]   What did I know?
[00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:01.400]   Yeah, you guys say from ... Who's to say that you're going to find a glass email?
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:02.400]   Justin.
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:04.600]   I need to find this guy, Paul, because if he can get those cojibas.
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.640]   Now ... Honestly, Justin, if you get an email from
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:11.560]   somebody who says, "I want to invest $1.3 million in your comedy album campaign," what are you
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:12.560]   going to do?
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:13.560]   I'm a brain mule.
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:16.000]   No one's going to give me $1.3 million.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.280]   You are a respected figure in tech journalism.
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:19.280]   I'm a brain mule.
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.880]   No, you know what?
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.600]   I'm so sorry I left these at home.
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:23.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.600]   No, I really am.
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:25.600]   I would have given you.
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:26.600]   They're really good.
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:28.200]   I'll take one.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:29.200]   It is contraband.
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.200]   I believe it's contraband.
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:31.200]   Yes, totally.
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.640]   But the funny thing is most of the cojibas are forged.
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:34.640]   They're fake.
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:35.640]   No, this is real.
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:36.640]   No, it's real because you got the stamp.
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:41.200]   If you don't have that stamp, if you don't see the stamp, you got fake goods.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.200]   [inaudible 00:05:50]
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:43.200]   This is like your own Jay-Z.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:46.200]   So I always like to take some-
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:51.200]   This is a real boys club, huh?
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.200]   Yeah, I'm really sorry.
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.120]   But no, wait a minute, Lauren.
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:57.040]   Are you making the false assumption that only guys smoke cigars?
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:59.320]   No, but why don't you send me one?
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:01.480]   Why don't you do a contraband mail then, Leo?
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:04.160]   I will send you a cojiba just for you.
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:09.040]   So you got any extra gaffers tape?
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.040]   You know this stuff's expensive.
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:12.280]   You can't just come in here and take our gaffers tape.
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:13.280]   Why?
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.280]   You want some?
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:15.280]   I need some.
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:16.280]   Yeah, I need some gaffers tape.
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.280]   Are you going to do that thing?
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:18.280]   Apparently it's a meme.
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:21.600]   I didn't realize this, but I see it on Instagram now where you take off all your clothes and
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.400]   you tape yourself up with black tape.
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:24.400]   That's what I'm going to do.
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.400]   Yes.
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:26.400]   Okay, that's what I thought.
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.400]   Wait, what?
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:29.200]   What meme is this?
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:30.520]   Maybe I'm following the wrong people.
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.880]   I don't know.
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:34.120]   It seems to be there's a lot of pictures of people-
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.960]   Taped.
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:36.960]   With black.
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:38.480]   Usually though it's electrician's tape, not gaffer's tape.
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:40.520]   They'd be smart to use gaffer's tape because it removes easily.
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.000]   Yeah, no, gaffer's tape is great.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   Yeah.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.720]   We're going to talk about Windows Blue next.
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:46.720]   Do you have a case of it?
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:48.160]   Is that you have lots of gaffer's tape?
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.160]   Because you should use it.
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.160]   John, do we have a ton of gaffer's tape?
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.360]   What do you need gaffer's tape for?
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:53.920]   Well, I'm asking him.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:55.520]   Are you going to do this photo thing?
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:56.520]   Yeah.
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:59.320]   Are you mean taping up your naked body, John C. Dvorak?
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:00.320]   Dvorak blog?
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:06.080]   Well, that's a disgusting thought, but no, actually because I'm changing my stereo gear
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:08.800]   and I need the gaffer's tape.
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:09.800]   A likely story.
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:13.560]   How about Xbox smartwatch?
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:14.560]   That won't work.
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:16.600]   You can't tape it with the smartwatch.
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:24.600]   I want to say if you do an image search for tape and bathing suits, this is a very popular
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:25.600]   meme right now.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:28.600]   It's a very horrible looking meme in this case.
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:31.680]   By the way, it's a gaffer's tape party over here.
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:33.040]   We got gaffer's tape.
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.160]   Apparently we have enough gaffer's tape to go around.
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.160]   We're going nuts.
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.160]   Everybody takes some gaffer's tape.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.160]   I'm wearing it as a hat.
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:40.280]   You have a box of them.
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:41.280]   Firefox OS.
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:43.520]   But isn't, John, isn't this fair?
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:44.520]   I know.
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:45.520]   Just be patient, Jason.
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:46.520]   Look at this.
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:49.680]   John, isn't this fairly expensive, this gaffer's tape?
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.160]   How much per roll is gaffer's tape?
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:52.160]   Look at the gaffer's tape.
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.160]   You got enough gaffer's tape to last a lifetime.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:55.160]   This is a television studio.
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:56.160]   We need gaffer's tape.
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.440]   This is the weirdest sideline I think I've ever seen on Twitter.
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:02.960]   Just a 30 minute conversation about gaffer's tape.
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:03.960]   All right.
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:07.000]   Just enter in hashtag scene through glass.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   Yes.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:15.400]   And I think you will see why I am not thrilled about this proliferation of Google glassheads.
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:16.400]   Okay.
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:21.960]   But the first photos taken off an iPhone weren't exactly amazing.
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:25.760]   This is just to say that I don't know if the first things we're going to see are going
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.120]   to be the best uses of them.
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.120]   Okay.
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:30.120]   That's fair.
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.120]   You're making an excuse for this product already.
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:32.120]   You're working for this company?
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:33.120]   No.
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:34.560]   In fact, I will go the other way.
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:36.320]   I don't think that this is a consumer product.
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:39.280]   And I think that the fact that they're kind of treating it as like a hybrid between-
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:44.080]   I wrote a column in PC Magazine where I openly said, "I hope this fails."
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:45.080]   What?
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:46.080]   Why?
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.080]   I think it's a dreadful product.
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:49.080]   People walking around, these idiotic glasses on, bumping into each other.
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:53.280]   It does feel like a product in search of a solution in search of a problem.
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.280]   Yeah.
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.280]   What's the problem?
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:56.280]   I want to take photos from-
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.360]   Now, this is the Pebble Watch.
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:03:59.760]   So this does some of the same things.
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.880]   The idea of the Pebble Watch is you tie this- have you used this, Lauren?
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:03.880]   How much is this thing?
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:04.880]   No, I haven't.
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:05.880]   I haven't actually used-
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:06.880]   There are 150 bucks.
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:07.880]   I got it for less-
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:08.880]   It's got a rubber thing.
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:09.880]   It's not even leather.
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.880]   No, it's not exactly a classy watch.
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:14.920]   You look kind of like a nerd wearing it.
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:16.600]   You are a total nerd wearing this.
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:18.240]   But it has E Ink, which is kind of neat.
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:20.600]   I've tried the other Android or iPhone-
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:24.280]   Ooh, it just changed from 430 to 434 to 435.
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:25.280]   You know what's cool?
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:27.240]   Somebody sends me a text, an instant message-
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.960]   Does it have a touch screen?
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:29.960]   No.
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:31.240]   It comes into my watch, it vibrates.
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:34.560]   Somebody calls me, it'll vibrate my watch.
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:36.200]   I can control my music from the watch.
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:37.920]   I actually kind of like it.
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:39.760]   Everyone that I know that has it is disappointed.
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:40.760]   No.
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:45.800]   I was prepared to be disappointed, maybe because I've used these other, like the IAM watch,
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:46.920]   which was horrible.
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:50.480]   At least the experience of pairing it to the phone, it works with the Android or iPhone,
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:51.480]   is pretty good.
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:52.480]   And it's kind of cool.
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:56.720]   You know, during the radio show, our call screening apparatus failed, so they started
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.600]   using instant message to send me callers.
[01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:01.160]   I was getting the name of the caller on my watch.
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:02.160]   That's cool.
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.160]   That was kind of cool.
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:07.880]   I'm in agreement with you on this, even though it seems like a cheap production.
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:09.960]   Well, of necessity.
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:11.280]   We have different watch faces.
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:14.360]   I can scroll through the watch faces.
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:18.240]   I've heard though that if you get multiple notifications or emails coming in at once,
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:20.120]   like a rush of emails, you'll miss a bunch.
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:21.640]   You can't then scroll through them again.
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:25.040]   No, it's one at a time, and it's kind of lame that way.
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:26.360]   I just downloaded a few of these.
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:28.400]   There are many more watch faces.
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.440]   You know, this was a Kickstarter project.
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:32.960]   They raised more than $10 million.
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.640]   Stripes to make this thing.
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.840]   A year ago, they were funded.
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:37.840]   They finally came out.
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:38.840]   I just got this.
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.160]   It took them a long time to get the watch out.
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:41.720]   Others have gotten there sooner.
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:45.000]   And you had to downgrade from a color one to a black one, right?
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.640]   I ordered a red one, and that's why I didn't get it till now.
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:50.040]   Apparently, they're having trouble with the red, so they sent me an email saying, "Can
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.040]   we send you a black one?"
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:52.040]   Oh, by the way.
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:53.040]   Oh, by the way.
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:54.040]   It was interesting.
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.080]   You know, this whole watch thing is really, really interesting.
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:06:02.440]   I was in London last week, and I had a conversation with Steve Ranger, who's our EIC for London,
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:04.360]   for ZDNet and Tech Republic.
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:07.720]   He did this great gallery of the history of the smartwatch, right?
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:09.040]   And the products that are kind of left.
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:11.040]   You remember Microsoft did this, the Spotwatch?
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:12.040]   Oh, yes.
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:13.040]   I had one of those Spotwatch.
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:14.040]   Horrible.
[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:15.040]   It was big.
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.040]   The thing was huge.
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:17.040]   It was the biggest.
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.040]   It could stop a bullet.
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:22.740]   I mean, it was, you know, if I was in Boston this week, I could have protected lots of
[01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:24.440]   cops with that thing.
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:27.600]   It was huge, and it was not very good.
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:28.840]   It didn't sync well.
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:31.560]   But you could look at that as the precursor of this thing.
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:35.720]   But that sort of left a bad taste in my mouth, because even I reviewed that thing so many
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:40.920]   years ago, and now I'm still trying to think, you know, how could these things be useful?
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:45.840]   And what Steve and I came up with as we were talking about it is there's sort of two pieces.
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:50.360]   There's either the sort of third screen thing, right?
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:54.420]   It's another screen, so you don't have to take it out of your phone, out of your pocket.
[01:06:54.420 --> 01:07:05.560]   Or there's the kind of Fitbit thing, where it is more like your jawbone up, or the Fitbit
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:08.020]   Flex is coming out with their wristband.
[01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:13.720]   So it's almost those two pieces that are making this interesting.
[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:16.780]   Maybe they'll merge, but it almost seems like the products are going one way or another
[01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:19.280]   with those two.
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:25.000]   I think the reason it's interesting is A, because yes, we've seen so many bad ones, B, because
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:32.880]   it was the first really big successful Kickstarter project at $10.2 million, C, because it was
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:34.080]   supposed to be E Ink.
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:35.560]   By the way, I correct myself.
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:36.560]   This is an LCD screen.
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:41.680]   Even though I said it was going to be E Ink, it's just a black and white LCD screen.
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:47.380]   But mostly it's interesting because Apple is rumored to be doing one, right?
[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:53.680]   And so the real question is, is this in any way a prototype of what an iWatch might be?
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:57.560]   Or is there something Apple could do that would make this much better?
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:58.560]   Yeah, make it a phone.
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:07:59.560]   Frankly, I can't recommend somebody's-
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:02.380]   Wasn't it a point of level two that it wasn't supposed to be entirely proprietary?
[01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:04.440]   It works with different OSs, correct?
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:07.000]   It works with any Bluetooth device, yeah.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   So with Apple, we'll definitely see something a little bit more proprietary to start.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.440]   I think what's going to be interesting is to see whether or not they do.
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:20.740]   As Jason mentioned, you've got now Fitbit Flex coming out and you've got the Jawbone Up and
[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:25.000]   you've got this small addressable market, but growing market of wearable fitness devices.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:30.360]   And if Apple makes a "iWatch", if it's going to incorporate some of those features too,
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:35.200]   because then you've got, I think, a larger target audience for that sort of thing.
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.200]   Blood pressure.
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:42.240]   This was supposed to be, they in their pitch said it would measure mileage, it'd be a runner's
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:43.480]   watch, and they couldn't get that in.
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:46.120]   They had to leave that out.
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:49.800]   The top thing to do, and as you mentioned, we've seen a lot of people try the smart watch
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:50.800]   and fail.
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:55.400]   I think Sony's tried it a couple of times too and they haven't really done a great job
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:56.400]   with that.
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:09:01.800]   And I think the one thing you know is that if Apple does do it, it's going to work at
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:02.800]   least.
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:05.280]   So that's a good place to start, right?
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:10.440]   And I guess that's kind of the difference between what we would hope to see with something
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:15.080]   like an Apple Watch and what we are seeing right now, which is very interesting to me
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:21.880]   with Google Glass, where now there's just always this constant, "Yeah, that's an interesting
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:22.880]   idea.
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:23.880]   It's cool.
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:24.880]   I'd like to get my hands on one."
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:27.320]   But it's $1,500.
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:31.280]   But they're only giving to people on a crazy Willy Wonka wish list.
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:37.300]   But the EULA says you can't sell it or even after it's publicly available, you can't put
[01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:38.300]   it on eBay.
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:39.300]   They'll brick it.
[01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:43.360]   Yeah, they're going to brick it because it's all tied through Google stuff, which is very
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:50.080]   weird to see Google trying to do a consumer-facing product, but having all these limitations
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:55.400]   for which when Apple puts out something like the iPhone or the iPad or hopefully an iWatch,
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:57.320]   it's just going to be, "Hey, here's a cool thing.
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:58.320]   Buy it if you like it."
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.480]   Do you remember the Timex Datalink, John?
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.480]   Did you ever have one of those?
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:02.480]   Yep.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:05.520]   That was the watch that you held up to the screen and it stopped working as soon as LCD
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:06.960]   screens became popular.
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:07.960]   You couldn't use it with LCD.
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:08.960]   I thought it was very creative.
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:09.960]   You had to use it with the CRT.
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:10.960]   Right.
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:14.520]   You had to use the CRT and it would program the watch with your contacts or your calendar.
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:15.520]   By blinking at it.
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:16.520]   By blinking really fast.
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:17.520]   Oh, what?
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.520]   Yeah, it was cool.
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.440]   And you can't do it with an LCD.
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:22.000]   So they just went out a bit.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   It was gone.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000]   It was done.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   I had a Datalink.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.600]   It was out for a couple years.
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:27.600]   1994 they came out.
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:31.560]   And you could put your address set on there and a bunch of other things.
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:33.680]   You held it up against the screen.
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:34.680]   Here's the image.
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:35.680]   It's on Wikipedia.
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:36.680]   I think I still have mine.
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:38.680]   You see that little camera at the top.
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:40.400]   That was one of the Microsoft watches.
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:41.600]   This is a different one.
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:43.240]   This is the original Microsoft watch.
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:44.240]   Well, but it was from Timex.
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.240]   Yeah, it was the Datalink.
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.240]   Right, it was the Timex.
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.240]   They partnered with Microsoft before Spot.
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:50.520]   And that's why they came up with Spot because they said, well, we can no longer program
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:52.020]   it from the screen.
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:53.560]   So we're going to have to do some sort of radio thing.
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:54.560]   And they used the vertical blank.
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:58.440]   I think it was still doable to program it from an LCD screen under some circumstance.
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:10:59.440]   Yeah.
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:00.440]   I remember that.
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:01.440]   I know that there was no.
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:02.440]   They never made it work.
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:03.440]   Right.
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:05.240]   But I still think it is somehow doable.
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:06.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:07.240]   Well, what they ended up using.
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:12.120]   The most interesting thing that Apple could do with this is turn it into an ecosystem,
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:13.120]   right?
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:20.560]   Where that watch, if they are in fact doing one and if it does in fact have this Fitbit
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:26.480]   capability, is that it is something that could interface with other things, right?
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:32.160]   Exercise machines, other equipment at the gym where they work with those providers
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:35.120]   and they have an API that lets them tap into it.
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:40.600]   And sort of think the way they did with the accessory makers for the iPod.
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.920]   I think that's the most interesting thing.
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:48.360]   That's a long game and not sort of something they're going to have in place next year,
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:49.360]   or this year.
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:50.760]   But that is an interesting long game.
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:52.520]   I'm going to be stunned if they bring out a watch.
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:54.200]   I just don't think they're going to do it.
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:57.460]   You know, I said the same thing about an Apple TV and they never did it.
[01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:59.400]   There seems to be much stronger evidence.
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:06.120]   I mean, reliable sources are saying Apple's got 100 people working on this.
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:08.240]   I mean, I agree with you, John.
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.840]   It doesn't seem like a good product.
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:10.840]   No, it doesn't.
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:17.960]   I should point out that Apple, you know, we kind of let Lauren get away with it.
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:19.960]   She said if Apple makes it, it's going to be good.
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:22.360]   I got to point out there's quite a few products Apple has made.
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:23.360]   I didn't say it was going to be good.
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:25.760]   I said at least it would work.
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:27.880]   Like Apple Maps work.
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:28.880]   Apple Maps do work.
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:29.880]   Yes.
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:30.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:31.880]   Don't give me that.
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:32.880]   I know we did this test.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.040]   I think what Lauren's saying is they'll spike it, right?
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:35.960]   They wouldn't release it if it was.
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:37.240]   I mean, I mean, if it was bad.
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:38.240]   Sorry.
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:39.240]   You don't know that.
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:40.240]   They depends.
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:41.840]   Depends how much money they put into it.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.880]   You can't spike something if you've got 100 people working on it.
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:44.880]   I don't think that this is even bogus.
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:45.880]   By the way, Jason just swore.
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:46.880]   Should we take a shot?
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:49.880]   Yeah, everybody gets a drink.
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:50.880]   Boom, boom.
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:51.880]   Have some of that.
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:53.480]   Bo yak.
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:56.120]   You should put to take this to the house and drink it tonight.
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.120]   It's a 2005.
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:58.120]   I should drink it in 20 years.
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:12:59.880]   No, no, this is a second wine.
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:00.880]   They're always designed to be drunk.
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:01.880]   Oh, well, let's open it up.
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:02.880]   Can we get it?
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:03.880]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:04.880]   No, no, no, no.
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:05.880]   No, no, please don't open it up.
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:06.880]   If you have it for dinner, you don't have to
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:07.880]   I'll have it for dinner.
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:08.880]   I'll have it as dinner.
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:09.880]   Now you're talking.
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:12.880]   What I said was I didn't necessarily say it would be good.
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:13.880]   OK, it would work.
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:22.280]   I said that if there's some sort of notification system between, let's say, your smartphone and
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:29.040]   the watch and maybe your iPad or whatever it might be, I have some faith that that notification
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:30.760]   system might work better.
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:31.760]   You're right.
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:35.160]   The previous products we've seen in the market, whether from Microsoft, Sony, Pebble or otherwise.
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:36.720]   Apple does ecosystems well.
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:42.480]   I'm going to be stunned if they bring out a phone that is not a watch that's not a phone.
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:44.480]   So that's what Tracy.
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:45.480]   That's what people want, right?
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:46.480]   I think, well, I don't.
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:48.480]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you want phone capability.
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:49.480]   No, he's on your watch.
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:54.600]   You don't know anyone to do that.
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:57.640]   There are zero people on planet Earth who want to go.
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:58.640]   Hello, sir.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:04.280]   I bet you said that nobody would ever want to take a picture with an iPad either.
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:06.320]   Yeah, or use that phablet.
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:07.320]   Hold it.
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:08.320]   One of those phablet.
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:09.320]   Yes.
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:14.600]   Who would ever want a five and a half inch phone besides you?
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:16.960]   I raised my hand.
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:19.680]   And boy, you see everybody taking pictures with iPads these days.
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:21.320]   It's kind of a, it's kind of a bane.
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:22.760]   This is why I'm worried about Google Glass.
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:24.800]   It's a chuckle moment every time.
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:25.800]   Wait a minute.
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:27.600]   Oh, shoe phone, shoe phone.
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:34.040]   So the Apple shoe phone member of our audience is holding up his foot and has taped his iPhone
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:38.920]   to the sole of it as a way of communicating to me the word shoe phone.
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:39.920]   Yeah.
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:40.920]   Yeah.
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:41.920]   That's good.
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:44.000]   I like it when the audience interaction Apple shoe phone would be cool.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.440]   They can do a deal with sketchers.
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:48.280]   Did you use gaffer tape to tape that to his shoe?
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:50.080]   Would you like some gaffer tape, sir?
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:51.820]   We're handing it out to everybody today.
[01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:57.720]   And then when it fails at their next earning call, they can say missed it by that much.
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:58.720]   Very good.
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:00.320]   I thought you were too young to even remember gifts.
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:01.320]   Come on, man.
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:02.320]   I'm impressed.
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:05.400]   I know Lauren is.
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.120]   Although she looks like age at 99.
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:09.160]   I just want to say that.
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:10.160]   A little bit.
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:13.960]   Wait, who's, wait, a lady never comments on age, but who is, let's see, I'm going to
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:15.200]   have to do some Googling here.
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:17.960]   OK, you guys go back to age at 99.
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:22.000]   Oh, now I feel really old.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.000]   She's Googling.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000]   Sure.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000]   All right.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.000]   Agent.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.040]   I remember those days.
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:31.040]   She's got cool bangs.
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:32.040]   Barbara Felden.
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:34.800]   Yes, she had bangs, but it was Anne Hathaway in the remake.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:35.800]   Anne Hathaway in the remake.
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:38.080]   Yeah, I had to Google that too.
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:43.680]   And there we go off the track, ladies and gentlemen, at four forty six.
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:45.960]   I interviewed Anne Hathaway for that movie, actually.
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:48.360]   And she was age at 99.
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:49.600]   Yeah, she was she was lovely.
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:52.160]   I don't know why everyone hates Anne Hathaway so much because she's.
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:53.160]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:54.760]   She seems like a real doll.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:55.760]   She's my imaginary girlfriend.
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:58.440]   I thought Taylor Swift is your imaginary girlfriend.
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:15:59.640]   Taylor Swift.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:03.400]   Take a look at Taylor Swift and tell me she doesn't look exactly like Donald Trump.
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:04.400]   I'm telling you.
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.400]   Get that.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:08.720]   Just put that image in your brain next time you see her and you tell me she doesn't look
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:12.720]   like Donald Trump.
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:13.720]   I don't know.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:14.720]   I don't know.
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:15.720]   I don't know.

[01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:54.720]   I don't know.
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:55.720]   I don't know.

[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:06.720]   I don't know.

[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:17.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:18.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:19.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:20.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:21.720]   I don't know.

[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:23.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:24.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:25.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:26.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:27.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:28.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:29.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:30.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:31.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:32.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:33.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:34.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:35.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:36.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:37.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:38.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:39.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:40.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:41.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:42.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:43.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:44.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:45.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:46.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:47.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:48.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:49.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:50.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:51.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:52.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:53.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:54.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:55.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:56.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:57.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:57.720 --> 01:21:58.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:21:59.720]   I don't know.
[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:00.720]   I don't know.
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:05.360]   So, what does your Windows 8 experience into a beautiful Windows 7 experience that never
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:10.360]   goes to that crazy Metro interface, boots to the desktop, stays there unless you force
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:16.080]   it to go to the other thing, that horrible Metro thing, and it makes the machine beautiful.
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:17.080]   It's great.
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:21.520]   So, where would you guys say, if you were to put a grade, I mean, with this news out
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:24.120]   there that they are going to retract a little on one of my big philosophical...
[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:27.160]   And Microsoft has not said this, by the way, but this is a scoop, but...
[01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:29.800]   But let's assume the rumors are true.
[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:32.400]   This is a damnation of Windows 8.
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:33.400]   Well, that's my question.
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:34.400]   Are they now backing off?
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:35.400]   That's why I don't think...
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:36.400]   Because they were all in.
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:37.400]   Yeah.
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:38.760]   I think they still are all in.
[01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:39.760]   Yeah.
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:44.720]   But especially for Enterprise, because Enterprise is where they are doing well.
[01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:49.760]   They are all in, and the PC market dropped 14% last quarter, the largest drop in history.
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:51.840]   And I blame Windows 8.
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:53.480]   I think it certainly has to...
[01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:56.880]   Some people say, "Oh no, it's the iPad, it's the mobile devices," but I think you have to
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:58.400]   blame Windows 8 a little bit.
[01:22:58.400 --> 01:22:59.400]   Yeah.
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:02.880]   Because the earnings, the Windows division was flat, but that's only because they took
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:05.760]   some profits from pre-sales and things.
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:07.560]   The actual numbers were very bad.
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:08.600]   They jiggered.
[01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:10.840]   They jiggered the numbers to make it look like they were flat.
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:11.840]   They weren't.
[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:12.840]   Right.
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:16.520]   I mean, the reason why things are kind of so brutal for them right now from a sales
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:22.520]   standpoint is just that so many people that have a Windows machine, even if it's four
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:26.520]   or five years old, is good enough to do a lot of the desktop stuff that they need.
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:27.520]   Right?
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:28.880]   They have no reason to upgrade.
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:32.800]   And this has been the case for five to 10 years almost.
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:42.400]   And where all of the growth was coming from in PCs up until about 2010 was in second devices.
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:48.600]   Netbooks played into that, buying a separate machine or laptop for your kid, one for your
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:50.320]   den, all of that.
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:53.240]   All of that was where a lot of their growth was coming from.
[01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:55.000]   And then the iPad happened.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:00.200]   And instead, the thing that you were buying was that second and third machine and the
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:01.680]   machine for the kids and all that.
[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:05.160]   Well, it started with tablets, with the iPad and other tablets.
[01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:07.640]   They started buying those instead.
[01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:10.000]   And so that's where Microsoft got hurt.
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:17.960]   And unfortunately, their answer to that has been, was this form factor innovation.
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:20.600]   And the problem is people aren't buying it.
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:24.520]   They don't want that instead of these other things.
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:27.200]   And that's where they're in trouble.
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:32.320]   And that's where we're still waiting to see something innovative from them that people
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:33.320]   want to buy.
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:37.440]   And by form factor innovation, Jason, you're referring to touch.
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:39.800]   You're referring to convertibles in touch and that sort of thing.
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:44.880]   You're not referring to the whole ultrabook push we saw for 18 to 24 months prior to that
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:47.520]   too, which of course, they were in touch.
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:48.520]   So right.
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:49.520]   Right.
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:53.440]   And like the Pro, which I think there was innovation in that, and that it's the first
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:57.720]   machine that I used that interestingly and kind of effectively, it has a lot of other
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:04.640]   problems, but combined keyboard and touch and even pen, which I'm not a big pen fan,
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:06.960]   but the pen actually works pretty well on that thing.
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:09.560]   And so that was their answer.
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:14.720]   But by and large, the masses and even enterprise have not bought into it.
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:18.120]   And that's where they're in some trouble right now.
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:21.160]   I have to say, I bought an ultrabook with Windows 8 on it.
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:23.040]   It has a touch screen.
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:24.040]   It's light.
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:25.040]   It's thin.
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:26.040]   I love the hardware and Windows 8.
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:27.240]   I really tried for three months.
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:29.360]   I said, I'm going to use it natively.
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:31.120]   And I finally, I did it, John.
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:34.640]   I put the, well, I put start eight, which is from Stardoc, but the same idea.
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:38.440]   And now I have a start menu and a desktop and I'm really happy.
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:40.640]   It's just like Windows 7.
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:41.640]   Yeah.
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:43.720]   And it makes you, but I can still use touch.
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:46.720]   And the underlying operating system is a little snappier.
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:47.720]   No, it's better.
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:48.720]   Copy works.
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:51.280]   It's broken for years, but you still need this.
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:53.480]   You know, what is the point?
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:58.920]   The desktop model, the metaphor they used to call it, began in 1981 and we're so used
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:02.560]   to it, it's like saying, let's change the car and take the drivers.
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:03.880]   We can maybe universalize it.
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:06.680]   Put the driver in the middle with the steering wheel in the middle.
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:10.120]   Let's do this after 30 years of standardizing on something.
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:16.960]   This, 32 years have gone by when everybody has pretty much adopted this kind of desktop
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:18.720]   to do computing.
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:22.880]   And that now they want to change it out of the blue to these crazy full screen apps and
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:23.880]   all the rest.
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:26.960]   That there's are people that hate computers that are thinking this way.
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:30.120]   I have to say you called it when you saw Windows 8 before it was released.
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:32.480]   You said it's going to be a big flop.
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:35.960]   I have to say, I think it's time to call it on this one.
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:36.960]   It's a flop.
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:37.960]   Yeah.
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:38.960]   Nobody wants it.
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:39.960]   I mean, John's right.
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:43.040]   But the other thing is though, John, if they didn't do that, everybody would be talking
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:48.520]   about how tired and old the metaphor is and the fact that they haven't done any innovation.
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:49.520]   You know what I mean?
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:50.520]   But they have this problem.
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:54.920]   Microsoft has this problem of how much innovation is enough and how much is too much and how
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:27:00.520]   much can they stick with the old stuff and get away with it.
[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:03.600]   And I think that's one of the challenges.
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:05.760]   Yeah, no, I agree with that.
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:08.720]   There's always this criticism and I've made it myself.
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:13.200]   And one time I wrote a column for Mac user years ago making up a bunch of crazy metaphors
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:15.240]   that could be used on a computer.
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:21.220]   But for the most part, there are other ways of doing innovation besides changing the graphical
[01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:23.480]   user interface so drastically.
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:30.000]   I mean, there's plenty of room for improvement like in the Microsoft Office, for example.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.000]   What about PowerPoint?
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000]   Talking about something tired.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.200]   I mean, can we do something with this?
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:38.160]   Or there's a lot of possibilities here, it seems to me.
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:42.880]   But I think Jason's very, very correct that they were in a position where now you are
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:46.800]   still seeing an evidence to back it up that this is a post PC world.
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:53.240]   And if they did nothing but shore up Windows 8 as a Windows 7 kind of refresh with these
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:57.480]   sort of changes, you would have said, well, congratulations, you're still on a sinking
[01:27:57.480 --> 01:27:58.480]   ship.
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:27:59.480]   And so they made a bold move.
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:01.480]   It didn't pay off because it wasn't good.
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:04.040]   They're the ones who shot the holes in the boat.
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:07.020]   Come on, this is like, yeah, the post PC.
[01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:08.020]   Thank you very much.
[01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:09.020]   They became part of the problem.
[01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:10.020]   They did.
[01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:11.020]   How about promoting?
[01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:12.020]   I wrote another column.
[01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:13.960]   I write too many columns.
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:19.360]   Where is the promotion for the real, the desktop PC, the modern desktop PC, which is a powerful
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:24.800]   machine with a lot of processing power and three monitors or four monitors in some cases,
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:29.200]   but at least three monitors or something that can really do some power work instead of promoting
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:34.360]   the idea of doing all your computing on a phone when you can actually be sitting down.
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:38.840]   And most of the power users, nobody even talks about them anymore, but most power users have
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:44.120]   a pretty honking machine and they usually have three big monitors and they do a lot of major
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:46.720]   work and they get a lot of work done very efficiently.
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:50.000]   I don't ever see Dell advertising this configuration.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.080]   I don't see HP advertising this configuration.
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:57.760]   These guys put themselves into a hole that dates back to 1999 and they wonder why they
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:58.760]   can't sell machines.
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:28:59.760]   Give me a break.
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:00.760]   It's marketing.
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:01.760]   It's too small.
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:05.280]   It's true, but it's all still the same machines though.
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.280]   I mean, and John, you're right.
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:09.320]   Look, I was walking down London last week and I was thinking something similar.
[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:13.480]   They have all the ground floor.
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:16.160]   It's like there's a lot of windows and you can see it and you actually see all these
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:17.160]   people working.
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:18.880]   All of them are using desktops.
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:23.720]   These are almost all banks and financial institutions like in downtown city of London.
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:27.120]   And I was looking at them and I was thinking, they're all using desktops.
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:32.320]   And I was like, but then I looked closer and all of them are at least five, six years old.
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:36.920]   They're all these really old machines and they've got like these dual monitors, like two 19
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:41.000]   inch Dell monitors from 2008.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.160]   And so I think that's part of the problem is they're still using machines that are good
[01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:47.680]   enough and they're not refreshing them.
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:50.280]   And that's what's put in the PC industry as a whole.
[01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:54.280]   But it is a good point that that is still what the configuration people are using that
[01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:57.240]   get work done on a regular basis.
[01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:02.560]   And eventually there will be sort of some refresh cycles that feed that.
[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:03.560]   We're going to take a break.
[01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:08.480]   Come back with more Jason Heiner from tech Republic, John C. Dvorak, channeldvorak.com
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:12.040]   and the show that you do.
[01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:13.280]   No agenda show.com.
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:15.600]   That's the one I was trying not to remember.
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:23.560]   Also Justin Robert Young from NSFW and from All Things D. It's Lauren Good.
[01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:24.840]   Thank you so much all for being here.
[01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:25.840]   We're not done yet.
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:31.640]   We're coming, but first a word from Squarespace, the best web hosting out there, the best content
[01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:33.960]   management system.
[01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:34.960]   It's smart.

[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:36.960]   It's mobile responsive.

[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:44.280]   That guy with the two 30 inch monitors down to the little four at a four inch tiny little
[01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:47.040]   iPhone screen and everywhere in between.
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:49.480]   And now Squarespace has e-commerce.

[01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:12.960]   Just all you have to do is, there you go.
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:13.960]   That's the screen.

[01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:31.120]   Look at these plans.
[01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:32.120]   It's simple.
[01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:33.120]   Three plans.
[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:35.160]   $8, $16, $24.
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:37.040]   Let's just talk about the top of the line.
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:38.040]   $24 a month.
[01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:39.040]   What do you get?
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:40.320]   Complete e-commerce solution.
[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:43.280]   They do not take a cut of your sales, by the way.
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:45.440]   Unlimited physical and digital products.
[01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:51.440]   You could sell CDs and MP3s, hardcovers and e-books.
[01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:53.280]   Mobile store looks great on mobile.
[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:54.280]   Absolutely.
[01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:57.680]   In fact, every one of Squarespace's mobile responsive templates works with their e-commerce
[01:31:57.680 --> 01:31:58.680]   system.
[01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:00.720]   They will help you with inventory tracking.
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:03.040]   They will calculate taxes everywhere.
[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:04.360]   They will handle shipping.
[01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:06.560]   You can even do coupons.
[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:11.080]   And you get unlimited pages, unlimited galleries, unlimited blogs, unlimited bandwidth, unlimited
[01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:12.080]   storage.
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:15.000]   This is $24 a month with an annual plan.
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.680]   $30 month to month.
[01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:17.680]   It's unbelievable.
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:22.720]   If you don't e-commerce, take $8 off and you've got a great solution with the unlimited plan.
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:25.720]   Everything unlimited, you still have the e-commerce.
[01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:26.720]   Squarespace is incredible.
[01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:31.280]   I got to tell you, if you're ready to start a blog, it'd be a great thing to do for somebody
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:35.760]   who's had got a wedding or in fact, that's what I think, who was it?
[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:37.320]   Jolie O'Dell.
[01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:39.920]   She and her husband, they were going to do a website.
[01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:40.920]   Was it Jolie?
[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:41.920]   It was somebody.
[01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:42.920]   I think so.
[01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:44.760]   And they used a special wedding thing and it never worked.
[01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:45.760]   They went to Squarespace.
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:46.760]   It never goes down.
[01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:49.200]   It's always up, great site.
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:54.160]   If you know somebody having a baby, if you just want to start selling online, there's
[01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:55.160]   nothing better.
[01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:59.920]   Squarespace.com, the most powerful and flexible e-commerce solution I've ever seen.
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:04.200]   And it's just $24 a month when you sign up for a year, or $30 for a monthly plan.
[01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:06.360]   Do get the year plan because it was Veronica.
[01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:07.360]   That's right.
[01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:08.360]   Thank you.
[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:09.360]   Chat room always knows.
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:10.840]   It was Veronica Belmont and Ryan Block.
[01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:12.680]   They had originally, Ryan was on the show.
[01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:16.040]   They said, "We set up a wedding site with some service provider that does wedding sites."
[01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:17.040]   This is something for you to remember.
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:19.080]   You and Ashley, any day now.
[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:20.080]   Jesus.
[01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:21.880]   I scared the hell out of him.
[01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:22.880]   Did you see that?
[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:23.880]   He turned white as a shit.
[01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:24.880]   He did.
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:25.880]   It was weird.
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:28.880]   Yeah, I got a comedy album.
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:31.880]   That's our folks.
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:34.480]   He's got Squarespace.
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:38.800]   He's being very quiet because we will not let him do commercials on an SFW anymore because
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:39.960]   he gets us in such trouble.
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:41.520]   You want to compare Squarespace to Jesus?
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:42.520]   You can.
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:44.680]   No, listen.
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:45.680]   Thank you.
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:48.120]   Squarespace.com, offer code TWIT4.
[01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:50.400]   Take 10% off your first purchase.
[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:54.240]   Make it the year plan and they'll even hook up the domain name and all of that.
[01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:55.240]   Squarespace.com.
[01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:56.240]   Nicely done.
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:57.240]   I try.
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:33:58.240]   I try.
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:01.920]   Number one comedy album on iTunes right now.
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:02.920]   It's called?
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:06.080]   Night Attack 2, Enjoy the Garden.
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:07.080]   Is there ...
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:08.080]   Enjoy the Garden.
[01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:09.080]   I don't know.
[01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:10.080]   I'm just going to download it and listen.
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:11.080]   No, it's a non sequitur.
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:13.040]   Actually, speaking of weddings, me and Brian were at a wedding.
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:14.040]   You got married.
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:15.040]   I did not.
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:16.040]   I did not get married.
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:17.040]   I was originally not married to Brian.
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:19.720]   I attended a wedding with Brian and it was at the Berkeley Botanical Gardens and there
[01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:22.840]   was a big sign that said, "Enjoy the Garden."
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:23.840]   We thought it was very funny.
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:25.200]   Oh, so it's tied to a wedding.
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:26.200]   Yeah.
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:27.200]   Very nice.
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:29.160]   That picture, the picture that's on the cover of the album was taken at that wedding.
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:30.160]   That's very nice.
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:32.320]   It involved lucha libre masks and fake mustaches.
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:35.400]   They had a wedding with fake mustaches and lucha libre masks?
[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:36.400]   Lucha libre.
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:37.400]   Lucha libre.
[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:40.240]   I'm thinking of Macho Libre, the movie.
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:41.240]   Sure.
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:42.240]   That's different.
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:43.240]   That's different.
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:44.240]   Nacho Libre is different.
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:47.160]   It's about the Mexican wrestling style, lucha libre.
[01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:49.080]   So there actually is somebody named lucha libre?
[01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:50.760]   No, that's a kind of wrestling.
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:51.760]   Oh, it's a kind.
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:52.760]   The masked Mexican wrestling.
[01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:53.760]   Oh, it's a kind.
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:54.760]   It's that masked.
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:55.760]   Mexican wrestling.
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:56.760]   Got it.
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:57.760]   Got it.
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:34:58.760]   Got it.
[01:34:58.760 --> 01:34:59.760]   Got it.
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:01.760]   Moving along, let's see, just checking to see what stories we've missed so far.
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:07.360]   Viacom, we mentioned this in our This Week in YouTube show earlier, once again loses in
[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:10.360]   their billion dollar lawsuit against YouTube.
[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:13.920]   I don't know how long they can keep this going, but they say we're appealing.
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:15.400]   Probably go to the Supreme Court.
[01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:18.200]   That Funny or Die Steve Jobs movie, I, Steve is out.
[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:19.200]   Anybody seen it?
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:20.200]   Oh, what is it?
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:21.200]   It's like seven years long.
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:22.200]   No, is it?
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:23.200]   Have you seen it?
[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:24.200]   No.
[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:27.600]   It's like I saw the running time of 70 minutes and I'm like, stop it.
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:28.600]   It's a movie.
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:29.600]   It's a real movie.
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:30.600]   Well, good for them.
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:33.600]   With Justin Long as a...
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:36.640]   70 minute YouTube funny or die...
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:37.640]   It's 80 minutes.
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:38.640]   It's 80 minutes.
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:39.640]   80 minute bit?
[01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:41.640]   No, it's a full movie.
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:45.160]   I just, I don't know, when I think of Funny or Die, I think of fun, hilarious short clips.
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:47.560]   For Christ's sake, we get two hours out of lame tech news.
[01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:50.120]   I think they could get to an hour and a half out of Steve Jobs.
[01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:51.560]   Did you watch it?
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:52.560]   I haven't seen it yet.
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:53.560]   Well, and that's the point.
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:54.560]   Did you see it?
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:55.560]   Is that no one's seen it?
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:56.560]   Did you see it Lauren?
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:57.560]   No, I wanted to do this show.
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:35:58.560]   Instead I had a budget in my time.
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:03.760]   I said, can I get two hours for Leo, two hours for Justin Long, and I chose Leo over Justin
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:04.760]   Long.
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:05.760]   I feel that was the right choice.
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:06.760]   You are a goddess.
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:07.760]   Very wise.
[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:13.040]   I'm dumping that Anne Hathaway right now, and Taylor Swift, sorry, no time for you.
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:14.040]   You're out.
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:17.360]   You guys are never, ever getting back together.
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:22.040]   In fact, he knew she was trouble when she walked in.
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:25.760]   I am the bad boyfriend that she keeps singing about.
[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:27.000]   Forget that John Mayer guy.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.920]   He has nothing on me.
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:34.640]   Nokia's Lumia hit record high sales, 5.6 million units in the first quarter.
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:35.640]   Record sales for what?
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:36.640]   For Nokia Lumia's?
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:37.640]   Well, good.
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:39.080]   I'm not surprised they got that many.
[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:42.720]   It's a good number, but it's nothing compared to like 30 million iPhones.
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:47.400]   I'll tell you, I parked for a record number of times on April 21 here in Petaluma.
[01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:48.400]   A new record.
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:52.520]   One time, 100% increase over previous times I've parked in Petaluma.
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:53.520]   Pretty impressive.
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:54.880]   It's crushing the iPhone in Poland.
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:55.880]   Don't forget that.
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:56.880]   That's right.
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:57.880]   So this is the funniest thing.
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:36:59.040]   Who was it that said this?
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:02.280]   In four countries- Microsoft.
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:06.640]   Microsoft said in four markets, not countries, four markets were number one.
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:07.640]   Crushing the iPhone.
[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:08.640]   So what?
[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:09.640]   It's Poland?
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:12.360]   So these are places where they don't sell the iPhone?
[01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:14.480]   Yeah, some neighborhood in Kazakhstan.
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:17.280]   I got to look this up.
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:19.880]   There's a flea market in Moscow.
[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:20.880]   You're pretty close.
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:24.320]   Russia was one of the markets.
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:25.320]   Do you have that Jason?
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:26.320]   Huge in Zimbabwe.
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:27.320]   I'm pulling it up.
[01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:28.320]   Yeah, we covered it.
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:30.680]   I'm pulling it up on Znet real quick here.
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:35.720]   Because it was kind of a funny- and somebody said, "Well, what countries?"
[01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:37.840]   And one of them is a region.
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:40.000]   It is an Eastern European region.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:41.560]   Yes, it's a block.
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:42.560]   The block.
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:43.560]   Yeah.
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:45.520]   One of them I think was Russia.
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:46.520]   Anyway.
[01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:49.120]   Well, let's get it somebody.
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:50.120]   It's in seven countries.
[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:52.080]   Okay, so actually here's the- this is Microsoft.
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:53.080]   Here's the quote.
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:54.080]   Sure.
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:55.080]   Yeah.
[01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:56.080]   And this is Microsoft's chief counsel or somebody like that?
[01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:57.080]   I can't remember.
[01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:58.080]   I think I've heard it in Latveria.
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:37:59.080]   It's huge.
[01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:00.080]   Latveria, it's big.
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:01.080]   Yeah.
[01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:02.080]   Sorry, let me pull it.
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:03.080]   Do you need the link to the link?
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:04.080]   Yeah.
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:07.840]   No, no, that's all right.
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:08.840]   Just tell us.
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:15.080]   So yeah, Microsoft trumpeted that it outsold- that the Windows Phone platform had outsold
[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:17.720]   iPhone in seven markets.
[01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:18.720]   Wow.
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:27.520]   Those markets were Argentina, India, Holland, Russia, South Africa.
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:32.200]   And the seventh market was a collection of countries including Croatia that IDC labels
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:34.920]   the rest of Central and Eastern Europe.
[01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:35.920]   Wow.
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:36.920]   But that's-
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:37.920]   Well, good for them.
[01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:38.920]   So great.
[01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:39.920]   India is a big market.
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:42.640]   Winning, probably because they're not selling the iPhone in India, would I guess.
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:44.000]   Yeah, that was my guess too.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.560]   And they've given these things away, right?
[01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:46.560]   What are they, $14?
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:49.800]   You can trade a ham sandwich for it?
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:50.800]   Apparently.
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:52.400]   Yeah, it is the lower priced one.
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:53.400]   So we have a sort of-
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:54.400]   No, it's the cheap one.
[01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:59.840]   We have a writer in Poland that went and sort of delved into this, right?
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:09.320]   And so the writer in Poland sort of came up with the fact that it's- and that obviously
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:11.760]   it's price, right?
[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:15.840]   They're selling it at much lower price and the iPhone is not being subsidized in those
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:17.760]   areas so there you go.
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:18.760]   It was Frank X.
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:24.560]   Shaw, corporate vice president of corporate communications at Microsoft, then dropped
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:28.860]   it just as like an offhand comment in a blog post.
[01:39:28.860 --> 01:39:30.440]   And then people said, "Well really?
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:31.440]   Where?"
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:33.040]   And that's it, that's the answer.
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:35.480]   Hey, you gotta find the victories where you can.
[01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:36.480]   And you know what?
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:37.480]   I like Windows Phone.
[01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:38.480]   Good for them.
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:39.480]   I like Windows Phone 8.
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:40.480]   I think it's a nice platform.
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:41.480]   I've never-
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:42.480]   Very pretty.
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:43.480]   It's very pretty.
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:44.480]   It is very pretty.
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:45.480]   It is smooth.
[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:46.480]   It runs nice.
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:47.480]   It's solid.
[01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:48.480]   It's solid.
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:49.480]   These are all things we could say about Taylor Swift.
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:50.480]   Taylor Swift is solid too.
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:51.480]   I don't know.
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:52.480]   I don't-
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:53.480]   She should get into this conversation.
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:54.480]   Solid.
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:55.480]   Twitter cuts off Flatter.
[01:39:55.480 --> 01:40:04.000]   Twitter is a weird kind of micro payment service that gives money to people if you get favorited.
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.160]   I have some Flatter dollars.
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:07.160]   I got some money.
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:08.160]   I got some like a dime.
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:09.720]   Yeah, it's not a lot of money.
[01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:11.680]   Well, it's better than nothing.
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:14.080]   But it's a Swedish startup.
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:17.080]   It was an online tip jar, used Twitter.
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:18.080]   So what was the deal with it?
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:24.300]   It tipped a dime to your favorite content producer using like on Facebook or favoriting
[01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:26.340]   on Twitter.
[01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:27.940]   Twitter was the biggest service for Flatter.
[01:40:27.940 --> 01:40:29.420]   Twitter just said, "No, sorry."
[01:40:29.420 --> 01:40:30.420]   So they would-
[01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:35.140]   So this is the second payment service that Twitter has cut off in the past week or so,
[01:40:35.140 --> 01:40:36.140]   right?
[01:40:36.140 --> 01:40:37.140]   Twitter wants it all.
[01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:38.140]   Well, I mean, are they-
[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:40.980]   Twitter has this habit now of saying, "No, really, develop for us.
[01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:41.980]   Develop for us."
[01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:43.980]   Oh, sorry, but we're going to close you off there.
[01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:44.980]   It's just kidding.
[01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:49.320]   But my question is, so I understand it's a kind of a different form of currency and you're
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:51.980]   getting paid for favoriting, but who really wants to exchange-
[01:40:51.980 --> 01:40:52.980]   Flatter dollars.
[01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:54.660]   ... payments on Twitter anyway?
[01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:56.260]   Yeah, that's what I don't get.
[01:40:56.260 --> 01:41:00.500]   I mean, there are a lot of interesting companies out there that are doing different forms of
[01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:04.980]   mobile payments through SMS, whether it's Venmo, which is acquired by Braintree, or
[01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:05.980]   look at it.
[01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:07.540]   Tons of companies in this space right now.
[01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:10.220]   Why would you develop a Twitter money exchange?
[01:41:10.220 --> 01:41:11.860]   But this is not a money exchange.
[01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:13.220]   This is more like, "I like John.
[01:41:13.220 --> 01:41:15.940]   I want to give him a little bit of money."
[01:41:15.940 --> 01:41:16.940]   It's kind of like a-
[01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:17.940]   It's Tencent, actually.
[01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:18.940]   Just give it to him.
[01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:19.940]   He's right there.
[01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:20.940]   Yeah, I have some right here.
[01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:21.940]   Just give me the dime.
[01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:22.940]   Here's a dime, kid.
[01:41:22.940 --> 01:41:23.940]   A shoelace.
[01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:24.940]   No one's getting a fee on top of it.
[01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:25.940]   No one's getting a-
[01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:26.940]   Exactly.
[01:41:26.940 --> 01:41:27.940]   He's going to bite the dime.
[01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:29.300]   Twitter also killing TweetDeck.
[01:41:29.300 --> 01:41:32.980]   Now, you may remember the way they acquired TweetDeck.
[01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:39.780]   Bill Gross's Idea Lab was about to buy it, and Twitter zoomed in and offered them a ton
[01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:44.580]   of money, not because they wanted TweetDeck, but because they didn't want ... What was
[01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:46.080]   Gross's Twitter company?
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:48.460]   He said, "We're going to replace Twitter, basically."
[01:41:48.460 --> 01:41:50.500]   Well, you haven't heard that before.
[01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:51.500]   He bought a bunch of the clients.
[01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:55.340]   Remember, he bought up a bunch of those ... God, which ones were they?
[01:41:55.340 --> 01:41:57.020]   He bought a bunch of the clients up.
[01:41:57.020 --> 01:41:58.020]   Right.
[01:41:58.020 --> 01:42:00.420]   It looked like he was making a play to be Twitter.
[01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:04.620]   If you have the clients, and then you offer a side service, and then people start using
[01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:08.180]   your side service, and you can ... Twitter bought TweetDeck for a lot of money.
[01:42:08.180 --> 01:42:09.180]   They're killing it.
[01:42:09.180 --> 01:42:15.340]   On May 7th, Android, iPhone, desktop, Air, and Facebook integration of TweetDeck.
[01:42:15.340 --> 01:42:16.340]   Boom.
[01:42:16.340 --> 01:42:22.740]   That Air app, I really hated all Air apps, except that original TweetDeck Air app.
[01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:28.260]   There still has been nothing that's quite as good as that original, in my opinion, TweetDeck
[01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:29.660]   Air app.
[01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:33.580]   There's been a lot of things that have tried to match it, including the TweetDeck native
[01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:38.460]   apps, and some others, including Hootsuite, and some more.
[01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:42.620]   None of them have been as good, or effective, or had as many really useful features as that
[01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:44.740]   original TweetDeck Adobe Air app.
[01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:50.020]   They were the first to have columns, so you'd have your home screen, you'd have your mentions,
[01:42:50.020 --> 01:42:53.900]   you'd have your direct messages, you could build searches, and you'd have a full screen.
[01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:56.340]   You could even devote a whole second screen to it.
[01:42:56.340 --> 01:42:58.380]   It was a great solution.
[01:42:58.380 --> 01:43:00.900]   What does Twitter play with all of these?
[01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:04.140]   Does anybody think that Twitter, besides myself, jumped the shark already?
[01:43:04.140 --> 01:43:05.140]   No, they're huge.
[01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:06.140]   I know they're huge.
[01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:07.140]   Now, I'm in Boston.
[01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:08.140]   Yeah.
[01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:10.460]   Everybody, and you know what?
[01:43:10.460 --> 01:43:11.460]   What's interesting is ...
[01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:12.460]   It's how I followed everything with the Boston thing.
[01:43:12.460 --> 01:43:15.420]   ... real people are using it.
[01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:20.060]   Tech Narate, maybe they moved to Google+ or somewhere, but real people now are using it.
[01:43:20.060 --> 01:43:21.060]   Yeah.
[01:43:21.060 --> 01:43:22.060]   All the kids have moved off of Facebook.
[01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:23.060]   I can't see it growing anymore.
[01:43:23.060 --> 01:43:24.060]   All the kids moved off of Facebook.
[01:43:24.060 --> 01:43:25.060]   That's right.
[01:43:25.060 --> 01:43:28.100]   The funny thing is now, kids are using it instead of Facebook because their parents,
[01:43:28.100 --> 01:43:32.140]   and their aunts, and uncles, and cousins, and stuff are on Facebook.
[01:43:32.140 --> 01:43:38.020]   It's almost like I see this funny thing with some people in my family who I won't mention,
[01:43:38.020 --> 01:43:43.060]   but their Facebook has these kind of antiseptic updates of they're working on their homework
[01:43:43.060 --> 01:43:44.060]   and doing that.
[01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:49.020]   Then over on Twitter, they're talking in the way that they really talk when they're with
[01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:50.020]   their friends.
[01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:53.020]   Who knows how to make a pipe out of an apple?
[01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:54.020]   I do, actually.
[01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:55.020]   It's very easy.
[01:43:55.020 --> 01:43:56.020]   You got a little foil, a little apple.
[01:43:56.020 --> 01:43:57.020]   Yeah, no problem.
[01:43:57.020 --> 01:43:58.020]   It's easy.
[01:43:58.020 --> 01:44:02.340]   What do you guys think about the Twitter music announcement this week?
[01:44:02.340 --> 01:44:04.540]   I actually like it.
[01:44:04.540 --> 01:44:07.980]   Finally, we have another way to buy music.
[01:44:07.980 --> 01:44:08.980]   Hooray!
[01:44:08.980 --> 01:44:10.660]   Yes, there's not enough ways.
[01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:14.100]   The proletariat rose up in singular cheer.
[01:44:14.100 --> 01:44:17.300]   I've been looking for a reason to buy music.
[01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:21.260]   I want to know when Leo is listening to Taylor Swift on repeat.
[01:44:21.260 --> 01:44:23.380]   You can now know what I'm listening to.
[01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:24.380]   Music.twitter.com.
[01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:25.900]   There's a web interface.
[01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:27.980]   There's an iPhone app.
[01:44:27.980 --> 01:44:33.060]   You can follow the people that you know, or you could follow popular people.
[01:44:33.060 --> 01:44:37.660]   It isn't just, by the way, a way to buy because you can tie it into your Spotify.
[01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:38.660]   Yeah.
[01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:42.580]   I think it's a good skin or interface for that.
[01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:47.460]   If I had that, I would be excited to see this new way to aggregate the very valuable data
[01:44:47.460 --> 01:44:52.020]   that is on Twitter to make my subscription worth more.
[01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:54.260]   But I don't have one of those, and so I don't care.
[01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:56.100]   Then you can buy it at iTunes.
[01:44:56.100 --> 01:44:57.100]   In that case, you're right.
[01:44:57.100 --> 01:44:58.100]   It is pretty crappy.
[01:44:58.100 --> 01:45:01.660]   I'm just not sure yet.
[01:45:01.660 --> 01:45:05.980]   If this was a swimming pool, I'd still be in the shallow end trying to figure out how
[01:45:05.980 --> 01:45:06.980]   warm the water is.
[01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:09.180]   I'm just not sure what the deal is with it yet.
[01:45:09.180 --> 01:45:18.060]   Well, I think if you contrast it to say Apple's Ping, it's what Ping should have been, right?
[01:45:18.060 --> 01:45:19.060]   True.
[01:45:19.060 --> 01:45:20.060]   Yeah.
[01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:21.060]   Low bar there.
[01:45:21.060 --> 01:45:23.980]   This is what people who I know are listening to.
[01:45:23.980 --> 01:45:29.740]   Justin Timberlake, Maroon 5, LMFAO, Nelly.
[01:45:29.740 --> 01:45:34.860]   All the things I can imagine you're listening to, Leo.
[01:45:34.860 --> 01:45:35.860]   These are people.
[01:45:35.860 --> 01:45:36.860]   So, okay.
[01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:37.860]   I know.
[01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:39.420]   This is like the most eclectic list ever.
[01:45:39.420 --> 01:45:40.420]   Because it's people I follow.
[01:45:40.420 --> 01:45:41.420]   Yeah.
[01:45:41.420 --> 01:45:42.420]   So then what good is it?
[01:45:42.420 --> 01:45:44.660]   Well, because I might say, "Hey, gosh, Jimi Hendrix.
[01:45:44.660 --> 01:45:45.660]   I never heard of him."
[01:45:45.660 --> 01:45:46.660]   Let me listen to that.
[01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:49.660]   Who wants to pump some party rock anthem?
[01:45:49.660 --> 01:45:53.140]   Look at Tanya Hall's listening to Cyndi Lauper's "True Colors."
[01:45:53.140 --> 01:45:54.300]   That's a song I haven't heard in a while.
[01:45:54.300 --> 01:45:55.740]   That's why I love you.
[01:45:55.740 --> 01:45:56.740]   Let me listen to that.
[01:45:56.740 --> 01:45:58.340]   See, this is like a time waster.
[01:45:58.340 --> 01:46:01.460]   It's a big time waster, but so is music in general.
[01:46:01.460 --> 01:46:02.460]   Not necessarily.
[01:46:02.460 --> 01:46:03.460]   Music is not a product.
[01:46:03.460 --> 01:46:04.740]   Oh, what do you listen to?
[01:46:04.740 --> 01:46:05.740]   Classic.
[01:46:05.740 --> 01:46:06.740]   Classic what?
[01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:07.740]   Music.
[01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:08.740]   Classical music.
[01:46:08.740 --> 01:46:09.740]   Classical music?
[01:46:09.740 --> 01:46:10.740]   No, classic.
[01:46:10.740 --> 01:46:11.740]   Classical music.
[01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:12.740]   Yeah, sure.
[01:46:12.740 --> 01:46:13.740]   Debussy, that sort of thing.
[01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:14.740]   Okay, yeah.
[01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:15.740]   No, because people say classic and they'll mean like John Fogerty.
[01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:19.940]   Well, I like John Fogerty, but no, that's not what I know.
[01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:21.820]   I'm always listening to stuff.
[01:46:21.820 --> 01:46:25.540]   Basically I have a classical music station since 1970-something.
[01:46:25.540 --> 01:46:29.700]   I've had a classical music station playing 24/7 in the front room of my house.
[01:46:29.700 --> 01:46:30.700]   Okay.
[01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:31.700]   John, don't you have like-
[01:46:31.700 --> 01:46:32.700]   Never turns it off.
[01:46:32.700 --> 01:46:33.700]   No, I never turn it off.
[01:46:33.700 --> 01:46:35.700]   He never turned it off since 1970.
[01:46:35.700 --> 01:46:36.700]   Yes.
[01:46:36.700 --> 01:46:37.700]   Pretty much.
[01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:38.700]   That's a long time to run a Pandora station.
[01:46:38.700 --> 01:46:42.660]   And John, John, do you feel the need to share that with people when you're listening to
[01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:45.300]   it or field recommendations from people online when you're-
[01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:46.300]   No, not really.
[01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:47.300]   No.
[01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:48.300]   Right?
[01:46:48.300 --> 01:46:50.740]   If there were a wine Twitter where people were recommending, "Here's what I'm drinking-"
[01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:52.740]   No, here's what I have a problem with.
[01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:55.420]   That sounds good at the beginning and then it becomes a cacophony.
[01:46:55.420 --> 01:46:56.420]   In fact, this is what happens-
[01:46:56.420 --> 01:46:57.740]   This is a cacophony right here.
[01:46:57.740 --> 01:46:58.740]   Yeah.
[01:46:58.740 --> 01:47:01.900]   And so you get the recommendations are good when the connoisseurs are there by themselves
[01:47:01.900 --> 01:47:06.660]   and then the public comes in with their lame recommendations, no offense public, but generally
[01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:09.680]   speaking most people who drink wine don't know what they're doing.
[01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:14.020]   And then it becomes a mess and it's like you can't sift through it, so you just go find
[01:47:14.020 --> 01:47:15.820]   the expert or two that at least you can agree with.
[01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:18.980]   I do have to say though, and we were talking about music recommendations a couple of weeks
[01:47:18.980 --> 01:47:25.100]   ago before this launched, RDO's had this, Apple tried it with Ping and Facebook has
[01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:26.700]   sort of the same idea.
[01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:28.060]   I think this is a pretty well done.
[01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:29.540]   Now Lauren, you're the youngest person here.
[01:47:29.540 --> 01:47:32.300]   You probably actually still listen to current music.
[01:47:32.300 --> 01:47:34.420]   Did you look at the website, music.twitter.com?
[01:47:34.420 --> 01:47:36.100]   Did you see anything of value in it?
[01:47:36.100 --> 01:47:37.100]   No, I didn't.
[01:47:37.100 --> 01:47:43.140]   I downloaded the app and I personally find music listening to be more of a private experience.
[01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:47.420]   I've tried the sound tracking app, I've tried Spotify, I've written a column about RDO back
[01:47:47.420 --> 01:47:52.180]   in the early days when they first launched it and I have never personally seen the appeal
[01:47:52.180 --> 01:47:56.900]   of wanting to share everything I'm listening to all the time or get recommendations that
[01:47:56.900 --> 01:47:57.900]   way either.
[01:47:57.900 --> 01:48:01.980]   I just find it to be more of a private listening experience unless you're on a social setting,
[01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:04.340]   in which case everyone's listening to the same thing.
[01:48:04.340 --> 01:48:07.220]   But do I think that it looks nice so far?
[01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:11.500]   I do think that Twitter has done a nice job in terms of interface.
[01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:13.820]   I think that you're going to see Twitter, I don't know this, but I think you're going
[01:48:13.820 --> 01:48:18.820]   to see Twitter try to get its Twitter tentacles in other areas too, like maybe they'll launch
[01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:19.820]   something for TV.
[01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:20.820]   TV?
[01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:21.820]   TV?
[01:48:21.820 --> 01:48:23.460]   Thank you for saying that.
[01:48:23.460 --> 01:48:27.100]   I'm usually embarrassed to think if people could actually see my playlist and it's like,
[01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:29.260]   "Ooh, no, I don't want to really let anybody see that."
[01:48:29.260 --> 01:48:30.260]   Oh, good Lord, yeah.
[01:48:30.260 --> 01:48:31.820]   Yeah, I'm a repeat offender.
[01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:35.660]   I get hooked on a song and I listen to it 17 times before I'm sick of it and my neighbors
[01:48:35.660 --> 01:48:39.140]   probably hate me and I don't want everyone to see that.
[01:48:39.140 --> 01:48:45.460]   I remember when Spotify first went free with the Facebook login and many of my friends-
[01:48:45.460 --> 01:48:46.860]   The friction free sharing?
[01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:48.180]   Well, number one, yeah.
[01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:52.260]   You just realize how terrible the music tastes are among all of my friends.
[01:48:52.260 --> 01:48:55.340]   They all stink at listening to music.
[01:48:55.340 --> 01:48:59.140]   I think this is, it's interesting and I totally see where you're coming from, Lauren.
[01:48:59.140 --> 01:49:02.300]   I think it is missing the very key component.
[01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:06.900]   I think I heard Sarah Lane bring this up on Tech News today, an up or down feature to
[01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:14.100]   have it honed a little bit more toward your taste to be like, "Well, this guy is populating
[01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:17.500]   my feed and I know he stinks at listening to music.
[01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:18.500]   He's terrible.
[01:49:18.500 --> 01:49:19.500]   Let me just turn him off."
[01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:20.500]   That would be easy to add.
[01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:23.860]   I suspect that they're going to absolutely do this for TV.
[01:49:23.860 --> 01:49:24.860]   They're going to do it for music.
[01:49:24.860 --> 01:49:26.680]   They'll do it for merchandise.
[01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:28.180]   It's a great revenue opportunity for them.
[01:49:28.180 --> 01:49:31.940]   They could take a cut of sales.
[01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:34.820]   Remember how popular Scrambling was with Last FM?
[01:49:34.820 --> 01:49:36.540]   No, I don't.
[01:49:36.540 --> 01:49:37.980]   You have no idea what I'm talking about.
[01:49:37.980 --> 01:49:38.980]   I didn't scrub.
[01:49:38.980 --> 01:49:39.980]   It was huge.
[01:49:39.980 --> 01:49:44.660]   Well, it was mostly, it was not in the US for a long time.
[01:49:44.660 --> 01:49:48.940]   Our British listeners and international listeners know all about it.
[01:49:48.940 --> 01:49:51.860]   It was very popular and that's effectively what this is.
[01:49:51.860 --> 01:49:55.020]   For some reason, it worked well there and it doesn't.
[01:49:55.020 --> 01:49:57.900]   Maybe because it was, and this is the same thing with Google Plus, with Twitter, with
[01:49:57.900 --> 01:49:58.900]   everything.
[01:49:58.900 --> 01:50:01.940]   If it's a small universe of sophisticated listeners, then it's cool.
[01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:07.140]   As soon as it's the unwashed masses, it's LMFAO and Taylor Swift.
[01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:08.140]   Taylor Swift.
[01:50:08.140 --> 01:50:09.140]   Community doesn't scale.
[01:50:09.140 --> 01:50:10.140]   It doesn't.
[01:50:10.140 --> 01:50:12.380]   It's a whole concept of community doesn't scale.
[01:50:12.380 --> 01:50:13.380]   It doesn't.
[01:50:13.380 --> 01:50:14.380]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:15.380]   But you could tune this.
[01:50:15.380 --> 01:50:16.900]   I mean, you could change the people you follow.
[01:50:16.900 --> 01:50:20.740]   I guess since you're not following people based on their musical taste on Twitter, it
[01:50:20.740 --> 01:50:22.740]   might backfire a little.
[01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:23.740]   Yeah.
[01:50:23.740 --> 01:50:27.500]   Because by and large, we don't like what everybody else is listening to.
[01:50:27.500 --> 01:50:31.860]   I mean, that's what we've seen as the nitrification of everything on the internet has continued
[01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:36.660]   to populate our own worldview that we care about what we care about, we don't care about
[01:50:36.660 --> 01:50:37.660]   what the guy next to me cares about.
[01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:42.580]   It all began for me when AOL opened its doors to the internet.
[01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:47.260]   Remember that summer, John?
[01:50:47.260 --> 01:50:49.740]   The internet was a nice, calm, quiet place.
[01:50:49.740 --> 01:50:51.740]   It was just you, me, a few close friends.
[01:50:51.740 --> 01:50:53.940]   And then AOL said, "Hey, welcome.
[01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:54.940]   We're going to give you the internet."
[01:50:54.940 --> 01:50:55.940]   Yeah, they killed themselves in the process.
[01:50:55.940 --> 01:51:00.140]   This sounds like one of the casual encounters bits from Game On.
[01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:03.100]   It all started in a small bar in Tijuana.
[01:51:03.100 --> 01:51:06.940]   It was the summer that AOL opened its doors to the internet.
[01:51:06.940 --> 01:51:09.100]   Everything went downhill after that.
[01:51:09.100 --> 01:51:10.540]   Hey, let's find out what you missed.
[01:51:10.540 --> 01:51:13.700]   If you missed this week on Twitter.
[01:51:13.700 --> 01:51:16.660]   Previously on Twitter, this week in YouTube.
[01:51:16.660 --> 01:51:18.740]   Well, maybe you should watch this ad.
[01:51:18.740 --> 01:51:20.380]   All plus size products.
[01:51:20.380 --> 01:51:21.380]   I should fit in.
[01:51:21.380 --> 01:51:22.380]   I should ship my pants.
[01:51:22.380 --> 01:51:23.380]   What?
[01:51:23.380 --> 01:51:24.380]   Right here.
[01:51:24.380 --> 01:51:25.380]   Ship my pants.
[01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:26.380]   Right here.
[01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:27.380]   You hear that?
[01:51:27.380 --> 01:51:28.380]   I can ship my pants for free.
[01:51:28.380 --> 01:51:29.380]   I just may ship my pants.
[01:51:29.380 --> 01:51:30.380]   It's a real catered ad.
[01:51:30.380 --> 01:51:31.380]   I think it's a real ad.
[01:51:31.380 --> 01:51:32.380]   And I think whoever did it's brilliant, but I don't think it's airing on television.
[01:51:32.380 --> 01:51:33.380]   I think it's YouTube.
[01:51:33.380 --> 01:51:34.380]   Oh, no.
[01:51:34.380 --> 01:51:35.380]   You don't think this can air on TV?
[01:51:35.380 --> 01:51:36.380]   That's YouTube only.
[01:51:36.380 --> 01:51:37.380]   This week in Enterprise TV.
[01:51:37.380 --> 01:51:44.740]   When we have these public cloud utilities that people are so used to using and they're
[01:51:44.740 --> 01:51:45.740]   dropping Enterprise.
[01:51:45.740 --> 01:51:46.740]   It's a very scary shot.
[01:51:46.740 --> 01:51:47.740]   They're violating pretty much every...
[01:51:47.740 --> 01:51:48.740]   I do not like this shot.
[01:51:48.740 --> 01:51:49.740]   All about it.
[01:51:49.740 --> 01:51:50.740]   It's like the Jedi Council on Star Wars.
[01:51:50.740 --> 01:51:51.740]   I really like this.
[01:51:51.740 --> 01:51:52.740]   It's a creepy scene.
[01:51:52.740 --> 01:52:00.580]   It's like a fusion house, something that's sort of between a home with a really crappy
[01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:01.580]   widget.
[01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:05.860]   A place that I could go when I want to go, but maybe isn't there all the time keeping
[01:52:05.860 --> 01:52:06.860]   me from doing other stuff.
[01:52:06.860 --> 01:52:07.860]   Facebook Tahoe.
[01:52:07.860 --> 01:52:16.460]   It's been a while since I synced any of my iDevices to a Windows machine, but I know
[01:52:16.460 --> 01:52:17.700]   a lot of you out there do.
[01:52:17.700 --> 01:52:24.100]   I think cross-platform dutips make all our lives just a little bit more harmonious.
[01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:25.820]   Twit for justice.
[01:52:25.820 --> 01:52:26.820]   That was a highlight.
[01:52:26.820 --> 01:52:27.820]   There we go.
[01:52:27.820 --> 01:52:28.820]   All right.
[01:52:28.820 --> 01:52:32.380]   For your cross-platform dutips, you've found the right network.
[01:52:32.380 --> 01:52:34.140]   Our show today brought to you by audible.com.
[01:52:34.140 --> 01:52:36.740]   I have to say there is a social network of audible listeners.
[01:52:36.740 --> 01:52:41.180]   Whenever you go out and you meet somebody who listens to audible, we always go, "Oh,
[01:52:41.180 --> 01:52:42.180]   what do you like?
[01:52:42.180 --> 01:52:43.180]   What are you listening to these days?"
[01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:44.180]   There are so many great books.
[01:52:44.180 --> 01:52:48.180]   I do want to point you to, if you didn't see it, Wednesday we interviewed Patrick Rothfuss,
[01:52:48.180 --> 01:52:52.620]   who wrote the amazing King Killer Chronicles, The Name of the Wind.
[01:52:52.620 --> 01:52:53.620]   Listening to that right now on audible.
[01:52:53.620 --> 01:52:54.620]   It is incredible.
[01:52:54.620 --> 01:52:57.260]   I just have so much respect for him.
[01:52:57.260 --> 01:52:58.260]   That's available on audible.
[01:52:58.260 --> 01:53:03.860]   I'll tell you what, it is the best 48 hours you've ever spent.
[01:53:03.860 --> 01:53:07.620]   It's long, but you're going to get your money's worth.
[01:53:07.620 --> 01:53:08.620]   Here's the deal.
[01:53:08.620 --> 01:53:11.540]   If you go to audible.com, you can get both books of the King Killer Chronicles.
[01:53:11.540 --> 01:53:13.380]   The third one not yet out.
[01:53:13.380 --> 01:53:14.380]   He's still working on it.
[01:53:14.380 --> 01:53:15.940]   I didn't pressure him.
[01:53:15.940 --> 01:53:19.260]   You can get both books for free.
[01:53:19.260 --> 01:53:25.500]   Right now, if you go to audible.com/twittwo, you'll be signing up for Audible's platinum
[01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:26.500]   account.
[01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:27.500]   That's two books a month.
[01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:30.980]   Actually, they're on sale right now, so 10 bucks if you want to just buy them all
[01:53:30.980 --> 01:53:31.980]   on a card.
[01:53:31.980 --> 01:53:34.140]   Why not get them free?
[01:53:34.140 --> 01:53:37.020]   The platinum account is two books a month, two credits a month.
[01:53:37.020 --> 01:53:41.460]   That's two books for most books.
[01:53:41.460 --> 01:53:43.620]   You can cancel it any time in the first 30 days.
[01:53:43.620 --> 01:53:45.380]   You will pay nothing, but the books are yours forever.
[01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:46.380]   I take it back.
[01:53:46.380 --> 01:53:49.380]   I'm looking at this now.
[01:53:49.380 --> 01:53:51.820]   It's 69, 71 hours.
[01:53:51.820 --> 01:53:52.820]   Boom.
[01:53:52.820 --> 01:53:54.700]   71 hours for free.
[01:53:54.700 --> 01:54:03.820]   If you're measuring your book buying dollar by price per minute, there is no better tonnage
[01:54:03.820 --> 01:54:04.880]   available.
[01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:05.880]   That is a good deal.
[01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:07.220]   Patrick is amazing.
[01:54:07.220 --> 01:54:08.220]   Highly recommend it.
[01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:10.100]   He's a good reader too.
[01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:12.620]   He's good, Nick Podell does a great job with it.
[01:54:12.620 --> 01:54:14.020]   Audible's got 100,000 books.
[01:54:14.020 --> 01:54:15.700]   You're sure to find something you like.
[01:54:15.700 --> 01:54:18.100]   Everything from thrillers, science fiction, nonfiction.
[01:54:18.100 --> 01:54:19.820]   I listen to a lot of history.
[01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:23.620]   The Pulitzer Prize winning Orphan Master's Son is available on Audible.
[01:54:23.620 --> 01:54:28.500]   If you'd like to keep up with the prize winning fiction and nonfiction, it's all here.
[01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:32.660]   You got to get it for free right now if you go to audible.com/twittwo.
[01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:36.340]   Two books, yours free at audible.com.
[01:54:36.340 --> 01:54:38.820]   Don't forget to follow them on Twitter too.
[01:54:38.820 --> 01:54:40.900]   Lots of great recommendations.
[01:54:40.900 --> 01:54:44.700]   They're audible_com on Twitter.
[01:54:44.700 --> 01:54:47.340]   I can't go to the site.
[01:54:47.340 --> 01:54:48.340]   What's that?
[01:54:48.340 --> 01:54:49.340]   I got an Audible recommendation.
[01:54:49.340 --> 01:54:51.220]   This is very dorky.
[01:54:51.220 --> 01:54:56.660]   I always find new stuff on Audible and it surprises me and I get excited about it.
[01:54:56.660 --> 01:54:59.060]   It's called the Shakespeare Appreciated series.
[01:54:59.060 --> 01:55:02.540]   This is maybe because I was just in London.
[01:55:02.540 --> 01:55:04.100]   This is Julius Caesar.
[01:55:04.100 --> 01:55:09.820]   Literally, it's the Julius Caesar, but it's thespians doing Julius Caesar and then they've
[01:55:09.820 --> 01:55:14.740]   got a narrator that's almost like this professor that sort of stops it and says, "Okay, hold
[01:55:14.740 --> 01:55:15.740]   on."
[01:55:15.740 --> 01:55:16.740]   Oh, this is great.
[01:55:16.740 --> 01:55:19.860]   They just said it was, boom, and then they bring that in and they sort of give you an
[01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:20.860]   interpretation.
[01:55:20.860 --> 01:55:21.860]   They talk about the history.
[01:55:21.860 --> 01:55:22.860]   They put it in context.
[01:55:22.860 --> 01:55:23.860]   So they're like breaking it down.
[01:55:23.860 --> 01:55:24.860]   Yeah, but it's the whole play.
[01:55:24.860 --> 01:55:25.860]   It breaks it down.
[01:55:25.860 --> 01:55:26.860]   Yeah, but it's the whole play.
[01:55:26.860 --> 01:55:29.300]   So it's the play on a bridge plus the commentary, which is great.
[01:55:29.300 --> 01:55:30.300]   Oh, that's perfect.
[01:55:30.300 --> 01:55:31.300]   I'm getting this.
[01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:32.620]   With thespians doing it.
[01:55:32.620 --> 01:55:33.620]   You can do any of them.
[01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:36.580]   I love the Caesar one because it's one of my favorites and I always try to read it around
[01:55:36.580 --> 01:55:37.580]   the Ides of March.
[01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:40.700]   I'm about a month late, but yeah, there you go.
[01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:41.700]   You got all of them.
[01:55:41.700 --> 01:55:42.700]   You can do-
[01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:43.700]   Romeo and Juliet, Twelfth Night.
[01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:48.900]   Here's Hamlet, Macbeth, Henry V, Hank Sank is we in the know, call him.
[01:55:48.900 --> 01:55:49.900]   Hank Sank.
[01:55:49.900 --> 01:55:50.900]   Hank Sank.
[01:55:50.900 --> 01:55:51.900]   It's a classic.
[01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:52.900]   Big in Paris.
[01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:53.900]   This is good.
[01:55:53.900 --> 01:55:54.900]   Thank you, Jason.
[01:55:54.900 --> 01:55:55.900]   I didn't even know about this.
[01:55:55.900 --> 01:56:01.100]   That's one of the fun things about Audible and you see what just happened to social network.
[01:56:01.100 --> 01:56:02.100]   Hey, have you listened to it?
[01:56:02.100 --> 01:56:03.100]   It's really awesome.
[01:56:03.100 --> 01:56:05.820]   I love nonfiction, just crushed inside Scientology.
[01:56:05.820 --> 01:56:07.580]   Oh, I got to get that.
[01:56:07.580 --> 01:56:08.580]   I forgot all about it.
[01:56:08.580 --> 01:56:09.580]   Oh man, it is awesome.
[01:56:09.580 --> 01:56:10.580]   I'm putting that on my wish list.
[01:56:10.580 --> 01:56:16.260]   I listened to it and now I'm clear on the bridge to total Audible listenership.
[01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:17.860]   Oh boy.
[01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:21.900]   They do have those apps and they should add that as one of the badges because they have
[01:56:21.900 --> 01:56:26.180]   Audible apps for iPhone and Android and you get badges for listening.
[01:56:26.180 --> 01:56:28.020]   By the way, their new app is awesome.
[01:56:28.020 --> 01:56:30.820]   If you have an iPhone, I don't know what it is on Android.
[01:56:30.820 --> 01:56:31.820]   Same thing.
[01:56:31.820 --> 01:56:32.820]   Same thing, big buttons.
[01:56:32.820 --> 01:56:36.220]   Very, very good and also it fixes something that used to bother me.
[01:56:36.220 --> 01:56:40.780]   You used to not be able to download anything unless you were on Wi-Fi.
[01:56:40.780 --> 01:56:47.180]   Now over your data connection, you can download the first usually three hours of your books.
[01:56:47.180 --> 01:56:49.180]   That's nice because if you're traveling, you want to get at least...
[01:56:49.180 --> 01:56:50.180]   Oh man, I travel a ton.
[01:56:50.180 --> 01:56:53.020]   It is an absolute lifesaver.
[01:56:53.020 --> 01:56:54.820]   I just added that to my wish list.
[01:56:54.820 --> 01:56:55.820]   I don't have any credits.
[01:56:55.820 --> 01:56:56.820]   I must have bought some books.
[01:56:56.820 --> 01:56:57.820]   That's great.
[01:56:57.820 --> 01:56:59.740]   The Inside Scientology book is great because obviously...
[01:56:59.740 --> 01:57:00.980]   It just came out a couple of months ago.
[01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:02.740]   I think it's blowing the lid off of that.
[01:57:02.740 --> 01:57:08.820]   All jokes aside, it is, it strives to be as fair a representation to Scientology and the
[01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:13.260]   people that run it as possible and it is extraordinarily interesting.
[01:57:13.260 --> 01:57:16.580]   Speaking of nonfiction, the new Sheryl Sandberg book too.
[01:57:16.580 --> 01:57:17.580]   It's very good.
[01:57:17.580 --> 01:57:18.580]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:57:18.580 --> 01:57:19.580]   Lean in.
[01:57:19.580 --> 01:57:20.580]   Lots of good stuff.
[01:57:20.580 --> 01:57:21.580]   Topping all the lists right now.
[01:57:21.580 --> 01:57:24.340]   Topping eDownloads and...
[01:57:24.340 --> 01:57:25.340]   Think about it, Lauren.
[01:57:25.340 --> 01:57:26.340]   You're busy.
[01:57:26.340 --> 01:57:27.340]   You want to read.
[01:57:27.340 --> 01:57:28.340]   You want to listen.
[01:57:28.340 --> 01:57:29.760]   You get in the subway.
[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:30.760]   You can listen.
[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:33.140]   You don't have to hear the strange music playing.
[01:57:33.140 --> 01:57:37.340]   You can, while you're at the gym working out, you can listen all the time.
[01:57:37.340 --> 01:57:38.340]   Lauren, you got to try it.
[01:57:38.340 --> 01:57:39.340]   Audible.com/twittoo.
[01:57:39.340 --> 01:57:40.340]   It is great.
[01:57:40.340 --> 01:57:41.340]   We're all fans.
[01:57:41.340 --> 01:57:42.340]   Yeah.
[01:57:42.340 --> 01:57:44.900]   I would not read books if it weren't for Audible.
[01:57:44.900 --> 01:57:45.900]   And I still don't.
[01:57:45.900 --> 01:57:46.900]   I listen to them and lie.
[01:57:46.900 --> 01:57:47.900]   Apparently, you don't read.
[01:57:47.900 --> 01:57:48.900]   But who does?
[01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:49.900]   You like Samuel Barber?
[01:57:49.900 --> 01:57:50.900]   He's a classic.
[01:57:50.900 --> 01:57:51.900]   What about him?
[01:57:51.900 --> 01:57:52.900]   You like him?
[01:57:52.900 --> 01:57:53.900]   I've never read him.
[01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:56.900]   No, he's a classical composer.
[01:57:56.900 --> 01:57:57.900]   British.
[01:57:57.900 --> 01:57:58.900]   I don't know him.
[01:57:58.900 --> 01:57:59.900]   Okay, so there you go.
[01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:02.940]   I do like Wagner, who somebody mentioned in the chat room.
[01:58:02.940 --> 01:58:03.940]   You like Wagner?
[01:58:03.940 --> 01:58:04.940]   Yeah, I do actually.
[01:58:04.940 --> 01:58:06.660]   I have both of them.
[01:58:06.660 --> 01:58:09.340]   Also ... There was two Vogners?
[01:58:09.340 --> 01:58:10.340]   Yeah.
[01:58:10.340 --> 01:58:12.620]   Wagner I and then Wagner II Electric Boogaloo.
[01:58:12.620 --> 01:58:13.620]   Maybe more.
[01:58:13.620 --> 01:58:14.620]   It's very good.
[01:58:14.620 --> 01:58:18.700]   Wagner II Electric Boogaloo was one of my favorites.
[01:58:18.700 --> 01:58:21.620]   It's only the unedited album.
[01:58:21.620 --> 01:58:25.980]   I think we have a show titled Ladies and Gentlemen.
[01:58:25.980 --> 01:58:26.980]   The EP.
[01:58:26.980 --> 01:58:28.620]   There's no wine recommendations for Costco.
[01:58:28.620 --> 01:58:32.580]   Okay, Dish, you think this is crazy?
[01:58:32.580 --> 01:58:35.220]   They are offering $25 billion for Sprint?
[01:58:35.220 --> 01:58:36.980]   Charlie Ergans is a mad man.
[01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:37.980]   He's going nuts.
[01:58:37.980 --> 01:58:40.060]   I think he's messing with people.
[01:58:40.060 --> 01:58:43.220]   He's just trolling on the largest stage possible.
[01:58:43.220 --> 01:58:44.220]   He doesn't have the money.
[01:58:44.220 --> 01:58:47.860]   Well, what would they want with the Sprint?
[01:58:47.860 --> 01:58:48.860]   I mean the Sprint.
[01:58:48.860 --> 01:58:50.740]   Well, I was going to say the Sprint Network.
[01:58:50.740 --> 01:58:55.380]   Remember, Dish is kind of making a play to get into the cell phone business, believe it
[01:58:55.380 --> 01:58:56.380]   or not.
[01:58:56.380 --> 01:58:58.740]   What they need is spectrum.
[01:58:58.740 --> 01:59:02.460]   They just want to be the wasp in the shoe of every possible major entity.
[01:59:02.460 --> 01:59:05.220]   Well, remember that they threw a little monkey wrench into the clear purchase.
[01:59:05.220 --> 01:59:06.860]   Now they're doing it with Sprint.
[01:59:06.860 --> 01:59:09.140]   So it's just, it's Charlie.
[01:59:09.140 --> 01:59:10.140]   That's the way he is.
[01:59:10.140 --> 01:59:11.140]   He's a great guy.
[01:59:11.140 --> 01:59:12.140]   I think it's a scam.
[01:59:12.140 --> 01:59:13.140]   I don't know if it's a scam.
[01:59:13.140 --> 01:59:14.140]   It might be a little bit of a pump.
[01:59:14.140 --> 01:59:15.300]   I don't know.
[01:59:15.300 --> 01:59:16.300]   Pump and dump, you think?
[01:59:16.300 --> 01:59:17.300]   No.
[01:59:17.300 --> 01:59:18.300]   No.
[01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:19.300]   No.
[01:59:19.300 --> 01:59:23.580]   Lauren, what are you working on?
[01:59:23.580 --> 01:59:25.380]   What can we see on All Things D?
[01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:27.420]   Are you going to get a conference of your own?
[01:59:27.420 --> 01:59:28.420]   Everybody's got a conference.
[01:59:28.420 --> 01:59:29.420]   You need a conference.
[01:59:29.420 --> 01:59:30.420]   They have a conference.
[01:59:30.420 --> 01:59:31.420]   No, no, they do.
[01:59:31.420 --> 01:59:32.900]   They have Dive into Mobile.
[01:59:32.900 --> 01:59:34.700]   Liz Gaines got that one.
[01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:36.220]   Oh, you want her to have it?
[01:59:36.220 --> 01:59:39.220]   Yeah, I want the Lauren Good Conference.
[01:59:39.220 --> 01:59:43.460]   I don't think it'll be called the Lauren Good Conference, but we do have plans to do more
[01:59:43.460 --> 01:59:44.820]   conferences down the line.
[01:59:44.820 --> 01:59:45.820]   So we'll see.
[01:59:45.820 --> 01:59:48.340]   We'll have to come up with a cool new branded one.
[01:59:48.340 --> 01:59:52.460]   We had D-Media and Mobile and we had an international conference.
[01:59:52.460 --> 01:59:55.180]   So we'll see what happens.
[01:59:55.180 --> 01:59:59.660]   But it'll just be Lauren listening to her own music and refusing your recommendation.
[01:59:59.660 --> 02:00:02.700]   It'll be All Things G.
[02:00:02.700 --> 02:00:03.700]   All Things Good.
[02:00:03.700 --> 02:00:04.740]   All Things Good.
[02:00:04.740 --> 02:00:06.020]   The Good Conference.
[02:00:06.020 --> 02:00:07.820]   I'm liking it.
[02:00:07.820 --> 02:00:08.820]   Good as hell conference.
[02:00:08.820 --> 02:00:11.980]   You can catch Lauren's writing at allthingsd.com.
[02:00:11.980 --> 02:00:14.220]   She covers consumer products.
[02:00:14.220 --> 02:00:15.980]   I see your picture life review here.
[02:00:15.980 --> 02:00:16.980]   Oh, there we go.
[02:00:16.980 --> 02:00:17.980]   Still at work.
[02:00:17.980 --> 02:00:19.080]   It's All Good Conference.
[02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:20.080]   It's All Good.
[02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:21.080]   It's All Good.
[02:00:21.080 --> 02:00:25.900]   Yep, I have a column that runs every Monday morning at 9 a.m. online on All Things D.
[02:00:25.900 --> 02:00:27.180]   So check it out.
[02:00:27.180 --> 02:00:28.180]   That's great.
[02:00:28.180 --> 02:00:29.180]   So nice to have you.
[02:00:29.180 --> 02:00:30.180]   Thank you for having me.
[02:00:30.180 --> 02:00:31.180]   Please come back.
[02:00:31.180 --> 02:00:32.180]   It's been really fun.
[02:00:32.180 --> 02:00:34.700]   And the next time you're in the Bay Area, please make the trek up to Petaluma.
[02:00:34.700 --> 02:00:36.580]   All the chicken and eggs you can handle.
[02:00:36.580 --> 02:00:39.420]   All the chicken and eggs and cigars and wine.
[02:00:39.420 --> 02:00:42.180]   And I got a Cohiba with your name on it.
[02:00:42.180 --> 02:00:43.180]   Thank you.
[02:00:43.180 --> 02:00:44.180]   Yeah, just for you.
[02:00:44.180 --> 02:00:46.900]   That's a good brand.
[02:00:46.900 --> 02:00:47.900]   What is it?
[02:00:47.900 --> 02:00:48.900]   It says the name of it.
[02:00:48.900 --> 02:00:49.900]   I don't...
[02:00:49.900 --> 02:00:50.900]   What are they shaped?
[02:00:50.900 --> 02:00:51.900]   I don't know what it is.
[02:00:51.900 --> 02:00:52.900]   It's a behike.
[02:00:52.900 --> 02:00:53.900]   Behike.
[02:00:53.900 --> 02:00:55.660]   Yeah, but what's the shape like?
[02:00:55.660 --> 02:00:56.660]   Is it a big thing?
[02:00:56.660 --> 02:00:57.660]   It's like a maduro.
[02:00:57.660 --> 02:00:58.660]   Maduro's a color.
[02:00:58.660 --> 02:00:59.660]   It's an arc.
[02:00:59.660 --> 02:01:00.660]   A wrap.
[02:01:00.660 --> 02:01:03.300]   And it's got a torpedo-like shape.
[02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:04.860]   Oh, it's got a little pointy thing at one end?
[02:01:04.860 --> 02:01:06.300]   Pointy thing at one end.
[02:01:06.300 --> 02:01:07.540]   You need a snipper.
[02:01:07.540 --> 02:01:09.660]   You need a moil to smoke a thing.
[02:01:09.660 --> 02:01:10.660]   A what?
[02:01:10.660 --> 02:01:11.660]   A moil.
[02:01:11.660 --> 02:01:12.660]   A moil.
[02:01:12.660 --> 02:01:13.660]   The thing that cut the thing?
[02:01:13.660 --> 02:01:14.660]   Yeah, the thing that cut the thing.
[02:01:14.660 --> 02:01:15.660]   I got one of those.
[02:01:15.660 --> 02:01:16.660]   I bet you do.
[02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:17.660]   I do.
[02:01:17.660 --> 02:01:18.660]   Just in case.
[02:01:18.660 --> 02:01:19.660]   Good Lord.
[02:01:19.660 --> 02:01:22.820]   I know, it just deteriorates as you go.
[02:01:22.820 --> 02:01:26.140]   I don't know if there was much to deteriorate.
[02:01:26.140 --> 02:01:28.380]   This is, as somebody said, real coheap are illegal.
[02:01:28.380 --> 02:01:29.380]   That's right.
[02:01:29.380 --> 02:01:30.380]   Yes, that's true.
[02:01:30.380 --> 02:01:31.380]   Justin Robert Young.
[02:01:31.380 --> 02:01:32.380]   Yes.
[02:01:32.380 --> 02:01:34.100]   You have the number one comedy album.
[02:01:34.100 --> 02:01:37.660]   In Canada, United States, UK, and Ireland.
[02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:38.660]   That is awesome.
[02:01:38.660 --> 02:01:42.220]   Just, that shows that Dane guy, what's his name?
[02:01:42.220 --> 02:01:43.220]   Dane Cook.
[02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:44.220]   Dane Cook.
[02:01:44.220 --> 02:01:45.740]   You see, you don't have to have talent.
[02:01:45.740 --> 02:01:46.740]   You were right.
[02:01:46.740 --> 02:01:47.740]   Exactly.
[02:01:47.740 --> 02:01:49.380]   Anything goes in comedy.
[02:01:49.380 --> 02:01:52.060]   Literally, just do the sign.
[02:01:52.060 --> 02:01:53.620]   No, no, you had it right the first time.
[02:01:53.620 --> 02:01:54.620]   There we go.
[02:01:54.620 --> 02:01:55.620]   Yeah, the Diamond Club.
[02:01:55.620 --> 02:01:58.140]   I've been making it like this and it's really more like the Rommel's Club.
[02:01:58.140 --> 02:02:01.540]   No, that's not, that's actually something else in sign language that I don't even want
[02:02:01.540 --> 02:02:02.540]   to get into.
[02:02:02.540 --> 02:02:03.540]   I wouldn't do that again.
[02:02:03.540 --> 02:02:04.540]   But yeah, no.
[02:02:04.540 --> 02:02:05.540]   Great to have you, Jerry.
[02:02:05.540 --> 02:02:07.140]   Night Attack 2, enjoy the garden, go get it on iTunes.
[02:02:07.140 --> 02:02:09.100]   Will be available on Amazon shortly.
[02:02:09.100 --> 02:02:11.740]   Did you drive out here with Patrick Delahanty?
[02:02:11.740 --> 02:02:15.460]   I actually, no, I came up here for brunch with Patrick and then-
[02:02:15.460 --> 02:02:16.980]   Because he drove out from Boston.
[02:02:16.980 --> 02:02:17.980]   Yeah.
[02:02:17.980 --> 02:02:18.980]   Just in time, by the way.
[02:02:18.980 --> 02:02:19.980]   He lives, and he's here now.
[02:02:19.980 --> 02:02:20.980]   Started in Watertown.
[02:02:20.980 --> 02:02:21.980]   Started in, no, really?
[02:02:21.980 --> 02:02:22.980]   He didn't know.
[02:02:22.980 --> 02:02:23.980]   Is that where you live, Watertown?
[02:02:23.980 --> 02:02:24.980]   He's from Watertown.
[02:02:24.980 --> 02:02:25.980]   He has Watertown on his ID.
[02:02:25.980 --> 02:02:30.980]   I think the FBI didn't know that because some guy driving from Watertown right about that
[02:02:30.980 --> 02:02:31.980]   time.
[02:02:31.980 --> 02:02:32.980]   Yeah, all the way out to here.
[02:02:32.980 --> 02:02:33.980]   He lives a mile away from-
[02:02:33.980 --> 02:02:34.980]   Oh man, really?
[02:02:34.980 --> 02:02:35.980]   Yeah.
[02:02:35.980 --> 02:02:36.980]   Wow.
[02:02:36.980 --> 02:02:37.980]   Well, I'm glad you're here now.
[02:02:37.980 --> 02:02:40.700]   The chances of gunfights breaking out in Petaluma are very low.
[02:02:40.700 --> 02:02:41.700]   We haven't had one-
[02:02:41.700 --> 02:02:42.700]   It happened recently.
[02:02:42.700 --> 02:02:43.700]   It happened right before-
[02:02:43.700 --> 02:02:44.700]   There's a drive-by egging.
[02:02:44.700 --> 02:02:45.700]   Yes.
[02:02:45.700 --> 02:02:48.140]   There's lots of egging.
[02:02:48.140 --> 02:02:51.620]   John C. Dvorak, channeldvorak.com, take all the gaffer tape you have.
[02:02:51.620 --> 02:02:54.780]   Once I take all I want, I just want one roll.
[02:02:54.780 --> 02:02:57.660]   You are a very simple man with simple needs.
[02:02:57.660 --> 02:02:58.660]   Exactly.
[02:02:58.660 --> 02:03:00.620]   That's enough for three or four bathing suits.
[02:03:00.620 --> 02:03:01.620]   Could be.
[02:03:01.620 --> 02:03:02.620]   Could be.
[02:03:02.620 --> 02:03:03.620]   Depends on the tookus.
[02:03:03.620 --> 02:03:04.620]   Dvorak.org/blog.
[02:03:04.620 --> 02:03:05.620]   Thank you.
[02:03:05.620 --> 02:03:06.620]   Thank you for laughing.
[02:03:06.620 --> 02:03:07.620]   I know.
[02:03:07.620 --> 02:03:08.620]   Listen.
[02:03:08.620 --> 02:03:10.780]   I just got the guy with the number one comedy album-
[02:03:10.780 --> 02:03:12.780]   To laugh at some dumb thing you said.
[02:03:12.780 --> 02:03:14.780]   All the Yiddish jokes, tookus.
[02:03:14.780 --> 02:03:15.780]   It's possible.
[02:03:15.780 --> 02:03:16.780]   All kick it up.
[02:03:16.780 --> 02:03:17.780]   Channeldvorak.com and noagentashow.com.
[02:03:17.780 --> 02:03:18.780]   Also PC Magazine.
[02:03:18.780 --> 02:03:19.780]   When's your next Noagentashow?
[02:03:19.780 --> 02:03:21.260]   You did one this morning.
[02:03:21.260 --> 02:03:22.260]   Yes.
[02:03:22.260 --> 02:03:23.260]   And you'll do one next-
[02:03:23.260 --> 02:03:24.260]   Thursday.
[02:03:24.260 --> 02:03:25.260]   Next Sunday.
[02:03:25.260 --> 02:03:26.260]   Thursday now.
[02:03:26.260 --> 02:03:27.260]   Twice weekly?
[02:03:27.260 --> 02:03:28.260]   Yeah.
[02:03:28.260 --> 02:03:29.260]   That's twice the amount of Noagentashow.
[02:03:29.260 --> 02:03:30.860]   It's like an eight hour show, isn't it?
[02:03:30.860 --> 02:03:31.860]   It goes on and on.
[02:03:31.860 --> 02:03:33.860]   It's only three hours plus.
[02:03:33.860 --> 02:03:34.860]   Sorry.
[02:03:34.860 --> 02:03:37.300]   You know why I say that?
[02:03:37.300 --> 02:03:41.460]   Because this has been a two hour show and I don't want people to feel like this is long
[02:03:41.460 --> 02:03:43.540]   because it's shorter than that.
[02:03:43.540 --> 02:03:44.540]   Than three hours plus.
[02:03:44.540 --> 02:03:47.980]   Hey, we have a commuter audience and they want it long, they want it least.
[02:03:47.980 --> 02:03:49.860]   We give them six hours a week.
[02:03:49.860 --> 02:03:54.580]   What I've realized is that people, the length of the show that people want is exactly their
[02:03:54.580 --> 02:03:55.580]   commute.
[02:03:55.580 --> 02:03:56.580]   Yeah.
[02:03:56.580 --> 02:03:57.580]   Yeah.
[02:03:57.580 --> 02:03:58.580]   Not shorter because then you have to start another show.
[02:03:58.580 --> 02:03:59.580]   Sure.
[02:03:59.580 --> 02:04:00.580]   Longer is not so bad because you don't have to fit in.
[02:04:00.580 --> 02:04:03.220]   So apparently all your listeners are long haul truckers.
[02:04:03.220 --> 02:04:04.220]   Yes.
[02:04:04.220 --> 02:04:07.740]   There's apparently, the average commute in this country is like 45 minutes to an hour.
[02:04:07.740 --> 02:04:08.740]   It's unbelievable.
[02:04:08.740 --> 02:04:09.740]   It's longer every year.
[02:04:09.740 --> 02:04:10.740]   It's ludicrous.
[02:04:10.740 --> 02:04:11.740]   How long Patrick did it take you to do it?
[02:04:11.740 --> 02:04:12.740]   How many hours on the road do it?
[02:04:12.740 --> 02:04:14.740]   About 45 minutes each way every day.
[02:04:14.740 --> 02:04:15.740]   Yeah, see that's very common.
[02:04:15.740 --> 02:04:17.540]   It took him 45 minutes to get here from Watertown?
[02:04:17.540 --> 02:04:18.540]   No, no, no.
[02:04:18.540 --> 02:04:19.540]   He's talking about his own job.
[02:04:19.540 --> 02:04:20.540]   How long did you traverse the country?
[02:04:20.540 --> 02:04:21.540]   Good sir.
[02:04:21.540 --> 02:04:22.540]   I traversed the country about 48 hours.
[02:04:22.540 --> 02:04:23.540]   48 hours.
[02:04:23.540 --> 02:04:26.460]   That's how long the next twit will be.
[02:04:26.460 --> 02:04:27.460]   That's how long, yes.
[02:04:27.460 --> 02:04:28.460]   I think this one was-
[02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:30.020]   That's only three no agenda shows.
[02:04:30.020 --> 02:04:31.620]   Jason Heiner, thank you for being here.
[02:04:31.620 --> 02:04:32.700]   We really appreciate it.
[02:04:32.700 --> 02:04:36.660]   Jason's the man that got me elected president of the internet and I'm not stepping down.
[02:04:36.660 --> 02:04:37.660]   Never.
[02:04:37.660 --> 02:04:38.660]   Excellent.
[02:04:38.660 --> 02:04:39.660]   Yeah.
[02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:40.660]   I don't care what Alexis O'Neill wants.
[02:04:40.660 --> 02:04:41.660]   It's mine.
[02:04:41.660 --> 02:04:42.660]   It's mine.
[02:04:42.660 --> 02:04:44.340]   Jason's at techrepublic.com.
[02:04:44.340 --> 02:04:45.420]   We thank you for joining us.
[02:04:45.420 --> 02:04:48.940]   We do twit every Sunday afternoon at three o'clock.
[02:04:48.940 --> 02:04:49.940]   Hands are raised.
[02:04:49.940 --> 02:04:51.820]   And one more thing I just want to mention, Teespring.
[02:04:51.820 --> 02:04:53.660]   Wow, is that only $15?
[02:04:53.660 --> 02:04:54.740]   We really should charge more for that.
[02:04:54.740 --> 02:04:55.740]   I know, right?
[02:04:55.740 --> 02:04:56.860]   I can't believe that.
[02:04:56.860 --> 02:04:58.260]   We're selling this t-shirt.
[02:04:58.260 --> 02:05:00.420]   It's only available for a month.
[02:05:00.420 --> 02:05:01.800]   It's our April t-shirt.
[02:05:01.800 --> 02:05:06.420]   The way we got it designed, we went to 99designs.com and we asked designers to submit designs and
[02:05:06.420 --> 02:05:10.500]   we had you, the people, vote on designs and this was the one that won.
[02:05:10.500 --> 02:05:12.100]   I think it's a beautiful design.
[02:05:12.100 --> 02:05:13.100]   It is a limited edition.
[02:05:13.100 --> 02:05:14.100]   You should buy some as shammies.
[02:05:14.100 --> 02:05:15.100]   It's cheap.
[02:05:15.100 --> 02:05:16.100]   You should.
[02:05:16.100 --> 02:05:17.100]   And they're nice.
[02:05:17.100 --> 02:05:18.100]   And how much are we having for the guests?
[02:05:18.100 --> 02:05:19.100]   You must have a few on the house.
[02:05:19.100 --> 02:05:21.300]   They haven't been printed yet because we have to sell enough.
[02:05:21.300 --> 02:05:22.860]   Oh, I see what you're getting at.
[02:05:22.860 --> 02:05:24.860]   We have 21 days and one hour left.
[02:05:24.860 --> 02:05:27.100]   Make the public finance your t-shirt.
[02:05:27.100 --> 02:05:28.820]   Yeah, we don't want to pay for it.
[02:05:28.820 --> 02:05:29.820]   Okay.
[02:05:29.820 --> 02:05:30.820]   It's also, it's a nice quality.
[02:05:30.820 --> 02:05:31.820]   You can choose for the loom or American apparel.
[02:05:31.820 --> 02:05:32.820]   It's a good looking t-shirt.
[02:05:32.820 --> 02:05:33.820]   Isn't that nice?
[02:05:33.820 --> 02:05:34.820]   Don't you love that?
[02:05:34.820 --> 02:05:35.820]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:05:35.820 --> 02:05:36.820]   I'm looking forward to it.
[02:05:36.820 --> 02:05:37.820]   It's styling.
[02:05:37.820 --> 02:05:38.820]   Put John down for one.
[02:05:38.820 --> 02:05:40.820]   Because it's free for all guests, right?
[02:05:40.820 --> 02:05:41.820]   Yeah.
[02:05:41.820 --> 02:05:43.180]   No, actually, we should do that.
[02:05:43.180 --> 02:05:44.180]   Let's order a couple extra.
[02:05:44.180 --> 02:05:45.180]   Sure.
[02:05:45.180 --> 02:05:46.180]   We can give them to the guests.
[02:05:46.180 --> 02:05:47.180]   A little swag.
[02:05:47.180 --> 02:05:48.180]   Send one to Lauren.
[02:05:48.180 --> 02:05:50.660]   Lauren, we have ladies and men sizes available.
[02:05:50.660 --> 02:05:52.660]   My swag.
[02:05:52.660 --> 02:05:55.340]   And since I couldn't give you some gaffers tape, have a t-shirt on.
[02:05:55.340 --> 02:05:59.980]   This has all just been an elaborate ruse so John didn't have to go buy gaffers tape.
[02:05:59.980 --> 02:06:01.780]   He was on the way to the hardware store.
[02:06:01.780 --> 02:06:02.780]   He's like, "Screw it.
[02:06:02.780 --> 02:06:03.780]   I'll just do a twit."
[02:06:03.780 --> 02:06:05.220]   And he thought, "Ah, twit'll have it.
[02:06:05.220 --> 02:06:06.220]   I'll come here."
[02:06:06.220 --> 02:06:08.220]   You have a box of it.
[02:06:08.220 --> 02:06:09.220]   Not anymore.
[02:06:09.220 --> 02:06:13.140]   We've given it out to everybody today.
[02:06:13.140 --> 02:06:15.420]   If you look under your chairs, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:15.420 --> 02:06:17.060]   And you get gaffers tape.
[02:06:17.060 --> 02:06:19.060]   And you get gaffers tape.
[02:06:19.060 --> 02:06:20.060]   And you.
[02:06:20.060 --> 02:06:23.780]   The website is teespring.com/twit for that t-shirt.
[02:06:23.780 --> 02:06:24.780]   T-E-E-Spring.
[02:06:24.780 --> 02:06:26.780]   That's a kind of cool startup.
[02:06:26.780 --> 02:06:30.100]   I think they were Brown or Harvard students who were selling t-shirts and they decided
[02:06:30.100 --> 02:06:31.100]   to do a startup.
[02:06:31.100 --> 02:06:32.100]   And they've done really a great job.
[02:06:32.100 --> 02:06:33.460]   We're really happy with them.
[02:06:33.460 --> 02:06:36.140]   The returns policy is very liberal.
[02:06:36.140 --> 02:06:38.580]   You could get it back if you send them 30 bucks.
[02:06:38.580 --> 02:06:39.580]   No.
[02:06:39.580 --> 02:06:44.020]   Actually, if you get anything wrong with it, they'll be glad to swap it out for you.
[02:06:44.020 --> 02:06:45.020]   $15.
[02:06:45.020 --> 02:06:46.860]   Teespring.com/twit.
[02:06:46.860 --> 02:06:48.260]   And do you have all three sizes?
[02:06:48.260 --> 02:06:49.260]   We have many, many sizes.
[02:06:49.260 --> 02:06:50.260]   Large, extra large and programmers.
[02:06:50.260 --> 02:06:51.260]   Thank you very much, everybody.
[02:06:51.260 --> 02:06:52.260]   I'm here all week.
[02:06:52.260 --> 02:06:53.260]   I never got a fez.
[02:06:53.260 --> 02:06:54.260]   I want one of those teachers.
[02:06:54.260 --> 02:06:55.260]   I never got one of the fez's.
[02:06:55.260 --> 02:06:56.260]   You didn't get a fez?
[02:06:56.260 --> 02:06:57.260]   No, so I definitely want to keep it.
[02:06:57.260 --> 02:06:58.260]   I should send them a fez too.
[02:06:58.260 --> 02:06:59.260]   Fez or raw?
[02:06:59.260 --> 02:07:00.260]   You still got fez's?
[02:07:00.260 --> 02:07:01.260]   Yeah, sure.
[02:07:01.260 --> 02:07:02.260]   Small, medium, large, extra large.
[02:07:02.260 --> 02:07:06.540]   We're going to 5XL, maybe.
[02:07:06.540 --> 02:07:09.940]   3XL, 4XL, 5XL.
[02:07:09.940 --> 02:07:12.940]   5XL, yeah.
[02:07:12.940 --> 02:07:16.460]   They should be put on some sort of a list.
[02:07:16.460 --> 02:07:17.460]   It goes 3XL, 4XL.
[02:07:17.460 --> 02:07:18.460]   And can I tell you something?
[02:07:18.460 --> 02:07:20.020]   Let's make some serious life decisions.
[02:07:20.020 --> 02:07:21.980]   You can get small or 5XL.
[02:07:21.980 --> 02:07:22.980]   It's still $15.
[02:07:22.980 --> 02:07:23.980]   Boom.
[02:07:23.980 --> 02:07:26.900]   Yeah, you could actually get a 5XL, cut it in half and have two t-shirts.
[02:07:26.900 --> 02:07:27.900]   Two t-shirts.
[02:07:27.900 --> 02:07:28.900]   Yes.
[02:07:28.900 --> 02:07:29.900]   I don't mind.
[02:07:29.900 --> 02:07:30.900]   I'm happy for you.
[02:07:30.900 --> 02:07:32.660]   You could have two wind sails.
[02:07:32.660 --> 02:07:34.180]   Right, it's a good car cover.
[02:07:34.180 --> 02:07:37.060]   You can make a tent out of it.
[02:07:37.060 --> 02:07:38.500]   You know, it's great.
[02:07:38.500 --> 02:07:41.060]   Wrap your loved ones in it when they get chilly at night.
[02:07:41.060 --> 02:07:42.060]   With some gaffers tape.
[02:07:42.060 --> 02:07:43.060]   Sure, here we go.
[02:07:43.060 --> 02:07:47.660]   Tape them closed and throw them in the trunk.
[02:07:47.660 --> 02:07:49.280]   They're much easier to drive around.
[02:07:49.280 --> 02:07:52.020]   You could have come out here, no noise at all in the trunk.
[02:07:52.020 --> 02:07:53.620]   This is the ProGaff, by the way.
[02:07:53.620 --> 02:07:55.460]   Oh, hey, we don't use amateur gaffers tape.
[02:07:55.460 --> 02:07:56.460]   This is not the 3M.
[02:07:56.460 --> 02:07:57.460]   AmGaff.
[02:07:57.460 --> 02:07:58.460]   I don't buy AmGaff.
[02:07:58.460 --> 02:07:59.460]   We get ProGaff.
[02:07:59.460 --> 02:08:00.460]   ProGaff.
[02:08:00.460 --> 02:08:06.300]   3PM in the afternoon on the West Coast, 6PM on the East Coast, which means Lauren's starving
[02:08:06.300 --> 02:08:07.300]   because she hasn't had dinner yet.
[02:08:07.300 --> 02:08:08.300]   I am.
[02:08:08.300 --> 02:08:10.180]   I'm eating sunflower seeds right now.
[02:08:10.180 --> 02:08:11.180]   I'm so hungry.
[02:08:11.180 --> 02:08:12.180]   Oh my God, the poor girl.
[02:08:12.180 --> 02:08:13.180]   Is she shelled or not shelled?
[02:08:13.180 --> 02:08:14.180]   They're not shelled.
[02:08:14.180 --> 02:08:17.660]   Oh, so you're going to be spitting them out like a ball player.
[02:08:17.660 --> 02:08:18.660]   Oh, nice.
[02:08:18.660 --> 02:08:19.660]   More than that.
[02:08:19.660 --> 02:08:21.020]   She doesn't have like a package.
[02:08:21.020 --> 02:08:24.020]   She's got a mason jar full of them.
[02:08:24.020 --> 02:08:25.020]   I have a jar.
[02:08:25.020 --> 02:08:26.020]   I have dinner waiting for me.
[02:08:26.020 --> 02:08:27.020]   All right, sorry, Lauren.
[02:08:27.020 --> 02:08:30.900]   All the area around Lauren's going to look like the Mets, you know, bench.
[02:08:30.900 --> 02:08:33.220]   She's been going all day.
[02:08:33.220 --> 02:08:36.220]   She had a big jaw earlier.
[02:08:36.220 --> 02:08:37.220]   Big jaw.
[02:08:37.220 --> 02:08:38.220]   Yeah, it was like this.
[02:08:38.220 --> 02:08:39.220]   She had a big jaw.
[02:08:39.220 --> 02:08:43.700]   She just spit it out before the show.
[02:08:43.700 --> 02:08:44.820]   We thank you for joining us.
[02:08:44.820 --> 02:08:45.820]   Make sure you tune in 3PM.
[02:08:45.820 --> 02:08:47.420]   I said that all day and night.
[02:08:47.420 --> 02:08:49.980]   If you can't watch, just wrap it up.
[02:08:49.980 --> 02:08:50.980]   Another tweet.
[02:08:50.980 --> 02:08:51.980]   It's in the can.
[02:08:51.980 --> 02:08:52.980]   Goodbye, everybody.
[02:08:52.980 --> 02:08:57.340]   You guys are funny.
[02:08:57.340 --> 02:09:00.580]   Yeah, try.
[02:09:00.580 --> 02:09:03.580]   We're hilarious.
[02:09:03.580 --> 02:09:06.180]   Do I amuse you?
[02:09:06.180 --> 02:09:07.180]   Funny looking?
[02:09:07.180 --> 02:09:08.180]   Funny looking.
[02:09:08.180 --> 02:09:09.180]   Yeah.
[02:09:09.180 --> 02:09:10.180]   Well, there you go.
[02:09:10.180 --> 02:09:11.180]   No, it's funny.
[02:09:11.180 --> 02:09:12.180]   Yeah.
[02:09:12.180 --> 02:09:13.180]   You should be do the show live sometime.
[02:09:13.180 --> 02:09:14.180]   Don't be on the Skype.
[02:09:14.180 --> 02:09:15.180]   Well, are you in New York, Lauren?
[02:09:15.180 --> 02:09:16.180]   I'm in New York.
[02:09:16.180 --> 02:09:17.180]   Yeah.
[02:09:17.180 --> 02:09:18.180]   They must drag you out here once in a while.
[02:09:18.180 --> 02:09:19.180]   Yeah, I'm out about once a month.
[02:09:19.180 --> 02:09:20.180]   I'm actually, I'm moving to the West Coast in the fall.
[02:09:20.180 --> 02:09:21.180]   See?
[02:09:21.180 --> 02:09:23.180]   I'm moving to the West Coast in the fall.
[02:09:23.180 --> 02:09:24.180]   You're moving to the West Coast?
[02:09:24.180 --> 02:09:25.180]   Yeah.
[02:09:25.180 --> 02:09:26.180]   San Francisco?
[02:09:26.180 --> 02:09:28.700]   Yeah, the Bay Area, I think.
[02:09:28.700 --> 02:09:30.700]   Consider Petaluma.
[02:09:30.700 --> 02:09:31.700]   Consider the East Bay.
[02:09:31.700 --> 02:09:32.700]   You know, just in time for Butter and Egg.
[02:09:32.700 --> 02:09:33.700]   Otherwise, you'd go broke.
[02:09:33.700 --> 02:09:34.700]   Butter and Egg.
[02:09:34.700 --> 02:09:36.900]   Now, there's a little issue with Butter and Egg Day.
[02:09:36.900 --> 02:09:37.900]   Why is that?
[02:09:37.900 --> 02:09:40.620]   Because it's Butter and Eggs Day.
[02:09:40.620 --> 02:09:49.500]   But they have, the city fathers have decided to rename it to Butter and Egg Days.
[02:09:49.500 --> 02:09:50.500]   This is the...
[02:09:50.500 --> 02:09:51.500]   You were talking about Petaluma?
[02:09:51.500 --> 02:09:52.500]   Yeah.
[02:09:52.500 --> 02:09:53.500]   So now it's a singular egg.
[02:09:53.500 --> 02:09:54.500]   We talked about this idiotic thing before.
[02:09:54.500 --> 02:09:55.500]   One egg on two days.
[02:09:55.500 --> 02:09:56.500]   Exactly.
[02:09:56.500 --> 02:09:57.500]   There we go.
[02:09:57.500 --> 02:09:58.500]   It's very annoying.
[02:09:58.500 --> 02:09:59.500]   Share the egg, ladies and gentlemen, of Petaluma.
[02:09:59.500 --> 02:10:00.500]   What's the origin of it?
[02:10:00.500 --> 02:10:02.340]   Why is there a Butter and Egg Day?
[02:10:02.340 --> 02:10:06.740]   So Petaluma, which is a small town about 55,000 an hour north of San Francisco.
[02:10:06.740 --> 02:10:08.980]   It used to be one of the giant metropolises in the 1850s.
[02:10:08.980 --> 02:10:11.220]   It was a very bustling city.
[02:10:11.220 --> 02:10:12.220]   True, it's a fact.
[02:10:12.220 --> 02:10:16.420]   Because we were about the northernmost point of the San Francisco Bay, so lumber, gold,
[02:10:16.420 --> 02:10:21.460]   food and stuff was brought to this point and then it shipped down to San Francisco and
[02:10:21.460 --> 02:10:22.820]   point south.
[02:10:22.820 --> 02:10:27.660]   But the real reason for Butter and Eggs Day, because we're kind of an agricultural area,
[02:10:27.660 --> 02:10:35.100]   is that in the 1900s in Russia, Jewish people were being killed in pogroms by the Tsar.
[02:10:35.100 --> 02:10:37.300]   This is prior communist Russia.
[02:10:37.300 --> 02:10:40.180]   And do-gooders here said we need to save these.
[02:10:40.180 --> 02:10:43.900]   So they were getting Jews out of Russia in the 1900s.
[02:10:43.900 --> 02:10:46.320]   And the problem was you had all these basically peasants.
[02:10:46.320 --> 02:10:48.900]   They were agricultural Jews.
[02:10:48.900 --> 02:10:50.100]   And they said what are we going to have them do?
[02:10:50.100 --> 02:10:54.900]   And it turned out it was very capital, low capital, very easy to set up chicken farms.
[02:10:54.900 --> 02:10:58.500]   So they were setting these Jews up that they brought in from Russia with chicken farms.
[02:10:58.500 --> 02:11:02.060]   And so this was a huge chicken area and they're still beautiful old wood chicken.
[02:11:02.060 --> 02:11:03.060]   Is this documented anywhere?
[02:11:03.060 --> 02:11:04.060]   Oh yeah, yeah.
[02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:05.980]   Because I know this used to be known for chickens.
[02:11:05.980 --> 02:11:06.980]   Yeah, that's why.
[02:11:06.980 --> 02:11:07.980]   Yeah.
[02:11:07.980 --> 02:11:08.980]   And we were the number...
[02:11:08.980 --> 02:11:09.980]   That's an awesome history lesson, Leo.
[02:11:09.980 --> 02:11:10.980]   Yeah, it's fascinating.
[02:11:10.980 --> 02:11:13.060]   And there's still a lot of descendants from that.
[02:11:13.060 --> 02:11:17.620]   And well we had a farm for a while with a chicken coop, with two chicken coops, the
[02:11:17.620 --> 02:11:18.900]   original 1900 chicken coops.
[02:11:18.900 --> 02:11:19.900]   Big giant chicken coops?
[02:11:19.900 --> 02:11:20.900]   No, they're huge.
[02:11:20.900 --> 02:11:21.900]   They're beautiful.
[02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:22.900]   You should have put some chickens in it.
[02:11:22.900 --> 02:11:24.300]   I refinished the floor.
[02:11:24.300 --> 02:11:25.300]   We fixed it up.
[02:11:25.300 --> 02:11:26.300]   It was a beautiful place.
[02:11:26.300 --> 02:11:27.300]   I was thinking that I was going to...
[02:11:27.300 --> 02:11:28.780]   And now you're going to move in to the chicken coop.
[02:11:28.780 --> 02:11:30.780]   Is that what you're saying?
[02:11:30.780 --> 02:11:31.780]   Yeah.
[02:11:31.780 --> 02:11:32.780]   Okay.
[02:11:32.780 --> 02:11:33.780]   We have chickens.
[02:11:33.780 --> 02:11:34.780]   I am already, Leo.
[02:11:34.780 --> 02:11:35.780]   You have chickens?
[02:11:35.780 --> 02:11:36.780]   There is a rule.
[02:11:36.780 --> 02:11:37.780]   It's still in the ordinances...
[02:11:37.780 --> 02:11:38.780]   Ordinance.
[02:11:38.780 --> 02:11:39.780]   That's not right.
[02:11:39.780 --> 02:11:40.780]   Ordinances, not ordinance.
[02:11:40.780 --> 02:11:41.780]   Ordinance.
[02:11:41.780 --> 02:11:42.780]   Yes.
[02:11:42.780 --> 02:11:43.780]   Ordinance.
[02:11:43.780 --> 02:11:44.780]   That you cannot...
[02:11:44.780 --> 02:11:51.380]   No C's and C's, no covenants, and any housing project anywhere in Petaluma can prevent you
[02:11:51.380 --> 02:11:52.380]   from having a chicken.
[02:11:52.380 --> 02:11:53.380]   Yeah.
[02:11:53.380 --> 02:11:56.300]   So in fact it's by law you have the right to have a chicken farm here.
[02:11:56.300 --> 02:11:57.940]   You have the right in Berkeley.
[02:11:57.940 --> 02:11:58.940]   Berkeley too.
[02:11:58.940 --> 02:11:59.940]   But in Albany they charge...
[02:11:59.940 --> 02:12:03.060]   You have to pay $150 license fee for each chicken.
[02:12:03.060 --> 02:12:04.060]   Nobody does this.
[02:12:04.060 --> 02:12:05.060]   Wait, per chicken?
[02:12:05.060 --> 02:12:06.060]   Yes, it's a scam.
[02:12:06.060 --> 02:12:07.060]   That's crazy.
[02:12:07.060 --> 02:12:09.860]   There's an actual chicken counter from the city who comes around?
[02:12:09.860 --> 02:12:10.940]   That's the drawback.
[02:12:10.940 --> 02:12:16.660]   I interviewed when I worked on KNBR 20 years ago the last chicken sexer of Petaluma.
[02:12:16.660 --> 02:12:20.660]   Is that the guy who checks the sex?
[02:12:20.660 --> 02:12:24.820]   When a chick is born it's very difficult to know if it's a hen or a cock.
[02:12:24.820 --> 02:12:26.900]   This is content.
[02:12:26.900 --> 02:12:27.900]   And there are people watching...
[02:12:27.900 --> 02:12:28.900]   I'm already...
[02:12:28.900 --> 02:12:31.420]   Here we go, Hen and Cock talk on Twitch.
[02:12:31.420 --> 02:12:33.660]   This guy could tell...
[02:12:33.660 --> 02:12:36.820]   I asked him and he wasn't very explicit but he was...
[02:12:36.820 --> 02:12:38.100]   Because he didn't want you taking his job.
[02:12:38.100 --> 02:12:40.140]   He was highly trained and he could tell...
[02:12:40.140 --> 02:12:41.140]   Highly trained.
[02:12:41.140 --> 02:12:43.420]   Because the chicks are fairly sexless when they're born but he could tell right away.
[02:12:43.420 --> 02:12:44.420]   He said, "No, that's a girl."
[02:12:44.420 --> 02:12:45.420]   Wait, just by sight?
[02:12:45.420 --> 02:12:46.420]   Well, I think he turned them over.
[02:12:46.420 --> 02:12:47.420]   He had to get in there a little bit.
[02:12:47.420 --> 02:12:48.420]   He turned them over.
[02:12:48.420 --> 02:12:49.420]   He had to look under the hood.
[02:12:49.420 --> 02:12:52.420]   I'm not sure because he was an old guy.
[02:12:52.420 --> 02:12:53.420]   He was the last...
[02:12:53.420 --> 02:12:54.700]   He could just spot them.
[02:12:54.700 --> 02:12:55.700]   He was...
[02:12:55.700 --> 02:12:56.700]   And it's S-E-X-O-R.
[02:12:56.700 --> 02:12:57.700]   He was the last chicken sexer.
[02:12:57.700 --> 02:13:00.580]   If you grow your own chickens it's important to know because you don't want to get a bunch
[02:13:00.580 --> 02:13:01.580]   of roosters.
[02:13:01.580 --> 02:13:03.540]   Because for one thing you don't want any roosters.
[02:13:03.540 --> 02:13:04.980]   You want one rooster.
[02:13:04.980 --> 02:13:06.940]   Well you want for the better eggs you do.
[02:13:06.940 --> 02:13:10.500]   But if you're in an area where they're charging 150 bucks a head and you're trying to keep
[02:13:10.500 --> 02:13:11.500]   your chickens a secret.
[02:13:11.500 --> 02:13:12.500]   No roosters.
[02:13:12.500 --> 02:13:13.500]   No roosters.
[02:13:13.500 --> 02:13:14.500]   Because they crow.
[02:13:14.500 --> 02:13:16.020]   You go out to Woodside where everyone has chickens.
[02:13:16.020 --> 02:13:17.020]   They're crowing all the time.
[02:13:17.020 --> 02:13:18.020]   You can't sleep.
[02:13:18.020 --> 02:13:19.020]   All day.
[02:13:19.020 --> 02:13:20.020]   They're crowing at one.
[02:13:20.020 --> 02:13:22.020]   Well it's a common misconception that roosters only crow in the morning.
[02:13:22.020 --> 02:13:23.020]   Bullshit.
[02:13:23.020 --> 02:13:24.020]   They don't.
[02:13:24.020 --> 02:13:25.020]   No, they crow.
[02:13:25.020 --> 02:13:26.020]   They crow all fucking day.
[02:13:26.020 --> 02:13:27.020]   They do.
[02:13:27.020 --> 02:13:28.020]   If you'll forgive me.
[02:13:28.020 --> 02:13:29.020]   No, it's true.
[02:13:29.020 --> 02:13:30.020]   And they're annoying.
[02:13:30.020 --> 02:13:31.020]   Wow.
[02:13:31.020 --> 02:13:32.020]   I didn't know that there's nothing, but it's such a virulent profanity.
[02:13:32.020 --> 02:13:33.020]   And all of virulent profanity.
[02:13:33.020 --> 02:13:34.500]   If you're trying to sleep in Petaluma...
[02:13:34.500 --> 02:13:35.500]   Don't.
[02:13:35.500 --> 02:13:37.500]   Don't.
[02:13:37.500 --> 02:13:38.500]   You're done.
[02:13:38.500 --> 02:13:41.620]   And a lot of them, a lot of the roosters are aggressive and they're annoying and they're
[02:13:41.620 --> 02:13:42.620]   jerks.
[02:13:42.620 --> 02:13:43.620]   This is content.
[02:13:43.620 --> 02:13:44.620]   And they're all by the way, racists.
[02:13:44.620 --> 02:13:45.620]   Racists?
[02:13:45.620 --> 02:13:46.620]   Yes, the only...
[02:13:46.620 --> 02:13:47.620]   Wait, hold on.
[02:13:47.620 --> 02:13:48.620]   Dial it back.
[02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:49.620]   Why are they racist?
[02:13:49.620 --> 02:13:52.220]   Well, that's the way they are with the different chickens.
[02:13:52.220 --> 02:13:54.980]   But they're all rapists too, which makes it even worse.
[02:13:54.980 --> 02:13:56.500]   You meant to say rapists, but you said racist.
[02:13:56.500 --> 02:13:57.500]   I did, you're right.
[02:13:57.500 --> 02:13:58.500]   C'mon.
[02:13:58.500 --> 02:13:59.500]   Racists is interesting though.
[02:13:59.500 --> 02:14:00.500]   Are you a Rhode Island Red?
[02:14:00.500 --> 02:14:01.500]   Oh my God.
[02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:02.500]   If Adam is listening, he knows why.
[02:14:02.500 --> 02:14:03.500]   Get out.
[02:14:03.500 --> 02:14:04.500]   Those Rhode Island Reds are lit.
[02:14:04.500 --> 02:14:05.500]   Those Rhode Island Reds are lazy.
[02:14:05.500 --> 02:14:08.500]   We don't for enough of your kind here.
[02:14:08.500 --> 02:14:09.660]   Layabouts.
[02:14:09.660 --> 02:14:12.680]   They make the lives of the poor hands miserable.
[02:14:12.680 --> 02:14:13.680]   With all the raping.
[02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:14.680]   Yes.
[02:14:14.680 --> 02:14:15.680]   Constant.
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:16.680]   That's their job.
[02:14:16.680 --> 02:14:17.680]   They're not raping, they're fertilizing.
[02:14:17.680 --> 02:14:18.680]   Can we talk about Google now?
[02:14:18.680 --> 02:14:20.680]   Yeah, that's what they're doing, but a lot of the hands don't like it.
[02:14:20.680 --> 02:14:23.080]   You try to tell that to the cops.
[02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:26.100]   And so what's so different in life?
[02:14:26.100 --> 02:14:27.100]   Never mind.
[02:14:27.100 --> 02:14:28.100]   Let's move on.
[02:14:28.100 --> 02:14:29.100]   I'm saying this is content with the raping.
[02:14:29.100 --> 02:14:30.100]   So Lauren, we're just...
[02:14:30.100 --> 02:14:31.100]   She's not...
[02:14:31.100 --> 02:14:32.100]   Lauren's giving up.
[02:14:32.100 --> 02:14:33.100]   She's gonna walk off the show.
[02:14:33.100 --> 02:14:34.100]   No, no.
[02:14:34.100 --> 02:14:36.020]   I mean, she is talking about chickens for we don't care.
[02:14:36.020 --> 02:14:37.020]   We don't care.
[02:14:37.020 --> 02:14:38.020]   I'm in New York.
[02:14:38.020 --> 02:14:39.020]   I agree.
[02:14:39.020 --> 02:14:40.020]   Exactly.
[02:14:40.020 --> 02:14:41.020]   Are you uptown or downtown, Lauren?
[02:14:41.020 --> 02:14:44.020]   That's why you should move to Petaluma.
[02:14:44.020 --> 02:14:45.020]   Right now I'm uptown.
[02:14:45.020 --> 02:14:46.020]   I'm on the Upper West Side.
[02:14:46.020 --> 02:14:47.020]   I guarantee she's not moving to Petaluma.
[02:14:47.020 --> 02:14:49.020]   That's where I was born, West 83rd Street.
[02:14:49.020 --> 02:14:50.020]   Oh, nice.
[02:14:50.020 --> 02:14:51.020]   I'm on West...
[02:14:51.020 --> 02:14:52.020]   I'm actually my boyfriend's place.
[02:14:52.020 --> 02:14:53.020]   I'm on West 75th.
[02:14:53.020 --> 02:14:54.020]   Yeah.
[02:14:54.020 --> 02:14:57.020]   You were born on West 83rd Street?
[02:14:57.020 --> 02:15:00.700]   My parents lived in the Frederick Douglas housing projects.
[02:15:00.700 --> 02:15:01.700]   Oh.
[02:15:01.700 --> 02:15:03.860]   Yeah, they're still there.
[02:15:03.860 --> 02:15:04.860]   Your parents?
[02:15:04.860 --> 02:15:06.500]   I was born a young, small black child.
[02:15:06.500 --> 02:15:07.500]   No.
[02:15:07.500 --> 02:15:09.860]   They lived in the process because he was a grad student at Columbia.
[02:15:09.860 --> 02:15:11.460]   We were up in Morningside Heights.
[02:15:11.460 --> 02:15:12.460]   Anyway, that's a long, boring story.
[02:15:12.460 --> 02:15:13.460]   He was a professor.
[02:15:13.460 --> 02:15:16.460]   This is when Frederick Douglas was actually running the housing project, right?
[02:15:16.460 --> 02:15:17.460]   He was actually in charge, yeah.
[02:15:17.460 --> 02:15:18.460]   Oh, so you were...
[02:15:18.460 --> 02:15:19.460]   Stamps?
[02:15:19.460 --> 02:15:20.460]   Can we talk about chickens some more?
[02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:21.460]   No.
[02:15:21.460 --> 02:15:22.460]   Stamps, 237.
[02:15:22.460 --> 02:15:23.460]   Go to meeting 471.
[02:15:23.460 --> 02:15:26.900]   Somebody else didn't have something to say about chickens besides Leo and myself.
[02:15:26.900 --> 02:15:31.260]   Squarespace offer code TWIT4, audible platinum 2, offer code TWIT2.
[02:15:31.260 --> 02:15:32.260]   Am I right?
[02:15:32.260 --> 02:15:33.260]   That is correct.
[02:15:33.260 --> 02:15:37.140]   I need to look at the go to meeting changes because I haven't...
[02:15:37.140 --> 02:15:40.860]   I see it's highlighted, but I'm worried.
[02:15:40.860 --> 02:15:41.860]   It's just simple copy changes.
[02:15:41.860 --> 02:15:42.860]   Wait, we're not halfway through the show?
[02:15:42.860 --> 02:15:43.860]   I'll talk about the wine.
[02:15:43.860 --> 02:15:44.860]   Right.
[02:15:44.860 --> 02:15:48.540]   They save all this stuff and they use it for bloopers.
[02:15:48.540 --> 02:15:52.180]   They use it for bloopers at the end of the show.
[02:15:52.180 --> 02:15:53.180]   This was...
[02:15:53.180 --> 02:15:54.180]   I invented this.
[02:15:54.180 --> 02:15:55.180]   You did.
[02:15:55.180 --> 02:15:59.820]   Well, Burt Reynolds invented it and Smokey and the Bandit parts too, but I copied it.
[02:15:59.820 --> 02:16:04.620]   I invented it for podcasts where the show ends, the theme music comes up and then wait, no,
[02:16:04.620 --> 02:16:05.620]   it's not over yet.
[02:16:05.620 --> 02:16:09.460]   We used to do this on the Silicon Spin Show and I quashed it.
[02:16:09.460 --> 02:16:10.460]   You did?
[02:16:10.460 --> 02:16:11.460]   Why did you quash it?
[02:16:11.460 --> 02:16:12.460]   I don't like it.
[02:16:12.460 --> 02:16:13.460]   You know why I do it?
[02:16:13.460 --> 02:16:14.460]   Oh, you're getting a text there.
[02:16:14.460 --> 02:16:15.460]   It's probably...
[02:16:15.460 --> 02:16:16.460]   You know why I do it?
[02:16:16.460 --> 02:16:17.460]   ... somebody criticizing me.
[02:16:17.460 --> 02:16:19.300]   Because I want people to listen to the whole show because sometimes the best thing is the
[02:16:19.300 --> 02:16:20.700]   last thing.
[02:16:20.700 --> 02:16:24.860]   When is that?
[02:16:24.860 --> 02:16:27.620]   When we put in the bit about chickens being racist.
[02:16:27.620 --> 02:16:28.620]   Sure.
[02:16:28.620 --> 02:16:31.540]   They are, they're racist, I'm telling you.
[02:16:31.540 --> 02:16:32.540]   These chickens.
[02:16:32.540 --> 02:16:33.540]   Chicken races.
[02:16:33.540 --> 02:16:36.100]   You know, there's a lot of different size chickens.
[02:16:36.100 --> 02:16:40.580]   There's big ones and small ones and chickens that they little bitty eggs and big eggs.
[02:16:40.580 --> 02:16:41.580]   Yeah.
[02:16:41.580 --> 02:16:42.580]   Brown eggs.
[02:16:42.580 --> 02:16:43.580]   Eggs all kinds.
[02:16:43.580 --> 02:16:44.580]   White eggs.
[02:16:44.580 --> 02:16:47.780]   There's actually a duck egg that's black.
[02:16:47.780 --> 02:16:48.780]   Really?
[02:16:48.780 --> 02:16:50.620]   Oh, it's a dynamite looking egg.
[02:16:50.620 --> 02:16:51.620]   Does it taste better?
[02:16:51.620 --> 02:16:52.620]   I never had one.
[02:16:52.620 --> 02:16:53.620]   I'd only seen them at the fair.
[02:16:53.620 --> 02:16:56.180]   I just tweeted chickens for fun.
[02:16:56.180 --> 02:16:58.060]   There we go.
[02:16:58.060 --> 02:16:59.940]   I think you're confusing tweeting and...
[02:16:59.940 --> 02:17:00.940]   I CC'd you, Leo.
[02:17:00.940 --> 02:17:01.940]   ... fucking.
[02:17:01.940 --> 02:17:05.420]   And by the way, the chicken, because they lay all these eggs all over the place, the
[02:17:05.420 --> 02:17:08.340]   eggs are phenomenal compared to a store bought egg.
[02:17:08.340 --> 02:17:09.340]   Oh, I agree.
[02:17:09.340 --> 02:17:11.100]   So you just got to go forage for some...
[02:17:11.100 --> 02:17:12.100]   Oh no, it's much better.
[02:17:12.100 --> 02:17:13.100]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:17:13.100 --> 02:17:14.100]   That's why you want drunk chickens.
[02:17:14.100 --> 02:17:15.100]   It's so much better.
[02:17:15.100 --> 02:17:16.100]   Oh, she's yawning.
[02:17:16.100 --> 02:17:17.100]   I'm so sorry, Lauren.
[02:17:17.100 --> 02:17:18.100]   She's bored.
[02:17:18.100 --> 02:17:19.100]   Oh, it's okay.
[02:17:19.100 --> 02:17:20.100]   No, no.
[02:17:20.100 --> 02:17:21.100]   It's not you.
[02:17:21.100 --> 02:17:22.100]   It's me.
[02:17:22.100 --> 02:17:23.100]   It's not you.
[02:17:23.100 --> 02:17:24.100]   It's me.
[02:17:24.100 --> 02:17:25.100]   It's not you.
[02:17:25.100 --> 02:17:26.100]   It's me.
[02:17:26.100 --> 02:17:27.100]   It's not you.
[02:17:27.100 --> 02:17:28.780]   You're going through the brush to find your own eggs.
[02:17:28.780 --> 02:17:31.780]   We can still be friends, Lauren.
[02:17:31.780 --> 02:17:33.660]   Alright, here we go.
[02:17:33.660 --> 02:17:37.940]   About time.
[02:17:37.940 --> 02:17:40.780]   Sometimes when the pre-show's this good, the rest of the show is crap.
[02:17:40.780 --> 02:17:41.780]   Most of the time.
[02:17:41.780 --> 02:17:42.780]   That's actually probably going to happen.
[02:17:42.780 --> 02:17:44.460]   But most of the time the rest of the show is crap, so it's the way it is.
[02:17:44.460 --> 02:17:46.460]   Yeah, that really probably doesn't have anything to do with anything.
[02:17:46.460 --> 02:17:47.460]   No.
