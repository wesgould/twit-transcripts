[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com/podcasting.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   This is Twit, This Week in Tech, Episode 59 for June 25, 2006.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   [Music]
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Joining us now on the Twit Round Table, which is actually not round.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   If I were to draw, it's probably more like a map of the internet.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Doing it in the start of topography.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   I was thinking maybe geographically, but you're right, it's more like a cloud, isn't it?
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   John C. Devorak is here to work that arc/blog.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   From here, home in the East Bay.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Robert Herron is here from, are you at your home in the East Bay as well?
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   I am.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   So that's a really big bump we've got there over in the East.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   From the city of San Francisco proper, we've got Mr. Patrick Norton.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   And I think, Roger, are you in San Francisco too?
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Yes.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   All right.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   And we're hoping Kevin Rose will join us a little later on to talk about, to Crow about Dig 3.0.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   But meanwhile, it's kind of a back to roots edition of Dig because we've been on the road, we've been traveling, we did the hated...
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Did I say Dig? I did.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Twit, I'm sorry, I'm just wishful thinking.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   This is the back to the roots episode of Twit.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   But we are after the hated 57, I thought we'd...no more interlopers.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Roger, you said one was really hated.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   You obviously didn't visit the website.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   You know, I have such a pathological sort of hate relationship to comments on boards.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   These are the ones with the file insulting comments.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Oh man.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Did you have to censor any of them?
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   I censored a few because there were a few that were gay bashing which I got rid of.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   But the people really hated a couple of the participants.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   I won't name names on the show.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   But I take the blame because I think it was really a sound quality issue, frankly.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   And as you know, John and Patrick, because you were there, nobody could hear anybody.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   So of course we were all talking over each other.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Right.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   That wasn't anybody's fault of mine.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   So I take the blame for that.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   You know what we did though?
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   That was kind of fun as I posted the raw tracks, you know, because we ate tracked it and asked people to remix.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And I've gotten, unfortunately, we got so much response.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I have dozens of these remixes.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   I haven't had time to go through them all.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   So I'm going to have to, as soon as I get a chance, I'm going to post them and give people a chance.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   There's probably one with a bunch of like fart noises overlaid.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   No doubt.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Additional subliminals.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   I mentioned it last week.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   There's one funny one that's a minute long and it's just the open and the close.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Oh man.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Which was kind of a commentary.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   A true fan.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   So we've all been playing before the show started with Windows Live because Robert, I guess, uses the traffic reports in Windows Live.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   And it was...
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Yeah, and I kept calling it local.live.com because that's the web address, but it's actually live local.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   They should switch those two words in the URL.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Well, because Windows Live is the registered trademark, right?
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Gotcha.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   You are all screwed up.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   The URL in mine says local.live.com.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Right, but on the page it says live.live.local.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   It's completely one or the other.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Anyway, I'm looking at this traffic thing right now.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   What's so special about it?
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   John, for those of us who actually leave our homes on a regular basis and travel and what would be considered prime commuting hours, the opportunity to afford a greater knowledge of what misfit has, you know, side-swiped a semi rolled three times in block traffic on 80 for four hours is incredibly useful.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   I do have to say one thing. I agree with John in one respect, at least in the Bay Area. There aren't any alternate routes, so all you do...
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Actually, there are.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Well, there are.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Well, there are not many.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   It's not like LA where you can go in three different ways.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   What's the alternate route across the Bay Bridge?
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Well, for me though, it's...
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   It's not bad it is.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   It's where you're going.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   It's the choice between the 580 and the 880.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Like, if you're looking at the map right now, there's a slowdown around the Coliseum for probably a game or something, so I'd know just to jump over to the 580 and roll to the 80 that way.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Now, Robert, when you do that, you should pound your chest.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   This is Captain Robert in the...
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Twit Skybird.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   And we can have our own traffic report.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   The first podcast with traffic reports.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Real time.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Actually, I mean, when I brought home the traffic gauge, when I started doing testing for that one, which is like a handheld regional version of this, for LA and the Bay Area and Seattle, my wife who had just finished, you know, two years of a 500 mile a week round trip commute down to Santa Clara,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   she liked actually watching it to see all of the traffic jams she wasn't running into anymore.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   I do the same thing now, because I no longer drive into San Francisco like I did.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Well, it's a nice cheat because you can do a quick eyeball and figure out if the Bay Bridge is screwed up and maybe you'll leave an hour later, right?
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   It's just cool.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   We should give the URL.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   It was in the show notes, but live.local.live.com.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   And then it's the traffic...
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Where does this traffic information come from?
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   It's the traffic.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   So there's now universal traffic information.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   No, there's actually regional, like Caltrans generates the traffic data.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Caltrans generates, and I don't know the name of the organization that does it up in Seattle.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   And then traffic.com aggregates the official information.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Yeah, they've got it for like Seattle, Portland, Salt Lake, Denver, Minneapolis, and there's you go to traffic.com.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   They've got a list of all the major areas they hit.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   See, it even provides event information as well.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Like they're talking about the night's game for the Giants and the gay pride parade happening right now and what to avoid.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Or what streets you probably want to avoid if you're trying to drive into that area.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   So there's Giants game and the gay pride parade.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Yep.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   They belong together.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Probably one.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   I'm wondering they should the Jackson maybe get some of those guys to play on the team.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   It would be cool if they could integrate mass transit, like how full a car is or how soon they can get.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   I think in some areas they do.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   I mean if you, you know, it barks on time.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   It probably indicates that someone.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   So I'm looking at this map and I see the 880 going past the Coliseum, but it's got like a green color and an orange color.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   I mean, what is that supposed to mean?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   That's because they do.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   They monitor sections of the highway.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   So you can see where I'm like.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Right in the middle of the highway.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   I go faster, slower.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   I go slower.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   No, it means John means if you're thinking about it, how many times you run into southbound on all one way.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Right.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   So you can see the compression between Alameda and Union City or what basically you can tell when the airports get in hammered in Oakland.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Zoom in, John.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Then you can see that it's actually different lanes.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   It's one different directions.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   You have to zoom in.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Robert was pointing out that the zoom, the scroll wheel works with the zoom, which is very cool.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   And it works on Firefox on the Mac, which is kind of surprising, giving it some Microsoft product.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Zoom being the thing when dead out.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   You zoom too far.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   It's just a solid-based screen.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Three of us are looking at it.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   It went down.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Is that what happened?
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Maybe.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   We killed it.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Zoom back, John.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Zoom back.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Pull out.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Pull out.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Right above the little compass thing.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   It says, "Road an aerial."
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   You click on "Arial" to get the satellite view, which is kind of cool.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   So as we're talking about it, any other websites, everybody's now trying to, it's funny that we're back to the portal page.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   The satellite view is giving me a black screen with some cute lines running down it.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   You see this saying, "I'm not happy with this."
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   You're at like eight feet above the ground, John.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Are you on dial-up?
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   No, he zoomed.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Look at the lower right-hand corner and tell me what the little gauge down there says the scale.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   What does it say?
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   I zoomed out to one mile.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   It's zoomed out a couple more miles.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   It's starting to sound like, you know, we're talking to Grandpa.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Hey, you can click the start menu.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   John, John, you're getting your traffic monitors and your portals.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   So, uh...
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   No, I hear all these raves from you guys and I look at this thing and I'm not seeing what the rave is.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   I don't, you know, I'm not sure I would make it my start page on the internet, but I guess if I drove a lot, I would.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   It's a useful tool.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   I'm supposed to have to die traffic transit.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Avoiding all this traffic completely.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Yes.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   I'm avoiding going to the news because we have a, uh, our associate news editor, Fred F from the UK, has been putting in stories and there's like eight million stories in here.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Uh-oh.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   So, there's quite a few to go through.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   We can talk about Blu-ray.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Let's talk about Blu-ray.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Because we've got, we're still, we, our Blu-ray box is supposed to show up Friday, so hopefully it'll be in Monday.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   First Blu-ray players are now shipping.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   From Samsung, Sony's are delayed another month, or three months, or six months, or they're going to drop it to push PS3 sales.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   But, uh, we've actually, we've had, uh, one of the desktop VIOs and a notebook VIO in-house.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   And I gotta tell you, the Blu-ray software that they ship with the VIOs really needs some more time in the oven.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Uh-oh.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   What's wrong? What goes wrong?
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   It doesn't work.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Yeah, but one of the, we're still waiting for Sony to get back to us to explain why the stuff on the, uh, the desktop doesn't work.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   And they're blaming architecture issues on the notebooks for its occasional slowdowns while playing video.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Hey, Patrick.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Can you ask Sony a question when you're going through the discussion on this thing?
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   I'd like to know exactly how their primary competitor in consumer electronics, Samsung, manages to roll out what's essentially Sony's product before Sony.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Good question.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   Just ask them, just ask them, say, you know, ask them to see what they say.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Actually, I, you know what, I think it really is.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   I think Samsung's trying to grow in the consumer electronics market in the United States, and they're willing to take entry-level risks with stuff like the ultra-mobile PC and the, and the initial Blu-ray players.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   They're just throwing a bunch of stuff out and see what sticks.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Now, according to PC world, Samsung is considering a dual format player, uh, later this year, I went.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   So, it was LG.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   They already have them ready to go.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   So, this is, we've talked about this before, John's contention is that they signed secret agreements preventing them from doing that.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Totally.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   I have a conspiracy theory about the whole thing.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   And that's a, Sony won't let anyone release a Blu-ray player for under $1,000 until the PS3 ships, which will make that the cheapest Blu-ray player.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   This is, according to PC world, uh, assistant manager in Samsung's home platform product planning division.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Said, "We don't have plans to make an HD DVD only player, but are considering a universal player.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   We're preparing HD DVD support now, and if we launch a universal player, it'll be the end of this year or early next year.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Samsung thinks Blu-ray will beat HD DVD, but they will consider it a dual format player.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   And Primera is shipping now a Blu-ray duplicator, which will make it much easier to pirate movies.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   Uh, 50 discs at a time.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   I like it.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Well, we actually have the, the Pioneer Blu-ray disc burner in.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   How about, so these Blu-rays are, are higher data density than the HD DVD.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   I mean, they're better for the two of us.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Yeah, 25.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   25 gigabytes.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   How about, let's forget the movie aspect of it.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   How are they as backup devices or copy, you know, how, how's the burner?
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Is it, is it good?
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   The, the phrase slow comes to mind.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   It is a lot of data you're putting down.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   I mean, is it slow relative to the amount of data or is it actually slower than a DVD burning?
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Well, it's slow.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   It's, it's slow relative to what you're used to with, with existing optical disc.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Remember, it's the same thing happened when you went from CD to DVD is it seemed really
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   slow, but you're burning 10 times the data.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   You know, or eight times the data.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   It's expensive, but you know, how does it look?
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Has anybody seen a movie on the Blu-ray yet?
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.400]   It's exactly like an HD DVD disc only with a different logo.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.000]   I mean, it's, it's a little more purple.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.600]   Now, now the Samsung does support 1080p, which the blue, the HDs do not yet.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.600]   Supposedly.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.400]   Again, supposedly this is all spec.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:24.080]   But are there any 1080p play movies to play back?
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.080]   They're all 1080p.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.080]   They're all they are.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.080]   Okay.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.080]   All the HD DVDs are 1080p.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.080]   Yeah.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.080]   Even though the players can't support it.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:35.160]   Well, the player in ironic may very well have digital out at 1080p, but yeah, it'll
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.160]   be simple.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.160]   Try immediately.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.960]   That's the other thing is we've got a, we've got a tissue, HD DVD player coming up
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.480]   again, again, hopefully on Monday.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:48.800]   And supposedly they've done a firmware patch on it that alleviates a lot of our frustration
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.800]   with the first generation tissue of HD DVD players.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:52.800]   So.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.640]   Did you see the argument and I thought it was pretty coherent from, let me see if I can
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.640]   find the source, the guy saying, forget it.
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:02.720]   They're going to both going to lose.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.720]   The war is over.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.720]   Who wins?
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.720]   I think.
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.480]   Internet too to the fiber to the curb.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.720]   So that's coming tomorrow, right?
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.720]   No problem.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:18.720]   Well, if they take any longer to get this stuff out, it's from audioholics.com.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:24.200]   Top 10 reasons why high definition DVD formats have already failed.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.640]   Shall I run by the reasons?
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.640]   Number one.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.640]   It's not dramatic enough compared to DVDs.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.040]   There's not market saturation.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.360]   There's competing formats.
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.280]   Oh, you could write this article yourself.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.280]   This is what they say.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.920]   Nobody likes false starts, which I think is probably true.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:37.920]   Yeah, right.
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:38.920]   It's not going to kill anything.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.520]   There's plenty of them that have done very well.
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.520]   That's right.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.920]   Number two, format wars don't sell players.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:45.920]   I think that's compelling argument.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.920]   Yeah, they do.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.320]   That creates competition with the lowest prices, which does sell players.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.480]   But it scares consumers.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.120]   I can rebut everyone who's on the wall.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.120]   I know you can.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.120]   And by the way, you could also have written this article.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.480]   It doesn't matter to John.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.480]   I take either side.
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.480]   Either side.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:05.800]   HD, DVD, and Blu-ray are not quantum leaps in technology in the way that I guess DVD was.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.320]   In other words, I guess he's saying they're not, and I've said this before, they're not
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.320]   that much better.
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.720]   DVD over VHS was significantly more dramatic than that.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.720]   You start going into multi-layered shoot double-ray.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.680]   You double-rayed a lot of data on one of these disks.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.800]   You'll never be able to store on a DVD.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:25.160]   Studio of John, a lot of people are looking at these on smaller monitors and going, "Huh,
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.400]   looks like my DVD right now."
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.640]   I know I'm talking about in terms of raw storage capability for backup purposes.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.800]   We got terabyte drives coming.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.800]   Well, that's a different data sample.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.080]   That's a different conversation.
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.840]   That's the data storage conversation versus the movie format.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.840]   Hi, John.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:43.960]   I mean, I think this is all about whether this is a movie format, not whether it's the
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.520]   highest quality consumer format we've ever had.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.680]   Yeah, I've been over a couple of weeks, so I'm argumentative, I'm sorry.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.680]   No, it's good.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.280]   He saved it up.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.800]   He hasn't wasted it on anybody else.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.200]   Studios are conservative, greedy, and unmotivated.
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.680]   Well, that'll never change.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:00.680]   Okay, I'm wrong.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:05.360]   Yeah, I mean, well, no offense, but they were greedy and unmotivated when VHS came out and
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.360]   they're being a max.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.200]   So they're conservative as a result.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.640]   They won't even listen to this.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.640]   Affirmative.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:15.480]   But you have to say that the list of titles we talked about last week, the list of titles
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.360]   are not impressive.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.520]   Unless you're a milo yo yo.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.960]   And by the way, I found out it's not Joe Vovitch.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.960]   It's yo wowich.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.800]   So unless you're a milo wowich.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.720]   Man, where is it wowich?
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.720]   I don't know.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.640]   There's 90 titles out, 96 titles out there.
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.040]   Oh, well, for HD.
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.240]   But for Blu Ray, there's only a handful.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.240]   75 listed right now.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.240]   But yeah.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.920]   PlayStation 3 cannot save the world.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:43.800]   Those who ignore history dot dot dot people want technology that's 15 minutes ahead of
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:44.960]   its time.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.760]   Enthusiasts are getting tired and smarter.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.400]   A skeptical news media doesn't help.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.640]   I guess that's us.
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.360]   Broadband and IPTV to compete.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.360]   Question mark.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.360]   That's the argument.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.360]   No.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.400]   That was just what the USA bonked.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.400]   Exactly.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.200]   Well, since I think AT&T and Comcast would like to crush the...
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.480]   Did you see the video of the Comcast technician sleeping on the guy's couch?
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.000]   I don't play in the poor guy.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.120]   He was on hold for an hour with Comcast.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:15.360]   It doesn't even have a special number to make it any quicker on his own end.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.360]   He falls asleep.
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.840]   He's got his laptop and his poor contractor.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.440]   Yeah, he's probably not even an employee, right?
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.880]   He's just a kind of fast asleep.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:27.120]   You know, we should put a website up with that stuff because I had a guy fall asleep in
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.720]   my driveway once from sprint.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.720]   Really?
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.720]   Yeah.
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.920]   I was wondering what was going on because I was waiting here.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.800]   And the guy went outside just to get something.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:36.800]   I went out there.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.800]   He's dead snoring.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.560]   It is in his right in the front seat.
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.560]   Unbelievable.
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.560]   Sorry, John.
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.480]   Was that a major keger last night?
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.680]   You're an overwhelming client.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:49.680]   I just...
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.680]   It happens later in the street.
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.840]   I think John's falling asleep during twit.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.880]   So, you know, I'm not going to say...
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.400]   I'm encouraging.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:06.040]   According to Radio Sweden, the White House ordered the Pirate Bay website closure.
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.840]   In fact, they've got documents to prove.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:08.840]   I love this story.
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:12.760]   It's a backstory on that because I saw the title, but I couldn't find the link to the
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:13.760]   actual article.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.760]   It's...
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:15.760]   What are they saying?
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.840]   All right, I'll tell you.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:21.960]   They claim they've got the documents that show the US threatened to go to the World Trade
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:22.960]   Organization.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.600]   This is the same thing the US is doing, by the way, to Russia over all of MP3.com, to
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.960]   impose economic sanctions against Sweden.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.280]   If the site, Pirate Bay, which is, of course, a big bit torrent tracker, was not stopped.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:37.120]   It came through the American Embassy in Stockholm.
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:40.720]   According to the documents, chief prosecutor from the Swedish government was called to
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:44.080]   the Justice Ministry and ordered...
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.080]   Ordered to take action.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.080]   You take action.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.080]   You take action?
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.080]   You take Patrick?
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.080]   Hey, Patrick.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.080]   I got to ask you something.
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.400]   You know, Pat, you said you couldn't get...
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:56.320]   I found that that link died too, and I'm wondering if that itself isn't kind of suspicious.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.320]   Sis vicious.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.320]   Mmm.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.960]   They only told to take down the site, but take down references to it.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:02.960]   That's...
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:03.960]   My mind...
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:04.960]   It's to the White House order, Claude.
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:05.960]   It proves...
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.680]   It proves the contention.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.640]   That's all I needed.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:10.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.440]   I know it's true now.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.280]   Yeah, they thought...
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.280]   Yeah, they thought...
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:20.480]   Probably what they would have done is thrown up tariffs for all exports out of Sweden to
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.480]   the US.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.480]   I think the...
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.120]   And the sad thing is the Swedish police are now going to just eat crow because they're
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.440]   getting sued by all the companies they put offline by taking their servers.
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:32.800]   The whole thing looks terrible, and Pirate Bay is back in operation from Sweden.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.600]   So it accomplished absolutely nothing.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.600]   Well, it disrupted a lot of other businesses.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.080]   Oh, there you go.
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:46.800]   So where do you think Larry Ellison stashed that $115 million he said he was given Harvard?
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:47.800]   Did you see that story?
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:48.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.800]   Tell us the story, Leo.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.800]   That's a great story.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:55.000]   Larry Ellison, a year ago, pledges he will give $115 million to Harvard the single largest
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.160]   contribution in the university's history.
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:02.440]   Harvard finally gets tired of waiting, goes to the press on Wednesday, says, "We haven't
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.240]   gotten anything."
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:09.960]   In fact, school officials have spent months trying to get Larry to talk to them.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.320]   Larry never paid us, said Harvard's spokeswoman Sarah Friedel.
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.320]   He didn't have to pay.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.320]   He already got the publicity.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.440]   He got everything he wanted.
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.600]   You know, he did this apparently once before.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:20.600]   Really?
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.600]   Yeah, there was another...
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:27.040]   I heard that reference on one of the broadcasts that he apparently stiffed somebody else.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.200]   Well, it's working because in October Forbes magazine listed him as one of the top 10 philanthropists
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.200]   in the business world.
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.240]   Based on the non-existent donations of Harvard.
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.320]   Yeah, good work Forbes.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.320]   Nice job.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.520]   It looks good on paper.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.120]   Oracle is declining to comment.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.040]   So maybe there's some truth to this.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.960]   Did you see that Warren Buffett...
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.240]   This was actually announced today and I don't have it in our notes yet.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:54.680]   Warren Buffett has said that he's going to give 85% of his fortune away just like Bill
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.840]   his buddy Bill Gates, the number one richest man in the world.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.920]   Warren's number two.
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:03.280]   And of that, about 30 billion will go to the Bill and Melon DeGates Foundation.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.280]   Isn't that great?
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.280]   Cool.
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.280]   That's going to...
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.280]   That foundation will now have...
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:12.520]   Well, he's not going to do it all at once, but he's pledged just like Larry Allison.
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.520]   He's pledged...
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.720]   United Way is putting together an anti-trust suit as we speak.
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.920]   I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.280]   We want some of that.
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:24.240]   He's pledged what will be basically double the endowment of the foundation, which is pretty
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.240]   amazing.
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:29.780]   Yeah, I do love the fact that Berkshire Hathaway stock price is...
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:31.480]   Perch-air price is 3,000.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.160]   It was $3,071 on Friday.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.320]   He doesn't believe in splits.
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.320]   No, not at all.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.840]   I love that.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:43.160]   The first installment will be is currently worth about $1.6 billion at today's Berkshire
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.360]   Hathaway price for this year, $1.6 billion.
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:47.360]   I think that's pretty impressive.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.360]   That's a good tax right now.
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.520]   Turner promised to give the UN a billion.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.520]   Whatever happened to that?
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.280]   No, I think he actually paid off our...
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.720]   What the US did.
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:59.400]   He paid off that portion of the debt.
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.400]   He did.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.400]   And he actually did it.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.400]   Yeah, good for him.
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:06.560]   But I think that was a one time because, you know, like all payments the UN dues are
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:07.560]   annual.
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.760]   He's not taking it on forever.
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:13.240]   No.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.080]   Just the old stuff.
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.880]   Take care of the back rent.
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:22.200]   You know, Warren Buffett, the real connection between Warren Buffett I think and Bill Gates
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.760]   is that they both love to play bridge.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.600]   In fact, whenever they're together, I understand they hold up together and just play bridge
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:30.920]   for hours all night.
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.000]   They love playing bridge.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   They love bridge.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Have you ever noticed that?
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   That they're big bridge?
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Are you a bridge?
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.560]   You seem like you'd be a bridge player, John.
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:41.320]   You know, that's funny to say that because when I was in the University of California,
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.240]   one of my roommates was the state national champion.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.240]   Wow.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.760]   And I could have learned the game from him.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.600]   But what did I do instead?
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:49.600]   What did you think?
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.800]   I don't want to say.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.760]   He was part of the free speech movement, I think.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.600]   You were out there making speeches and rabble rousing, weren't you?
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.600]   I should have been learning bridge.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.600]   That's all I can say.
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.920]   You know, it would be interesting if someone could do an analysis of all the great philanthropists,
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:09.400]   you know, Carnegie and Morgan and P. O'Feller.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.400]   I think O'Feller.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.400]   If they played bridge.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.720]   Maybe there's a connection.
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.720]   I think they played Wist.
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:15.720]   Wist.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:17.720]   Knuckle.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:18.720]   Knasta.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.720]   There's a game.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.320]   You know, it's hard to play Knasta because you have to hold like four decks of cards
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.320]   in your hand.
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:26.720]   There's, you know, it's a huge number of cards.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.720]   So where do you run into space?
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.720]   I don't know.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:33.840]   You know, learn so many interesting things on Twit, don't you find?
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:40.040]   There have been this week alone three zero day Excel flaws.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.840]   What's going on with Excel?
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:42.840]   Three.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.920]   There's a security hall.
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.920]   It's being exploited.
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:47.920]   Who cares?
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:50.920]   What kind of security hall can you have?
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:56.040]   Well, I know you can have a problem because if you use Internet Explorer in Windows, it
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.040]   is by default.
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.880]   It will open office documents from websites.
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.300]   It'll open Word documents and Excel documents.
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:05.800]   So if I embedded an Excel document on a website and somebody's foolish enough to be using
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.800]   Internet Explorer.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:13.040]   Damn, boom, I got them.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:16.080]   Larry Ellison has dropped out of college twice, by the way.
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.080]   I don't think you went to Harvard at any point.
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.080]   Are we going back to Larry Ellison's story?
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.080]   Yeah, I just like read ball tales about Larry Ellison.
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.080]   We don't twit.
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.920]   Are there write ball tales about Larry Ellison?
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:31.520]   So basically Ellison has never graduated with a degree from college.
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:32.520]   No, no degree.
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.200]   And that's he's held it back considerably.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.200]   I've noticed.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.200]   Obviously.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.960]   He'd be so much richer.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:39.960]   What do you think of?
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.120]   What do you make of this Dan Rather story?
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.360]   He's going to Mark Cuban's HD net.
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:48.840]   You know, it sounds a lot like good night and good luck only in a much mellower way.
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.600]   Well interesting because apparently Rather, this is very Nick Sony.
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.920]   Rather, Dan Rather has been going to watch by himself.
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:57.920]   Good night.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:58.920]   Good luck.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.280]   He's apparently seen it four or five times now over and over again.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.360]   Bemoaning the good old days of Edward.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.640]   Well, I think he's trying to look for the frequency.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.360]   What's the frequency, Kenneth?
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.360]   That's an obscure.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:14.840]   I guess essentially he's been fired because CBS just won't let him do anything.
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:20.840]   And we can blame the blogosphere for that because it was Rather's now tainted story
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:26.680]   about Bush's service and service that was exposed by the blogosphere and really I think
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.240]   got Dan Rather fired.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.760]   And now, you know, you're looking at more an issue of his ratings and then trying not
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.600]   to muddle the audience or trying to redirect.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.560]   Could have been that for CBS News.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:41.520]   And what is, I haven't seen network news in years, but I think CBS now is, what are they
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.520]   doing?
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.520]   They keep changing.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.680]   They've got a guy in holding pattern until Katie takes on the ratings.
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:51.200]   The ratings under the new guy are up and then, you know, unless they changed their mind,
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.840]   Katie Cork takes over later this year.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.920]   I can't see that working out personally.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.080]   She's too chipper.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:00.760]   Well, yeah, she's not, you know, it's all, and I don't want to.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.040]   I know what you're going here.
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.040]   You're going.
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.040]   Well, the soothsayer.
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.200]   He knows where I'm going.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.200]   So I'm not going there.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.200]   I won't do it.
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.200]   I won't do it.
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.200]   I won't go there.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.200]   You know where you're going, John.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.200]   He's going to say, are you mad as hell?
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.760]   Are you not going to take it anymore?
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.560]   Say, oh, no woman can be credible as a network news anchor.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:18.560]   Aren't you going to say that?
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.560]   That's not what I was going to say, but I say no.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.560]   That's pretty close.
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:22.920]   I don't think that's what it is.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.040]   I just don't think Katie Kurex the one for that job.
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:28.440]   I don't, what, when did she, when did she become a talking head?
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.840]   She's a personality.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:30.840]   That's good.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.400]   Well, maybe that's what the news needs.
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.000]   Walter Cronkite was a personality.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.800]   Yeah, I guess he was.
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:36.800]   I guess that's true.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.760]   Well, was Katie ever a reporter in a two sense turn?
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.480]   Probably in some local station somewhere.
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.960]   You mean like a journalist?
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.440]   Probably not.
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.920]   I'm not, I'm not convinced this is a good idea.
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.920]   Nope.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:48.920]   Yeah.
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.920]   And by the way, though, that's not where I was going.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:51.920]   Oh, really?
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:52.920]   Where were you going?
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.280]   I was going to talk about somebody at Tech TV.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.680]   That's kind of a personality guy.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.880]   They put him into the Anchorman slot.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:03.120]   I think Victoria Riccano should be the next anchor of CBS Night News.
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.120]   Victoria was on set.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.400]   Is it she still doing current affairs or something?
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.400]   No, you're kidding?
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.960]   She's like a hotshot on that news show insider.
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:10.960]   You're kidding.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.720]   By the way, Kim Orecch, John.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:16.200]   Kurex reporting career brand, which was hired by Stan Hooper as a desk assistant for the
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.400]   ABC News Bureau in Washington, D.C.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:23.960]   She became an assignment editor at CNN, worked as a general assignment reporter for WTVJ
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:28.720]   in Miami, Florida, WRC TV, and ABC station in D.C.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:32.760]   I just looked up where she won her Associated Press Award and an Emmy.
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:36.320]   She joined NBC News in 1989 as a reporter from 89 to 91.
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:39.240]   She filled in for Brian Dumble as a host today.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.240]   I think she's got some skills.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.240]   All right.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.240]   At least according to Wikipedia.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.240]   I'm still saying.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.240]   Go to Victoria.
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:50.360]   I'm not seeing the same kind of bio that you hear from, get out of Rather's background
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.360]   or front guys.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.360]   He was a real news guy.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.160]   This is floating around a bunch of local stations.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.160]   Come on.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:59.800]   I know, but you're saying this like the whole integrity of the news reporting mechanism
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.760]   in national television still matters.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:02.760]   Forget it.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:03.720]   I think it does matter.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:08.320]   I think it should, but I don't think it does in the eyes of the people making the decisions.
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.320]   It's entertaining.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.200]   I think it's a good runarligent charge of news at ABC.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.760]   It's become an entertainment division.
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.000]   I think Katie Corri can read as teleprompter.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.680]   This is as good as anybody else.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.600]   I'm not sure of that either.
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:24.040]   You want to go look at Victoria's Wikipedia article.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.840]   Victoria Riccania.
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:26.840]   She's so funny.
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:32.240]   If you ever watched that show on E called The Soup, they're on her case constantly.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.240]   They're hilarious.
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.240]   Really?
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.240]   Yeah, she's like a highlighted person.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:40.400]   Apparently in May she appeared as herself in an episode of CSI Miami, but I'm just loving
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.360]   this picture on Wikipedia.
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.400]   I mean, there's a news anchor.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.840]   By Francis Bertrand.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.800]   Wow.
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.800]   I'd hire her.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.880]   Hey, have you guys seen the XGL running on open sous?
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:58.040]   Yeah, let's get back to the topics here.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:03.120]   So what about this broadcast flag that they want to sneak into?
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.960]   Senator Stevens telecommunication.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:05.960]   But what happened with that, by the way?
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:11.480]   It's the latest on that because it only saw on Wednesday they were going up to the committee.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.480]   Did it pass through committee?
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:17.880]   Senator Two, Senator Stevens, who is one of the three oldest men in the Senate.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.840]   We have the oldest Senate, by the way, in history of the West.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:21.840]   Far from Alaska?
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.080]   That's that jerk from Alaska, right?
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.080]   You know, Stevens is Alabama.
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.880]   Oh, there's a guy from Alaska that's pretty, I thought it was Stevens too.
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:33.160]   Stevens is kind of in the pocket, I believe, of the telecommunications industry.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:40.000]   He co-wrote the original '96 Telecommunications Act, says, "We made some mistakes," and they're
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.480]   redoing it, but they've snuck in broadcast flag.
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:46.880]   Remember the broadcast flag was overturned?
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.160]   The FCC wanted it to the courts.
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.160]   By the courts.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.160]   Yeah, by votes.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.560]   The FCC wanted to put it in.
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:29:00.280]   This was a device that would go into all analog, all TVs, all computers that would allow a
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:06.000]   broadcaster to set a flag on any programming saying you may not copy this.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.280]   The FCC was going to enforce it, and the courts said you can't.
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:14.720]   So now the Senate is going to send out a bill, the new telecommunications act, to make it
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:20.600]   into law, requiring that you put these things in.
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:26.120]   So the committee marked it up this week, and I don't know what the latest status is of
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.120]   it.
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.000]   How many times do we have to shoot this down?
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   I don't know.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   It's a terrible idea.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.720]   When they want to get something through, they just keep running it at you until you're
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.720]   stuck with it.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.720]   You can't wait.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.920]   You should be highlighting these politicians who keep doing it.
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:38.920]   I agree.
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:39.920]   I agree.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.880]   Most of the guys are in incumbent areas where they can't get voted out of office, and they've
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.920]   already gerrymandered their place in such a way that, except for the senators, but
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.080]   Mueller House guys have all, you know, they're pretty much locked in.
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.840]   We can't get rid of these people.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:54.840]   Turn limits.
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.680]   Well, this got me.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.880]   Stevens has been in there forever.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.040]   I'm just trying to see what the latest is on this.
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.400]   Hey, you guys here that see you.
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.400]   Maybe he's Alaska.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.240]   No, I thought there was a Stevens.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.880]   There's a Stevens in Alaska too.
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.880]   All right.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:09.880]   I'm confusing which one.
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.880]   Alaska is terrible.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:11.880]   I'm not sure which Stevens is.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.880]   From Alaska should be ashamed of themselves.
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:14.880]   Oh, you know what?
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.880]   It is Alaska.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.880]   I thought AAAL was Alabama.
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:18.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:19.880]   I apologize.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.520]   I was completely wrong.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.440]   You should apologize to the people from Alabama.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.840]   They have to go to that.
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:26.040]   And I take back the accent.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.040]   What's the Alaska?
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.040]   It's Alaska.
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.040]   AK.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.040]   I don't know.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.040]   I'm confused.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.040]   You're asking too much of making.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.640]   The FCC, the role of gatekeepers of new technologies.
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.640]   Yikes.
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:41.320]   Well, apparently the FCC approved taxes for VoIP on Friday.
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.040]   Really?
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:46.280]   That was something that was there were long opposed to.
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:51.960]   Well, moving these specific kinds of bits across the internet are now suddenly taxable.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.360]   This is net neutrality once again.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.360]   That's...
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:56.360]   Oh.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.520]   Where's my federal communications?
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:00.520]   CNET supporting it.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:06.760]   FCC voted unanimously at its monthly meeting here in DC to require all voice over internet
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:10.680]   protocol services that connect to the public switch telephone network as opposed to using
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:15.120]   peer to peer technology like Skype to contribute to the universal service fund.
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.120]   So wait a minute.
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.800]   So if you use Skype, you would have to pay...
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.320]   Oh, it's the universal service.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.320]   That's right.
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:21.320]   Yeah.
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:22.320]   Which is kind of cool.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:27.680]   I mean, that's what subsidized telephone service and the middle of nowhere back in the
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.680]   day.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:31.880]   So Skype to Skype calls wouldn't be affected and...
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.880]   But Skype to play for you.
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.880]   Just don't leave your bee.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:34.880]   Skype to play for you.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:35.880]   Yeah.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:36.880]   Anything that...
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:40.160]   Faith anytime of VoIP connects to a POTS, you get charged.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.320]   Any time of VoIP connects to...
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:44.160]   Sounds like something my parents told me about the birds and the bees.
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:47.360]   On a VoIP and a POTS like each other.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.360]   And they get...
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:53.360]   You get taxes.
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.040]   Any other stories anybody wants to bring out?
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:32:01.040]   I can talk about CEOs earning 262 times the pay of workers, according to the Economic Policy
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.040]   Institute.
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.240]   Your husband goes on for years.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.240]   Who cares?
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.240]   They deserve it.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.240]   Give them more money.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.680]   Yeah, they especially deserve when they start laying everybody off.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:09.680]   That's not really...
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:10.760]   Get their money's worth.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:12.480]   How about wireless USB?
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.480]   Yeah, that's a mess.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:21.960]   The story behind wireless USB is at the last ultra wide band meeting.
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:25.120]   Somebody was like, "It's time to start shipping products!"
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.800]   And everybody went, "Her, her, yes.
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.960]   We should ship products."
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.360]   So someday we'll see wireless USB products and wire.
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.360]   That's a good product.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:37.080]   Part of the issue is spectrum is that if you're going to make it something that you could sell
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.760]   everywhere, you've got to get the spectrum approved everywhere.
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.760]   Well, the problem is, yeah, it's...
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:47.480]   Ultra wide band is fundamentally a US-only technology because of the bandwidth in place.
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:51.600]   So you can make it, but you can only sell it here, I guess.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:56.880]   But isn't that particular type of frequency allocation very robust in terms of you could
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.480]   have lots of overlapping devices and...
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.440]   Well, why don't they use 2.4?
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.320]   Why don't they use the unregulated bandwidth?
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:04.680]   Is it just too crowded now?
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.560]   No, it's not like you're not on a band with Ultra wide band.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:12.320]   It's a whole series of frequencies and it's a bunch of sputtering that goes on.
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.480]   It's a time-based kind of thing.
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.040]   It's not a jumping thing either.
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.040]   It's all at once.
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:19.320]   Like frequency hopping spread spectrum.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.800]   But that's different.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:26.640]   Ultra wide band is also used to be called low detection radio and it used to be called
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:34.080]   pulse radio and it's a very strange type of radio that some people think is just bogus.
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.080]   It's been around for a long time.
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:36.080]   So it may never work.
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.080]   No, it does work.
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.760]   The military apparently uses it, but they have to crank up.
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:45.040]   They don't give them enough because everybody else that has those fixed spectrum, these
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:48.920]   fixed frequencies, they're upset with the fact that Ultra wide band has to take a whole
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:51.080]   bunch of the stuff and then they make a bunch of...
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:54.520]   Supposedly, the Ultra wide band people say it's all below the noise level, but these
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.080]   other guys say that's bull.
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:00.400]   It interferes with the global positioning satellite frequency and everything in between.
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.280]   It's right now it's a 3 to 10 gigahertz.
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:03.280]   So we're very...
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:06.000]   It's all over the place.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   So it's...
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   And so they...
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.800]   So the FCC said, "Well, we can let you guys slide, but you don't get a lot of juice."
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.640]   So they won't let them have much power.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:18.720]   So the best that you can do with it is stick a device, you know, an Ultra...
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:23.560]   A USB device and then shoot it over to the printer like 10 feet away.
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:24.640]   Or for a cell phone.
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:26.160]   But is it better than Bluetooth?
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:28.160]   I guess it's faster than Bluetooth is the whole point, right?
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:29.160]   Oh, it's super fast.
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.160]   It's 400 plus.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:34.200]   Yeah, but Bluetooth is going to run over it and a wireless 1394 is going to run over
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:35.200]   it.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.200]   So it's just a...
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.200]   It's like a cable almost.
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:39.200]   It's a...
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.200]   Essentially.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:41.200]   It's a pro...
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:42.200]   It's either now, only without wires.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:43.200]   Interesting.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.200]   Interesting.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:47.440]   And I guess you could do is it on low power devices like cell phones and that's why they're
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:48.440]   interested.
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:51.600]   I've had people in the business tell me that it's really kind of...
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:52.600]   It has certain flaws.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:57.000]   In fact, even Intel's been playing with it and they've had to kind of redesign the theory
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.960]   and it seems to be...
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:02.960]   It's a little iffy and there's a lot of money that's gone down the drain in this particular
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:03.960]   technology.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.960]   They're actually getting very far.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.160]   Although I'll get a letter about that tomorrow.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.560]   Well, it's the wrong job.
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:19.640]   The IEEE spec is vaporized amidst the battling between the Intel crew and the Freescale crew.
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:29.240]   So there's a coffee shop in Vancouver, Washington called Brood Awakenings.
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:34.280]   And there's a guy in the coffee shop.
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.280]   He's not in the coffee shop.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.600]   He's using the coffee shop's Wi-Fi.
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.320]   He's actually sitting in his parking lot.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.080]   He's been there for three months.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.080]   Right.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.080]   Using the...
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.080]   Great story.
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.800]   Using their Wi-Fi.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:48.120]   So finally the manager of the store says, "This creep...
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.560]   He's stealing our Wi-Fi for three months."
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:51.560]   And he's about a coffee.
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:52.560]   He has about a coffee.
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.800]   So she calls 911.
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:54.960]   No, this story...
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.400]   Yes, more to it than that, Leo.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:02.880]   This story is interesting because the coffee shop apparently let the guy do this for a
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:03.880]   while.
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:07.640]   And they went out and asked him if he would just buy some coffee because they were getting
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:08.720]   sick of it.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.240]   And so the guy refused to.
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:13.240]   I mean, if the guy bought some coffee, I think this would have never happened.
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:15.600]   So now we have this precedent after this...
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:21.320]   They called the police, told the guy to buy some coffee, wouldn't do it.
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:25.880]   And so the police came up out and gave him that kind of citation for stealing, you know,
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:26.880]   whatever.
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:27.880]   Well, I know.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:28.880]   But it's not locked down and they don't...
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:32.680]   Do they have anything that when you log on to their Wi-Fi, it puts up a splash page?
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:33.680]   Oh, that's a good point.
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:34.680]   It's just conditional for using job abuses.
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:35.680]   You know, they do it all so...
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:36.680]   You know what, though?
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:43.000]   I mean, if you think about it, once you start abusing anything, you know, eventually even
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.960]   the most altruistic person is going to get kind of irritated.
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:48.400]   Well, it's the tragedy of the commons, Roger, right?
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:51.760]   But you know, the flip side is if you don't put a fence around it, what are you going to
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:52.760]   do to it?
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:53.760]   But how much do?
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.760]   What is he killing?
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:55.760]   I mean, he's not killing their band?
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:56.760]   He is killing their band with.
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:57.760]   Maybe he's selling low.
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:58.760]   I mean, good.
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:00.760]   I think they called the cops a deputy.
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:01.840]   I think they were just annoyed.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.360]   They said knock it off to the guy.
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:07.640]   He came back and so they arrested him and now they find out, by the way, he's a level
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:08.640]   one sex offender.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.360]   But that's another matter.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.360]   That's an unrelated matter.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:16.800]   You think, though, you think if you were a sex offender that you wouldn't kind of be
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.800]   so contentious in a situation like this...
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:19.800]   What do I do?
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:20.800]   It's wearing.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.720]   Well, what he was doing.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:29.400]   So anyway, this whole thing, the fact is, a lot of these coffee shops, they put the systems
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.080]   up and you're right, Patrick.
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.640]   I feel the same way.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:36.360]   If you let the signal go out into the street, it belongs to the public.
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:40.040]   What does it take to have some little nerd that probably comes in there and has coffee
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:46.480]   anyway to go into this router and just find the guy's MAC address and then block him?
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.960]   This is not rocket science.
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:53.560]   Oh, yeah, but this is a classic case of somebody not bothering to do their homework, getting
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:59.480]   exploited and then calling 911 and police have better things to do than browse the guy
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:01.400]   out of your parking lot.
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.520]   Call up the ISP for writing your information.
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.680]   Read the manual for the system.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:06.920]   Do some clever.
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:07.920]   Do some clever.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:08.920]   They'd have hacked him.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.920]   I mean, they'd just bring in a hacker.
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.480]   It's not even clever.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.480]   It's being responsible.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:17.920]   You wouldn't be like, "Is this the fire department?"
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.920]   I can't operate my coffee machine.
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:20.920]   I know.
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:21.920]   I agree with you.
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:22.920]   Come on.
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:23.920]   If you're going to sell a service, have a clue.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.920]   But let's say they didn't use the line.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.440]   Let's say they didn't use the line.
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:31.080]   Let's say they didn't use the non-emergency number.
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:34.320]   Do they have the right to call the police if this guy is using their Wi-Fi?
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:38.320]   Oh, that's apparently the police felt so they gave the guy a citation or they busted
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.080]   him so they must have been had to read the report.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:43.760]   Do they give him a citation for warning for the Wi-Fi or do they give him a citation
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:44.760]   for sitting in the parking lot?
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:45.760]   First thing they did is they gave him a warning.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.000]   They said, "Get out of here."
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.080]   He came back and then of course at that point now they're mad at him.
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.840]   So they arrested him.
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:57.000]   This is going to happen more and more until I don't know what's going to result.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   Well, it's interesting.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.440]   A lot of why I might get a favor shutting it off on the weekend.
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:01.440]   Well, that's what I'm afraid of.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.160]   I mean, I hope they don't start locking it down, shutting it off.
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:05.560]   Well, I'll be honest.
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.200]   I was in a beach house this week.
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.480]   There was no internet access.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:13.560]   But when I went upstairs, I was able to get on somebody's system and I used it.
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:14.560]   I know it's wrong.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.920]   It is wrong, because you're a bad person.
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:17.920]   It's not wrong.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.360]   What's wrong about it?
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:20.360]   Someone leaves their system.
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.360]   I agree.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:22.360]   It's not wrong.
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.360]   As far as I'm concerned, it's like it's, you know, once it gets into the stuff I believe.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.360]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:27.360]   Leave your front door unlocked again.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.840]   It was invading my house, my space.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:29.840]   No, no.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.400]   You know, the front door is much different than coming in the house or being outside.
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:36.640]   If I start throwing stuff out into the street and somebody picked it up, what am I saying?
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.640]   Well, hey, you're taking my stuff from the street.
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.280]   I mean, that doesn't make any sense.
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.880]   It's not the same as going in the house.
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.480]   I liken it to...
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.240]   I'm walking down the street and I have some...
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:50.880]   I've just finished my Fritos and I got a bag and there's a trash can on the street.
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.320]   I open it up and throw the Fritos in.
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:56.160]   Now I'm using their utility, but it's a de minimis usage.
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:59.200]   It's just not hurting them in any way.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:03.520]   And if it did, they have methods and steps you can go through that are pretty simple.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:05.120]   They'd lock either prevent it.
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.600]   Lock the trash can.
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:09.280]   Or if you're a business and you know you're going to have a lot of users and you don't
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:14.200]   want to deal with using a custom login for everyone, you could simply get a decent route
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:16.880]   or that provides throttling for all the users.
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:20.240]   And it's just like that way no one user can be like hogging all the bandwidth.
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:23.600]   What's missing from the story that I wish that we're in it is what was a guy doing?
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:26.120]   I mean, if he was just checking his email and some occasional surfing, in other words,
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:31.160]   not doing anything that a customer wasn't doing and not tying up the network, then so
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:32.160]   what?
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.480]   I think it was annoying.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.560]   I think it was just annoyed by the guy because you kept being put by the coffee.
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.480]   If you had just bought a cup of coffee.
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:40.480]   It's a cup of coffee.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.480]   J.
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:45.200]   I think they didn't like the guy in their parking lot too, obviously, right?
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.760]   Now you can arrest him for being in your parking lot.
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:50.200]   How many hours was this guy sitting in the park?
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:51.200]   Three months.
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.200]   Sure.
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.200]   What else is there Patrick?
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.200]   Because it's just Toad's car.
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.200]   He didn't live there.
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.440]   He should have just towed his car.
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:02.840]   They do have the 72 hour loss in most places.
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:09.520]   Australia is going to give every family in the country free internet filtering software.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:12.720]   It's the smart.
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:17.560]   It's the centerpiece of a $116 million crackdown on internet porn.
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:20.000]   But the centerpiece is here's some software.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.240]   They're not really cracking down on the porn.
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:24.400]   They're just saying here to use this software.
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.480]   Australia is like, Australia is great.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:31.080]   Because anybody who doesn't be as like raw in your face is like the entire country.
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.080]   I love it.
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:33.080]   I love it.
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:35.680]   Especially listen to the parliamentary debate and stuff.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:36.680]   This is.
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:37.680]   Any debate.
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:42.920]   The communications minister Helen Kuhnen said this is the single biggest commitment to protecting
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:46.320]   families online in the history of the internet in Australia.
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:48.240]   It's not bad.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.240]   I don't know.
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:54.120]   But to say this is also the woman didn't she refer to one of her fellow cabinet ministers.
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:57.280]   This is a grub and would ask to apologize.
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:00.000]   She said she apologized if she defended grubs in any way.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.280]   But I'm so seeing them with the minister and then was censured from the parliament for
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.280]   one day.
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.280]   We need more of that.
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.280]   Is she a senator?
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:10.040]   No, she's a minister.
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:11.040]   They're going to.
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:12.040]   She is.
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.040]   It says Senator Kuhnen.
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.040]   Yeah, they have a Senate.
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:17.240]   So she's both the communications minister and a senator.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:20.320]   And they expect 2.5 million families to take the software.
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.560]   They don't see what the software is though.
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:22.560]   I'm curious.
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:25.080]   I'll probably be all around in New South Wales.
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:31.080]   I'm just like the internet connection anywhere outside of actually now I take that back.
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:33.640]   I am sure Western Australia has pretty good.
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:35.560]   But I don't know.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:38.040]   I mean, this is a country with legal brothels.
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:39.040]   Really?
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.360]   We're a country with legal brothels roger.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.360]   It's called Nevada.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:43.360]   Certain areas.
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:45.360]   No, no, I mean all of us.
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.360]   It's, you know, the.
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:48.200]   It's a, it's an Australian football.
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:51.120]   They export bollsters because they refuse to drink it themselves.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:54.480]   I mean, bollsters is what tourists drink.
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:56.680]   I think they were really committed to this though.
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:00.560]   Wouldn't they work with ISPs to do the filtering at the ISP level than just giving, you know,
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:01.800]   handing out software.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:05.080]   But you see, if you do it at the ISP level then you're censoring what your citizens
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:06.080]   have available, right?
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:09.360]   In the United States that would be a First Amendment violation.
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:10.360]   Okay.
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:13.840]   You know, if you give people the ability to software, if you make the software free and
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:18.840]   available instead of telling people, you know, go to your ISP or go buy a make software.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:19.840]   That makes sense.
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.840]   And you're giving, you're putting hands in the tools of the people.
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:22.840]   I mean, think about it.
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:24.600]   I mean, what would make more sense?
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:28.680]   The Child Online Protection Act or giving everybody access to filtering software?
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:29.680]   No, you're right.
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:30.680]   You're absolutely right.
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.960]   They do, we do, don't we try to require libraries to run filtering software?
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:35.560]   That's the whole COPA thing.
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:36.560]   That's, that was COPA.
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:37.560]   Okay.
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:38.560]   Yeah.
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:41.400]   But at the same time, COPA had other issues.
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:44.040]   Well, there's all sorts of issues.
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.760]   There's issues with filtering software.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:49.480]   You know, if you run most of the filtering software, you can't search for, you know,
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.480]   you know, breast cancer.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:52.280]   You know what I mean?
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:53.280]   Right.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:56.200]   Although they, they, one of the things they are going to do is use these in libraries.
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.640]   So that's similar in that respect.
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:58.840]   Oh, excuse me.
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:03.440]   It was a house of representatives in Australia where the, where it was Julia Gillard who called
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:04.440]   the Minister of Health.
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:08.600]   I moved that the Sniveling Grub over there not be further heard.
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.400]   You sniveling grub.
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.400]   I love it.
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.440]   Has anybody tried Opera 9?
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:17.040]   They claim six million downloads in the first day of availability.
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:18.040]   It's really nice.
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.040]   I like it.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.800]   We're actually, we're actually showing it on, on Tuesday.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.800]   It's got BitTorrent support.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:26.760]   It really good search engine customization.
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:31.240]   And they've added now, I guess in response to Firefox, you've got skinning that's very
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:35.520]   similar to Firefox skinning and you've got widgets which are essentially extensions.
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:39.640]   Of course not the, they don't have the same number yet of extensions as Firefox has, but
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:41.200]   and it's free.
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:42.200]   Do you like it better than Firefox?
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:43.400]   Oh, they're not charging at all.
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:45.760]   No, it's, they've gone free.
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:47.720]   Do you like it Patrick?
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:49.280]   It's, it's pretty impressive.
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:52.200]   It's, are you still using Firefox or have you at the moment?
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:55.280]   But I, I may, I may be considering switching.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:57.520]   There's some other browser activity going on.
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:01.960]   So I'm kind of running a mini, mini browser environment on my notebook for the next few
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:02.960]   days.
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.680]   What does that mean?
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.280]   You'll figure it out eventually.
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.280]   Not necessarily.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:12.280]   Or I can have my dewar act moment or you can watch DLTV this week and find out the mystery
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:13.800]   of the next generation of browsers.
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:16.720]   I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm mixed feelings about their RSS handling.
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:20.240]   I mean, they basically have a RSS reader built in, which is probably got a BitTorrent
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.240]   tool built.
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:22.240]   Pretty cool.
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:23.240]   And it's got BitTorrent.
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:25.040]   Yeah, but is it the latest version of BitTorrent and how long would you have to wait for that
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.040]   to be in upgrade?
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.040]   And how do you tell?
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:30.160]   Because he just released that version 4.2 then has that.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.160]   Well, it's not open source.
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:32.680]   So, you know, that's exactly right.
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:34.520]   You just, you're, you're their mercy.
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:37.920]   So I mean, it's nice that it's there that way you have one less thing you have to worry
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:40.360]   about if you click on a torrent, like at least you know you have something on your computer
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:41.360]   that'll work with it.
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:42.360]   Right.
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:43.360]   Right.
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:46.000]   How about, you know, I'm still waiting for, I guess Kevin probably isn't going to join
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.760]   us, but he apparently is trying to log in, but I can't see his ID that he's calling.
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:52.760]   I don't see him.
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:53.760]   I see him online.
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:54.760]   Oh, you do you?
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:56.760]   He tried I aming you.
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.920]   Oh, I didn't see anything.
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:00.360]   It's our, I don't know what I said.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.360]   I know what it is.
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:02.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.360]   Okay.
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:05.360]   But it looks like he's that that handle is offline now.
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:08.000]   So he has to approve it.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.920]   Oh, he's invisible.
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:15.480]   Well, we have the other issue, which is we don't have enough room for him.
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:21.600]   So who, who, just quickly back to that Australian porn software thing, how much the government
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.360]   spending 116 million on this crackdown?
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:27.160]   I think they're spending on that particular piece of software.
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:29.960]   They said they expect to hand out 2.5 million copies.
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:33.840]   So is there any way they're going to turn into software or is it I?
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:34.840]   They don't say it.
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:35.840]   I wish they did.
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:36.840]   I don't know what software they plan to use.
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:41.360]   I mean, are they suddenly now going to support this for life and spend money on that as well?
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:45.820]   Well, that's really in my opinion, more up to the internet service providers to at least
[00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:50.240]   offer tools like that if users want them or for the users themselves just to take it
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:54.240]   upon themselves to either use an expensive or low cost tool.
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:55.240]   I don't know.
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:58.960]   It just seems like a waste of something the government shouldn't be doing.
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:03.600]   You're giving out software doesn't seem like the first thing they should be up to.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:04.960]   I don't even know how to do it.
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:05.960]   I'm creating desk jobs.
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:08.280]   I mean, look around you.
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:11.560]   I mean, you talk about subsidies and look at water subs.
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:12.560]   Oh, I'm seeing.
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:13.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:14.560]   I can't wait to finger.
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:18.840]   Is anybody by me think the energy is a little low this week on the show?
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:19.840]   Are you tired, John?
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:20.840]   You want to take a nap?
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:22.400]   You want to talk about something really controversial?
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:24.160]   I mean, there's a video camera.
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:25.160]   We can.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:27.160]   These are boring me stiff with this stuff.
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:30.920]   Well, when you run, hey, John, are you running Linux at all in any system?
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:31.920]   Well, I am.
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:32.920]   Is he really?
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:33.920]   Have you checked out?
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:37.320]   Have you checked out XGL running on Comp is the new Windows manager?
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:38.320]   I thought you were joking.
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:39.680]   What is XGL?
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:42.000]   It's really it's a.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.560]   It's an extent.
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:48.520]   It's basically an extension to the X window like the X server.
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:52.760]   So you can basically do what Quartz Extreme does for the Aqua interface.
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:57.160]   You can accelerate the agency and you've got through through a OpenGL accelerated.
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:59.240]   Oh, and have you installed that anywhere, Patrick?
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:01.800]   Yeah, we actually ran it on Thursday show.
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:02.800]   It's really pretty.
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:03.800]   We about killed Roger.
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:06.040]   Oh, you had to set it up, Roger?
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:07.880]   Yeah, but it was actually kind of cool.
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:12.960]   Once you once you kind of figured out the quirks and SUSE, it all the pieces fall into
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:13.960]   play.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:14.960]   It's from no vell.
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.800]   So you have to use SUSE for this or?
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:17.800]   No, it was.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:22.320]   They've actually got packages, XGL packages available at free desktop.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:23.320]   Cool.
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:24.320]   Cool.
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:25.320]   Well, I'll have to try it.
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:26.320]   It does look pretty cool.
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:27.720]   I'm looking at this resource intensive.
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:29.960]   Is this the future?
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:30.960]   Nah.
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:32.960]   It's just I can't be.
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:39.160]   What's the, you know, you know, I, it's I was I was already that it was it was a pretty,
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:43.720]   it was a nice toy, but Robert actually had a couple of good reasons to use it for gaming
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:44.720]   maybe.
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:46.800]   Oh, for hiding porn at work.
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:49.400]   Because you could rotate the desktop immediately.
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:52.800]   Maybe I should give this on one side of the cube and yeah.
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:56.720]   You know, we can also point out I can the on top of a solid platform is pretty much the
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:00.240]   entire, you know, OS 10 and or Windows Vista.
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:01.240]   Oh, I agree.
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:02.240]   I agree.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:06.000]   You know, there's Apple just do really good cooling on their systems because that's one
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:11.320]   thing I'll notice on on these new 3D desktops is that my 3D card is now in 3D mode all the
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:13.080]   time and it's hot.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:14.280]   The fan turns.
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:18.720]   The fan kicks up and that's now becoming the single loudest component in the system.
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:19.720]   Huh, interesting.
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:20.720]   Apple solves that by not putting.
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:21.720]   I'll take more of the stream.
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:22.720]   Is that intense?
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.200]   Yeah, I think that's you core image.
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:25.200]   Exactly right.
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.200]   Yeah.
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:29.360]   So still it looks gorgeous and I don't know.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:32.280]   It is a lot of eye candy, but there might be some useful on us there.
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:35.080]   Yeah, I actually blogged it when it first was first introduced.
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:38.080]   People can look it up on the devorek.org/blog.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:40.720]   So when undercut me, John, thanks for.
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:43.760]   Hey, but Patrick's got a video.
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:44.760]   Yes, video is.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:47.680]   We still got the working machine.
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:50.800]   Well, that's an advantage.
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:54.720]   I'd recommend people out there go to both sites.
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:58.000]   Hey, I like that even better.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.920]   While they're out of there, they can go to crankygeeks.org.
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:00.920]   Alright.
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:03.520]   Now let's go plug all the time.
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:04.520]   Plug fast.
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:05.520]   I got nothing.
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:06.520]   I got nothing.
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:07.520]   We were talking about.
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:08.520]   You got twins.
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:10.440]   We were going to launch the, yeah, you're listening to my show.
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:11.440]   So I can't plug anything.
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:13.160]   No, you got your other million shows.
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:17.400]   You got like nine shows on TV now.
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:18.400]   With a new website.
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:21.680]   Also, we can write a name out in a security not.
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:23.400]   Thanks, John.
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.400]   Mac break.
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.480]   Outside the net.
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.480]   Mac broken.
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:28.480]   Mac broken.
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:29.480]   Mac daddy.
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:36.560]   Well, don't do anything with the Daily Gizwiz because that's just too obvious.
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:39.560]   We do have a launch, a website launch coming up.
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:43.000]   I mean, it's not dig 3.0, but we do, the new website is ready to launch and we're going
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.400]   to tie it into the Dell campaign, which was supposed to launch today on this show.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:51.040]   And I got lazy and I just said, hey, guys, can you put it off?
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.720]   Because I want to take a vacation.
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:58.120]   So I think the Dell thing will launch in a couple of weeks and with it, the new site.
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:00.240]   What are you using for a content manager?
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:01.240]   Drupal.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:02.240]   Again?
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:03.240]   Yeah, I like Drupal.
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:05.760]   And well, what's different about what you, what are you going to do?
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:08.160]   It's a new design and it's got a lot more capability.
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:09.760]   Are you have outside people working on it?
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:10.760]   Or are you doing it?
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:11.760]   Oh, God.
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:12.760]   I couldn't do this.
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:13.760]   You can't do it on Drupal.
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:15.560]   Drupal is pretty brain dead.
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:21.000]   No, I can run our site, but the redesign came from Amber MacArthur's team at archetype.ca
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.640]   and the folks who are working on the Drupal engineering are really a great team called
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:26.080]   Lullabot.
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.080]   And they've done a great job.
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:28.080]   It's very nice.
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:29.080]   Lullabot?
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:30.080]   Lullabot.
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:31.080]   L-U-L-L-A-B-O-T.
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:32.080]   Look, it's not dig 3.
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:35.520]   Look, are you paying them or are they doing it for just a plug?
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.080]   Oh, I'm paying them.
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:38.080]   Okay.
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:39.080]   And it's not dig 3.0.
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:42.160]   I mean, that's a major, more than just a redesign.
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.160]   I mean, that's a major.
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:47.120]   This is just going to be a different looking site with some additional features, but not
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:48.120]   significant.
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:50.160]   What new features are we going to have here?
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.160]   Mostly for me.
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:53.300]   Oh, great.
[00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:55.340]   The workflow is built into the website.
[00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:57.200]   You'll see some differences.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:58.400]   Not much.
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.840]   You know, the comments are moved around in a different area.
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:02.340]   You'll be able to see all the episodes.
[00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:07.040]   There'll be a flash player on every episode, so you can listen from the website, things
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:08.040]   like that.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:10.080]   Who's paying for that bandwidth?
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:11.080]   Is that AOL?
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:13.080]   It all comes from AOL.
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:14.080]   It all comes from AOL.
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:15.080]   Okay.
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:16.080]   AOL depends.
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.080]   AOL is doing some of the shows.
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:18.080]   Are you getting caught?
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:21.080]   I mean, you're worried about your being diminished, John?
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.080]   No, no.
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:25.000]   I've been to be honest about the reason I'm asking is because I think a lot of people
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.080]   out there who listen to this show are in the content managers.
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:33.440]   They use one of the blogging software packages, WordPress or Drupal or Joomla or any of
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:34.520]   these other things.
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:37.960]   And I think we should probably discuss it a little more in any detail.
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.920]   So if people out there can say, "Oh, that's interesting.
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:42.400]   I can't do that at home."
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:46.880]   I've actually been woefully behind in writing up how we record the shows now because we've
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:50.280]   changed it since the last time I wrote it up and how it's produced and all that stuff.
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:51.280]   And I will do that.
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:53.080]   There's going to be a fairly long talk.
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:56.280]   Are you talking about the regular shows, the Skype shows, the local shows?
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:58.320]   It's all different everywhere.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:52:59.320]   It's a different group.
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:00.840]   Drupal has been great.
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:03.280]   One of the things Drupal will give us the capability.
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:06.640]   Right now it automatically handles the PayPal and stuff, the donations.
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:11.280]   One of the things that's going to allow us to do is a much more e-commerce and private,
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:13.240]   not private, but sites.
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:17.240]   Part of the site will be open to members only and Drupal handles that very well.
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:20.000]   And also it has, each of you have a blog on there if you want it.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   I mean it allows more blogs.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   Yeah, we never use it, do we?
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   No, you know.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   But that's all right.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   I said I need to replace the passwords, get replaced when you moved on to Drupal.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   I don't think so.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   No, we've always got to go.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   Yeah, you never told us anything.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   You're keeping us off the blog.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   It's giving us a secret.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.800]   Yeah, I still have your wacky icon.
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.680]   I mean, you know, and we went else.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:38.560]   We're going to have new album art.
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:40.120]   There's a lot going on behind the scenes.
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:44.200]   Laurie Lebow watches doing our album art from Illustrations, original illustrations
[00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:47.160]   by Nitro Sack and Snaggy of the Joy of Tech.
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:50.560]   I got to get a picture of you, Roger, actually.
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:54.240]   If somebody out there wants to see the most interesting Drupal implementation I've seen
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:58.000]   for a while, you should go to the last redesign of the onion.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   Are they Drupal?
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   Yeah, I know.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.360]   You look at it, you go, my God.
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:03.560]   It looks like the New York Times redesign.
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:05.440]   It's amazing what you could do with Drupal.
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:08.660]   Well, the new four seven, which just came out as incredibly powerful.
[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:09.660]   Which one?
[00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:12.720]   Drupal 4.7 is just very nice.
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:14.640]   I didn't realize they were using Drupal on the onion.
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:18.280]   Yeah, I found that out when I was doing some research on five column layouts.
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:21.480]   Yeah, well, one of the nice things, and I don't want to get too inside baseball here,
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:26.000]   one of the nice things about 4.7, the new version of Drupal is it's not columnar anymore.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.200]   You can have arbitrary regions anywhere of any kind.
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:30.200]   And that's going to help us.
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:31.200]   The engine's all over.
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:32.920]   Yeah, that's going to help us a lot.
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:34.000]   All right, let me see.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   I think if I dump you, Roger.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   Yep.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   Go ahead.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   Just dump me on.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   Or Roger.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   Or Roger.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.040]   I might be able to thank you, Roger.
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:44.040]   Sure.
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:45.040]   Always great to have you on.
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:46.040]   I'm really glad you could be here.
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:47.040]   But goodbye.
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:48.040]   Goodbye, Roger.
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:49.040]   Goodbye.
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:50.040]   He's glad to go.
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:51.040]   Are you kidding?
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:52.040]   He's glad to be off this bike.
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:53.040]   Back into the hot tub, man.
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:54.040]   Back to the hot tub.
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:55.920]   You know, he's got, he was picking up chicks.
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:57.840]   People could see this on the video at 57.
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:00.720]   They could see him going off and picking up women.
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:01.720]   Maybe I shouldn't say this.
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:03.960]   He's a smooth operator, baby.
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:05.280]   He's very, very smooth.
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:06.640]   Well, Kevin's not answering.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:10.400]   So I guess I punted Roger prematurely.
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:13.960]   You before we get Kevin, if we can get Kevin on, I'll continue to try.
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:18.200]   Any thoughts about dig three, you went to the party, didn't you?
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:19.200]   I was there.
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:20.200]   Were you there?
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:21.200]   Patrick and Roger and I both went.
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:22.200]   And Roger?
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:23.200]   To me, Robert and I.
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:24.200]   Robert and Roger and I all three went.
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:25.200]   What'd you think?
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:26.200]   It's pretty.
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:27.200]   It's smart.
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:34.000]   It's going to be interesting to see what Calcanis' response is.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.400]   Calcanis is not copying responses over it.
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:39.040]   I love Kevin's line.
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:45.720]   Jason should have waited to steal our code because we're going to make some big changes.
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:46.720]   I think it's clean.
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:49.040]   They've done a lot of stuff with actually allowing you to track what your friends are
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:53.040]   doing inside of Take 3.0 that I think is going to be pretty popular.
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:54.840]   Community-oriented stuff.
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:55.840]   Yeah.
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:58.760]   Visualization tools, I think, are going to highlight even though those won't be out for
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:55:59.760]   a couple of months.
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:01.760]   Can we talk about those or are they, uh, shush?
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:04.160]   No, they've already been blogged.
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:05.160]   publicly, yeah.
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:08.280]   I don't know if anybody has anybody put a video up back showing them in action.
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:09.280]   This is the flash.
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:13.040]   I've got a video, but we haven't run it yet because it was after the last show.
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:15.400]   This is the flash tool that you were talking about.
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:16.400]   Right.
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:17.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:18.400]   What does it do?
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:19.400]   Oh boy.
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:24.560]   It's kind of an inter-series of bubbles that each bubble represented stories that were
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:28.160]   currently being dug and they would also show you the people in real time who were digging
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:33.040]   them and the bubbles rise up as they're getting, uh, or it becomes kind of like that linked
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:36.720]   view where the bigger the bubble, the more activity currently surrounding it and then
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:40.720]   interconnected lines would tell you how people jump from one story to the next and by the
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:45.320]   thickness of those lines, you would see how how many people were reading that one story
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:46.760]   and then jump to the secondary story.
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:52.280]   It was just lots of cool visualizations like that in addition to like a variable top,
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:58.720]   say top 10 to top 100 view of the front page as people are digging on all the content that's
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:56:59.720]   currently available.
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:03.320]   Kevin, Kevin, can you tell what we're talking about?
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:04.320]   Yes.
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:07.720]   And we have Kevin Rose in a bucket.
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:08.720]   Hello.
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:09.720]   Yeah.
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:12.360]   Are you, you're on your laptop mic, I guess, huh?
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:13.360]   Yes.
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:14.360]   Sorry about that.
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:15.360]   I'm at the office.
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:16.360]   That's okay.
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:17.760]   Your new cavernous office is obviously.
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:20.760]   It's, um, it's crazy.
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:24.600]   It's kind of everyone's around here doing last minute preparations for a big push on Monday.
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:28.440]   So Monday, the new site three is coming out, but that, but not the features that we were
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:33.440]   just talking about, which are these kind of real time flash, uh, you know, dig, kind
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:35.680]   of super dig spy on steroid stuff.
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:36.680]   Right.
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:38.600]   So that stuff is coming out mid July.
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:41.800]   We have to ramp up and buy some more servers down.
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:42.800]   All that stuff.
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:44.440]   Yeah, I bet.
[00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:45.440]   That's cool.
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:46.440]   So tell us what's new in dig 3.0.
[00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:50.280]   Uh, well, it's, it's pretty much we're expanding into a bunch of different areas that
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:51.880]   we haven't been into in the past.
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:54.600]   It's expanding outside of just technology based news.
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:57.800]   Taking some heat from the, you know, the dig regulars over that.
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:01.920]   Well, you know, it's actually, we've gotten a lot of push from the users of dig right
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:02.920]   now.
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:07.120]   They've been submitting stories about, you know, world and business or world news and,
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:10.280]   and, uh, you know, movie related news and music.
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:14.280]   And it's one of those things that the, the community will moderate that stuff down on
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:18.920]   the existing site because they know it doesn't fit to any given topic on the site.
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:19.920]   Right.
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:21.960]   So we're expanding to a bunch of different other areas.
[00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:25.880]   But one of the things we really want to do is make sure that that, that core community
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:30.400]   of the people that use dig today, uh, still have the experience that they, they know and
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:31.400]   love.
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:34.880]   And so we've given every single user on the site the ability to remove any of the topics
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:35.880]   that they're not into.
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:39.200]   So if you could care less about any of the stuff that we add, all you have to do is uncheck
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:42.920]   a box, click on save, and then you'll have just that technology view that you did the
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:43.920]   day before.
[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:46.800]   So the people who are complaining, which obviously is just a loud minority, they don't
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:47.800]   have to worry.
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:48.800]   It's good.
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:49.800]   It could look exactly like the old big.
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:52.360]   Yeah, they don't have to see all the new stuff.
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:56.840]   Are you, I guess some of the concern is that you might dilute the audience because right
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:58.880]   up to now it's been a geeky audience.
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:04.400]   Yeah, you know, it's, it's, it's kind of strange because over the last year we've really seen
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:08.160]   that kind of change and shift with all these new users that we've been adding on a daily
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:09.160]   basis.
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:13.200]   So we get a lot of the, a lot more mainstream, stream stuff than we used to.
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:18.440]   It used to be hardcore, just, you know, Linux only kind of stuff going on the site and about,
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:22.000]   you know, creating summer clusters or whatever it may be.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:25.480]   But now, you know, we get a lot of videos, a lot of YouTube stuff and, you know, it's,
[00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:26.520]   it's been all over the place.
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:30.000]   So it's clear that we need to really expand and push out these other areas.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.440]   Alexa, according to Alexa, you're bigger than slash dot now.
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:35.000]   Is that, does that match your own system?
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.160]   Yeah, it's, it's been pretty crazy.
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:41.160]   I think that right now we see about a million unique visitors a day.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:42.160]   A day.
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:43.160]   A day.
[00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:44.160]   Jesus.
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:48.080]   And, and that, that results in about nine and a half million pages served a day.
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:51.000]   And how many uniques a month?
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   That's a good question.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   I'll have to find out exactly.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.080]   I think it's like nine and a half or something like that.
[00:59:56.080 --> 01:00:01.080]   Well, I imagine, I mean, I certainly visit every day, but I don't think everybody would
[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:02.080]   visit every day.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:04.440]   So if you're getting a million uniques a day, yeah, it's probably in something like
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.440]   that.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:06.440]   Yeah, I think it's spread around there.
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:07.440]   Wow.
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.440]   I mean, that's considered.
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:09.440]   Actually, sounds like it'd be more than that.
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:12.560]   The, you know, the problem that you have with Alexa, by the way, is that they don't, they
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:17.840]   don't take into account anybody who has a, uses Firefox, which unfortunately is where
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.640]   I'm sure Slash.
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:23.640]   For example, probably has the majority of its people using Firefox.
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:25.440]   Yeah, but I'm sure Dig does too.
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:26.440]   Well, maybe.
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:31.440]   I can tell you, actually, we're in Firefox for about 65% of users.
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:34.600]   Yeah, that's, yeah, that's pretty standard with, with the high tech.
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.240]   Yeah, that's what we're saying as well.
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:39.760]   But that's going to change if you start opening it up because you're going to, you know,
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:47.000]   these people that do all the kind of entertainment oriented that digs are going to be all windows
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   IE users.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.800]   Yeah, without a doubt, I'm sure they'll draw in a whole different crowd.
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:55.560]   Would you actually make your numbers look even bigger on Alexa if you're going to go
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:56.560]   by those only?
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:57.920]   Yeah, but we don't need to go by Alexa.
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:58.920]   We got the numbers.
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:03.600]   No, somebody should have the, does anybody subscribe to the Nielsen's?
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:04.600]   The net Neilson's.
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:05.600]   The net Neilson's.
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:06.600]   Oh, I don't.
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.560]   Do you, Patrick, you know those numbers?
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:13.400]   I tend to find Alexa to be a very curious choice.
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:17.400]   Well, it's just the only one that everybody can publicly see.
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.400]   It's free.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.400]   Right.
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:24.440]   And it's probably okay for, well, maybe not for, you know, kind of a sense of scale, if
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:25.440]   not actual numbers.
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:29.160]   It's, it's, it's interesting because, you know, internally when we look at our own numbers,
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:31.480]   obviously there's some differences there.
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:35.640]   But if you see, if we have a really, you know, a big story, it's the wire about diggers
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:39.600]   and what that we see as spike internally, it'll also be reflected on Alexa.
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:44.680]   So there, it's somewhat, you know, it's, it's nice to have a free tool that you can compare
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:46.880]   yourself to other science and other.
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:50.320]   So that's all we look at it as not real hard factual information.
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:55.200]   Well, I think also people agree that the dig effect now has, you know, completely outpaced
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.240]   the slash dot effect.
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:01.000]   I mean, for a while, you know, getting hit by, you know, getting linked by slash dot was
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   deadly to a site.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   And now it's pretty clear.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.480]   In fact, I was talking to Vincent Ferrari, who was the AOL cancel guy.
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:08.680]   You know, he's got that video.
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:09.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:15.600]   Or audio of him trying to cancel AOL and which is hysterical to listen to because he had the
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:21.680]   guy on the other end, John, the AOL call rep just does everything he can do to keep
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:26.120]   Vincent from canceling, including asking Vincent, who's 30, if his dad can come on the line.
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:28.280]   You know, I talk to your dad, please.
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:29.280]   Wow.
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:31.640]   I had a similar problem with Vona Vonage.
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:32.640]   Yeah.
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.920]   Well, these guys are impossible to get rid of.
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:38.520]   Yeah, I mean, that's every, every company tries to keep customers, but there are, there
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:43.040]   are ways and there are ways anyway, this Vincent told me that, you know, he'd put this up on
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:46.720]   the site and wasn't a big deal until it got dug and just took off.
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:49.800]   In fact, he was in that lower interview than my NBC and everything.
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:52.320]   So clearly dig has a lot of impact.
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.320]   That's cool.
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:54.320]   I saw him on CNN.
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:56.120]   Yeah, he was on CNN.
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:03:01.680]   We, you know, it's funny because somebody sent me the phone number of John, the call rep
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:04.000]   from Ogden, Utah.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   John lost his job.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.280]   You know, AOL fired him.
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:11.280]   And it's, it's, I feel better than John because John was just doing what AOL told him to do,
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.280]   I think.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:15.280]   Yeah, I was going to say, I think they're instructed to actually, you know, act like
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.280]   that.
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:21.960]   Yeah, you know, you know, I, I, I, I always take these firings with a grain of salt.
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:24.360]   I'm always reminded I was telling anecdote here.
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:29.120]   Pat McGovern used to, when he was running computer world and I think he's almost done
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:32.080]   this a little bit with the info world, but not to any extreme.
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:34.920]   He used to always have these columnists who were like these guys would dug up all this
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:35.920]   dirt.
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:39.240]   And then when it, you like offended an advertiser, something with government was okay.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:42.720]   The guy's fired at firing him, but the guy never existed.
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:46.600]   So they changed the pseudo name and the guy's working again the next day.
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:49.400]   I think this guy actually was fired because we called him.
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:53.120]   I tried to get him on the radio show and he said, well, I've hired an attorney and the
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:54.720]   attorney has told me not to talk to anybody.
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:57.840]   Of course, maybe that was maybe that's part of the AOL strategy.
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:58.840]   I don't know.
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:04.160]   Anyway, in any event, I did talk to Vincent and he, he's a big twit fan, by the way.
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:08.000]   In fact, I didn't, the truth is I just mentioned it on the radio show and he called in immediately
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   and we put him on.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.880]   So, yeah, it's kind of a fun story.
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:15.640]   And I imagine I would guess that because of all the attention AOL has received because
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:18.000]   of this, now would be a good time to cancel.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   Right?
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   I mean, it'd be pretty easy to get through.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000]   Right.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.240]   No, Leo, no, we're, we work with these people.
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:24.800]   No, I'm not canceling AOL.
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:25.800]   I love AOL.
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:27.800]   Can you, can you hold on for one?
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:28.800]   Sure.
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.800]   I'll be sure.
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:30.800]   Can you just one second?
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:31.800]   Sure.
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.800]   Somebody's smoking the pernicious weed outside my garage and I need to stop them real quick.
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:39.200]   That would explain the sluggishness that you were worried about John earlier.
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:40.200]   Maybe.
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.600]   So you had a party, Kevin.
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.120]   First of all, you had two parties.
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:44.960]   One at the beach house to celebrate the anniversary.
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:45.960]   What is it?
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.520]   The second or third anniversary of Google?
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:49.360]   Of the, you mean the dignity?
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:50.360]   Ignition?
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:51.600]   Oh, it was, it was digs and Google.
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:54.520]   And just promoted you to the owner of Google.
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:55.520]   Yeah.
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:56.520]   Of dig, yeah.
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:00.000]   So it was the, the, the one at the beach LA was just our one year.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   One year?
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   Yeah, one year.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   A dig nation.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   No.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   Oh, dig nation got it.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.360]   And then, and then you had a party on Thursday for the press to show a three point out, which
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.320]   I'm sorry I couldn't make, but I, we've been.
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:11.800]   I never even got invited.
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:13.920]   Oh, that's not true.
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:15.360]   We sent you an invite.
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:16.360]   You must have gotten invited.
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:19.560]   John gets no spam and he gets no invites.
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:22.280]   Well, I'll spam filter.
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:25.080]   I would have made it if I had it on the calendar.
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:28.080]   I'll call you next time, John, and tell you I couldn't, I was out of town.
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:29.840]   I couldn't make it, but it sounds like it was a great party.
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:31.680]   Did you get big, big turnout Kevin?
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:36.600]   Yeah, there's about a hundred and 40 hundred and fifty people in the press and just, you
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:37.600]   know, friends and they.
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:38.600]   That hundred and five degrees.
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:39.600]   Yeah, it was hot.
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:40.600]   It was hot.
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:41.600]   It was so hot.
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:42.600]   Where was this?
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:43.600]   Oh, is it San Francisco?
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.640]   Yeah, it was in San Francisco downtown.
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:46.640]   This far called the North.
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:47.640]   And that hot day.
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.200]   Yes, that hot day.
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.200]   Exactly.
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.200]   It was hot.
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:52.200]   Really hot day.
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:53.200]   The last week.
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.200]   The one hot day.
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.200]   I was at Stinson Beach.
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:56.320]   It was hot at the beach.
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:57.520]   So that's how hot it was.
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.520]   It was really hot.
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:00.520]   Well, congratulations.
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:01.520]   It's really exciting.
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:03.960]   What is it going to take to get 3.0 up?
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:07.120]   I mean, it's all done and it's ready and you're just going to flip a switch tomorrow
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:08.120]   morning or?
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:09.120]   I wish it was that easy.
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:11.320]   It's actually very, very complex process.
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:13.960]   It takes about 45 minutes.
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:16.560]   It's going to start at about 5 a.m. tomorrow morning.
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:21.200]   And it's one of those things where there's a bunch of DB changes that have to be made
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:25.920]   and a bunch of code has to be pushed into like subversion and the issue.
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:26.920]   It is insane.
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:27.920]   Good luck.
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:32.640]   Because we're moving to a different type of like we're moving off a standard kind of
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:35.960]   Maya scale structure to kind of a sharding based structure.
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:37.880]   And so it's a different type of file system that is.
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:38.880]   Why are you doing that?
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:39.880]   Is it more robust or?
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:41.360]   It just helps you scale long term.
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.360]   Scale, yeah.
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:46.080]   So it's one of those things where this is a big, big deal for us.
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:47.080]   Oh man.
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:48.080]   Are you worried about?
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.080]   Yeah, it's good to be very tricky.
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:50.080]   You can be down.
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:55.640]   Those things where you internally, we basically for like the last week have been doing trial
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:56.640]   runs.
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:57.640]   Fire drill.
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:03.360]   And today was our first really successful day of doing the push without any problems.
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:04.360]   So that's great.
[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:07.800]   Well, I logged on a couple of days ago and you were down for briefly.
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:12.880]   Yeah, we had to, we did a small little update to kind of accommodate for some 3.0 pushes.
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:14.600]   So it's really tricky now.
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:18.680]   It's at the point to where when you're on, I don't know what we're on now, but 75 or
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:19.680]   80 servers.
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:24.160]   And then you can just move and migrate that to a new version and then make sure it all
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:28.960]   syncs up and add an additional 20 or so servers.
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:31.160]   It's a challenge.
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:35.720]   Is this all new code or are you getting rid of all the old big coders?
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:39.200]   Yeah, it's actually, it's all rewritten from scratch because it's taking advantage of
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:40.200]   the new file system.
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:45.160]   So, but luckily we had a really good guy here a few months ago.
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:49.000]   Scott Baker, who is one of the Apple guys that helped him scale iTunes and whatnot.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   Wow, great.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.680]   He came to us from Apple and then the guy that does our VBA stuff came to us from Friendster
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:57.520]   and you know, the kind of problems that they ran into.
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:59.320]   So he's helped solve a lot of their challenges.
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.880]   Scaling, because they grew very, very fast almost overnight.
[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:04.160]   Yeah, they had some major issues back in the day.
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:05.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:06.160]   Well, that's exciting.
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:08.160]   I'm, congratulations on your success.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.160]   Oh, thanks.
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:10.160]   You're good.
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:11.600]   And we're glad you could come on.
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:13.840]   I don't, I won't keep you because I'm sure you have other things.
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:16.840]   We have, at least we have one guy on the twit thing that is successful.
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:17.840]   It's making some money.
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:19.440]   I'm trying to get some money.
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:22.240]   So what do you think of the Netscape?
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:23.240]   It really is a clone.
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:25.840]   I mean, they really copied you as closely as they could, I think.
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.080]   Yeah, they just did a little too early.
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:30.760]   They should have waited till after we had to do the outdoor.
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:31.800]   Tell me about this.
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:33.200]   I don't know anything about it.
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:34.200]   You didn't see it?
[01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:37.360]   No, it's a, uh, Nets, uh, www.netscape.com.
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:40.000]   What is it?
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000]   beta.netscape.com.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.440]   It's a new portal page and basically they're doing dig.
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:45.440]   Really?
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:52.440]   They're, they've got, well, it's a little different because they do have editorial, uh,
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:53.880]   control of the top part.
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:54.880]   So they have editors.
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:09:01.880]   If you go to www.beta.netscape.com, they have editors, but what do they call the digs?
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:02.880]   Uh, votes.
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:03.880]   Yeah.
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:04.880]   And then it's votes.
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:08.080]   It's just, it looks, I mean, it's right on the same spot.
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:09.080]   They've got a button.
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:10.080]   Is it a box?
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:11.080]   Is it a square?
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:12.080]   Yeah.
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.080]   Oh, please.
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:14.080]   Could they make a round?
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.080]   Oh, God.
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:18.360]   It's a little different because to vote for it, you just check the checkbox.
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:21.520]   Let me ask you this, Kevin, did you look at it and say, oh, I could steal that?
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:22.520]   No, no.
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:24.960]   There's nothing I want from Netscape.
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:29.080]   Is there any look and feel thing you can do here to maybe like, you know, get a little
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:30.080]   law firm involved?
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:35.000]   Well, you know, we have stuff that we've filed as far as, not that have to do with
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.360]   the look and feel, but as far as our promotion algorithms that we've filed.
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:39.360]   Oh, good.
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:40.360]   Patents.
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:41.360]   Great.
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:43.600]   That's something that we'll be looking to in the future.
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:48.440]   But right now it's just like, I mean, Netscape has been going downhill for the longest time
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:50.200]   and they're just trying to find a way to revive it.
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.200]   Right.
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.680]   It's one of those things where it's majority of traffic are people that don't know how
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:56.080]   to change their homepage and have Netscape 4.0.
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:57.440]   Well, that's what they talk about.
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:02.080]   We've got whatever it was, 8 million registered, whatever the huge number was of registered
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:03.080]   users.
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:04.080]   Right.
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:05.080]   But you're right.
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:07.440]   I mean, they're not people who haven't figured out how to change their home.
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.440]   Yes.
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:09.440]   That's who they are.
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:10.440]   Right.
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:14.080]   I thought that was the internet.
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:17.600]   I think it was, I thought it was great that for at least the first week, Kevin Rose was
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:18.600]   the number one story.
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:22.600]   That picture of Kevin and I thought that was really great.
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:26.880]   It is cool though, the fact that AOL is kind of not dating the space.
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:27.880]   It validates.
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:28.880]   It's a leave in the social news.
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:29.880]   Yeah.
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:31.960]   If you're good enough to steal from, that means you're pretty, you're doing pretty darn
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:32.960]   well.
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:33.960]   Yeah.
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:34.960]   Yeah.
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:35.960]   Well, congratulations, Kevin.
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:39.080]   I can't wait till Monday, tomorrow morning and I'll be live.
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:41.400]   Hopefully you did cross your fingers.
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:43.720]   So when it's done, what time do you think it'll be done?
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:47.720]   It should be done by around 6 a.m. Pacific.
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:48.720]   Pacific.
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:53.240]   So by 9 o'clock, by the time people start showing up for work on Monday in New York City, dig
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:55.440]   into the Keg will be cracked in the dig offices.
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:56.440]   Yeah.
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:57.440]   Are you going to be up all night tonight?
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:00.200]   No, I got to get to bed early so I can get up early.
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:04.440]   But if it's not up by 7 or 8, you know that we're having some issues.
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:06.440]   But we'll get, we'll work through them no matter what they are.
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:08.440]   Well, we'll be crossing our fingers and thinking about you.
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:12.320]   And yeah, it is, as John said, it's nice to know at least one of us is doing okay.
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:13.320]   Congratulations.
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:20.160]   I can see like Robert and I look at each other across the bay going, huh, how come like,
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.320]   you know, where's our two points?
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:25.880]   You guys, oh no, no, no, fucking Kevin Smart.
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:27.120]   You went after you deserve it.
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.120]   He's got vision.
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:29.120]   I'm not explaining.
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:31.720]   No, I'm just laughing because like you guys don't consider yourself successes and you guys
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.960]   own homes in the Bay Area for years.
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:38.920]   I live with three other roommates and like the nasty apartment.
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:39.920]   Oh, okay.
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.920]   Well, your time to come.
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:45.760]   Kevin, if you know, if you hired a maid, the apartment would be a lot.
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:46.760]   That's true.
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:47.760]   That's true.
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:48.760]   Especially the bathroom.
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:50.760]   I'm going to buy out more.
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:52.760]   You know how bad it is.
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:53.760]   All right, Kevin.
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:54.760]   Hey, good luck.
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:55.760]   Congratulations.
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:58.040]   And we look forward to seeing it tomorrow morning.
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:11:59.040]   And I'll see you guys.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.040]   I appreciate it.
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.040]   Right.
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:02.040]   Nearly 6 a.m.
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:03.040]   You'll be done.
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:04.040]   Everything to do though.
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:05.560]   Those things never work out.
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:06.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:10.800]   Now that Kevin's gone, we can say that'll never be 10.
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:14.000]   If they get it done in an hour, it'd be a miracle.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.200]   I'm encouraged that they've been rehearsing all week.
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:17.880]   I mean, but it is.
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:20.440]   He's got some really together guys.
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:21.600]   He sounds like he does.
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:23.400]   He's got really good people.
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:25.200]   That's exciting.
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:26.200]   That's neat.
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:28.800]   Actually, the truth is we're all doing pretty well.
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:32.800]   I mean, Patrick, it's obvious we just had, you know, I mean, we've talked about the
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:35.480]   all-male by comparison to Kevin Rose.
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:39.760]   Well, he's the, you know, did you see that he, I forgot to ask him about this, that
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:40.760]   who was it?
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:41.760]   Was it business 2.0?
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:46.080]   Somebody picked him as the one of the top 50 movers and shakers of 2006.
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.080]   Who was that that picked him?
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:49.320]   Well, they were hoping to improve through dig rankings.
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:51.320]   Yeah, that's the old.
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:54.240]   That was actually a really nice interview with Kevin.
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:55.240]   That was great.
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:56.240]   What was it?
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:57.240]   Was it business 2.0?
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:58.240]   Business 2.0.
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.240]   Yeah.
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:00.240]   And he was up there.
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:03.840]   He paired him with who?
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:07.920]   It was another 50 people who matter, business 2.0, the new new media.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:08.920]   The new new media.
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:09.920]   I mean, he was up there with--
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:12.920]   It's when he gets his picture on the cover of Time Magazine.
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:17.360]   I mean, that's what made it business 2.0 is a joke.
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:21.240]   We should also point out that the number one in the 50 who matter now, business 2.0
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:24.440]   list was you, followed by Sergio Brandon-Larry Page.
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:25.440]   Not me, you.
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.440]   You, all of you.
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:27.440]   You, everybody.
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:28.640]   The consumer is creator.
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:29.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:30.640]   Edward Muddock, Steve Jobs.
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:31.640]   You know what's more interesting?
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:32.640]   Same old, same old.
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:38.120]   The 10 people who didn't make the list like Linus Torvalds and people like that, I thought
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:39.280]   that was very interesting.
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:40.620]   That was to me more interesting.
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:41.620]   But these lists are bogus.
[01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:44.480]   Hey, you know, we used to do these lists and all these magazines that I've worked for.
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:48.480]   And I know how they work and Patrick knows and anyone who's worked in a publication knows
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:49.480]   it.
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:52.240]   You get about six guys sitting around usually during lunch.
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:54.480]   You got the old list from last year.
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:55.480]   You sit around.
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:56.480]   What do you think we should do?
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.080]   Ah, we should move this guy up to number three.
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:00.280]   Yeah, that'll make number six really mad.
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:01.920]   That'll be really funny.
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:05.680]   And then you just do that until you get the list together, pass it around a little bit
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:06.680]   and he says, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:08.120]   And then they print it.
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:09.120]   Come on.
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:10.120]   It's a bunch of BS.
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:11.120]   I like it.
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:13.520]   A couple of, a couple more stories we should get to before we wrap these things up.
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:16.760]   Apple, did you see the price of shake?
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:21.720]   Apple drops it from $2,500 to $500.
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:22.720]   That's pretty remarkable.
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:24.600]   In fact, good news for anybody does compositing.
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:27.840]   I mean, that's a, that's a very expensive program, a very good program.
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:30.240]   I can see that none of you care in the least.
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:33.960]   Oh, the problem is we're all looking around thinking what we need is Alex to tell us
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:34.960]   is why this is going to shake.
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:35.960]   Yeah.
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:36.960]   We'll listen to this in the video.
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:37.960]   Where's Alex?
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:40.960]   No, he's, he's shown it, shown us shake many times a call for help and it's in a really
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:41.960]   cool program.
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:44.080]   I mean, I, I can start it.
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:47.160]   You're going to see kids doing some amazing stuff.
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:48.160]   All right.
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:52.560]   Another story, Netflix thinking about moving into the download business.
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:56.360]   They want to introduce a proprietary set top box with an internet connection.
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:58.720]   It's the same thing Disney was doing, isn't it?
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:00.280]   Sounds like a Kimbo to me.
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.680]   It sounds like a Kimbo.
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:03.680]   Same idea.
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:06.560]   That's Will Hurst's company where they, you put a box on the TV set and it, I don't know,
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.040]   uses the free band.
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.240]   They're actually moving away.
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:14.200]   They've, they've given away the Kimbo boxes to RCA and they're pushing, they're pushing
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:17.000]   an add on for the Windows media.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000]   Ah, interesting.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.560]   I think that's the way to go.
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:23.320]   I don't think these, these, these standalone boxes for just downloading stuff.
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:24.880]   Who's going to want to buy another set of boxes?
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:26.480]   Yeah, I think everyone has a computer.
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:27.480]   Yeah.
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:29.480]   Disney's been doing it for a while.
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:33.960]   They say that, I don't, I, I, they're slowly going to get out of trials with they did.
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:37.800]   I mean, understand they've introduced it in some other markets in LA now.
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:39.320]   So it must be doing okay.
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:41.160]   The movie beam stuff.
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:42.160]   Yeah.
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:43.160]   Yeah.
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:45.160]   And it sounds like it's actually the same.
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:51.160]   Well, I mean, the, the, uh, is movie beam, Disney, Disney, movie beam is like the cousin
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:52.160]   to the blanking interval.
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:53.160]   Right.
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:54.160]   It's just VBI.
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:56.360]   I don't think they actually use VBI do they?
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:58.800]   Well, something, something, something like that.
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:02.480]   Oh, they, you know, they used to use the, uh, the PBS stations.
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:07.520]   They use their extra bandwidth on their side bands or something to do this stuff.
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:12.160]   See, that's like close to 20 megabit or over 20 megabit.
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:13.160]   They're able to live better than it.
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:14.560]   Better than it will broadcast hours.
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:15.560]   Wow.
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:16.560]   Ha ha.
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:20.960]   Movie beam does not use VBI uses a proprietary RF technology from dot cast dot car.
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:21.960]   RF.
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:23.120]   Oh, then they are there.
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:25.360]   And you probably using the PBS stuff.
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:26.360]   Brother.
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:28.800]   Hey, it's straight from hdb.com.
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:31.440]   Those guys got to be true.
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:34.880]   Except when they talk trash about Robert.
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:39.040]   Any other, uh, interesting stories, are we just going to go back to windows live and
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:44.240]   watch the traffic with comfortable traffic?
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:45.680]   Thanks guys for being here.
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:51.400]   Devorak.org/blog where John is going to rush off and do his story on, uh, what is
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:52.400]   XGL?
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.200]   Well, I know it's already been on.
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:55.440]   I know I did that like months ago.
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:57.200]   I had one of the first months ago.
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:58.680]   It was like a middle lady.
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:02.760]   I had one of the early demos of it and I blogged it with the movie that they are linked to
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:03.760]   their movie.
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:05.320]   Yeah, they have that cube movie and stuff like that.
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:11.000]   But you could also see it with Robert and Roger and, uh, and, uh, Patrick on, uh, DL
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000]   dot TV.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.760]   That's where they live these days.
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:17.400]   I didn't realize, you know, I just realized now the three of you are working together.
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:18.400]   Yeah.
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.400]   Because you hired Roger.
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:20.400]   Yeah.
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:22.400]   And this has become the DL TV podcast.
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:23.400]   And not quite.
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:24.400]   I didn't realize that.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:26.720]   Yeah, you guys still got a cranky geek here.
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.520]   So there's one cranky deep.
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:32.200]   It's all the ZD TV guys and Lisa's in there somewhere.
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:33.200]   Yeah.
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:34.200]   And Lisa's.
[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:35.200]   Yeah.
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:36.200]   I love that that you hired Analisa.
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:37.200]   That's great.
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:39.200]   She's the old producer for a game spot.
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:41.200]   The devil you know is better than the devil you tell.
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:43.000]   That's why we hired Roger.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.120]   He has a devil, isn't he?
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:46.880]   Thank you guys and we'll see you next time.
