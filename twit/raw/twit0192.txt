[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   So I figure, you know, I get a gaming laptop, get my game on on the road.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   >> That's one of those Dell FX gaming.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   >> Yeah, the gateway.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   >> The gateway.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   >> I actually was embarrassed that it was a gateway.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I covered up the gateway.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   >> I noticed that you put the Twit logo where the gateway logo belongs.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   And there's a sideways apple.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I don't even know what that's all about.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   >> That was somebody just snuck.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   That was a sneak attack.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   >> Slaps it on.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   >> It's on there.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   >> Scam School, great show, great way to learn how to win bar bets, essentially.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   >> Yeah, manipulate people.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Get what you want.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Also here, I'm very pleased to say Catherine Hall, my good friend and photographer.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Catherine is a specialist in taking pictures of people, but she's also a geek as any digital
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   photographer must be these days at Catherine Hall.net.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Great to see you.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   >> Thank you.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   >> And finally, last but not least, the bird brain herself.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   >> Ladies and gentlemen, Ms. Kirsten Sanford.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   >> Howdy.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   >> I said it right.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   >> You did.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   >> I paused.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   I thought no consonants, and I got it right.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   >> Kiki, you're actually a good person to have on this day because the big story as we record,
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   and as a developing story, is the story of this swine flu.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   >> Yeah, it's huge right now.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   >> And it's really interesting to watch people's reaction to this.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Some people like Colleen go, "Oh, yeah, you know, just another one of those stories."
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   She said, "I'm worried about the killer bees, but I guess now I can worry about the swine
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   flu."
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   You know, she mocks it.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   But then there are those of us, like me, who read all the books about the 1918 pandemic,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   that killed 10 million people, and I'm thinking, "Could this be the one?"
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   >> Well, there could be a pandemic, and the CDC and the World Health Organization have been
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   looking out for the next big pandemic, and the way that we have international travel and just the way
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   that our world works, we're so much more connected, and people come across into contact with so
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   many more people on a daily basis now.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Our schools are crowded, you know, and that's another thing they shut down.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   They've shut down schools in Mexico as a result of this outbreak.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   >> They're shutting down schools in Texas now.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   >> In New York City, they shut down.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   I think they're shutting down a school there, and, you know, so it's scary, and there is
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   a reason to mock the story, and there is a reason to take it very seriously.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   >> Well, we just don't know yet.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   >> And that's right.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   We just don't know.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   >> The thing about the swine flu that is scarier than the avian flu is the fact that it comes
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   from a mammal.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   So the jump in the avian flu, in order for the flu to become a pandemic coming from birds
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   to people is that it would have to switch to become contagious among people, and so that's
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   a major mutation, and that's not necessarily something that, you know, it might take place
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   in a bird, but then that bird doesn't come in contact with a person, and so it could never
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.360]   make it to people or swine or whatever, but the fact that this is a flu coming from a
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:48.360]   very close relative of the human species makes it a lot more dangerous, and the subtypes
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.120]   that it's made up of, this H1N1 subtype, it's very contagious.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.120]   It's contagious.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:03.000]   It's a mammalian flu, and that's two out of three of the major factors when organization
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.880]   like the CDC is looking at it to determine whether or not it might become a pandemic,
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.040]   and so this is something that the CDC is taking very seriously, and the CDC, and I will be
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:17.040]   honest here, our government is not ready, our health system is not ready to do anything.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.040]   >> There are no vaccines.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.200]   I heard a report that there is one company that can make them, they say, in half the
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.000]   time, that takes them half the time, that's still 13 weeks.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.120]   >> Right, and so by that time, you know, the pandemic can already have taken its course.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:36.360]   They're saying that this flu is showing up in, you know, two days, maybe as long as five
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.320]   days to show up in person to- >> Well, I'm watching-
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.360]   >> There's Google Maps, which is great.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.920]   There are a number, I put a link in the show notes to a Mashable article that says how
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.160]   to follow this, and you can use the World Health Organization or the Centers for Disease
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.400]   Control, but there's also a great Google map, and I've been looking at this Google map,
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.440]   and you know, every time I look, there are more dots on the map.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.720]   Originally, it was Mexico, then North America, then Europe, and now I'm seeing in Colombia,
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.200]   I'm seeing in New Zealand, some outbreaks in Europe, and even in the Middle East, and
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.480]   in this day and age with of air travel.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.520]   >> Yeah, and that's- >> This stuff could spread very quickly.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.160]   >> Yeah, and that's something they've known for several years, is that because of air travel
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.920]   and our ability to be international within a few hours, these things can spread so easily.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.760]   I mean, the biggest protection that you can have for yourself is to wash your hands.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.520]   You know, that's- >> What about those masks?
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.520]   >> The best thing you can do.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.040]   Yeah, the masks- >> Do they help?
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.040]   >> Mm-hmm, absolutely.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.000]   >> Do you like the surgical masks, the cheap ones you get at long?
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Those are okay?
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.760]   >> Yeah, because the airborne particles, when people sneeze or cough, those particles go
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.760]   end up in the air.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:42.080]   And so if you know you're going to be out around people, you're going to maybe a school, or
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.440]   you're going to a hospital where sick people go, you know, maybe you want to put on a mask.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.160]   >> I'm going to start wearing one, right now, Fek, what are you doing in my room?
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.160]   Get out of here, all of you.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.320]   >> I watched my hands really.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.200]   >> I had heard the opposite, so this is news to me.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:00.960]   What I heard was that wearing a mask was not a good idea, gave you a false sense of security,
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.880]   and that the reason that you see them wearing them in surgery is not to keep something from
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:05.880]   getting into their mouth.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.880]   >> It's to get out.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.720]   >> But to get out from coughing and- >> So mask is even more useful if you're sick.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.720]   >> That's what I imagine.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.720]   >> If you're sick, it's much more helpful.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.880]   I mean, the thing is like, if you're going to wipe your nose with your hand, or that puts
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.040]   back to the viral, not bacterial, but the viral particles-
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.040]   >> This one is more air-borne than normal.
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.760]   Is that what I'm reading?
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.400]   I can't really quite follow all this stuff.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.760]   >> I don't know, necessarily, that it's more air-bound than normal.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:38.160]   If it is a flu that gets into the lungs and the mucous membranes, I mean, that's where-
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.720]   I mean, different viruses will get into different tissues in different ways.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:48.200]   And so this flu might be specifically multiplying within the mucous membranes.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.840]   And so if that's where it is, then you're going to be sneezing, and air particles are
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.400]   going to come out, those are going to contain viral particles, and then it's airborne.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.440]   You have these aerosolized little bits of things flying around everywhere.
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:04.280]   >> And the reason we're taking this seriously is because 20 people have died in Mexico.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.280]   >> It is fatal for some.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.680]   Nobody's died yet outside of Mexico.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.680]   I'm not sure why that is.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.880]   >> And I don't know.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:17.800]   Something that I haven't seen is that the people who are dying are probably immune system
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.200]   compromised to begin with.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.600]   >> And what's interesting, they're tend to be younger people.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.600]   >> Yeah, Patrick Norton.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.880]   >> I mean, my wife's been very concerned about this because we have a toddler.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.080]   It started to show up at the minor panic in some of my relatives.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.880]   >> I mean, can we put this in the perspective compared to the 1918 pandemic?
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:40.400]   I mean, because the numbers on the pandemic vary between 50 and 100 million were killed.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.520]   The numbers sort of as the people doing, the epidemiologists doing the study, as they
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.440]   get more contemporary, they scale the numbers up.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:52.640]   They don't know if it started in Fort Rides, like somewhere in Kansas or somewhere in Asia.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.560]   The records aren't tight enough to know what it is.
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:59.040]   They did say that it was a cytokine storm and overreaction of the body's immune system
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.880]   that caused the deaths more so than the actual flu itself.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.720]   But we're talking about like 5 to 20% of the people.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.560]   I think probably closer to 5% of the people who contracted the disease and something like
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:14.520]   a quarter of the United States at one point, or not disease, the influenza, like 25,
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:19.680]   20% of the US population had it, like 2 to 5% of the population died from it.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.400]   I mean, what are we talking about?
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:25.120]   Because there were like 20 people who died in Mexico and it's like, dude, like 800 people.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.120]   >> 86, actually, according to the UK.
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.120]   >> 86 is it now?
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.120]   >> 86.
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.120]   >> 86.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.920]   >> But I mean, there haven't been that many, I mean, if you look at the map, there're not
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.520]   that many points on the map yet.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.400]   So, yeah, but I mean, we're talking about in the United States, like a typical year is
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.040]   44,000 traffic fatalities divided by 365.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.920]   So let's call that 120 people are going to die today in car accidents in the United
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:44.920]   States.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.920]   20, 86 of people have died in Mexico.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.920]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.600]   I'm like, I'm trying to understand what percentage of the people are dying of this.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.120]   Is it spreading to the, you know, have the epidemiologists that are working on it?
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:00.160]   Because they're like, the Center for Disease Control is like, woo, proof that we need to
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.160]   be funded.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.160]   Yes!
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.160]   >> The borders.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:07.640]   I mean, I tease, like, I happen to love the idea that they're there.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.960]   I wish they were as well funded as other branches of government that have failed us incredibly
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.960]   in the last couple of years.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.000]   So they're flying in experts to try to start tracking this.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.760]   Do we even know in Mexico how many people, what percentage of people have actually died
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.760]   and what percentage of the population has it?
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:30.280]   Because it just seems like it's a 24-hour news cycle, you know, to and into the tail end.
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.800]   >> Some of it could be that, Patrick, but there is, because of the pandemic of 1918,
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.760]   there is a legitimate concern.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.640]   And people, health officials are very concerned that this could be the one.
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.560]   In fact, I've read an article that said, it's not a question of when.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.560]   It's going to happen.
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.960]   We just don't know if it's this one.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.760]   >> We don't know if it's this one.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.160]   I mean, you are right.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:53.960]   Like we said before, I mean, there is a certain aspect of it that is a 24-hour news cycle.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:59.720]   And these news agencies are grabbing on something that's not war related to be able to talk
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.720]   about.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.720]   And so they're like, yes.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.720]   >> Or finance related.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.800]   >> It's bad news that doesn't have anything to do with the other bad news.
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:07.800]   >> Right.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:08.800]   But at this stage--
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.800]   >> It's quick.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:10.800]   Get the graphics department going.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.320]   >> But at the same time, this is something that we do need to be concerned about.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.920]   I don't think it's been going long enough for them to really-- I mean, maybe the CDC
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.720]   does have numbers that they haven't completely reported yet.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.280]   Maybe they do know more about it than they're letting out.
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:31.680]   >> Is there any numbers or statistics on the fatality rate of those who catch the disease?
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.320]   I mean, are we looking at the diseases of death sentence?
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.360]   >> A lot of people survive it in the US.
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.800]   In fact, most people have survived in the US.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.240]   All the fatality is in Mexico, right?
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.240]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:49.680]   And the thing that you hope for is that you don't get a flu that will be dangerous for
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.680]   the average person.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:56.240]   So we know that the flu is dangerous for babies and for the elderly.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:01.880]   People who have weakened immune systems, people who are immune compromised.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.400]   That's who most flu is, the yearly flu is dangerous for.
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.040]   And that's just kind of like, OK, that's just we know that.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:14.320]   But what we don't want is for all of us in this room who assume we're fine.
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.320]   >> More people.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.320]   >> The important people.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.320]   You know all the other people.
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.320]   >> Me, yeah.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.320]   >> Well, that's what's interesting about that.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:24.880]   >> You don't want like 12 and 13 and 14-year-olds getting sick and dying from this flu.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.440]   And that's when it becomes dangerous.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.560]   >> That's what was interesting about the pandemic was it affected young people, it was
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.760]   mostly soldiers initially who died.
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.200]   And that was what was so scary.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.080]   >> I guess the high.
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:39.080]   >> But also the soldiers at the time, the soldiers at the time, they were post World
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.080]   War I.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:44.560]   The health conditions of the military around the world were pretty deplorable.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:49.320]   One of the most striking statistics for an army that was brutally impacted with India,
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.360]   which would have been like 20% of the Indian army, I believe, died of it.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:58.320]   But the other thing is, you know, the armies are cleaner and healthier and in better shape
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:02.720]   these days is I think something that, you know, I mean, when people sort of, when you
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:08.400]   go, I think that everything I read said it wasn't hygiene issues, it was because they
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.640]   didn't have the immunities that the older folks had.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:18.080]   >> Well, why would they not have the, I mean, because they hadn't been exposed to earlier
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:24.160]   incidences of flu, which gave people over 40 some form of protection that the young
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.080]   people under 40 didn't have.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.320]   And what is a little scary is that the same thing is happening with this particular swine
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.080]   flu that the people who are dying are younger.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.120]   So that's one of the many reasons of cause for concern.
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.760]   I mean, the story, the text we should talk about, the text story and the text story partly
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:45.480]   is that you will see on Twitter and other sources a lot of hysteria and craziness.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:50.240]   Adam Curry couldn't be with us on the show today, but in his place, Jason Calicanis, Jason,
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.960]   is this all one big conspiracy?
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.680]   Was it the federal government that designed this flu?
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:56.680]   >> No, I'm sorry.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:57.680]   I have a job.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:02.680]   I can't.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:07.760]   I think they did a special edition of No Agenda this morning to cover the conspiracy.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.880]   Info Wars has already published an article saying,
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.880]   >> Too much time on your hands.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.880]   People who have jobs don't come up with these conspiracy theories some now.
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.480]   You know what's interesting in Japan?
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.600]   >> You just came back from Asia.
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.720]   And I'm always shocked in Japan, like I was in a meeting with somebody and the translator
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.520]   had a mask on the entire meeting.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.640]   This is an hour and a half, like high level meeting.
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.680]   And I guess she happened to be sick that day.
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.120]   She wore the mask and I'm like, she's talking to me.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.040]   I feel like I'm talking to like a stormtrooper or something because I can't see her lips
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.040]   moving.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.360]   No idea what she looks like, but she's translating for an hour and a half in the meeting.
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.320]   And I was like, wow, it's really interesting.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.320]   They're incredibly courteous.
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.960]   They wear these not to protect themselves, but to contain themselves from infecting other
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:49.960]   people.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:50.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:55.400]   You had also just traveled through two airports and across the world in a little tiny tube.
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.640]   So she may have been wearing it to protect herself.
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:58.880]   >> For me, it's quite possible.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:04.720]   >> Yeah, but you see this pretty often in all of the places in Japan and in Seoul.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.480]   They wear them sometimes also for pollution outside, but it's mainly for people who are
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.760]   sick.
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:13.320]   And I think I'm going to start wearing them on planes because I had a friend who was a
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:17.240]   doctor like five years ago and she's like, you know, there's going to be these pandemics
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.240]   and all this stuff.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.720]   You should wear a surgical mask.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.560]   If you think you look silly, just throw your blanket over your head and go to sleep.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.240]   On a plane, you should wear one to protect yourself.
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.240]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.560]   And these things cost like a dollar or two or three.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.760]   So I mean, I want to get I'm going to try and find a domain name and start selling these
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.120]   things because it's got to be a business model ever.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.880]   >> I actually wore one on the plane to Egypt for that very reason.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.360]   I was a little nervous about that.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.360]   So yeah.
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:44.320]   >> Well, to speak directly to the tech angle, I think it's amazing what they're doing with
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.320]   the Google Maps.
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.800]   You actually being able to see the outbreaks.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:52.600]   And I wonder there's, you know, you talk about the signal to noise ratio and obviously we're
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:58.320]   way more interconnected and obviously knowledge and communication and technology makes us
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:02.280]   possible to a degree that was not possible in the early 20th century.
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:07.260]   And I wonder if is the mere fact of our instant communication to instantly know where the
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:12.240]   outbreaks are and what areas need to take high levels of precaution if that alone will
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:16.560]   be enough to stop it or the flip side is, as you mentioned, Twitter hysteria.
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.080]   You've got the signal and you've got the noise.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:22.640]   So which is technology going to end up being a boon or a bus?
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.040]   >> Very good point.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.040]   Yeah.
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:30.480]   I think people are smart enough to know that what you see on Twitter is just chatter.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.120]   >> It's a starting point.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.760]   And then you go do your research from there.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.600]   Obviously I saw the other night and I was like, well, heck, it says flu stuff.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.840]   And then I worked backwards.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.760]   >> But we're intelligent.
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.200]   I mean, no, no, no, that was the wrong word.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.520]   >> Like those other people.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.720]   >> Not like those morons.
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:52.320]   >> No, no, but we're sophisticated in terms of understanding that maybe many people, especially
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:57.800]   people, you're new to Twitter, do you know enough to know that some of it is BS?
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:04.320]   >> Yeah, I mean, there's certainly, it will instantiate me to look further online.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:08.080]   So if I see something here that, you know, it's an interesting point where I say, okay,
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.040]   well, I'm going to look into this.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.040]   So.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:15.360]   >> I think we created a friend feed in Twitter searches on swine flu because I know that
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.280]   a lot of good traffic, useful links and so forth.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:22.120]   And most of what I know about the swine flu come from links that I've picked up.
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.800]   But I don't just say, oh, yeah, that person said it was a conspiracy.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.720]   It must be true, but you wouldn't do that.
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:30.680]   >> No, well, and I think another thing too, just on the positive note of it is I wouldn't
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:34.360]   have been exposed to it as early as I was if I wasn't.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.560]   That's how I learned about it was through it.
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.720]   >> It is the pulse of them.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.320]   It is now the pulse of our brains, isn't it?
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.320]   >> It's more of a yeah.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.200]   >> You know what the problem with it is though, and now I was at breakfast with Evan Williams
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.240]   and Biz on Wednesday or Thursday.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.880]   And when you click on one of these things now, everybody knows, wow, people are clicking
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.480]   in the sign bar on swine flu.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:57.760]   Therefore, all the marketers now are marketing to whatever the big search terms are.
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:58.760]   So the same person.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:59.760]   >> Oh, no.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.760]   >> And it's like, yes, more information on swine flu.
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:03.760]   >> Oh, that's terrible.
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.720]   >> And all the blogs and everything, you know, just the way they sort of follow Google trends
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.720]   or whatever.
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:11.600]   And I'd say it's a fair game, but you don't get the actual legitimate chatter.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.480]   What you're getting now is, the service says the service is trending and they've created
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.480]   a page on it.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.480]   >> Right.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:18.480]   >> So it's a, yeah.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.400]   >> You know, I created a Twitter account for my mom, which you probably had me delete,
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.320]   but I tried.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.880]   And she said, "People will follow me."
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.880]   I said, "Yeah?"
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.360]   She said, "I don't want that."
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.800]   So, but I understand.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.800]   >> I understand.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.480]   >> But because she created a new account, she got, it's interesting.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.080]   She got a completely different interface than me.
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.880]   I know some people have, it had trends right on the front page.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.680]   It had a search box on the front page.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:42.680]   >> Yeah, that.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.040]   >> See, I don't have that on my account.
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.320]   Only some people have that on their account.
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.000]   >> That's because they're trying to scale the service.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.360]   And if they have too many people searching and clicking on those trends, it's database
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.360]   hits and whatnot.
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.840]   So they're just trying to roll it out.
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.800]   >> That's a really nice feature for something like this.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.800]   That's really great.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.600]   >> Yeah, it's like right next to it on the right-hand column is all the trends.
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.760]   >> And you see them.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.920]   You know, I use Tweety on the iPhone and it has a page of trends.
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.400]   I presume it's the same.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.560]   Is that information all coming from search.tweater.com?
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.880]   >> Yeah, it's the API.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.880]   >> Okay.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:14.000]   So it's all the same information no matter what client you're using.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   >> Have you guys started playing with the seismic desktop or any of the new clients like Tweety
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   desktop for the Mac or?
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.080]   >> Seismic desktop is very nice.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.960]   I'm using it.
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:29.440]   It's a little in multiple accounts and all that stuff.
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.440]   It's really light.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:34.000]   I've been using Tweetyck for a while, but that's got all those kind of memory problems.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.320]   It was constantly like crashing or spinning wheel of death on the Mac.
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.320]   I think they're cleaning it up.
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.320]   But you know what's really interesting?
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.400]   They were able to raise capital for a Twitter application company.
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.760]   >> Isn't that amazing?
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:48.120]   >> That's like, I think that's a sign it's a bubble.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:52.320]   But a recession right now, so I don't understand.
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.040]   >> It's a recession bubble, don't you know that?
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:59.040]   >> It's a recession Twitter bubble because in the eBay, when eBay became big, there were
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:03.320]   like hundreds of business plans that were like, we're going to take people's stuff and
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.360]   then go put it on eBay for them.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.200]   We're going to create insurance for eBay.
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.920]   We're going to create a payment system, PayPal for eBay.
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.120]   When you know a service and also that happens on Facebook, right?
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:17.240]   Like Zenga and Rocku and all these people who are making applications and casual games
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.240]   for Facebook.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:22.280]   So it's when you know you have a company that's really worth something, what other companies
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.200]   are built around it?
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.320]   >> So real quick because I don't worry about to move on to something else, but I got to
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.680]   know from Dr. Keke, is there something everybody should be doing or not be doing?
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:34.880]   Like it's now the time to do something or to wait.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:39.040]   Like for us, because I mean there's nothing that strikes to the heart of fear.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.800]   >> I'm just not going out.
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.800]   I'm staying in.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.240]   I'm going to stay in this room.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.520]   I'm sealing it up and that's it.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.760]   >> But that's your problem is you're inviting people like me who travel all over, so I go
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.560]   out and collect the bugs and bring them to you.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:50.560]   >> Oh, she's Louise.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.040]   This is the last live Twitter.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.640]   Everybody got a Skype from now on.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.720]   What should we do, Keke?
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:05.200]   >> The most that you can do really is wash your hands or use the Purell type stuff.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.080]   That's the best you can do because your hands come in contact with so many objects.
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:16.560]   I mean if you were to keep track of how many times you touch things every day, it's phenomenal.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.840]   And all the different things that other people have touched, it's out of control.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:26.120]   And so you want to be able to clean your hands, don't touch your nose, your eyes, your mouth,
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.120]   try and keep away from--
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.880]   >> And the Purell is effective against the viral?
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.880]   >> Yeah, the alcohol.
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.080]   You can just pour pure alcohol in your hands, but it's a little different.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.080]   >> Or drink a lot of alcohol.
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:38.480]   >> I've heard two shots of vodka gets rid of anything.
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:39.480]   >> The odds of it.
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.280]   In case you swallowed the bugs.
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.280]   >> Exactly.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.280]   >> Hold on, hold on.
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:47.240]   >> Very important, if you're going to use these things, you have to have above 60% alcohol
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.240]   content that you're on the phone.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.240]   >> It's true.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.240]   Above 60%.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:55.000]   All you do is move around and also things like fecal material and other dirt and something
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   like that.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.880]   If you don't wash your hands, it just gets moved around on your hands and it's incredibly
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.880]   disgusting.
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.880]   People have to learn how to wash their hands with hot water.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:02.880]   >> At least 20 seconds.
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.920]   >> Like saying for a minute, for a minute do it.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.520]   Please, everybody who shakes my hand, do it.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.520]   I'm an absolute jerk before.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.920]   If you meet me in person, it's absolutely fine to not shake my hand and just sort of
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.000]   put your hand up away and say, "Hey, great to meet you."
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.560]   >> You could also try, we can all be Japanese and just bow at each other.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:20.560]   >> It's much better.
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.560]   Nobody should touch each other's hand.
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.320]   >> That's the whole reason that they have the bowing tradition.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:28.200]   So they don't shake hands and that's part of it is not.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.840]   You don't shake hands, you don't transmit stuff and you just bow.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:36.680]   >> I want to talk about the pirate base trial.
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.680]   Turns out the judge had some very suspicious connections.
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:43.680]   >> But you found the head no conflicts of interest.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.040]   Well, you hang on there.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.200]   We're going to talk about that in just a second.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.800]   Also, financials are out for Microsoft and Apple.
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.840]   Who do you think was the big winner in the last quarter?
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.600]   The one that's selling the inexpensive computers you don't have to be cool to own or the one
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:02.040]   that's selling the very expensive computers you have to be cool to own.
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.240]   I'll tell you the answer in that in a bit, but first we're going to take a little break
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:12.320]   to mention Jason Calicanis's very favorite thing in the whole wide world.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.320]   >> Really?
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:14.320]   You're kidding, they're back?
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.320]   >> They're back, baby.
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.320]   >> And they're in the first block.
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.600]   >> In the first block because I know you want to talk about Audible.com.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.600]   >> Audible Audible.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.800]   >> Katherine, do you know about audiobooks, Katherine?
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.280]   >> I'm even taking a photo.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.200]   >> She's taking a photo because she's so excited, so she'll remember it.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.200]   >> Audible.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.200]   Let me tell you something.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:34.360]   You're on a flight, you're in your car, you're wasting time and you're going to listen
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.520]   to some like donkey radio and like--
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.520]   >> That's called a zoo.
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.520]   >> You didn't think donkey radio.
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.080]   >> Hey, this is a zoo and you're on a zoo.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.840]   We're going to throw a pineapple at this, but I mean it's just like--
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:47.840]   >> Donkey radio.
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.840]   >> This is just something better than donkey radio.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:57.320]   Stop rotting your brain, use that downtime at the gym, on the flight and in your car.
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.840]   You do those three things, at least you do two of the three.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:04.240]   You buy a couple audiobooks, you go to Audible.com/twit2.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.720]   You probably get some ridiculous deal.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.800]   They give a ridiculous deal to only the Twitter audience.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:08.800]   What's ridiculous deal?
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.520]   >> The ridiculous deal, I'm glad you asked Jason Gallicanis.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:15.080]   If you go to Audible.com/twit2, you can sign up for a platinum account and get two, not
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.080]   one but two books, absolutely free.
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.480]   I'm going to recommend one that is very appropriate.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.720]   Did any of you ever read this?
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:25.240]   I found it because it was on a list of the, I think of the 100 science fiction books you
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.280]   have to read that everybody has to read.
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.960]   It's 60 years old now by George R. Stewart.
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:33.400]   It's called Earth Abides and it couldn't be more appropriate.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.680]   It starts with a guy who's coming down from the mountains.
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:42.680]   He was camping and he got bit by a snake and was feverish and writhing for a week but somehow
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:50.440]   survives, comes down to find that most of the earth has died off due to a great plague
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.440]   that he was saved from.
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.680]   He thinks because the snake bites somehow and inoculated him.
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:59.400]   Well it turns out only maybe hundreds or thousands of people have survived planetary
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.400]   wide.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:06.320]   Earth Abides is about his journey of discovery as he wanders, looking for other people.
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.400]   He goes down to Berkeley, takes place in the Bay Area.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.600]   So I have a little soft spot for it.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:14.600]   He wanders into Berkeley and he saves the library because he says, well this is all
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.400]   of everything we've learned.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:21.800]   He tries to teach, he does finally run in some other people.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.360]   They start a tribe, a family.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:27.680]   He tries to teach the young ones about the modern world.
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.680]   They can't learn.
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:33.960]   It is a fascinating story that ends in I think a very beautiful and upbeat way about the
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:40.920]   triumph of not only the earth because the earth absolutely survives but also of humanity.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.000]   Not technology but of humanity.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.680]   This is one of the best science fiction books in which there is no ray gun, there is no
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.160]   interplanetary travel, there's no time travel.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:55.080]   It's one of those plague stories that like the stand that occur from time to time and
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.480]   maybe a good time to read this.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:00.120]   It certainly is a beautiful book and I highly recommend it.
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.320]   Written by Jonathan Davis and Connie Willis.
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.400]   Let me play just a little bit of it so you can hear a little bit.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.400]   Have you ever read this?
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.400]   It's a wonder.
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.400]   Patrick, you probably read it.
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:13.520]   No, but I kept thinking of like when you mentioned library, I kept waiting to hear that he broke
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.520]   his glasses.
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:19.200]   Oh, actually that might be, I can't remember.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.960]   That's a good point.
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:21.960]   That would be irony, wouldn't it?
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.080]   No, that would be an episode of the Twilight.
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:30.000]   I'm still amused that you're talking about like it's a beautiful heroic, alliagic novel
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.080]   of gentle language and you're like, but it's plague fiction.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.400]   Yeah, that's why I'm here.
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.360]   Listen, I happen as well.
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:43.880]   Say because I have never broken my leg, my leg is unbreakable or because I've never
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:47.440]   died, I am immortal.
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:54.240]   One thinks first of some great plague of insects, locusts or grasshoppers when the species suddenly
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.240]   increases out of all proportion.
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:58.600]   Let me tell you, you're going to get pulled into this book and you're not ready.
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:27:59.600]   Like we just canceled.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.520]   Yeah, you're not going to want to stop.
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:07.320]   This is recommended as one of the all time great science fiction books, not very well
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:08.320]   known.
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.320]   I was blown away.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.800]   I gave it to my daughter after I read it.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.280]   I said, you have because she wants to learn about sci-fi.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:17.000]   You know, Jason was joking, like, let's just quit the show and actually just listen.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.280]   But like that happens to me all the time.
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:22.760]   I get pulled into the audible vortex where it's like, oh, just listen to the must do dishes.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.760]   One more chapter for sure.
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.600]   It's actually good for doing dishes too, I might say.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:32.200]   One thing I listened to, my little recommendation, we can remember it for you wholesale from
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.200]   the.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.200]   Oh, the Philip K. Dick.
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.120]   Dick, Minority Report and other stories.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.240]   You know what movie that became?
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.240]   We can remember it for the second.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.240]   Total recall.
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.240]   There you go.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.240]   We have a nerd.
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:48.200]   These Philip K. Dick audio books are fantastic because you know, you see some of the films
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:51.480]   that are made out of them, even you know, Blade Runner, Du Androids, Dream of Electric
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:56.360]   Sheep, the books are so much different than the movies and there's so much more interesting
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:57.360]   aspects to it.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:01.240]   Like, listening to Du Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, which I listened to on the way back
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:05.320]   from Sundance with 10-hour drive, it was just awesome because there's so much more in the
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.600]   book than there is in the film, obviously.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:08.600]   Hey, Jason.
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:13.880]   Actually, I tried several, you know, Du Androids Dream of Electric Sheep became Blade Runner
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:14.880]   and I kid you not.
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:19.240]   I tried five full times to watch Blade Runner and it was beautiful and gorgeous and I fell
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:23.680]   asleep every single time and it wasn't until I had read the original book, the Du Androids
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:28.720]   Dream of Electric Sheep, on audio book, which I think the version I read was performed by
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.800]   Callista Flockhart and I forgive who the God was.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.560]   Which Callista Flockhart and...
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.800]   It was another famous guy.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.800]   It's Matthew Modion.
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:39.800]   Okay.
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:43.080]   But they were great and I got through the whole thing and you get to hear about like the
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.920]   kipilization of the Earth.
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:45.920]   Yes, kipo.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.920]   I love that word kipo.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:50.480]   And as a result, after doing the book, I was able to enjoy the movie so much more.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.520]   It was alive and vibrant and I didn't fall asleep.
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:56.400]   A little tip, if you're searching for it on Audible, they've renamed it Blade Runner
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.040]   so that people can find it a little bit better.
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.040]   Really?
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.240]   So let's give you two books.
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.240]   You get the two books with the platinum account.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:11.160]   So you want to read two great science fiction books, Blade Runner by Philip K. Dick and Earth
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:16.800]   Abides by George R. Stewart and you get both of them free when you go to audible.com/twit
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:17.800]   to...
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.200]   We highly encourage you to check it out and we thank them so much for the support.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.200]   Kipo.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.200]   What is kipiling?
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.200]   What is the kipil of the...
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.200]   Kip?
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.280]   You have to understand the first law of kipil.
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.280]   People drive out non-kipil.
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.280]   It's something that is...
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.280]   Is it a bike club?
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:34.440]   No, what it is, is you remember the JR, the Sebastian character?
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.440]   These are my friends.
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.440]   You know the guy...
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:39.440]   These are my friends.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.600]   We're our best buddy JR.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.040]   You have to help us.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.040]   Okay.
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.320]   That guy was great.
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:49.800]   I don't make their eyes.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:53.080]   What happens is in that building, there's so much junk because everybody's left Earth
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.320]   that they call it Kipil.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.120]   Kipil just collections and collections.
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.120]   Yeah.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.120]   Nothing.
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:02.360]   So if one person lives in an apartment building with 500 units, it's filled with Kipil.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:06.280]   And the Kipil just seems to accumulate and accumulate and it drives out non-kipil because
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.040]   it sounds like my life.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.840]   If you've ever seen my garage, that's all I think I'll walk out and like Kipil.
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:11.840]   This building's full of Kipil.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:12.840]   Yeah.
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:16.280]   Basically, he basically saw that we were going to live in a society where consumption
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:21.640]   would be unabounded and therefore there would be more stuff than people.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.680]   Audible asked me...
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:25.800]   They want me to read a book.
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.960]   And they said, "Well, what would you like to read?"
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.600]   And I said, "I gave him a few choices."
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:32.520]   But I said, "You know what I'd really love to do is Philip K. Dick's short stories."
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:33.520]   But they've got them all, unfortunately.
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:34.520]   Yeah.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:35.520]   So I guess I won't do it.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.520]   And they're good.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.520]   I would listen to them by you.
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:41.160]   Well, why don't we have the Twit roundtable read a book but we'll all take a different
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.160]   character.
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.160]   We can do that.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.160]   So awesome.
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:45.160]   Deal.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.160]   That's a great idea.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.160]   I've always wanted to do that.
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.160]   So great book.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.600]   Well, I've always wanted to do the radio theater thing.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:51.600]   Yeah.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.360]   So if we can find something that we have the rights to, I will invite you all back.
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.080]   But we will do a show in here.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.080]   An old time radio with Follies.
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:58.080]   Great Expectations.
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.480]   Yeah, great Expectations is public domain.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.480]   We could do that.
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.480]   Sure.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.480]   How long would that take?
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.480]   Walks.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.480]   We need lots of wine.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.360]   I've nonstop reading.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.160]   So I just also want to thank Gary's Wine.
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:15.200]   They're providing the wine for the show today and Gary'swine.com.
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:18.160]   We have a couple of wines, the Innisfree Cab, which you like, Kiki.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.720]   You decided you like the red better.
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.200]   I like the red.
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.000]   The red just really hit me.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.320]   That's the 2006 Innisfree Cab.
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:25.320]   It's tasty.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.320]   And the Catherine also voting.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.320]   I love the red.
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.320]   And Brian.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.320]   It is free.
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.320]   You're going to make it unanimous?
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:32.320]   Yeah, the red's excellent.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.320]   And it's free Cabernet Sauvignon.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:34.320]   I didn't try against anything.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.640]   Well, I've been drinking the wallflower Sauvignon Blanc.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.640]   It's a little sweet, but I'm finding it refreshing.
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:39.640]   Mm-hmm.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:40.640]   It is refreshing.
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.640]   This is a good...
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:42.640]   But you like the cabs.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:43.640]   There's a lot of cabs.
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:44.640]   There's this one.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.640]   Yeah.
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:46.640]   It's good.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.400]   Will and Gary recommended that one highly.
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:49.400]   So I thought we'd take that one.
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:50.400]   Let's have a book on tape comment.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.400]   Yes.
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:52.400]   Yes.
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.400]   Well, I started doing this myself.
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:57.560]   And I have to say, it's actually quite amazing because times like...
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.120]   I was driving home from San Francisco the other day and there's tons of traffic.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.120]   It's a lifesaving.
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:04.120]   And I started to get annoyed and then I was like, "Oh, you know, I just listened to my
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.120]   book on tape."
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.520]   And it sounds like silly, whatever, but it really...
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:08.520]   I don't know.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.520]   It's like you can learn because it's bad.
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:12.400]   You know you've got the bug bad when you start looking forward to traffic.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.400]   You're like, "Oh, sweet."
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.760]   Well, I don't have a long drive.
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.520]   I said, "Now it's this week in Audible."
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:18.520]   But we're not talking about...
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:19.520]   We're talking about...
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.520]   Oh my gosh.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:21.520]   We're talking about books.
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:22.520]   We're not talking about...
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:23.520]   I have a great idea, Leo.
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:24.520]   There was somebody who mentioned the hot zone.
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:25.520]   There was somebody who mentioned the hot zone.
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.520]   That we're going to do this being audible.
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.520]   Yes.
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:32.160]   Like for 30 minutes after the show, that would be like, "We're going to charge them eight
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.560]   times for the sponsorship."
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:34.960]   One meeting in dollars!
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:38.160]   That's what I feel like dollars could do.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.160]   That's the businessman.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.160]   I'm in Austin Powers.
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.560]   This week in Audible produced that.
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.360]   And am I Dr. Evil?
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.360]   No, I am.
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.560]   Look, I'm sitting here with your dog.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.640]   Oh, you're petting the dog like Dr. Evil does.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.200]   I'm like the silent doctor.
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.200]   Oh.
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:54.640]   He's the most dangerous type of evil.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.640]   Evil.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:59.320]   All right, so let's get back to the news stories.
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:02.280]   There are quite a few.
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:05.560]   I'm going to mention the Microsoft and Apple results.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:08.560]   Microsoft, Microsoft, Charles J. I.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:14.160]   Ever, revenue decline profits down 32%.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:18.280]   The first quarterly revenue loss in 23 years is a public company.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.680]   But they met Wall Street's expectations.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:22.280]   And they price went up this week.
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:26.600]   That was the funny part because I clicked on the link and it says, "Microsoft shares
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.600]   jump."
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:28.600]   They jump!
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.600]   How can you lose?
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.200]   All right, you're the businessman, Jason.
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:33.560]   Why is that good news?
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:36.520]   Yeah, I don't know exactly.
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.960]   Not losing as much as probably was that people expected them to lose more.
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:42.520]   Typically, when that happens, you have these.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:43.800]   Microsoft is a blue chip now.
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.920]   You have to remember, this is not like a grilled stock.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.880]   So people who own it own a lot of it.
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:54.240]   So it's not like, and it hasn't really, in terms of the range it's traded and it's traded
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:56.000]   sideways for over five years.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.200]   It's really been stagnant for so long, hasn't it?
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.200]   Yeah, well, I mean, the promise makes so much money.
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.760]   It's so predictable as a business.
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:09.160]   And there are some signs of weakening now, though, with Windows 7 and the Visahold debacle.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:13.120]   And then you have Apple actually getting some market share and then you have netbooks cutting
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.120]   in.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:18.680]   And people are like, "What's a Linux operating system wrapper?"
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:19.680]   Ubuntu.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:25.720]   Ubuntu is now actually maybe you could use it.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:28.920]   So I think I had a lot of challenges.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.920]   So Microsoft, it's first down quarter in 23 years.
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:36.840]   Apple posts its best second quarter earnings ever.
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.280]   And fires 10% of retail full-time employees.
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.640]   Well, maybe that's why.
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.800]   Actually, Mac sales down 12%.
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:47.560]   So it was really on the iPhone and the iPod that they made so much money.
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:54.600]   They sold 2.22 million Macs for the quarter, 11 million iPods, 3.79 million iPhones.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:55.600]   That's in three months.
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.480]   That's double the number it sold a year ago.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:01.040]   I mean, it really was an iPhone win.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.040]   What happened to the recession?
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:06.080]   I mean, this is what I found puzzling about Apple's results is you would think an iPhone
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:10.160]   is the most unnecessary thing you could possibly buy in a down market.
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:11.160]   Where are people getting the money from this?
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.160]   If everybody's losing their jobs?
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.120]   So what are these 3 million people buying iPhones?
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:17.520]   Well, first of all, maybe you could explain this to me.
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.320]   I don't want to sound callous, but everybody's not losing their jobs.
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.320]   What is an employment at eight and a half?
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.320]   Well, it's actually 16%.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.320]   Is it 16?
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.320]   16% California.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:30.520]   If you underemployed and stayed by state and not looking.
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:31.720]   And it would stop looking.
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.680]   So it's a lot of people.
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:37.080]   And also people will have this collective belt tightening that's been going on.
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.520]   Well, that's what I'm seeing is this kind of psychology.
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:40.520]   You're feel guilty about spending.
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:44.720]   But you know what, I think the iPhone is so beautiful that it actually transcends recession.
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:45.720]   It's over your guilt.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:50.320]   What we saw that before last time and it was a technology thing last time in the Great
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:54.440]   Depression when people defaulted on their loans and they came and they started confiscating
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:58.680]   stuff, people would give up their refrigerators before they gave up their radios.
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:36:59.840]   They kept the radio.
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:00.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:04.280]   I'll eat warm food, but give me a little abner.
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:05.280]   That's right.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.280]   Well, they'll keep me on the phone.
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.960]   And people also went to the movies.
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:09.760]   And so there's the entertainment aspect.
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:13.320]   But also the radio was probably the first time that people were really connected to what
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.480]   was going on at the time.
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.480]   And so there's the news.
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.280]   And the iPhone does that now.
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.280]   Yeah, think about it.
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:21.640]   If you had to take away your iPhone, it's not really the piece of equipment you're worried
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:22.640]   about.
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.640]   It's like, that's my connection to all my friends.
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:24.640]   The phone is the least.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:25.640]   The phone is the least.
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:26.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:27.640]   That's my Twitter feed.
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:28.640]   That's my friend feed.
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.720]   That's my connection to the outside world.
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:31.720]   It's my Google.
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:32.720]   It's everything.
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:33.720]   Well, it's also, sorry.
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:34.720]   Go ahead, Kevin.
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:39.680]   Oh, I was going to say, I mean, going back to what you said about buyers or more.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:44.640]   I think because it's a tool that we can use for our businesses and communication, our
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:47.240]   psyche allows us to purchase it more so--
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:48.240]   It's justifiable.
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.240]   Exactly.
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.240]   Patrick?
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.120]   Well, I mean, the iPhones hit Walmart.
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:59.440]   It's scaled probably better than any cell phone in probably a decade in terms of gathering
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.360]   market share.
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.520]   It's popularized.
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.760]   It's available.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:07.920]   And people, there's also, especially younger generations, they spend-- younger kids spend
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:13.240]   a huge amount of money on cell phones monthly without thinking twice about it.
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.600]   It's amazing, actually.
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:21.000]   When you look at numbers of somebody in their 30s or 40s or 50s on what they spend on apps
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.800]   or songs or ringtones versus what somebody-- an average teenager or somebody in their
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.920]   early 20s is spending on cell phones.
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.040]   It's just considered a necessity.
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.200]   And they've scaled it out.
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.200]   The price is down.
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:35.200]   You can pick one up for $200.
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:37.080]   They're in Walmart.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:39.880]   It's just hugely popular.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.840]   Oh, by the way, the whole refrigerator thing people gave up.
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.960]   They're refrigerators because they couldn't carry them in the car with them to the next
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:45.960]   place.
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:46.960]   Other way out to pick grapes.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:50.760]   Well, there's also-- but the other thing is that they're also-- the refrigerator was
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:54.200]   not nearly as entrenched in culture.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.920]   None of us-- most of us can't imagine life without a refrigerator.
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:00.840]   Everybody in the 1920s could pretty much imagine life without a refrigerator.
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.360]   You can't eat ice boxes.
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:03.960]   It's still-- but it's still-- you know what I mean?
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.760]   They had ice boxes, ergo.
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.960]   They could-- they could eat a refrigerator.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:12.160]   Yeah, but I mean, ice boxes still require money and they require a weekly delivery or
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:15.520]   daily semi-weekly delivery from an ice fan that costs money.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.000]   Get this-- get this statistic.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:26.120]   India in March, 15.6 million new cell phone users in March.
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:29.280]   And you know, India, they don't have refrigerators.
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.280]   No, I'm serious.
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.280]   But they have cell phones now.
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:35.200]   Yeah, I've been India.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:39.760]   It's amazing to me that they have dairy products and they don't-- like we feel like we need
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.920]   to have refrigerators for everything.
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.320]   You really don't need them for--
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.320]   That's a very American thing for refrigerators.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:47.720]   If you're going to get things fresh if you're going to use things within a certain period
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:53.640]   of time, you know, the refrigerator just extends the period of time that things stay
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:54.640]   good.
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:57.680]   It decreases the rate of death.
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:02.640]   They also-- and Alan Burtchell's pointing this out in our friend feed conversation-- they
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.840]   also don't have landlines in India.
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:07.440]   So I mean, this is a lifeline.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:08.440]   But all of the population--
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.440]   I mean, they're kind of-- they're kind of leaving--
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.440]   They're kind of leaving--
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.440]   They're kind of leaving-- they're kind of leaving--
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.440]   They're kind of leaving-- they're kind of leaving--
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:13.440]   Well, a lot of people are giving up their landlines here in the United States.
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.440]   You know, they're sort of just leapfrogging straight to--
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.440]   Right.
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.440]   Yeah.
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:21.160]   Well, though, it costs-- it costs more than an order of magnitude less to install cell
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.640]   towers than it does to involve landlines.
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:28.720]   So for most of the third world, cell phones are almost exclusively what's been going
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:30.440]   up for the last decade.
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:34.160]   The other thing is like 15 million people-- isn't that like what?
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.160]   One-- like 1.5% of the population.
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.160]   Yeah, India's huge.
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.840]   There's a billion people in India, at least.
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:44.280]   This reminds me of the book The World Is Flat, where he talks about the side effect
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:48.120]   of, you know, we all grumble grumble about the outsourcing of jobs to India.
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:51.760]   But the other side of the coin is that we are creating another middle class over there
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:54.640]   and they're going to be buying Windows XP and Vista and Windows--
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:57.560]   I'm just glad they have a middle class since we don't seem to have it.
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:58.560]   Because somebody--
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:01.200]   We're exporting our middle class over there.
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.520]   We have a huge middle class.
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.520]   You know what's interesting, too?
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.520]   Shrinking.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:08.640]   You're thinking that the T-Mobile sold like a million G1s?
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.000]   That kind of surprised me, but it took them a long time.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   I mean, it wasn't--
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   It's month.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.080]   It was the same period of time for the 3.7 million iPhones.
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:19.320]   So for-- and that's with T-Mobile, which is like the fourth--
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:22.760]   That also includes the inaugural induction.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:26.880]   I mean, that includes like how many iPhones that they sell in the first six months of
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:27.880]   the iPhone.
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:28.880]   Right.
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:29.880]   They sold them out.
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:30.880]   I mean, I don't know how many ones.
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:31.880]   I don't think they said.
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:36.200]   But if you think about that, I mean, that's with the fourth largest carrier T-Mobile.
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:41.160]   I mean, when they get that thing out to other platforms, I think that this is a sleeper.
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:43.160]   Google's got a huge business here.
[00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:44.160]   Huge.
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.360]   Apparently, they're about to do a netbook.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.360]   Somebody's about to do a netbook.
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:51.480]   But this is-- yeah, what's happening is they're saying, why should we give any money to Microsoft
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.040]   when we get this for free?
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:54.040]   Right.
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.040]   And $250.
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.040]   I think that--
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:57.040]   Because there's no lower management.
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:01.240]   Battery life, power management, which has always been miserable on anything other than
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:03.080]   OS XP and Windows XP.
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:04.080]   Excuse me?
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:05.080]   Spinning wheel of death.
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:07.320]   I mean, you don't have to deal with freezing blue screen.
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.320]   You know?
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.320]   Yeah, but you know what?
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.200]   What's the last time you had a blue screen on Windows?
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.320]   I mean, I haven't had one on Windows 7 yet.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.320]   My first ago, my last two was--
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:16.320]   I haven't had one on Windows 7 yet.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:21.400]   But I have to say that the problem is that we haven't really seen Android, at least I
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:22.880]   have an on a decent platform.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.960]   This G1 has just not enough horsepower to really show what Andrew can do.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.560]   But I'd love to see it on a netbook just to see how it does.
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:34.040]   The netbook that's supposed to be the first one coming out is basically a glorified cell
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:35.040]   phone.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.000]   It is not a full Intel power netbook.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   Is it Asus?
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   Who's making it?
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.680]   It was some fourth tier company I'd never heard of before.
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:46.280]   Well, since we're talking about netbooks, is there any interest in talking about Apple
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:48.280]   officially poo pooing on the netbook?
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:50.280]   It's going to release WWDC.
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.280]   That's coming out.
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:55.760]   It was Tim Cook in the analyst meeting.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.720]   Now, Tim is not like Jobs.
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:00.400]   If Jobs said that, I'd say, "Oh yeah, they're definitely making one."
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:03.640]   But Tim Cook, is he-- I mean, you probably-- I don't know.
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:04.720]   Jason, you must know him.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:05.720]   You know everybody.
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.720]   I think I'm not at once, but I don't know him.
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:11.800]   But they're notorious for lying through their teeth and then doing the exact opposite.
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:12.800]   Well, yeah.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:16.240]   I mean, Steve Jobs saying, "No one will ever want to watch a video on affordable development
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:17.240]   and the price."
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:18.240]   He told me with his stomach.
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.680]   But you know what the thing about netbooks is?
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.280]   I think this is another sleeper.
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:25.040]   And I think I talked about this like a year ago on Twitter.
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:28.840]   In Japan, do you know how much a netbook cost in Japan?
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:29.840]   One dollar.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:30.840]   What?
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:31.840]   What?
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:33.160]   Because they're subsidized by the carrier.
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:34.160]   Yes.
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:41.040]   You walk in and if you buy a $25 or a $35 data plant with 3G, you get a five percent dollar
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.040]   in the states.
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:43.040]   That's happening in the states.
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:47.040]   Ties in selling a $50 netbook as long as you sign up for two years.
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.840]   Though that's happening in the states already.
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:51.720]   It's $60, $60, $75 a month for the plan.
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:55.680]   Now, for the unlimited plan that's capped at really big a bunch.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:00.880]   Well, that actually ties into my little conspiracy theory is that obviously Apple bought all
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:04.760]   those touch screens a while back and there's conjecture that it was all about a netbook.
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:09.760]   I wonder if they're just going to still essentially have a netbook but not call it a netbook.
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:13.640]   I'll call it an always on connected tablet or something like that.
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.600]   Yeah, I with one.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:16.600]   It's June.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:17.600]   We're all agreed, right?
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.480]   June, netbook and Steve Jobs.
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:22.080]   Okay, so here's the deal.
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.080]   Surprise guests.
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.320]   Phil Schiller is doing the speech at WWDC.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:30.560]   They talk, and then Phil Schiller says, oh, one more thing and out walks Steve Jobs with
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:31.560]   a netbook.
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:32.560]   Completely ripped and buff.
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:33.560]   Yeah.
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:34.560]   Half robotic, shoot blazers.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:35.560]   Yeah.
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:36.560]   I am bad.
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:40.560]   I am bad.
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:41.560]   That's my plan.
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:42.560]   I like now, dog.
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:46.840]   I totally like Steve Jobs and the remake of RoboCo.
[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:49.760]   You asked for a netbook here.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:50.760]   It is.
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:51.760]   I am a job.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:52.760]   Oh, and one more thing.
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:54.560]   It also the text swine flu.
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.920]   Oh, oh, hey.
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:58.640]   That's our that's our that's my vote anyway.
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:44:59.640]   I don't know.
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:00.640]   Maybe that's wishful a little bit of wishful.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:01.640]   I have guaranteed right now.
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:06.360]   They launch a netbook whether they are consciously going to do it or not because they have no
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:07.360]   choice.
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:10.360]   These things are so good and so cheap.
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:17.000]   If I was with this Windows ad campaign, they need to say get Windows for $500 by three
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.720]   computers by one for every other family or by one Mac.
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:20.720]   Right.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:21.720]   They're not going far enough.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:26.080]   They're selling these crappy HP notebooks instead of saying, what are you talking about
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:27.080]   $1,000?
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:28.080]   Here's three notebooks for $9.99.
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:29.080]   That's what they should be doing.
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:31.800]   They should say we were fat.
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:35.560]   Hi, we're the calicannises and I wear the reports.
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:36.560]   We're the calicannises.
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:40.560]   $2,000, you know, back book tower.
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:44.480]   But instead we decided to buy each member of the family for $500 on Netflix.
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:45.480]   F U apple.
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:46.480]   Boom.
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:50.680]   If I was a CEO, it's a new reality show.
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:55.160]   Hi, we're the calicannises coming to our home.
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:58.600]   I got tourists and fun doing that.
[00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:00.200]   We have many notebooks.
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:02.200]   Some of them are very small.
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:03.200]   Very nice.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.200]   Very nice.
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:05.200]   We play Doom.
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:07.840]   The last party.
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:09.320]   This one running Android.
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:11.960]   Well, I'd love to see a tablet from Apple.
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:15.120]   I think a tablet from Apple is a great idea, but they did.
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:16.120]   You're right.
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:18.720]   They said Tim Cook said, this is crappy.
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:20.800]   Who would want a crappy computer like this?
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.320]   We wouldn't sell it because it's just so junky.
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:29.920]   But you know, but what's setting it up is however, but you know what people do want.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:34.000]   What they would like is something that fills this niche but has better processing.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.680]   What if more powerful?
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:38.920]   What if you could get one that really was nice?
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:43.440]   iPhone with a bigger screen that'll actually use a keyboard and a decent processor.
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:48.520]   I would actually, I would consider that about a thousand times more than I would consider
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:49.520]   the air.
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:52.520]   I think he would French kiss it actually.
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:53.920]   I think this would happen.
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:58.320]   Do you know who should be worried about it is the Amazon Kindle because everything I
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:02.240]   hear about the Kindle, the thing I'm least interested in is using it to read books or
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:06.400]   hearing it, do robo speech to laboriously read something to me.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:11.200]   But the idea of something that's got an always on data connection prepaid that gets me automatic
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:15.880]   content download, if it was like that but beautiful like a giant iPhone.
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:19.960]   All it did was surf the web and I could see everything all the time.
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:20.960]   Why can't it happen?
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:21.960]   What's wrong with this?
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:23.200]   There's two issues there.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:29.680]   One is the only reason that Whisper Net can work is because they have occasional use of
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:33.560]   relatively small downloads so they can scale it.
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:39.680]   They're basically paying nothing because a consumer account, barring one of those mystical
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:48.580]   Apple negotiations of a better deal than anyone else gets, basically, unless the Apple Net
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:53.920]   book is essentially sold as a device like an iPhone, they're not going to get a deal
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:59.320]   on the, you're not going to get, you're not going to pay $250 or $500 for something and
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:02.480]   get lifetime free wireless.
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:07.480]   Which is one of the, which is what I would spend $350 or whatever and tack on, I don't
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:10.920]   know, 20 bucks extra a month to add it to my collection.
[00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:14.360]   The promise is it's going to be, it's going to be a matter of a heart.
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:16.440]   It doesn't have to be 60 bucks though, Patrick, does it?
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:18.120]   Well, I think about it this way.
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:19.480]   What are you paying for your iPhone?
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:23.320]   You're paying for your plan plus an additional 35 bucks a month.
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:29.280]   So okay, so how are they going to get around the, so that's like almost 100 bucks.
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:32.120]   If you have a cheap plan, it's still 75 bucks a month.
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:36.080]   So let's say they take out the cell phone, they take the cell phone number away from
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:39.920]   it, they make a data device, what's going to make them want to go lower than the 60 bucks
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:44.120]   a month, they already get for a five gigabyte capped unlimited account.
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:48.760]   And even without that, the thing that makes the battery life work on the kindles, which
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:55.360]   is like 90% of what makes, is the fact that, that they pop the, basically they, the, the
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:59.360]   e-ink changes the display to the new configuration and then it stops using power.
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:03.960]   So effectively they have no power draw compared to a traditional computer or computer that
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:06.160]   you would use the browse, the web or anything.
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:09.440]   If it wasn't for that, the Kindle would have a battery back on it like this thick to get
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:11.000]   two weeks of reading.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.560]   You basically haven't attached to a car battery.
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:18.920]   You know what I would do is I would, I would totally buy something that was like a jumbo,
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:23.720]   a jumbo iPhone and actually had a dock for you to lock in your iPhone into or something.
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:24.720]   Right.
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:27.800]   That'd be, and to which where you could piggyback on that data connection, that'd be kind of
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:28.800]   cool.
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:32.280]   I think Apple might surprise everybody and just do another iPhone and not do a tablet, not
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:36.080]   do anything bigger with the, on the premise that this is enough.
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:39.480]   I mean, look, they just sold what, how many millions of them in three months?
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:41.560]   I mean, this, for many people, this is enough.
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:43.400]   What about the screens they bought though?
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:47.240]   Well, however, we're the screens 12 inch touch screens.
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:50.040]   They weren't that big or 10 and a half inch, whatever it was.
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:53.960]   They bought it supposedly, according to the times or one of the, one of the time when
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:57.080]   he's electronics news, things they supposedly bought these.
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:50:01.240]   But I, I wouldn't be surprised to see, I think we're all assuming Apple's going to do this.
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:02.560]   Apple, you never can assume anything.
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:06.200]   That's a problem is they've set such a precedent of, of blowing us away out of nowhere.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.760]   There's like, you know, when are they going to resurrect people?
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:11.320]   Come on, Apple, hurry up.
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:12.320]   And they may not need to.
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:16.200]   That's the point is that they may be very happy with how the iPhone is selling.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.200]   You know?
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:21.200]   And by the way, who needs a tablet that you can kill a baby by shaking it with?
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:22.200]   Right?
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:24.400]   I mean, where is the, where is the, God, I don't mind it.
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.040]   What a bunch of gotcha.
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:27.040]   So what happened there?
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:28.040]   Honestly, an application.
[00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:29.040]   Yes.
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:30.040]   It was.
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:32.800]   That's basically somebody created an offensive application.
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:33.800]   I'm really offensive.
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:36.040]   Where you basically shake a baby.
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:38.840]   It's actually really horrible thing.
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:42.720]   Obviously, a shaking baby syndrome, very dangerous, obviously abusing kids.
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:44.600]   It happens.
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:50.680]   They're funny, you know, even in a college humor type of way, not that they did it, but
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:54.440]   it just, well, around bad.
[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:57.680]   So I somehow somebody let it slide through, you know?
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:59.480]   I mean, there's a lot of pressure.
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:01.680]   They've got 35,000 applications, a lot of pressure.
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:02.680]   I don't think they're even looking.
[00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:04.680]   I think they're probably just going down a page looking at the name of the page.
[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:05.680]   I think they're looking.
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:06.680]   Check, check, check, check, check.
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:07.680]   Go and look at that one.
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:08.680]   But I do think they're looking.
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:11.920]   I know a lot of good iPhone applications, great iPhone applications that are still on
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.520]   hold that people can't get into the store.
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:19.440]   There's one guy I know wrote an application that I would love to see that it's a Netflix
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:22.640]   application that allows you to manage your Netflix on the iPhone.
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:23.640]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:24.640]   I'm having great news.
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:26.040]   And they've released it.
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:27.520]   It's just waiting in the queue.
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:28.520]   It's not out still.
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:31.000]   What they need to do is they need to have two types of applications.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.680]   One are certified, one are not certified.
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:37.200]   Anybody can make an uncertified application for the, and you can buy it through the iTunes
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.200]   store.
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:40.120]   It doesn't have to certify logo on it.
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:42.240]   Certified applications don't come up in search.
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:44.000]   Certified applications have a big roadblock.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   This is not certified.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.760]   It could destroy your computer at your own risk.
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:50.440]   Massive two or three roadblock kind of situation.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.680]   Are you sure you want to talk?
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:52.680]   Here's my question.
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:53.680]   This is interesting.
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:56.960]   I was watching a history channel documentary on computing in the eighties and they brought
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:59.880]   up the specter of Atari.
[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:02.360]   Remember Atari 2600, King of the World.
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:03.720]   Greatest, everybody was buying them.
[00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:04.880]   They were under 200 bucks.
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:05.880]   Great games.
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:08.320]   But Atari said, no one but should know.
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:11.160]   I think said quite admirably we won't make an open system and let anybody develop games
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:12.160]   for it.
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:13.840]   So many crappy games came out.
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:18.600]   Not only it killed the platform and not only were people getting, what is this game, but
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:21.000]   they actually had to, it killed the 2600.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.600]   They had to bulldoze cartridges because there were so many bad cartridges.
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:27.800]   Nintendo with the NES took a look at this and said, well, wait a minute, we can't do
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:28.800]   that.
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:32.520]   And they were the ones who said we have to approve and license every single game.
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:36.360]   Apple's iTunes store is exactly that same model.
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:39.960]   Now does that make sense in the day and age of the internet where information is almost
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:40.960]   perfect?
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:44.480]   This is really tough for me because both of you guys sounded like geniuses.
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:46.320]   I'm just like, oh, Jason, so right.
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:47.960]   No Leo, so right.
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:53.200]   Well, it may be that the times have changed that internet, the internet, you know, it
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:57.280]   would have saved the 2600 is if there were a better communication system among customers
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:59.880]   and they could have said, oh, whatever you do, don't buy that big dug cartridge.
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:01.200]   It's a piece of crap.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:03.360]   Then those things may not have killed the 2600.
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:07.200]   But at that time, there was no- I don't think they were sold that killed it though.
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:08.280]   Oh, it's well.
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:09.760]   No, it killed it.
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:10.760]   It killed it.
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:14.000]   So succeeded because they did the exact opposite.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.120]   They said you may not make a game for the NES unless we say so.
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:21.280]   And everybody bought the NES because they knew that every game was at least going to
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:22.280]   be playable.
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:27.760]   I think it's really important for a company to have the certification of products that
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:30.560]   come out that apply to their products.
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:34.720]   So like the way that the iPhone apps are working, I mean, those are iPhone, like they're related
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:39.000]   to the iPhone that the potential of something like a shaken baby, the app coming out.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   That hasn't-
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   No, it's an aberration.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   We can admit that.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.840]   But it's an aberration, but it has a trickle-back effect to the image of the company and the
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:47.840]   way you see it.
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:52.360]   And so as the company that is, you know, this is Apple, this is iPhone, this is their entire
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:53.360]   image.
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:55.240]   And so they want to control that.
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:59.880]   And I think Jason's right in the fact that maybe they're own little directory of iPhone
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:00.880]   apps.
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:01.880]   Sure.
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:02.880]   These are certified.
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:06.480]   These are the things that we agree are awesome products that we want to have, you know,
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:08.040]   have affiliated with us.
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:12.880]   But then, but then maybe allow other products to be created, but not certified.
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:17.120]   And you can have your shaken baby or like shoot the dog or whatever it happens to be.
[00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:19.960]   Well, that system exists already with jailbroken iPhones.
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:20.960]   Right.
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:22.760]   And I have to say the lot of the applications are created.
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:24.440]   But not have it like destroy the warranty though.
[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:25.440]   Right.
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:28.360]   But isn't that what Apple's like base, like their branding is based on?
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:30.400]   Is that everything works sort of thing?
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.400]   Exactly.
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:32.400]   I mean, it's not against their branding.
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:35.840]   If you start introducing applications and other things that work with their products.
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:36.840]   That's their point.
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:43.760]   I mean, I'm always inherently bummed to see somebody screwed over, you know, just on
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:47.600]   poor taste like, you know, I mean, this was taken off because it was a poor taste and
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:49.720]   that could be a very person by person basis.
[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:51.480]   And you know, whether or not this is a good or bad app.
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:52.480]   I'll give you another one.
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:53.480]   Let's give you another one.
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:54.480]   And then you can judge it on this.
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:55.480]   Okay.
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:59.240]   There was an application where you could select a pit political figure, Hillary Clinton, Barack
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:04.320]   Obama, George Bush have them bouncing on a trampoline in the Oval Office and doing back
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:05.320]   flips.
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:07.560]   And I think if Hillary did it, her skirt would go up or something.
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:12.240]   But anyway, the Apple said, no, we will not allow you to sell this in the iTunes store
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:14.800]   because it's disrespectful to elected officials.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:15.800]   Wow.
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:16.960]   Now use that one as your example.
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:17.960]   Everybody says shake it, baguis.
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:18.960]   Right.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:19.960]   Right.
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:20.960]   Right.
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:21.960]   Well, and that's just it.
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:24.000]   What I was going to say is, is I'm always bummed to see, you know, something wiped off
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:28.240]   just for being in poor taste because that's a person by person, but it's very consistent
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.360]   with what everything Apple's done so far.
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:32.640]   I'm not going to be too harsh on them.
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:34.440]   They're playing by the same rules they've always played by.
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:37.480]   So you read the Catherine and you agree too that this is their business model.
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:38.480]   Yeah, it's a brand.
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:39.480]   It's a brand.
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:40.480]   They do whatever they want.
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:41.480]   Well, they of course can do it.
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:42.480]   Yeah.
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:47.880]   But we can, we can go and we can tell dead baby jokes and, you know, have our poor taste
[00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:50.480]   and, you know, we don't tell.
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:51.480]   Wow.
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:53.480]   There's the confession.
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:57.200]   You heard it straight from Dr. Kiki headline tomorrow.
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:59.080]   Dr. Kiki loves dead baby jokes.
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:01.640]   No, that's actually our new show is Dr. Kiki's dead baby jokes.
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:03.200]   That was the name you were going to come up with.
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:04.200]   That's the name I came up with.
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:05.200]   Yeah, I thought so.
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.200]   That's exciting.
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:08.200]   It's a week.
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:09.200]   Dead baby jokes.
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:10.200]   The reason this is a really bad idea.
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.200]   I'm not sponsored by Apple.
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:12.200]   No.
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:13.200]   Go ahead, Jason.
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:14.200]   Just ignore these kids.
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:17.200]   I'm not the only reason you know something's wrong with something really wrong.
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:21.440]   I don't know who these people you have in the studio are, but I love them.
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:24.600]   Seriously, this is a big problem for Apple actually because what they're doing is they're
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:28.000]   setting themselves up in this antitrust situation again.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.600]   And they don't have market shares so they can sort of play a game with the PC market
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:35.400]   share about not having a hardware run on OS 10.
[00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:43.000]   But in iPhone they're going to have a monopoly and the same thing with iTunes.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.840]   And so this is really stupid of them to take this sort of, we're going to be the judge
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:48.840]   of everything.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:51.640]   They should have a certified group and then have one that's not certified.
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:56.080]   But the crazy thing is, I don't know if you guys know, but I was officially elected chairman
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:57.080]   of the internet.
[00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:58.080]   Congratulations.
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:00.800]   I've been wondering who's running this.
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:04.160]   I've actually, I know I'm the chairman of the internet because I get all these emails
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:06.840]   from all these crazy people who are telling me.
[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:08.520]   Now that you're in charge, let's fix this.
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:10.320]   Yeah, I get all these things too.
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:15.760]   But one of them that I've been getting an email from somebody who's involved in a project
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:19.320]   about Jake and baby syndrome and all this stuff.
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:23.480]   So he's writing these long emails about, oh my God, Apple's the worst company in the
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:24.480]   world.
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:32.280]   So now they want the, they want Tim Cook to attend a two hour panel discussion about
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:37.480]   prevention of abuse head trauma at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill on May 6th.
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:44.200]   They want him to, you know, like, you know, work directly to get the people who downloaded
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:46.440]   this and have an intervention with them.
[00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:48.160]   And the guy's like, what do you think, Jason?
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:53.920]   And I'm like, I, and I wrote him, I said, I think you're leveraging their stupid mistake
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:55.840]   in like a really heavy handed way.
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:56.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:58:00.360]   And it makes you look like you're trying to manipulate the system and it's really cheap.
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:01.360]   It's extortion.
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:05.280]   It is a good company that made a stupid mistake and then apologized.
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:06.280]   What more do you want?
[00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:08.000]   And he said, well, they have to do more.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.840]   And I'm like, why are you emailing me?
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:11.920]   I know I'm the chairman of the interwebs.
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:14.400]   But as chairman of the interwebs, this is not inappropriate.
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:20.520]   Why you have to actually fill out the form 4097B and you have to challenge the interwebs
[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:22.720]   standards of Jake and baby syndrome.
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:27.560]   And I just unbelievable like this like eight page letter of everything Apple must do.
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:30.760]   Apple dodged a big bullet though, because you know, they're on Thursday, they're one,
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:33.640]   they sold their one billionth application in the app store.
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:34.640]   Yes.
[00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:38.240]   If it had been shaken, baby, I think Brian brush would point it is.
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:40.280]   That would have been PR disaster.
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:43.360]   It could have been, it could have been so much worse.
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:47.160]   And the one billionth app is, and the one billionth and one application.
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:48.160]   Yeah.
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:54.400]   The one billionth was a free app called bump that I guess lets you copy your iPod touch
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:58.160]   contacts over to your iPhone or something like that.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:02.200]   But it was a free application, which is probably not what Apple would have liked.
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:04.800]   The winner is a 13 year old kid.
[00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:09.160]   He is going to get $10,000 worth of iPod songs.
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:10.840]   That's what 10,000 songs, right?
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:12.480]   It depends on what you buy.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:13.880]   Almost enough to fill up his iPod.
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:14.880]   Yeah, really.
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:16.880]   And he gets a MacBook Pro.
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:21.640]   He actually did quite the $10,000 iTunes gift certificate and said I have a million songs
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:22.640]   from Pirate Bay.
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:23.640]   Thank you very much.
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:26.640]   Thank you for letting me give this to a friend.
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:29.240]   I don't really need that.
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:30.840]   Let's talk about the Pirate Bay judgment.
[00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:31.840]   This is kind of interesting.
[00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:36.560]   We talked last week about the fact that the two founders of Pirate Bay will found guilty.
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:44.960]   About the way that we go to buy a Swedish court that said that this is piracy.
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:49.440]   Even though you're just running a search engine, you don't actually host any pirated files.
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:52.760]   Those torrents point to, for the most part, illegal files.
[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:53.760]   So you're guilty.
[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:58.000]   I think several, a couple million dollars and a year in jail.
[00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.400]   Now they're appealing.
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:07.520]   But now comes news that the judge who sentenced them has some ties to some copyright organizations.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:08.520]   You know what this is like?
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:12.120]   This is like watching a concert and it's the most hilariously awesome circus you've ever
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:15.280]   seen and the show's over and everyone's still going nuts.
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:19.760]   And then somebody walks on stage holding up a finger like, oh, you want one more?
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:22.760]   We're like, yeah, more Pirate Bay craziness.
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:24.520]   This will not end.
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.800]   Well, they're also appealing.
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:31.680]   I mean, I don't think I'm going to say right now, 70% chances guys are not going to jail.
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:35.720]   People are protesting over there and it's a very liberal society.
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:36.720]   And if you know--
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.400]   Well, this gives them a handle.
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:42.240]   If they're going to overturn it, this gives them a handle.
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:43.560]   The judge would have to do it.
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:44.560]   This doesn't give them a handle.
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:51.400]   This gives them a baseball bat and a backhoe and a full-- I mean, this is Nordstrom.
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:52.400]   Who is the judge?
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:55.240]   I remember the Swedish Copyright Association.
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:58.800]   And something else I'd never heard of, which is the Swedish Association for Industrial
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:05.120]   Legal Protection, which just would look awesome on a t-shirt.
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:12.000]   But the judge serves in the Swedish Copyright Association with the lawyers for the plaintiff.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.560]   So he's in an association with the lawyers for the plaintiff.
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:19.040]   And the quote-- it's a great quote on the CNET store.
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:23.280]   Every time I take it-- actually, it should be-- every time I take it, somebody needs to
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.480]   do the Swedish chef on this one.
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:25.480]   It should be trying to be a queen.
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:28.480]   You know, I got in trouble last time for doing it, but I'll do it for you, Patrick, because
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:29.480]   I'm not a man.
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:30.480]   It's OK.
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:31.480]   It's OK.
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:32.480]   It's OK.
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:33.480]   It's OK.
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:34.480]   It's OK.
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.480]   It's OK.
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:36.480]   It's OK.
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:37.480]   It's OK.
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:38.480]   I work-- I work with a Swede.
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.480]   She loves the Swedish chef humor.
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:39.480]   Every time I take a case, I evaluate if I consider myself having a conflict of interest.
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:42.480]   That's like a mix between a Swedish and Stephen Hawking.
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:43.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:44.480]   A Swede.
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:45.960]   A Swedish chef in a very expensive case.
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:48.000]   I didn't find out to have one.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.680]   So I think it's OK.
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:53.200]   I think the judge is about to get his ass handed to him.
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:54.600]   Well, you think he didn't have a conflict.
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:56.200]   Then we-- sorry, we brought it up.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.200]   Yeah.
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.200]   OK.
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:01:59.200]   Well, you're right.
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:00.200]   You're right.
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:01.200]   No problem.
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:04.000]   That's kind of-- I think it's not so bad to be a member of those organizations, but
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   really, if you're serving on the board with the plaintiffs' attorneys, that would seem
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.600]   to be a conflict of interest.
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:16.200]   I don't know if he was serving on the board or they're just merely members' same association,
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:20.120]   but it's obvious that the judge has a bias to the copyright organizations.
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:21.480]   Yeah, I would say so.
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.320]   I don't think copyright's a bad thing.
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:28.600]   And it's really interesting freedom of speech versus the Pirate Bay guys obviously want
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:33.560]   to destroy copyright and destroy all copy protection and encourage as much file trading
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:34.560]   as possible.
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:35.560]   Kevin.
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:38.680]   You're a photographer, and of course, one of the issues photographers face these days
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:41.240]   getting ripped off on their images.
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:44.280]   How would you feel if your images were on Pirate Bay?
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:46.520]   Not the images themselves, just the torrents.
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:52.520]   Are these guys-- should they go to jail?
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:53.520]   It's a tough one, isn't it?
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:54.520]   It's not obvious.
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.520]   Yeah.
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:56.520]   It's definitely--
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:03:02.000]   I think the damage is minimal, as I guess what I would say, but maybe my thought anyway.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.320]   Well, I'm a hot seat.
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:08.440]   I don't know how to answer that because I feel conflict with that a lot as far as--
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:09.440]   Sure.
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:12.240]   --where the boundaries.
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:15.320]   When you put the inner stuff on the internet, it's sort of out there.
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:16.320]   Right.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:21.160]   Well, now, OK, in the defense of the movie companies, they didn't put anything on the
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:22.160]   internet.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.160]   Right.
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.160]   Because people like Brian Brushwood did that.
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:25.160]   What?
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:26.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:30.800]   That they just put a movie out, and somebody else took the DVD and put it on--
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:35.280]   Or in some cases, some of their own employees or subcontractors took a version of the movie
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:37.200]   and made it available.
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:41.840]   Which is, whoever did this with the Wolverine movie, I mean, most of the time they've water
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:44.520]   mark this stuff so they can identify the original source.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:47.680]   I can't imagine what they're going to do to that individual or company.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:50.000]   I just don't think that Pirate Bay--
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.360]   Well, here's-- there's two things I think.
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:53.600]   One is, they're a search engine.
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:54.800]   What's who's next, Google?
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.360]   You can search for torrents on Google.
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:01.200]   Yeah, no, no, no, no, let me sort of take a step back from what I was saying before.
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.360]   It's one-- yeah, I don't think-- I don't think linking to torrent sites should be illegal.
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:07.160]   I don't think linking to illegal code should be illegal.
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:12.640]   What's great about the Pirate Bay guys is they work so hard to establish themselves as such
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:13.640]   a huge target.
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:14.640]   I know.
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:15.640]   They annoy--
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:16.640]   And so many.
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:19.240]   And they have-- unlike people-- because there were people who were talking for a long
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:23.600]   time like, yeah, we're going to set up a test case for the DMCA.
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:28.160]   So it can go to the Supreme Court and be struck down as being unconstitutional.
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:32.080]   And then it's like, every time a case comes up that might actually get anywhere near the
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:34.960]   Supreme Court, everybody's like, yeah.
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:42.200]   Did you notice that copyright is provided for in the Constitution but not fair use?
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:44.440]   Maybe we shouldn't take this to the Supreme Court.
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:45.440]   And the case gets styped.
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:50.000]   Because they're afraid that the courts will set a precedent that doesn't exist right now
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.480]   in favor of fair use.
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:55.880]   Yeah, because the basically the fundamental president for copyright is like, oh, yeah,
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:05:00.520]   it's kind of in the Constitution to encourage development and technology and stuff.
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:01.520]   But fair use is not.
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.560]   Fair use is an accepted thing.
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:08.320]   And fair use has been a rubber blanket that's been stretched in some interesting ways.
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:13.840]   But it's-- I still think the DMCA is a miserable law that should be stomped into submission.
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:17.720]   But there's not a lot of legal grounds to work with that.
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:22.200]   And so much of what people do that violates the DMCA is basically avoiding paying for something
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:23.680]   that somebody else created.
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:28.880]   Well, that's why I asked Catherine because here's a-- actually, we're all content creators.
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:32.680]   Yeah, unlike Catherine, though, we put our stuff on the net and say, take it.
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:33.680]   Take it.
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:34.680]   Please take it.
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:37.720]   Well, in some cases, remember, you know, there would like when my wedding pictures were
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:41.560]   put up on your website, somebody copied all of them off your website.
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:43.760]   Some guy in Oklahoma uses them or did.
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:45.040]   I haven't checked recently.
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:49.720]   Uses them to gather website hits that direct people to his eBay sales site.
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:50.720]   Well, I'm sorry.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:53.880]   Hey, you know, there's nothing we can do about it because they were all posted on your
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:56.960]   website with a copy left or a creative comment.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:58.760]   So it's, you know what I mean?
[01:05:58.760 --> 01:05:59.760]   It's like--
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:00.760]   He looks so regretful, dude.
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:04.400]   He's so bummed to hear this.
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.040]   That's just one more reason.
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.600]   Patrick has many reasons to hate me.
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:09.360]   It's just one more reason.
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:10.880]   Just add it to the pile.
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:16.200]   No, it's great because at some point it's actually-- it's given me-- so what I said
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:19.840]   to my wife one day is, look, someday we're going to be driving on I-40.
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:21.320]   We're going to be in Oklahoma.
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:24.480]   We're going to be in one of those points where we're like, OK, it's only 38 miles to
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:28.320]   the next Indian casino because there's like an end you can see every eight feet on I-40
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:29.320]   in Oklahoma.
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:30.320]   And we're going to go visit this guy.
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:33.280]   And it's going to be awesome because I'm going to knock on the front door of his house
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:36.720]   and be like, hey, I wanted to ask you about the pictures.
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:40.840]   And I just want to watch the facial reaction.
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:43.200]   Maybe we'll videotape it, put it online.
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.200]   Maybe it'll do something on YouTube.
[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.960]   And I'll share his love right back with him.
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:47.960]   It'll be epicly cool.
[01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:50.720]   It'll be great is when you start making too much money off that content, he'll come
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:54.320]   knocking on your door as saying he never signed a release.
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:07:00.040]   I have to say that most of the time I get in trouble, it's for stuff like that where
[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:06.480]   I instantly just thought, oh, everybody would want to see this and post stuff up there.
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:08.840]   But it's the internet.
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:09.840]   It's the way it works.
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:12.560]   It is the ultimate social tool for sharing.
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:15.480]   And some people don't like having their stuff shared.
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:17.880]   The pictures, whatever.
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:20.640]   I've met kids who are like in little indie bands.
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:25.080]   They're like, yeah, we sold like 800, seven inches.
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:29.720]   And we looked at one of the torrents, about 275,000 downloads.
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:33.000]   So we could all quit our jobs, work in the graveyard, shift at 7-11.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.520]   If we got like 4% of the revenue of that.
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:38.880]   I would say that's revenue they never have gotten.
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:41.160]   Well, is it or isn't it?
[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:44.720]   Because it's like if they had a medium for distributing those albums where they could
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:49.920]   get some, or maybe if just people weren't scumbags about taking stuff that they wouldn't
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:52.960]   pay for otherwise.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:58.560]   It's shameful that so many people consider it their deity given right.
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:03.360]   I think really that the failing there is that the kids working in the 7-11 weren't creative
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:06.880]   enough about how to use this notoriety that they generated.
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:13.120]   This was also at a stage where the file trading was fairly new.
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:17.680]   It's like peer to peer sharing pre-bit torrent.
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:19.520]   So it shouldn't have set torrent traceability.
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:23.600]   They basically were able to track down a ridiculous number of downloads.
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:27.280]   And it's like, yeah, so the onus is on them to be creative about something they never
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:31.480]   asked to be distributed on the internet, which is like kind of shameful.
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:35.920]   On the flip side, the internet, it's still a very wild west kind of thing.
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:36.920]   It's a tough one.
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:41.080]   And it's the difficulty that you had, Catherine, in kind of saying how I feel about it, is
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:43.080]   the problem we all have.
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:45.680]   Of saying, well, what's the answer to this?
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:46.680]   I don't know.
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:50.560]   I think, too, when it comes to sharing and the internet and all that, there's a certain
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.240]   issue of it's bound to happen.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:57.000]   But as long as credit is given, for me, for example, people have posted my images, as
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:02.320]   long as my name is associated with the image, then there's been situations where I made
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:07.480]   a resource guide and this guy copied the whole thing and blacked out were my copyright
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:08.480]   list.
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:09.480]   And distributed it.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:10.480]   That's why.
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:13.360]   And then he tried to tell me he didn't realize it was wrong.
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:16.960]   And I was like, well, when you were covering the copyright, did that maybe occur to you?
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.440]   That's why you're doing it.
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:19.680]   Why else did you cover that?
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:20.680]   Yeah.
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:22.440]   So that made me really, really, really upset.
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:25.480]   But then I've seen other people post my images, but they put my name with it.
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:29.240]   And it's like, it directs people to my site and that's fine.
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:34.480]   And there's also the image, the image, the instance of whether or not they're gaining
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:41.040]   financially from your work and giving you credit or not or not giving you kickback from
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:42.680]   using your work in a financial way.
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:45.280]   The word is royalties, but it gets kickback work.
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:46.280]   Yeah.
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:48.880]   And that was a little big would be nice.
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:52.120]   And that was one of the reasons why I got so upset with this one situation is he was
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:54.480]   distributing this to students in his workshops.
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:56.200]   And so he was profiting on my work.
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:57.200]   And that was different.
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:01.400]   That's, yeah, I mean, that's different than maybe just taking it and sharing it and being
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:02.400]   able to be.
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:08.480]   I found this, I found this really awesome guide and Catherine Hall came up with it and I want
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:09.640]   to share it with you.
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:10.880]   That's actually actionable.
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:11.880]   Yeah.
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:13.480]   And then you can hire up the lawyers.
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:14.480]   Take all of his lenses.
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:17.560]   Yeah, but I thought about it actually.
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:19.840]   There's a pretty easy way to deal with this, I think.
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:25.240]   If you look at television shows, which were like the bread and butter of the pyre bay for
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:30.440]   a long time, TV shows are not their bread and butter anymore because Hulu is out and
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:33.080]   it's much easier to just watch it on Hulu and...
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:34.920]   Or on the network website.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:37.160]   Yeah, or on ABC's website.
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:40.800]   And so the movies of the people who are suffering from this, why are the movies suffering from
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:41.800]   it?
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:46.560]   Because they put DRM on stuff, because they don't make stuff available in HD, because
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:47.560]   they have windows.
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:51.240]   They just have to throw these ideas out the well out of the window and make these things
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:55.080]   available to consumers for a reasonable price and with advertising on them and they'll be
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.080]   fine.
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:57.760]   They just don't want to do that.
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:00.640]   So until they do, they're going to play this cat and mouse game.
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:04.680]   What they should do is they should sell these lawsuits and say, if I was in the studio head,
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:06.240]   I would say the pyre space, guys.
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:08.160]   Okay, I'll let you do what you're doing.
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:13.200]   Underneath every single bit torrent, I want a thing that explains to people that they're
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.800]   going to go to jail if they download this.
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:18.720]   And here are people who have links to the cases and that we will prosecute them.
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:22.680]   And that I want to left of it, the streaming version that says 99 cents, click here to
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:26.720]   do it easily and get the DVD and they see all the legal options.
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:31.480]   And I would say the pyre guy will drop the case if you give us the website.
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:34.480]   So if anybody does these kind of things and they build up a big enough website, the movie
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:38.680]   suit is just take the pyre bay over, let these guys go free, they have all this incredible
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:43.880]   domain name and page rank, and then replace all the torrents with the same exact file
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:45.560]   with advertisements in them.
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:47.760]   And they would instantly have a billion dollar business.
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:49.200]   So yeah, but the pyre, thank you.
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:52.840]   Aren't the pyre bay eyes just going to start hosting their servers in China or somewhere?
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:53.840]   Yeah, they're still doing it.
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:56.080]   I mean, that's the point to say, in fact, on the front.
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:59.160]   I mean, actually, I think it would be awesome if the studios kind of did that like next
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:00.920]   to a torrent had the 99 cent download button.
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:02.160]   I think that's a great idea.
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:07.840]   That's what I'm saying is instead of going, ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and being frustrated
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:11.600]   and going to lawyers, maybe there's a way to make something out of this and be creative
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:12.600]   about it.
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:14.320]   But the 99 cent download isn't going to happen.
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:17.360]   I mean, they're going to, if they're going to come at it, looking at it for profit, they're
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:18.440]   not going to do it for 99 cents.
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:21.800]   They're going to be like, oh, the cost of going to a movie.
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:26.440]   And so suddenly you're suddenly you're paying $10 for that not a theater experience.
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:32.120]   But it's not about it's not about it's not about it's basically about at least it's
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:34.560]   attempting to recoup some of the lost revenue.
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:37.440]   Maybe nobody who downloaded that video is going to spend 10 bucks for a seat.
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:39.560]   Yeah, a lot of these people now, they are in China where they are in places where they
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:40.800]   can't get the films anyway.
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:45.560]   So the statistics of how many things are downloaded, a lot of them are downloaded overseas.
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:51.040]   But revenue on 10% of a theft stream is better than revenue on 0% of a theft stream.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:53.840]   I mean, basically you have to herd these cats to the right place.
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:57.960]   China is getting very legitimate and the cost of DVDs in China is now down to like two
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:01.440]   or $3 and software the same thing.
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.240]   Microsoft is charging less for licenses there.
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:08.640]   If most people over there are stealing their Oracle license or stealing their Windows licenses,
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:13.520]   the way it works is, as I was told by people who do business over there, the local rep from
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:16.320]   Microsoft or from Oracle comes and says, we know that you're stealing.
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:17.520]   You have 18,000 servers.
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:20.560]   Can't you pay?
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:21.560]   Can you pay anything?
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:25.160]   And the guy's like, well, he's like, pay $50,000 a year.
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:26.960]   That same software, Michael, is 5 million in the United States.
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:28.320]   And the guy goes, you know what?
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:29.400]   All right, we'll give you the $50.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:30.400]   You're being reasonable.
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:33.040]   So they're actually the software industry is taking a really cool approach to, which
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:36.960]   is let's leave the horse to water, you know, and let's see if it drinks.
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:39.360]   And they just slowly are doing that.
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:40.960]   Nobody wants to break the law.
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:43.160]   And nobody wants to be in lawsuits.
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:46.880]   Just give people a decent price and give it to them the way they want it.
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:48.480]   If they want to download it, let them download it.
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:50.400]   If they want to stream it, let them stream it.
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:52.800]   Be happy they're interested in your content.
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:58.480]   And the big battle they have is that time is going to video games, time is going to blogs,
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:13:59.480]   time is going to podcasting.
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:00.960]   They got to fight the real enemy.
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:02.600]   They're fighting their own customers.
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:03.600]   That's not the enemy.
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:05.720]   The enemy is all their creative content producers.
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:07.560]   In the long run, that's the problem, isn't it?
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:08.960]   One footnote to what's stupid.
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:11.360]   They're fighting on this front where-
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.360]   Fighting their customers.
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:13.360]   Yeah.
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:15.200]   And that's just not a way to do business.
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:16.200]   No.
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:17.200]   So they're fighting for customers.
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:20.440]   This is very similar to what went, you know, at the end of the 90s with MP3s, everyone's
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:21.440]   freaking out.
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:22.440]   Nobody's buying CDs anymore.
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:28.200]   They're just like, "Oh, wait, this is opening up a whole new revenue stream.
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:29.360]   Now we're selling ringtones.
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:34.160]   Ringtones are a giant percentage of money that content, manufacturers in music make."
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:35.960]   Not a giant percentage.
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:39.120]   They're a giant source of revenue, but compared to CD sales, they were-
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:41.960]   Yeah, but they make a lot of money on something they weren't making any money on.
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:46.400]   Yeah, but what's that line that the newspapers guys keep coming up with where it's trading
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.560]   analog dollars for digital sense?
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:50.640]   I'm not sure which of the publishers said that.
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:53.880]   I mean, I think additional revenue streams are great, but I think everything's going
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.280]   to be scaling back.
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:59.080]   I mean, you know, is there going to be a $5 million action film?
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.880]   It's going to wow us as much as a $100 million action film.
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:02.880]   Yeah.
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:07.560]   So if there's demand for action films, then somebody's going to make a $100 million action
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:08.560]   film.
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:09.560]   And you know what?
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:12.960]   If people are too cheap and they want- and they watch everything on Hulu and YouTube,
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:13.960]   then there won't be.
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:14.960]   And you know what?
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:17.280]   There's not going to be newspapers in about five years.
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.280]   That's just the way it is.
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:22.160]   Because people don't want newspapers, but because the economics don't make any sense.
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:23.160]   That's just the way it is.
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:27.520]   I was going to say, I don't think that's- I actually- I'm one of the people who doesn't
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:28.520]   think that's actually true.
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:31.080]   I think we're not going to see big newspapers.
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:35.040]   We are going to see small local newspapers, and there are models that are actually starting
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:38.480]   to work in terms of local ad sales and running local news.
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:42.680]   And so I think that we are going to see newspapers, but not the big ones.
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:45.880]   I mean, the big national, international news, that's going to be gotten online.
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:46.880]   Where are you actually seeing-
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:47.880]   Yeah.
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:53.200]   That's why Jay Leno is going to the 10 o'clock hour and from the 11 o'clock hours because
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:55.600]   it's so much cheaper to have in there.
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:00.640]   And plus also that niche of high quality drama is being filled by networks like FX,
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:03.400]   which shows like The Shield and Breaking Bad and Ad Man.
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:04.400]   She always saw some-
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.400]   What a great-
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:07.040]   Do you guys see this on Boing Boing?
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:09.400]   This is an article from The New York Times.
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:11.440]   Music, Pirates in Canada.
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:16.840]   American publishers say they're suffering by copyright violations from Canadian Pirates.
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:22.640]   This is published in The New York Times of June 13, 1897.
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:24.640]   The P-97.
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:33.720]   The publishing houses in Canada that are taking these legitimate publishing music, I guess
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:35.560]   it's music and lyrics.
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:36.560]   Canadians.
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:37.560]   Those Canadians.
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:38.560]   They're sold at-
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:41.160]   Is that what started all the jokes?
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:42.160]   That's it, lame Canada.
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:46.800]   They're sold from two to five cents a copy, even though in the states they sell for the
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:49.600]   sell from 20 to 40 cents a copy.
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:53.320]   Publishers estimate fully five million copies of songs are printed and sold in the month
[01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:54.320]   of May.
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:58.280]   Those Canadians, they're putting the song publishing industry out of business.
[01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:00.400]   It's the other words.
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:01.400]   It's never changed.
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:02.400]   Nope.
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:04.320]   And it didn't put music out of business.
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:05.840]   No, it just changed.
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:07.840]   The more things change, the more they stay the same.
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:08.840]   There is truth in that.
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:09.840]   No, there's truth.
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:12.160]   All right, I want to take a little break.
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:15.920]   Speaking of change, the new CEO at MySpace, Jason has some advice.
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:18.040]   Is it a him or her?
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:19.040]   It's a her, right?
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:20.440]   No, it's Owen Van Nada.
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:21.440]   Oh, that's a guy.
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:26.240]   I was the CEO of Facebook and then one of the CEO jobs, Zuckerberg wouldn't do it and
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:28.080]   they've gotten a little tiff.
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:29.080]   All right.
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:34.280]   Jason will explain what he should do to fix the problem.
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:35.280]   Whatever that is.
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:39.240]   Before we do that, though, I want to mention my friends that go to my PC, Citrix, the folks
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:43.400]   that do those great remote access programs like Go to Meeting, they do.
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:49.560]   This is the easiest, the best, the most secure, the simplest to use remote access ever.
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:50.560]   And I've tried them all.
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:51.560]   Go to my PC.
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:54.200]   I want you to try it for free for 30 days.
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:18:01.400]   Go to G-O-T-O-M-Y-P-C.com/Twit for a free 30-day trial.
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:02.400]   Here's how easy it is.
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:06.960]   Before I'm done talking, you will have it installed on your computer and then you can
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:08.520]   go home.
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:09.600]   You could take some time off.
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:10.600]   You could travel.
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:11.600]   You could see the world.
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:16.760]   Enjoy life knowing safe and secure in the knowledge that any time you need that file,
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:23.200]   you got to check the inbox or you need access to that office computer, you can get there.
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:24.840]   Don't be chained to your office computer.
[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:25.840]   Release yourself.
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:28.520]   You probably probably done some escape work.
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:29.520]   Totally.
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:31.280]   You're talking about from Go to My PC, right?
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.760]   This thing has saved me so many times.
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:33.760]   It's unreal.
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:39.120]   I was literally, I was in LA for a show and I got a call from some TV group that wanted
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:42.800]   to a demo reel and I didn't have the specific bit they wanted on me.
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:43.800]   I'm like, "Let's back."
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:47.480]   I was talking about having my wife overnight, a DVD and all this stuff.
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:49.640]   Then finally, and believe it or not, I was like, "No, no, no.
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:52.880]   I'm hearing all the time about the Go to My PC, free 30-day trial."
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:54.480]   I signed up.
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:56.840]   I told my wife how to install it on the computer.
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:57.840]   It's that easy, folks.
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:58.840]   It really was.
[01:18:58.840 --> 01:18:59.840]   She walked in.
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:00.840]   It was on.
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:01.840]   Next thing I know, and I actually opened up the computer.
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:04.120]   I opened up the editing program.
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:09.080]   I edited together a specific demo reel from them and then FTPed it up to their server.
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:10.080]   Sent them a link.
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.080]   That's very cool.
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.080]   I had it done in an hour.
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.720]   I didn't even know that when I was going to you.
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:15.440]   I was going to ask you about handcuffs.
[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:17.560]   I'm really glad you know about it.
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:18.560]   No, I love it.
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:19.560]   Go to my PC.com/twit.
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.200]   He's listened to the ads and used it.
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:22.200]   You can't do.
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:23.200]   It's free for 30 days.
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:25.200]   Give it a try.
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:26.680]   Secure, efficient.
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:27.880]   You can even listen to audio.
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:32.600]   You could surf the net from a shady internet cafe in Murmansk.
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:37.440]   Wherever you are, go to my PC.com and get you to your office computer, Mac or Windows.
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:38.440]   It's really great.
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:39.440]   What a try.
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:43.040]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:45.760]   I didn't even know that when I went to you, Brian, brush what up.
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:46.760]   Oh, no.
[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:47.760]   Yeah.
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:51.720]   In fact, actually, just the cost of just one overnight of a diesel.
[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:52.720]   What is it?
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:53.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:54.720]   Yeah, totally.
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:55.720]   Well, especially since you paid nothing.
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:56.720]   Yeah.
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:58.480]   So I get Jason's email newsletter.
[01:19:58.480 --> 01:19:59.480]   I had what is it?
[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:00.480]   15,000?
[01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:01.480]   How many people?
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:02.480]   Yeah, like 14,000 or something else.
[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:03.480]   That's awesome.
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:04.480]   Tinyurl.com/JasonsList.
[01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:08.120]   Oh, it's still open to the public.
[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:09.720]   You don't have to be like a special.
[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:11.360]   I mean, this is secret URL.
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:13.360]   Tinyurl.com/JasonsList.
[01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:16.360]   J-A-S-O-N-S-L-A-I-S-T.
[01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:19.920]   Do you have ads for Dallas courts on Jason's list or is that too?
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:21.840]   We have a casual encounters list.
[01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:22.840]   Yeah, of course.
[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:24.680]   A casual encounters off the list.
[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:25.920]   It's a mailing list.
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:29.160]   And Jason, how about once a week you'll write a very thoughtful long?
[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:30.320]   Once every three weeks.
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:31.320]   Three weeks, OK.
[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:32.320]   Instead of the blog.
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:37.120]   Yeah, I gave up on the blog because there's too much noise and nonsense.
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:38.120]   Little likes to it.
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:39.120]   Little like to it.
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:40.120]   Little like to it.
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:41.120]   Yeah.
[01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:44.800]   So your last post, I don't even know if you knew that Myspace was looking for a new CEO
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:49.120]   when you wrote it, but your last post said here's what Myspace needs to do to save itself.
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:51.160]   I had a little bit of inside information there.
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:54.840]   But yeah, my name came up in the talk about it, which is very accurate.
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:57.480]   Would you have taken the job?
[01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:01.080]   You know, how do I say this?
[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:04.560]   You know, I'm very committed to Mahalo, obviously.
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:08.800]   And I think that has a lot more upside than Myspace, frankly.
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:10.920]   And it's more exciting for me to write about.
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:13.200]   That's kind of telling.
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:14.960]   That's really telling, in fact.
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:16.880]   Well, and that's no dig to Myspace.
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:19.080]   I think Myspace is a lot of fundamental problems.
[01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:24.480]   And I think that, you know, most people would say the best days are behind it.
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:26.040]   And it's going to be on the decline.
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:31.000]   Therefore, the chances of it recovering are 50/50 maybe, or the chances of it catching
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.320]   up to Facebook are 20%.
[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:36.760]   So essentially, it's going to be years and years of pain.
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:40.960]   It's sort of like taking over as AOL CEO when the dial up business is going away.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:43.840]   You're basically going to be dealing with bad news your whole life.
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:45.480]   Is there any upside to any pointers?
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:47.240]   It's just all the way downhill.
[01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:49.320]   No, I mean, there could be upside.
[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:53.760]   I mean, what basically has to happen is they have this big asset, which is eroding.
[01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:56.720]   I mean, it's actually, I shouldn't say it's eroding.
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:02.440]   It's got modest growth compared to Facebook, which has, and Twitter, which have massive
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:03.440]   growth.
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:05.160]   Obviously, Myspace does have a lot of users.
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:12.120]   Of the three, of the three, Myspace, Facebook, or Twitter, which would you like to own?
[01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:15.640]   Currently today, I would like to own Facebook, but I think ultimately Twitter is going to
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:16.640]   win.
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:17.640]   So really?
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:18.640]   Wow.
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:19.640]   Yeah, I do.
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:20.640]   I'll tell you why.
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:21.640]   When it saves us from the swine flu.
[01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:27.280]   I think what Twitter is going for, Twitter's elegant simplicity means everybody can use it.
[01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:30.960]   And so I fully believe every single person on the planet will have a Twitter account
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:34.000]   who's online, whether they're probably true, isn't it?
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000]   That's probably true.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.960]   If they're in India on a cell phone, they're going to have it.
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:37.960]   They're going to get on Twitter.
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:38.960]   Why not?
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:39.960]   It's a friend.
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:40.960]   It's probably a virus.
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:44.840]   And that'll be the global roll of X. And that'll be the equivalent of your phone number.
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:45.840]   People...
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:46.840]   It is.
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:47.840]   It's digital dial tone.
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:49.440]   It's your phone number now, especially with the direct thing.
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:53.960]   Like many times I'll be going to a meeting with somebody and they hit, they direct message
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:55.960]   me through Twitter instead of texting my phone number.
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:57.360]   And I'm like, why did you do that?
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:58.360]   Well, pretty simple.
[01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:00.400]   They don't have to remember my phone number.
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:01.680]   They know it's going to come to my phone.
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:02.680]   It's a direct message.
[01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:03.680]   That's really interesting.
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:10.280]   So I don't look at Twitter as much as blogging service as I do a namespace like novel network
[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:11.360]   or any of these other things.
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:12.560]   So I think they're going to win that race.
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:14.440]   I don't think anybody can stop them.
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:18.960]   And you're going to log into the majority of your sites and get the majority of your
[01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:22.240]   direct communication through Twitter.
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:24.000]   And that's pretty powerful.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.560]   And you don't really have to worry about monetizing it.
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:28.240]   So I think the Twitter guys have a brand for the ages.
[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:30.120]   Well, you do have to worry about monetizing it.
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:31.120]   You're just saying that you can--
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:32.120]   Kind of really.
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:33.120]   You know, when you're such a gal--
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:34.120]   Yeah.
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:36.120]   It'll take care of itself.
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:39.840]   You know, there are people at AOL who I would sometimes shake my head and go, I can't believe
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:41.320]   this person is making money.
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:44.080]   You know, it's like mid-level manager running some group.
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:47.760]   But it's like, well, if you point the AOL homepage at a terrible product and it gets
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:52.200]   half a million people a day, it's going to be a viable business.
[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:55.760]   So I'm surprised at the three options you gave Jason Calacanis because all the scuttlebutt
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:58.160]   was that he was going to take over GeoCities.
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:23:59.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:01.360]   They actually lost me the GeoCities job.
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:04.600]   They were like, we can shut this off or give it to Jason Turan.
[01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:05.600]   And they were like, yeah.
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:06.840]   Well, I know Miller's a friend of yours.
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:07.840]   Miller bought web logs.
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:09.840]   Yeah, he's a friend of mine.
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:11.400]   And he's on the board of Mahalo.
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:14.200]   And News Corp is an investor of Mahalo.
[01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:15.520]   So it's all very in-steshuous.
[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:19.760]   I don't think I would want the job to be totally honest because I love what I'm doing
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:21.080]   right now.
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:26.800]   My optimal size for running a company is I like 20 to 30 people, 40 people.
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:30.680]   And I wouldn't want to have that when I was at AOL, I had over 100 people reporting to
[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:33.960]   me and it was just not as much fun.
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:38.080]   So what would you do if you were in charge of my space?
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:42.040]   Can it be saved or is it just a long, grim slide down?
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:43.600]   No, it can be saved.
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:46.680]   I think what you have to do is you're going to have to be bold and you're going to have
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:47.680]   to invest.
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:48.680]   And the problem is-
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:49.680]   And what would you invest in?
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:50.680]   Would you buy Twitter?
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:52.480]   Well, you won't be able to.
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:55.760]   It sounds like- I'm not for something people can't buy Twitter then-
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:57.680]   Twitter is now clearly not for sale.
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:59.960]   If you're a vision of what Twitter is, it's not for sale.
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:00.960]   Oh, wait.
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:05.520]   They've had offers that are very significant.
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:06.520]   And they said no.
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:09.720]   So- That would be crazy to sell at this point.
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:16.200]   Actually my advice to him would be if he gets over a billion dollars to sell it.
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:19.600]   But that's only because my belief is that the multi-billion dollar businesses don't come
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:23.160]   along that often and if you do get one, selling it's not a bad option.
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:26.240]   However, I don't think he's in it for the money he made enough of the last company.
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:27.840]   So that's a mitigating factor.
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:29.960]   I think it's about legacy for him.
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:35.600]   So if this is your second home run, it's legacy is what's important, not the amount
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:36.600]   of money you make.
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:37.600]   So he's not going to.
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:40.040]   If it's the first time I'd say like, sell immediately.
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:46.080]   You know, like Zuckerberg's crazy for not selling Microsoft, you know, according to, you
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:50.960]   know, information I have like offer close to 10 million dollars for that 10 billion dollars
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:51.960]   for that company.
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:56.480]   They invested a 15 billion, but they wanted to buy it in the high billions, like seven,
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:58.680]   eight, nine billion from what I heard from VC.
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:00.400]   Should Mark have sold it at that price?
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:01.400]   Absolutely.
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:02.400]   Absolutely.
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:03.400]   But you know what?
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:04.400]   He's another one is Kooky.
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:08.120]   You know, he thinks he's the next Bill Gates and he doesn't want to do anything but build
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:09.720]   a hundred billion dollar company.
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:10.720]   Right.
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:13.960]   But this very foolish when you're 24 years old to think like that in my mind because you
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:17.640]   don't have a chance to exit the number of people in the world who had a chance to exit
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:23.080]   above a billion dollar, you know, it's like 10 people or 100 people, whatever it is.
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:29.280]   So anyway, the three, the things that Microsoft that Mike Space should do is number one, I
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:34.400]   think mobile is the future of social networking in Japan and so 90% of social networking at
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:36.440]   cars on your phone, Twitter isn't a good example of that.
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:43.280]   So I would just go absolutely crazy making a G1 application, Android application, iPhone
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:49.080]   applications, mobile applications, mobile's and just try to win mobile and crush and like
[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:54.760]   maybe buy that looped stuff or copy it immediately and really start to get into mobile social
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:56.040]   networking and mobile asset.
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:57.800]   There's still an opportunity there, you think?
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:00.320]   It's not absolutely in Tokyo.
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:01.640]   I was with Tyler.
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:02.640]   We're sitting on a train.
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:04.640]   We got five people on each bench next to us.
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:08.600]   Eight out of ten had their phones out and eight out of eight were doing something on a
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:13.240]   social network or seven of eight were doing something socially, you know, game or whatever
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:15.800]   or email or that kind of stuff.
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:20.040]   And that leads to the second name which is casual games make a lot of money, a lot of
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:23.000]   money and just take a lot of time.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.840]   And who do you play games with?
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:26.000]   You play games with your friends.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.800]   So it's a very natural fit and companies like Zanga and Rock, you are crushing it.
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:33.480]   So I'd buy one of those companies or build a bunch of applications and just have tons
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:35.840]   of gaming inside of my space.
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:36.840]   That's an overhanger.
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:39.920]   And then I would build some sort of a virtual currency inside of it and try to make my
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:42.440]   way because that's how social networks make money.
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:44.480]   We're starting to lose your connection, Jason.
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:46.120]   I'm not sure what's going on.
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:47.280]   But the gist is there.
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:51.400]   And I think to read more, subscribe.
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:52.400]   What is it?
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.400]   Tinyurl.com/jason's list?
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:55.400]   Yeah.
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:56.400]   Yeah.
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:57.400]   I think it's a tinyurlurl.com/jason's list.
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:00.240]   I think it's very interesting though that there's still room in this mobile space and
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:03.720]   yet you feel, and I think actually I have to agree with you now that you articulated
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:04.880]   it that way.
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:08.120]   That Twitter is the dial tone for the 21st century.
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:10.120]   It's kind of an amazing thought.
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:14.360]   Well, now others have said, Dave Weiner said, oh no, there'll be a thousand Twitters in
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:15.960]   a few years.
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:18.360]   He feels like every media company is going to create their own Twitter.
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:19.360]   You don't think so?
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:22.760]   It was just a thousand search engines, like two matter.
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:23.760]   Right.
[01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:26.760]   Isn't there literally a million social networks with Ning now?
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:28.600]   Didn't they hit one million?
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:29.840]   Like literally there's one million.
[01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:30.840]   That's amazing.
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:31.840]   My space is out there.
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:32.840]   Yeah.
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:33.840]   Yeah, right.
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:35.480]   But none of them, I guess I don't know, they're good.
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:40.480]   For example, my friends run the website spill.com, which is very targeted, very specific, and
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:46.440]   they have a very passionate base, but there's no chance their website is going to threaten
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:48.560]   Facebook or MySpace anytime soon.
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:52.200]   Likewise, I don't think Twitter's going to go away so much as you may have micro-Tewitters
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:55.760]   the way Ning has created these micro MySpaces.
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:57.760]   Right.
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:01.240]   Very interesting.
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:03.720]   I can hear the dinner bell ringing upstairs.
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:08.200]   That made you hungry, huh, Patrick?
[01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:11.720]   Well, it just means I'm going to see my child before he goes to sleep.
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:12.720]   You go, boy.
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:20.080]   It's great to talk to you, Patrick Norton is the host of Tekzilla, T-E-K-Z-I-L-L-A.com.
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:23.440]   And next time you come up and you join us in here in the studio, it'll be great to see.
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:24.440]   I will.
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:25.440]   Yeah.
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:26.440]   Thank you, Patrick.
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:27.440]   Good to talk to everybody.
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:32.600]   Nice and calicatus is Mr. Mahalo, M-A-H-A-L-O.com.
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:35.520]   That's the place to go for Mahalo.
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:37.640]   Yes, sir.
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:42.160]   And you're doing a new podcast called This Week in Start-Up.
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:43.160]   Start-Up.
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:44.160]   Start-Up Friday.
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:45.920]   Thank you for letting me use the name.
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:46.920]   You're very gracious about that.
[01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:49.360]   I know you don't own it, but I did ask permission.
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:51.440]   Everybody should know that.
[01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:52.440]   That's quite all right with me.
[01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:53.440]   Yeah.
[01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:54.440]   I'm glad you do it.
[01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:59.280]   And Kevin Pollock's show is now at 5 o'clock Pacific in Yim Eastern.
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:01.960]   Every Sunday on Ustream, is that where he's doing it?
[01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:02.960]   I think right now it's stick-in.
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:03.960]   Stick-in.
[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:04.960]   That's right.
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:08.920]   Trying to get a sponsor and trying to get one of these guys to support it.
[01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:09.920]   And yeah.
[01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:11.160]   So that's out of your studio?
[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:12.480]   Yeah, we have a studio here.
[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:14.520]   We basically modeled it after yours.
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:18.080]   And if you ever want to use it or anybody wants to use a studio, they could just email
[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:19.560]   me, Jason@mahalo.com.
[01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:20.560]   We have a Tri-caster.
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:24.520]   Sort of the idea is to let people use the studio to make shows and they give us a plug
[01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:26.480]   and that's it.
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:27.680]   And when's your show now?
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:28.680]   A week from Friday?
[01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:34.480]   It's going to be this Friday, this Friday, 1 p.m. and my guest is going to be Brian Alvey,
[01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:39.400]   who was my partner on WebLogz Inc. and who's doing a new company called CrowdFusion, which
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:42.960]   is like a crazy, crazy blog publishing system.
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:47.400]   So it's basically going to be a little intro from me, an interview with a guest, and then
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:50.200]   some news in startup companies specifically.
[01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:53.000]   So now like Tech News, like, so we're going to talk about the iPhone, but we will talk
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:57.760]   about here's a company, how they raised money, how they built their product.
[01:30:57.760 --> 01:30:59.280]   So it's a little different than Twitter, I think.
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:00.640]   No, it sounds great.
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:04.760]   And of course, it's one o'clock and you'll be doing that on StickAm as well.
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:06.280]   Well, I think it's StickAm yet.
[01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:08.880]   This week in startups.com, it's not designed yet.
[01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:09.880]   We're designing a logo this week.
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:12.040]   And we're just going to throw it together and see how it goes.
[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:13.040]   It's very exciting.
[01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:14.960]   Very casual, yeah.
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:16.760]   And yeah, thanks for having me on.
[01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:18.200]   Oh, it's a pleasure.
[01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:19.200]   Love having you on.
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:20.200]   Love having Audible.
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:21.200]   Audible loves you, yes.
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:22.200]   We do.
[01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:23.200]   I love having you.
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:24.520]   I actually registered this week in Audible.com.
[01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:25.520]   So you're watching Audible.
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:26.520]   You wasted no time.
[01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:27.520]   Leo and I are going to produce your show for you.
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:28.520]   We've talked about it, actually.
[01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:29.520]   We should do it.
[01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:30.520]   Let's give them a show.
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:31.520]   So we can all talk about it.
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:39.960]   Next time come up and we'll have some great wine from Gary's Wine.
[01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:42.280]   I like a little port, if that's possible.
[01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:43.280]   We can do a port.
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:45.040]   We do a port and a dessert wine.
[01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:47.240]   I like the honey sweetness kind of thing.
[01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:50.080]   Oh, you're a fan of the stickies.
[01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:54.440]   I like the sticky honey and the...
[01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:55.440]   Tiki's going...
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:56.440]   Blisious.
[01:31:56.440 --> 01:31:57.440]   I like the port.
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:58.600]   I'm drinking port.
[01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:02.840]   My wife says I drink a glass of red wine every night because I'm high strong.
[01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:03.840]   Port's good.
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:04.840]   Anxiety and stress.
[01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:05.840]   And...
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:06.840]   Port's good.
[01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:07.840]   I'll tell you what.
[01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:08.840]   Tell you what, you come up here and we'll have port and cigars.
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:09.840]   How about that?
[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:11.240]   Oh, I'll bring some Cubans.
[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:12.240]   Or I should say...
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:13.240]   And they're cigars.
[01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:16.240]   Bring the Cubans and they're cigars.
[01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:18.120]   Don't put the wine for us.
[01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:20.040]   No, I'll bring some Cubans.
[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:22.280]   Not Cubans, but they are very similar.
[01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:23.280]   Yeah.
[01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:25.720]   From the Dominican Republic, but Cuban seeds.
[01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:26.720]   Yeah.
[01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:28.560]   Bring some Cubans.
[01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:29.560]   Thank you, Jason.
[01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:30.560]   A pleasure.
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:31.560]   Take care.
[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:32.560]   Catherine Hall is a photographer.
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:35.920]   One of the best I've ever had the pleasure of working with.
[01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:42.280]   She is just brilliant and you can find her stuff on her website, www.cathrinhall.net.
[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:44.440]   And it's great having you in studio today.
[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:47.440]   Catherine was here for the radio show and we just said, "Stick around for a twit."
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:49.320]   And gave her some wine.
[01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:50.320]   He couldn't get rid of me.
[01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:51.320]   That's a pleasure.
[01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:52.960]   Really nice to have you in.
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:56.440]   Also want to thank Brian Brushwood of Scamschool fame.
[01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:59.240]   Yeah, we got to get you outside of here to a bar.
[01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:00.600]   Do some teach you some scams.
[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:02.240]   All right, I'd love to do that.
[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:03.240]   That'd be fun.
[01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:05.680]   The old quarter through the bar trick or something like that.
[01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:06.800]   Be really fun.
[01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:09.320]   And schwood.com is the website.
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:10.320]   SHWOD.com.
[01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:11.320]   No C and Schwood.
[01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:13.760]   You know, I should have done everybody's Twitter handle.
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:14.760]   @shwood.
[01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:16.480]   Your is @shwood.
[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:17.480]   Yeah.
[01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:19.280]   Catherine is @cathrin_hall.
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:20.280]   K or C?
[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:21.280]   C.
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:22.280]   Like Catherine the Great.
[01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:23.280]   Right.
[01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:24.280]   She is Catherine the Great.
[01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:25.280]   There you go.
[01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:26.280]   Kiki is Dr. Kiki.
[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:27.280]   I am.
[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:28.280]   DRKIKI.
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:29.280]   D-R-K-I.
[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:30.280]   D-R-K-I.
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:31.280]   I like it.
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:32.280]   D-R-Kiki.
[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:33.280]   D-R-Kiki.
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:34.280]   Okay.
[01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:35.280]   Hi, Dr. Kiki.
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:38.280]   And she's also at kirstensanford.com.
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:39.280]   I am.
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:43.720]   And the host of This Week in Science and our newest host on This Week in Tech.
[01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:49.240]   On the Twit Network, we're going to do a science show starting live on Twit TV, which
[01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:55.000]   would be live.twit.tv every Thursday at 6 p.m. Eastern, 3 p.m. Pacific, which is 2000
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.000]   UTC.
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.120]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time anywhere except in her husband, Marshall's
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:02.120]   ear, the name of the show.
[01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:03.640]   It's so exciting.
[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:05.200]   Dr. Kiki's Science Hour.
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:06.200]   There you go.
[01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:07.200]   The point.
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:08.800]   Well, with Lee Alapore, you can leave that part out.
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:09.800]   I don't like him anyway.
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:10.800]   That's good.
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:13.160]   Dr. Kiki's Science Hour will make it stay on you on Thursday.
[01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:14.160]   I love that.
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:15.160]   Yeah.
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:17.400]   I came up with all sorts of different names.
[01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:18.400]   I had this idea.
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:23.040]   I'll keep science out of it because I want to talk about just the way that everything
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:25.560]   is science and it's just a way of looking at the world.
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:28.560]   But I was like, "Yeah, no, this is just really... people get it.
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:30.400]   You want to describe what the show is about."
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:31.400]   Yes, I agree.
[01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:32.800]   It's an hour of science once a week.
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:33.800]   Couldn't be better.
[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:38.040]   And we'll be talking about, I think, bird flu, or rather swine flu this week, yeah?
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:39.040]   Yeah.
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:40.040]   Among other things.
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:41.040]   I'm actually...
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:42.040]   I don't know what...
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:43.040]   I have a friend who's an epidemiologist.
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:44.040]   I'm very fabulous.
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:46.640]   I was thinking that we could kind of temper that.
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:50.400]   Also, we could get an epidemiologist, maybe someone from the CDC or your friend.
[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:51.720]   My friend Bill Keene, who I went...
[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:55.600]   He was my college roommate, is the director of Public Health for the State of Oregon.
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:35:00.760]   He's a master's in Public Health, an expert on parasitic diseases.
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:04.640]   I'm sure he's got a little swine flu.
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:11.680]   When the big tomato problem with the tomatoes and the E. coli, he was interviewed everywhere.
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:13.360]   I saw him on CNN and everywhere.
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:15.920]   So he's very active in this, a real expert in Public Health.
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:16.920]   He'll have a lot to say.
[01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:21.680]   I think he gets excited when the old good, another disease.
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:23.520]   Let me tell you something.
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:24.520]   Let me tell you something.
[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:27.280]   I had Thanksgiving with him once.
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:31.640]   And he started by saying, "Do you know how many bacterial infections you can get from
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:32.760]   a turkey?"
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:34.000]   You might know this as a bird.
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.280]   Some vanilla is the worst.
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:36.280]   It's the worst.
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:40.280]   I got a little nervous when he started handling the turkey with a rubber glove after it was
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:41.280]   cooked.
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:43.880]   He said, "These things are deadly."
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:45.880]   You could kill you in so many ways.
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:49.080]   But I enjoy your turkey.
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:52.440]   So he, Bill King, we'll see if we can get him on Thursday.
[01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:53.920]   It'd be great to get him on.
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:59.160]   I was thinking also to add a little level of the fun and where it could potentially go.
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:03.920]   Scott Sigler has written a one in his book, his trilogy is working on, a real recent one
[01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:05.200]   contagious that came out.
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:07.360]   It's all about, I mean, it'd be really fun to get him on.
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:08.360]   Oh, this is going to be fun.
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:11.240]   I think I'm going to try and get in touch with him and see if he'll be able to do it.
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:12.560]   So, Scott, if you're out there.
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:15.480]   And one thing we're going to really try to do on this show is take calls.
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:17.200]   So we'll be using talk shoe for that.
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:20.800]   And so if you don't have a talk shoe account, you might want to find out about it.
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:22.440]   T-A-L-K-S-H-O-E.com.
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:25.400]   And we will be taking calls at the end, toward the end of the show.
[01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:27.400]   So we'll talk, do about 40 minutes, and then we'll take some calls.
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:32.720]   Yeah, we'll probably do a lead-in background, then the discussion with everyone who's either
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:39.600]   here or calling in virtually and then get everybody else to be involved in the show.
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:45.320]   I think one of the big aspects of this that I'm excited about for this show is being able
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:48.040]   to incorporate everybody's questions.
[01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:51.280]   Because, I mean, like we said, science is a way of looking at the world.
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:53.920]   Everybody is affected by how the world works.
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:54.920]   We're a part of it.
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:56.960]   And so, you know, let's all be involved.
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:57.960]   I'm excited.
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:36:58.960]   That's great.
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:00.800]   I've wanted to do a show about science for a long time.
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:02.400]   I can't think of anybody better to do it with.
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:06.000]   And you're going to follow Maxwell's house, which is a show about getting deep into a
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.000]   single subject.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:11.080]   And so it's going to be a perfect -- my idea of a well spent Thursday afternoon.
[01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:14.000]   Two hours of mad brainyness.
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000]   Brain expansion.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000]   So thank you.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.160]   So great to have you.
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:20.360]   A reminder, we've got a Twi -- pics page.
[01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:23.040]   We invite you to visit twit.tv/picks.
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:28.680]   I noticed Colleen picked the Android G1 phone yesterday.
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:32.240]   She says, "Warning, not intended for use by Apple fanboys."
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:33.720]   That's why we love Colleen.
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:37.480]   Also a reminder that our wine today and every week is brought to you by Gary's Wine at
[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:38.480]   garyswine.com.
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:43.720]   We had a delicious scab today that we all agreed was A plus, the Innisfree.
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:44.720]   Cabernet Sauvignon.
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:48.160]   You'll find that at garyswine.com/twitlive.
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:50.040]   I thank you all for being here.

[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:52.320]   We'll see you again next week.
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:53.320]   I hope another Twi --
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:54.320]   This is amazing.
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:38:01.320]   Is it okay?
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:08.320]   Yeah.
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:10.900]   (upbeat music)
