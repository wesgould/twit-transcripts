[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   I know it's the superb owl game going on in many parts of the world, but here in the

[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.000]   Sitting right next to me, the world famous Liberty Madison.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.440]   Sounds like a furniture brand, but it's actually a person.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.960]   No, it's great to see you again.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.960]   Welcome back.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.960]   That's your real name.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.160]   Yes, thank you so much for having me again.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.160]   I appreciate it.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.760]   And you know, I love you to death for being here on Super Bowl Sunday.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.760]   But I see you brought snacks so everybody's happy.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.760]   I did.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.760]   I kind of wanted the essence so everybody can feel like they're at Super Bowl Sunday.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.760]   In our chat room, they call it the superb owl game.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.760]   Really?
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.760]   Tell me more.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.760]   The superb owl.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.760]   Well, just spread the syllables differently.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.760]   It's like you calling it Pinterest.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.760]   Oh, now you have to tell her, I call it Pinterest.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.760]   And you call it P-Rest.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.760]   P-Interest.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.760]   P-Interest.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.760]   And I call him P-Ed, Philip Elmer Dewitt.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.160]   Now, Philip, you have a new gig.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.160]   Not quite.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.880]   I'm close to having a new gig.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.880]   So we won't say anything.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.240]   No, no, we can talk about it because I'd love to talk about the business model that I'm
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.240]   using and why.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.080]   Oh, I love to hear about that.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.400]   I'm always interested in business models.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.560]   Not having one, I find them fascinating.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.320]   You use advertising.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.320]   Yeah.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.520]   We're ad supported free media.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.520]   Right.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.040]   I'm going to be ad free.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.040]   I'm going to be ad free supported media, one hopes.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.040]   Yes.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.040]   Philip, formally at Fortune.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.040]   And--
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.040]   Still at Fortune for a few more weeks.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.040]   OK.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.440]   And one of the grand-- I know I hate to say old men, but I'm an old man so we can say it.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.240]   Grand old men of tech journalism.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.720]   And one of the best.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.720]   Also here.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.120]   Love to have her from imore.com.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.120]   Georgia Dow.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.120]   Viomorrel.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.120]   Hi.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.120]   Diomorrel.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.120]   Diomorrel.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.120]   Diomorrel.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.680]   And she borrowed Misshoo.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.680]   Johnny Ives set today.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.680]   She's in the world.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.680]   The background, the white room.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.680]   The white room.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.680]   I think if you could--
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.680]   I think if you could.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.680]   If Johnny Ives had a French accent.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.680]   Is this the funniest I've had ever made?
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.680]   How many accents can you do?
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.680]   No, it's probably sell more phones.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.680]   That would be awesome.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.680]   It would, wouldn't it?
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.680]   I think so.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.680]   So Johnny Ives.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.680]   Or he could be this iPhone as made with fine, corinthian leather.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.680]   Yes.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.680]   Yes.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.680]   Can you do Russian?
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.360]   Of course I can do Russian.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.680]   But we have no studu.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.680]   Musan squirt.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.680]   Yeah, I always want to say musan squirtle when I do por is bad enough.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.680]   Musan squirtle.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.360]   It is Super Bowl Sunday.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.600]   So we're starting the show a little early.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.240]   If you're just joining us, I apologize.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.120]   I hope I made that clear last week that we were going to start early because we want to
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.120]   get everybody out of here before kickoff, which may not happen because that's only an
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.880]   hour off.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.800]   But there's so much stuff to talk about.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:21.240]   And I really want to talk about it starting with I think Twitter because there was a big
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.240]   kerfuffle and you're all social media mavens, you especially liberty.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:34.000]   I think you represent the kind of the young millennial generation and how they use social
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.640]   media is among your buddies and friends and your group.
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.360]   Is Twitter widely used?
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.160]   I would definitely say so.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.200]   But without a doubt, Twitter, there's some impression that Twitter is more.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.920]   Yeah, I do, but it more influential among the tech literati, the tech, the rati, than
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.920]   it is among the general population.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.040]   I could possibly see that because people ask me.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.040]   It's really interesting.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.760]   How do I have so many Twitter followers?
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.640]   I'll tell you my secret right here right now.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.400]   I personally signed them up.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.800]   You get your friends and your family.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.800]   You say come over here.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.320]   No, no, no, no, no, not friends and family strangers.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.320]   People off the street.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.480]   So you're an evangelist.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.000]   You know what Twitter doesn't know that until now.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.120]   So Twitter, if you're listening, I can turn this ship around for you and get you some more
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.120]   users.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.080]   So feel free to tweet me and we can make the film up.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.080]   Are you a Twitter user?
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.080]   I do.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.080]   I love Twitter.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.360]   Yeah, because you can, you know, if you want to find out what people are saying about any
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.760]   particular topic, you type it in and there it is.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.760]   I like the live aspect of it, right?
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.760]   Philip.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.760]   And Georgia, you're a Twitter.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.080]   I would guess you're a Twitter user as well.
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.520]   I use Twitter, but I use Twitter and spurts.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.960]   Like I stay away from Twitter for as long as possible.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.040]   And then like in eight hours, I'll like take a look at Twitter and then I'll respond to
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.560]   like 30 people and then I'll be gone for three hours.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.960]   So I like Twitter spam people.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.600]   And then most of my like Twitter stuff is strange or funny.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.520]   And I use it for work, but I probably would stay away from most social media if I could.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.520]   Unfortunately, with my job, I'm somewhat forced to.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.160]   So I use Twitter because it's short, sweet.
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.160]   It's done.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.160]   Agreed, Georgia.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:16.320]   So last week we talked about Twitter as well because of Joshua Topolsky, formerly of Engadget
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.760]   who wrote an article in The New Yorker that Twitter was dying.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.920]   And then this week, the New Republic, a response from Nevnite Alang who says, "You can't kill
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.400]   Twitter even if it dies."
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.960]   And I think this is an important point that he makes.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.680]   And he says, "Twitter is still the best answer to the question.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.240]   What is happening in the world right now?"
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.240]   Absolutely.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.240]   Absolutely.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:45.360]   And then watch TV, Netflix, or literally make a decision without Twitter.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.520]   He says, "It's not that there's something inherently great about the product Twitter,
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.560]   but the company pioneered a new cultural form which now has its place in our society.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.040]   And even if there weren't a Twitter, we would have to have something like it.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:04.440]   There was the dial tone of the internet or the ticker, the news ticker of the internet."
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:09.240]   You'd think that CNN would tell you what's happening now.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:16.280]   It's so bad that you do better just dipping your net into Twitter and see what's swing
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.280]   by.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.280]   Well, it's true.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.160]   You might have watched the Republican debates, for instance, yesterday on ABC, but much more
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.800]   likely, at least among our crowd.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.240]   And that's why I partly asked you that question, Liberty.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.560]   You would also have Twitter fired up.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.600]   And if possible, Tweet Deck or something that would let you watch multiple screams strolling
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.600]   by.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.240]   One reason our point from the last show we did, when you're using Twitter and focusing on
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.680]   conversations such as the debate, you want to circulate around a hashtag.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:46.280]   And that allows you the opportunity to connect with people directly who are talking about
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.400]   something live, talking about a topic, and using a particular hashtag.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.840]   So the reason it comes up this week is, of course, this continual, you know, Twitter
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.600]   stock continues to go down and puts it in play for a hostile takeover.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.840]   We found out right after the show last week, Jason Calicans was here and kind of hinted.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.960]   Yeah, there are people looking at it.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.840]   And I said, is it going to be a company like Google or Facebook or somebody who could take
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:14.360]   Twitter and integrate it into existing services or is it an investment company who wants to
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.680]   kind of turn Twitter around, make money?
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.680]   He said, both.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.240]   He said, I know for a fact, there is an investment company who's looking very hard at Twitter.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:26.040]   It turns out the next day we saw the news that Mark Andreessen had considered purchasing
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.040]   Twitter.
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.040]   And he's a big Twitter user.
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.360]   He loves the invented the Tweetstorm for all intents and purposes.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.920]   That did not happen, but it does feel like it's in play.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.640]   The business insider said that he and Silverlake partners thought about buying Twitter, but
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.840]   decline decided not to.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:51.200]   Twitter, meanwhile, has admitted that, well, at first Buzzfeed News said, is going to this
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.960]   week announce or to launch the algorithmic timeline.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.360]   Now Jack Dorsey responding said, yes, we are looking at it.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.720]   No, we're not going to do it right away.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.600]   What is the algorithmic timeline?
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.640]   Why are people so upset that Twitter might be doing this?
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.640]   What does it mean?
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.560]   Philip, can you talk about that?
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:16.240]   Well, it would mean that a computer would be rather than getting the stuff that people
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.920]   said on the topic you're interested in, in the order they said it.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.240]   There'd be a computer that would be making some decisions about what they think you would
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.240]   like.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.240]   Like Facebook.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.240]   Like Facebook.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.240]   Exactly.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.240]   They don't very well.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.520]   However, that is exactly why people go to Twitter.
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.520]   Because Twitter is in order.
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.520]   Because they don't want that.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.520]   Yeah.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:40.160]   So if you do that, it's kind of like, hey, I'm going to use the same algorithm as Facebook.
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.160]   It might as well be the same thing.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.760]   And people really appreciate that.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.880]   I think that what they're mistaking is they think that Facebook's popularity is because
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.120]   of their algorithm, whereas they're completely different ecosystems.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.920]   People go to Twitter because, you know, I've chosen the people that I'm going to follow.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:56.920]   It's short.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:57.920]   It's sweet.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.240]   It's a cool little bites of information that I can choose to.
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.400]   And it's kind of effortless.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.760]   And Facebook has a different population with a different group of people that have different
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.640]   needs and wants to it.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:12.920]   And in many ways, it's, you know, the techier people are probably on Twitter because it's
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.320]   just fast and effortless.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.880]   And that's what people want for it.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:21.400]   So changing something that we're comfortable with is probably not the best of choices for
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:25.960]   Twitter to make because it makes people a little bit more upset than happy because they
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:26.960]   already like what they're using.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.560]   Yeah, I've heard people say, oh, you just don't know what's good for you.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.400]   Face nobody ever wanted Facebook.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.720]   Everybody criticizes Facebook for parsing its feed, massaging its feed.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:42.000]   And nevertheless, it continues to grow and grow and grow by doing so.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.560]   And the folks at Twitter may be having the same thought.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:49.760]   Look, because they're getting a huge storm of protest against this idea of an algorithmic
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.880]   feed, but they may be saying, you just be patient.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.940]   In fact, an engineer who was working on it, who was no longer at Twitter said, be patient
[00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:58.760]   because you will like it.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.360]   Now I, Twitter's been doing something similar for a while while you were away.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.360]   Do you guys get the wall you're away?
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.360]   Yes.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.840]   So I just, I went to my Twitter page and it says while you were away, these are tweets
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:09.840]   from people.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.360]   I'm not sure how this is algorithmic.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.280]   Somehow they're choosing people that I care about stuff that I might have missed.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.920]   And then I could see what's, by the way, I'm glad that they include Megan Maroney, my
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:25.600]   colleague here at Twit, the wire cutter, a blog I pay a lot of attention to, and Tommy
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.460]   Chong of Cheech and Chong.
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:32.260]   So those are the big three, those are the big three.
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.180]   You may laugh, but Tommy thinks I'm cool.
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.700]   He actually, he said Leo's cool.
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.500]   Don't know if he's saying that.
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:38.500]   It's cheap.
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.500]   I'll take it.
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.220]   And then I could say the new tweets by clicking that.
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.180]   So they're saying this is not so very different from what we're already doing.
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:47.380]   And you may think you want a chronological feed.
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:52.020]   You may pay lip service to that, but you don't.
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.500]   Ben Thompson made an interesting distinction.
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:13:00.820]   He said Facebook was built on an existing network, your network of friends.
[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:07.440]   Whereas Twitter was based on a network of strangers interested in a particular topic.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.780]   You end up tuning it.
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:13.060]   You have to tune it to make it useful for yourself so that you know who to follow and
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:19.220]   you get that tight list of people who are plugged into what you want to know about.
[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:24.700]   But it's different than Facebook.
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:29.260]   In that Facebook, it's instantly useful because you find out what your friends are doing.
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.340]   Twitter takes that learning.
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:36.500]   It's got a steep learning curve.
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:43.460]   That's the problem they're trying to solve is that if you don't know Twitter, if you sign
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:47.340]   up somebody, Liberty, and they go there, they go, what the hell is this?
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.660]   What am I seeing?
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:50.660]   What is the...
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:55.260]   Because it's a culture and a language all of its own with the hashtags and the 140 characters.
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:14:00.300]   And I think Jack Dorsey, the new CEO, has also said we're going to expand from 140 to
[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.300]   10,000 characters.
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.060]   That's also a response to that.
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.060]   So the idea is...
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.980]   But as he describes these changes, it sounds more and more like Facebook, right?
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.980]   I think they're just reaching for straws at this point.
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.540]   At this point, they're just trying to see what can we do to acquire users.
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:18.300]   And I think having the 140 characters is indigenous to Twitter and should stick.
[00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.260]   I think that should stick.
[00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:21.260]   And they should...
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.340]   I agree with you on that.
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:23.340]   We should give them the opportunity.
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:24.340]   I don't want to see essays.
[00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:25.340]   I don't want to see that.
[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:26.340]   That's medium.
[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.340]   I don't.
[00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:28.340]   That's why I go to the Twitter platform.
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.340]   Right.
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.340]   So that I can stick to that.
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.380]   Like Georgia mentioned, it's short and sweet and that's what we want.
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:36.220]   But I think we should definitely give the algorithm a chance because me personally, I wanted
[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:41.020]   to start a campaign over at change.org when they changed the UX UI for Facebook.
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:42.740]   You guys remember that a couple of years ago?
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:46.340]   I was upset and really, I was ready to march in the street.
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.740]   Yeah, but now you're fine.
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:48.740]   And now I'm fine.
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:49.740]   I'm completely fine.
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:50.740]   I think that's the point.
[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:51.740]   And with one in any other way.
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:52.740]   I think that's the point.
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:53.740]   I will hate change.
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:54.740]   Exactly.
[00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.540]   So I want to give them the opportunity to really show us what they can do because like you
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.540]   said, we may enjoy it a bit more.
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:00.540]   We don't know what we want.
[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.540]   We don't know.
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.060]   And we can turn it off.
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:07.740]   That's what Jackson, that is actually important, that you will have the option to watch a crime.
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:11.840]   Just as you do, by the way, on Facebook, you can look at a chronological feed.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.340]   And Facebook switches it back after a while, right?
[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.340]   You switch it.
[00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:16.340]   I noticed this because I--
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:17.340]   There's a lot of things.
[00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.940]   They turn it off again.
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.540]   I don't know whether Twitter will do that or not.
[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:25.540]   I think that Twitter's biggest issue is not going to be the algorithm to their newsfeed.
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:26.940]   It's going to be signing up new members.
[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.840]   And how do they find other people that they would enjoy in their circles?
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:34.280]   I think that that's one of the biggest issues that Twitter has because whenever I sign up
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:38.720]   someone that's new, that doesn't know how to use Twitter, it's like, well, now how do
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.540]   I find people?
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.400]   And with Facebook, that's so much easier.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.180]   And so I think that it's really hard to find what, you know, like you search for me, you're
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.200]   not going to find my name because I have to use an underscore.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.360]   And so that makes it really difficult for people.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.600]   And, you know, I think that that's one of the things that Twitter is going to have to
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.600]   work on as well.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:00.160]   There's no question, though, that the modern era when you talk about technology is very
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.600]   much defined by Twitter and Facebook.
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.600]   Those are very--
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.600]   Definitely.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.440]   Those are a lot of what makes modern life, modern life.
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.440]   Definitely.
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.060]   What I really enjoyed it, Jim said it earlier, is that people go to the platforms for two
[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.060]   different reasons.
[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:18.700]   And for me personally, that's one reason that I love Twitter is you can meet new people.
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.980]   And on Facebook, that typically isn't the interaction.
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.820]   It's literally a place for friends.
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.700]   So did you meet any new people at the Super Bowl party?
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.700]   Because that looked pretty cool.
[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:28.700]   I'm sorry.
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:29.700]   I'm sorry.
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:33.020]   I'm just distracted by the fact that I'm sitting next to a superstar.
[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:37.780]   I invited you to the parties, but you were over at Twitch filming awesome content.
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:41.880]   My people didn't tell me about that.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:46.060]   Twitter does say that they have banned, I think it was, 175, or 125,000 accounts for
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:49.160]   terrorist-like activity.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:53.480]   Promise you-- and Twitter knows this, but apparently the journalists who repeated that
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.120]   story don't.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.000]   So they made a new account.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.600]   So they kill 175,000 accounts, and 175,000 new ones were created.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.600]   It's impossible.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.600]   How do you stop it?
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.600]   How do you stop it, Leo?
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:05.600]   What do you--
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.600]   You can't.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:11.460]   The fundamental charms and flaws of Twitter is that they don't use a real name's policy.
[00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:12.460]   So you can do anything.
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.660]   They're just happy their numbers start growing.
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:14.660]   Yeah.
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.660]   That's why they did it.
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:16.660]   Look at the growth.
[00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:17.660]   Look at the growth.
[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:18.660]   Look at the growth.
[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:19.660]   That's amazing.
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.460]   We had a big day yesterday.
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:31.220]   Twitter is really much more like the original internet and use net and the chaotic anything
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:32.220]   goes.
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:33.220]   Exactly.
[00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.220]   World of the internet.
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.780]   And we loved it, didn't we?
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:36.780]   Yeah.
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.060]   I missed the well.
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.380]   But that's what happened to the well, by the way.
[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.620]   The well was this amazing cultivated discussion group.
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.020]   The whole Earth electronic link.
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:52.520]   It was based at Sausoleto and a lot of the Bay Area's most technically literate interesting
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:53.820]   people were on there.
[00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.100]   And then it descended as used net did into flame wars.
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.540]   You were probably PED in the well.
[00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.620]   That's probably where you got that in that handle, right?
[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.620]   Yeah.
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:04.140]   But the great thing about the well is that there was no anonymity.
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.980]   It's one of the things I want to do with my site.
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:10.300]   You log on with your real name and you own your words.
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.500]   I want to hear about this.
[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:12.500]   Mm hmm.
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:13.500]   Yeah.
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:14.500]   We're going to take a break.
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:15.500]   We come back.
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:16.500]   I'm also going to talk about the debut.
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.500]   Very exciting.
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.500]   The brand new debut of the Amazon Echo.
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:20.940]   Oh, wow.
[00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.940]   Because of course the Echo has been out for a long time.
[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.660]   We all in the tech community love it.
[00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:31.460]   But get ready because this afternoon on the Super Bowl, Amazon's first Echo ads.
[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:33.740]   And I think that the onslaught is about to begin.
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:34.740]   It clearly is.
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:35.740]   They're pretty good.
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:36.740]   They're pretty good.
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:37.740]   Yeah, with Alec Baldwin, right?
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:38.740]   Yeah.
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:39.740]   Yeah.
[00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:40.740]   I mean, you know what?
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:41.740]   I haven't.
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:42.740]   Don't tell you.
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:43.740]   No spoilers.
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:44.740]   Okay.
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:45.740]   You know, some people don't want to hear anything about Star Wars before it came out.
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.380]   I don't want to hear anything about Super Bowl commercials.
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.380]   I'm teavowing it.
[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:52.180]   I don't care about the score, but please don't.
[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:53.980]   No spoilers for the Super Bowl commercials.
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:58.300]   No, I'm actually a, I'm a huge Echo fan.
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:03.500]   And it's clear because these ads are five million bucks for 30 seconds this year.
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:08.060]   That's up something like 67% from a few years ago.
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:13.660]   And so when it comes, it says statement when a company buys Super Bowl ads, it's a statement.
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:17.860]   One of the reasons they buy Super Bowl ads is to say we got the money and we're committed.
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:18.860]   It says we came to win.
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.460]   We came to play and we came to win.
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.460]   Exactly.
[00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.460]   We came to play.
[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:23.460]   We came to win.
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:24.460]   And I think so.
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.660]   I think Amazon buying ads for the Echo is a statement.
[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.780]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.820]   Georgia Dazz here from iMore.com.
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.460]   Philip Elmer DeWitt from Fortune.com.
[00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:38.340]   Liberty Madison from Liberty Madison.com.
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:42.180]   And I'm Leo LaPorte from Leo LaPorte, not anything else.
[00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.140]   I don't have Leo LaPorte.com.
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.140]   You don't.
[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.380]   I should get it.
[00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:48.020]   Somebody else has it.
[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.020]   Do I?
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.020]   No, I don't.
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:54.100]   Our show today brought to you by Wealthfront.com.
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.860]   You know, we're all saving for the future.
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:56.860]   I hope, right?
[00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:59.260]   You're putting money aside, at least for your retirement.
[00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:03.580]   If you've got kids for the college, fun, maybe you're saving for a down payment.
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.580]   You should have long-term investments, long-term savings.
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:12.140]   And the reason I say investments is probably not best to put it in a bank.
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:13.900]   Savings accounts make almost nothing.
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.940]   You'd be better off putting it in the mattress, frankly.
[00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:18.620]   You got to invest it.
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.140]   Problem is the investment is, well, you kind of have two choices.
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:25.420]   Either you're going to take the time to learn about investing, to do it right, and to more
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:31.100]   importantly, pay attention to your investments, log in frequently, check how it's doing,
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.260]   rebalance, or you're going to pay somebody to do that.
[00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.780]   And when I say pay, I mean pay.
[00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:40.440]   Traditional investment advisors, they will charge you 1 to 3% of what you have under
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.860]   investment per year.
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:48.580]   That means you have to make 1 to 3% more every year just to break even.
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:49.820]   I got a better way.
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:56.900]   Better advice, full-time maintenance of your account, constantly rebalancing it, paying
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:58.060]   attention to it.
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.140]   It's wealth front.
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.020]   Now, wealth front doesn't charge 1, 2, or 3%.
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.420]   They charge 1/4 of 1% a year.
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:06.420]   There are no hidden fees, no transaction costs.
[00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:07.820]   That's it.
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.940]   And they're what they're-- it's software.
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:17.820]   And they're basing the software on the really brilliant insights of their advisory board.
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:23.620]   200 years combined investment experience, people like Burton Malkeil who wrote the book,
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:27.900]   the random walkdown Wall Street, and Charles D. Ellis, the king of investment advisors,
[00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:31.140]   they took their brains and they put them in this software.
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:35.740]   And the thing is because it's software, it constantly monitors your account, is constantly
[00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:39.740]   managing it to optimize return after taxes.
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:40.740]   And this is key.
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.620]   They do tax-loss harvesting.
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:47.060]   You ask your investment advisor, are you doing tax-loss harvesting?
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:51.140]   It's fun to watch them pretend they understand what you just ask them.
[00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.260]   They have no idea.
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.140]   And no, they're not doing it.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.580]   Direct indexing, all sorts of sophisticated stuff.
[00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.940]   We've heard from many Twit fans now because we've been doing these ads for a while who've
[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.420]   gone to wealth front are very happy.
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:06.420]   And they say they love how they can diversify their portfolio.
[00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:11.460]   They can kind of feel like they're participating in the economy, buying stock in Apple and Amazon
[00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:12.460]   and Facebook.
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.220]   And they pay no commissions.
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.220]   It's transparent.
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:18.660]   You see what's happening at all times on your dashboard, on the desktop or on the mobile
[00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:19.660]   app.
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:23.180]   You could have, whether it's a personal account, a joint account, a retirement account, you
[00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:25.500]   know everything wealth front's doing on your behalf.
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.820]   And all of this for one quarter, one percent per year with no additional charges.
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:32.100]   Actually, I'm going to do even better for you.
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.340]   Now, it's $500 to start.
[00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:34.740]   I want you to go to the site, frankly.
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.740]   I want you to read up on this.
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:40.700]   Seriously, this is, it's important that you know what you're doing before you do it.
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:44.500]   But I think when you read up on it, you'll see why I'm so bullish on this.
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:49.420]   And when you go to wealthfront.com/twit, they can, they will actually generate a portfolio
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.140]   for you, the customized allocation they recommend for you.
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:54.660]   So you can see what they would be doing with your money.
[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:59.180]   And they base that on some questions they'll ask you, like your timeframe, how comfortable
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.340]   you are with risk, things like that.
[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:04.260]   That's free at wealthfront.com/twit.
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.300]   You can get started for as little as $500.
[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:10.700]   That's the minimum amount to open an account.
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:11.940]   And, and I love this.
[00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:19.460]   Your first $15,000 will be managed free of charge, not a quarter of 1%, nothing forever.
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.300]   So you read, this is a really great way to get a leg up.
[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:25.860]   Your first $15,000 managed for free.
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:28.860]   Wealthfront.com/twit.
[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:35.620]   This is a, this is technology put to one of the most important things in your life, your
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:36.620]   investments.
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:37.860]   Wealthfront.com/twit.
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.660]   I think this is really interesting.
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:41.660]   I haven't seen the yet.
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:42.660]   So are they good?
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:46.460]   Tell me how it's, I kind of have read some stuff.
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.980]   I haven't seen like Alec Baldwin's looking for a great idea or something.
[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:53.060]   How does it go?
[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:54.060]   You could talk to me, Phillip.
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:55.060]   I don't mind.
[00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:56.060]   I won't yell at you in this one.
[00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.060]   I'm trying to remember what he did.
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:04.340]   There's one where he wants the football shaped canapace on football shaped enough.
[00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:09.180]   Oh, you don't want any spoilers either?
[00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.180]   I don't want any spoilers.
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:12.180]   Okay.
[00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:13.180]   So hot dogs, the hot dogs are good.
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:14.260]   That's the best part of the game.
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:15.740]   I agree.
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:22.740]   There was a good article in, I think it was Quartz saying, get ready because this is when
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:29.180]   the world learns about what has been the best kept secret of the tech community.
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:33.780]   Amazon's Echo is a sleeper hit, right Stan Fromer, who I love.
[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:36.700]   And the rest of America is about to find out for it for the first time.
[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.340]   He points out something we've known for a long time.
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.900]   The people who have echoes are always talking about that.
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:43.420]   That's a good sign in tech.
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.300]   The people who have it going, oh, you have you tried the echo.
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:46.300]   It's so amazing.
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:47.780]   What do you like about it, Leo?
[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:48.780]   Tell us.
[00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:51.460]   It's not a fade to it.
[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:52.460]   Anything you want.
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:53.460]   You could tell it.
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.380]   What's interesting is Amazon keeps adding features.
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:59.980]   In fact, this is the biggest problem they face is complexity.
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:04.660]   So it's a black tube with a speaker and a ray mic so it can hear you anywhere in the
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:05.660]   room.
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.740]   So I don't really think I'm talking to the tube.
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.980]   I think I'm talking to the house, right?
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.300]   That's the first thing you want.
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.420]   Like how 9,000 you could talk actually how 9,000 didn't end so well.
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:17.260]   But you want to get me scared there.
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:21.900]   You don't want how 9,000, but you want to be able to actually every movie I was going
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:22.900]   to say what is it?
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.500]   Her the one with Scarlett.
[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:27.820]   Every movie with this kind of technology is adding badly, doesn't it?
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:28.820]   Artificial intelligence.
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:32.460]   Mother from Aliens wasn't too bad.
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:35.020]   I want to talk to my house and I wanted to respond.
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:37.620]   And that's what that's basically what the echo does.
[00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:41.140]   And it started when we first get it, you do timers and you have it read you your news.
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:42.900]   Now you can have it read you your audible book.
[00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.980]   Now you can ask it questions.
[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.300]   It'll do searches.
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.740]   You could say how old is the president.
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:52.260]   You can say, but you can also now they just added you can get a pizza from Domino's.
[00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:57.780]   They said, you could say, get me a car and an Uber will arrive.
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.420]   Spotify is tied into it as well as your Amazon music.
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:05.940]   Interesting for people that are concerned about someone always listening to them.
[00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:06.940]   Well, yes.
[00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:11.460]   And the only people who would like this are people who aren't worried about that.
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:19.380]   But I should point out that it's the case also with Siri and Google now that even though
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:23.380]   when they're always on, they're not they're not like sending it back to the home office
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:28.540]   everything you do only when you give it the activation phrase because these things aren't
[00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:30.140]   sophisticated enough to do that.
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:31.860]   They're just listening for a voice pattern.
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.340]   I think that's what they told you, Leo.
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:34.340]   I think it's very.
[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:35.340]   It could be lying.
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:38.540]   It's definitely very sophisticated to listen in, but you're right.
[00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:39.940]   It's just like Google plus.
[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:44.460]   They're listening for the there's they're listening for a trigger word and they have
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.500]   that pattern stored in there and they're just comparing it.
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:50.020]   They can't be sent and everything I say back to Amazon.
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.020]   Oh, wow.
[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:52.260]   See, my worries.
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.420]   My kids would be like, you know, get me a new puppy.
[00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:56.420]   They do that.
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:57.420]   Poppy shows up.
[00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.860]   You know, that would be my problem.
[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.420]   But so here's the do you house or your college kid?
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:02.420]   Seven and ten.
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:03.580]   Okay.
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:09.340]   They also have you could say Amazon fart for me and just tell them about that.
[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:12.620]   Don't tell them about the get me a new puppy feature and they'll be doing that for the
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:13.620]   next.
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:14.620]   Thanks, Leo.
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:15.620]   Thanks.
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:21.380]   That is one of the one of the they call them skills, although that's not really a skill.
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.940]   Like an innate ability.
[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:25.860]   An innate ability.
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:26.780]   Exactly.
[00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:29.580]   I I'm very intrigued by this.
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:34.940]   The fact that Amazon is putting money into Super Bowl commercials tells me they see a
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.340]   market here, right?
[00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:37.340]   Definitely.
[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:40.460]   I think this is a easy way to get everyone on board for Internet of Things.
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:41.860]   Just an easy way to introduce it.
[00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:44.060]   It works with that because you could say turn on my lights.
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.060]   Exactly.
[00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:46.060]   You could say open the garage door.
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:47.060]   I can query my car.
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:49.860]   I could see how much gas is left in the car and it will tell me.
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:53.260]   It's a perfect market though because while you're while you're watching the Super Bowl,
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:55.540]   you don't want to get up for anything.
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:58.100]   And so here it's saying is that listen, you wouldn't have to.
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.100]   Yeah.
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:03.060]   So you could get pizza right now with a crappy pizza, but you can still.
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:06.860]   Well, which is better getting up and calling to get good pizza or just sitting there and
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:08.380]   saying what come to a pizza?
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:09.380]   What come to a pizza?
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:10.380]   Domino's.
[00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.020]   Domino's launched the tweet pizza.
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.180]   You just it's the same company doing the echo.
[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:15.180]   There you go.
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:19.220]   Also, if you're going to order something, you're probably going to order it from Amazon if
[00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.540]   you're using their box, right?
[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.460]   Well, that's exactly right.
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:27.060]   In fact, if you're a prime customer and echo really makes most sense if you're a prime
[00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:28.660]   customer.
[00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:30.140]   And you've ordered a product before.
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:33.060]   Let's say I've ordered adult diapers before.
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:38.060]   I could say get me more of those and the echo because it knows that you ordered those before
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.060]   we get you some more.
[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.300]   I think we've learned a lot about you today.
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:46.260]   We've learned that you get teenies when you watch YouTube videos or next week.
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:48.020]   And now you've got adult diapers.
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:48.940]   It's the comedic.
[00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:50.380]   I always use that for example.
[00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:51.380]   And it's comedic.
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.380]   I guess I don't I shouldn't.
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.220]   Georgia, there's some go for bathroom breaks.
[00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:56.220]   So yes, I would.
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:58.220]   I want to take a policy or a free idea.
[00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:59.220]   I'm not diapers.
[00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:00.900]   That's what I really asked.
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:04.900]   You listening in when we were talking earlier, you must have asked her that.
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:06.420]   Were you talking about astronaut diapers?
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:07.420]   We were.
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:08.420]   We were.
[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:10.820]   You there was a break and we were talking anyways.
[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:11.820]   I wasn't listening.
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:14.820]   But now I know who my friends are.
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:15.820]   I know.
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:19.140]   I was just saying that there's uses for that.
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:20.140]   That's all.
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:21.140]   Yeah.
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:22.140]   They're useful.
[00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.140]   Anyway, I love it.
[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.660]   Everybody I know who has it loves it.
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:28.020]   And I have a feeling a lot more people are going to be talking about it.
[00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:30.260]   And I have a feeling we're going to see a lot more skills.
[00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:31.260]   Wonder if there's a website.
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:36.820]   I think there probably is Alexa skills.
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:38.820]   What is that?
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:39.820]   That's the skills.
[00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:40.820]   There you go.
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:41.820]   You found it.
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:42.820]   Well, these are from my echo app.
[00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:44.060]   Oh, OK.
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:48.220]   So you can teach it like I mean some of it's stupid like give me a daily affirmation or
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:49.220]   but I could play Jeopardy.
[00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:51.020]   It'll ask you six Jeopardy questions.
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:52.020]   You stupid?
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:53.020]   No, that's good.
[00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:54.020]   The information's OK.
[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.300]   Yeah, I am I am smarter.
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.300]   I am better.
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:58.300]   And people like me.
[00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.300]   Oh, like losers.
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:00.300]   Yeah.
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:01.300]   Rock, paper, scissors, loser, it's Bob.
[00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:04.580]   Some of this stuff is really weird because anybody can do it.
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:08.100]   And I was saying this is their big problem is there are too many things it can do.
[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:12.140]   It's like you have to remember as with all voice commands you have to kind of remember
[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:13.700]   the syntax and the command.
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:14.700]   I don't think it's too many.
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:18.820]   I think it's been more constantly to make it fun and engaging and continue to keep you.
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:20.860]   But now I have to write on post it notes.
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:21.860]   Right.
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:22.860]   How do you do that?
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:23.860]   What I could do.
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.620]   That's when I use where my class.
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:27.260]   Hey, where's my car?
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:30.500]   I love Google now because it tells you.
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:31.940]   It just tells you where you parked.
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:32.940]   Yeah.
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:36.820]   If you're in New York City, you can see what the status of the subway system you can ask
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:40.380]   it about your specific bus or train.
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.380]   When's the next day train?
[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:46.620]   I wanted to actually just tell me to know where I'm going and to have that information
[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:50.020]   and just be you know, be the artificial intelligence I need you to be.
[00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:52.620]   Just know where I'm going and tell me how to get there.
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:56.700]   Well, this is the this is the step.
[00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:57.700]   Where's that step?
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:58.700]   Right.
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:30:59.700]   I mean, I think we're going.
[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:00.700]   Google now gets me there.
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:01.700]   Yeah.
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:02.700]   Yeah.
[00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:03.700]   Well, and it surprises me.
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:04.700]   Google hasn't done that.
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:05.700]   In other words, why is Amazon doing this?
[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:09.460]   And not Google feels like Google should have done this.
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:12.940]   It's changing the subject slightly.
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:19.980]   Have you seen the video of the guy ordering his Tesla with his watch to open the garage
[00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:22.780]   door and drive out and close the garage door?
[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:23.780]   Yeah.
[00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:24.980]   That's the new summon command.
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:25.980]   Yeah.
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:27.980]   Interestingly, have you got that?
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:32.020]   Leo, my Tesla X is on order.
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:33.300]   But and I will get the song.
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:36.220]   I did order this special summon command.
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:38.340]   Yes, because that's so cute.
[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.500]   I saw that tweet that you sent out about your test.
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:41.500]   I'm so excited.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:42.500]   Congratulations.
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.140]   But they are apparently they lied is a bad word.
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:48.580]   I don't want to use that word because Stuart Elsa, you know, Stuart, right?
[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:50.420]   They're going to cut out your Tesla.
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:54.180]   Yeah, Stuart apparently had a model X on order.
[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:59.620]   He's a well known technology journalist, now a venture capitalist and old friend.
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:04.700]   And he apparently had a model X on order and then started complaining on a medium post
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:09.820]   about the unveiling and how Elon kept everybody waiting for two hours and he never did see
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:10.820]   his model X.
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:12.820]   So Elon canceled his order.
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:13.820]   That's horrible.
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:14.820]   So let's not.
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:15.820]   So I love Elon.
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:16.820]   I love you.
[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:17.820]   I love you.
[00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:25.740]   Wait at least until you get the car.
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.060]   No, I have nothing to complain about.
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:32.340]   But but but they were they're working on the website and apparently inadvertently they
[00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:36.980]   put so you have a page where it shows you your status.
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:41.260]   And you know, it's really it's interesting to watch these people crazy people like me
[00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:45.500]   because we're buying a car sight unseen, never having test drive.
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:48.500]   And I wasn't even sure what the colors were, you know, what they were going to look like,
[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:49.500]   but I just ordered it anyway.
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:50.500]   And it's an expensive car.
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.220]   It's not a cheap car.
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:56.140]   And because but you're we're fanatics because we want to drive electric vehicles that are
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:57.220]   as fast as a portion.
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:59.900]   I don't, you know, turbo Carrera.
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:05.980]   And not that I want to drive it like an old lady, but but I could go fast if I wanted
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:06.980]   to.
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:10.260]   Lisa will drive it fast.
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:16.020]   So you go on to this page and then little bits of information about the process emerge
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:18.980]   on the page like I just got my vehicle identification number.
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:19.980]   That's a good sign.
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:21.820]   That means they're getting a little closer.
[00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:24.940]   And then next to it they put should be available and I would like went crazy.
[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:27.620]   This is where I tweeted February early March.
[00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:29.940]   I'm like, what?
[00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:31.980]   I wasn't expecting this till next year.
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:32.980]   What?
[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:37.140]   Apparently that was an error because it's gone now.
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:38.500]   But I'm not complaining.
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.500]   I'm just wanting to.
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.060]   This is not a complaint.
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.060]   I'll take it.
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.060]   So excited.
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:44.060]   I'm just excited.
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:48.020]   Whenever it's ready, I'm happy to have it.
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:51.380]   And I'm grateful to you for letting me buy one.
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:53.300]   Thank you.
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.700]   Thank you for taking my money.
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:56.380]   Thank you for taking my money.
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.380]   Yes.
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:00.500]   Isn't it interesting though that there are companies there are not many.
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:03.060]   Apple might be one of them where people just they don't care.
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:04.980]   They said, just take my money.
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:07.100]   I'll take what we've got.
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:11.820]   You can probably have a safe bet because of all of the people who are so happy with their
[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:17.500]   Teslas that and so I think it's a safe bet that it's going to be a really great car and
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:20.140]   you're going to be exceptionally happy with that.
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:21.140]   There it is.
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:22.860]   This is so this this feature.
[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.100]   This guy actually wrote an app.
[00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:28.740]   This is not part of the official Tesla app, but he wrote an Apple Watch app.
[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:32.460]   The Tesla app lets you do the summon on the iPhone or Android phone.
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:37.740]   And what summon does as you're going to see here is the car opens the garage door.
[00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:43.780]   This is all without user intervention opens the garage door and very gradually.
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:45.380]   Very carefully.
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:50.700]   Very carefully backs out and then opens the door and lets you get in and it will do the
[00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:56.220]   opposite once you arrive and they say this is for garages that are so tightly packed
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:58.740]   that you can't actually get out of the car once you bark at it.
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:02.700]   But it's got sensors all over it so it will avoid.
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.140]   But don't you feel like great.
[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:06.260]   I hate backing into my garage.
[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:07.260]   Right.
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:08.660]   It's really frightening.
[00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:11.620]   I think frightening is letting the car back into your car.
[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:12.620]   Just frightening.
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:13.620]   I love that.
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:16.380]   I probably should treat trust the car over myself.
[00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:18.980]   Maybe maybe I have to be honest with that.
[00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:20.500]   The car is probably safer than I am.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:24.620]   I'm just going to hang a tennis ball on a rope and if it hits the windshield.
[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:25.620]   That's what my dad did.
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:26.620]   He just missed that.
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:27.620]   I know.
[00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:29.620]   I know this, Georgia, but I am your father.
[00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:32.220]   Oh my goodness.
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:33.100]   You invaded her.
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.580]   In spirit anyway.
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:36.780]   An age in spirit.
[00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:37.780]   Yeah.
[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:38.980]   Anyway, I don't know how we got to do that.
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:40.740]   But yeah, that's kind of cool, isn't it?
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:41.740]   Philip, it's.
[00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:42.740]   Yeah.
[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:45.340]   If you can't afford it so further.
[00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:46.340]   Right.
[00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:51.140]   Well, you know, there was a video by an answer.
[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:53.860]   Cartwright is a voice of Bart Simpson.
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:57.380]   She has a test lacks and she says, I'm driving down the highway, but I don't have my feet
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:00.900]   on the pedals and my hands just hovering over the wheels and the Tesla is doing it
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:04.940]   all for me.
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:08.940]   I wish she'd said something like don't have a cow man in the parts.
[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:12.020]   Probably she's not allowed to, you know, copyright.
[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:13.900]   Yeah, I think she can only do for them.
[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.340]   I bet you they don't allow her to.
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:20.020]   Yeah, that's weird.
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:23.300]   So enough we've done Twitter.
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:24.300]   We've done the echo.
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.900]   Okay, let's go home.
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.340]   I think the Super Bowl is always no, no.
[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:28.340]   Much more.
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:31.380]   We should make a little bit more.
[00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:38.740]   Jason Clanthes has prepared this lovely rundown for us to consume.
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:43.020]   What's app passes a billion monthly active users?
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:44.340]   But this is international, right?
[00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:45.740]   We don't use what's what's up here.
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:48.740]   I'm asking you as if I'm representing everyone.
[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:50.820]   Yeah, I'm representing people use WhatsApp.
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:54.660]   I think it's more popular overseas, especially in South America.
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.300]   It's really popular.
[00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:59.180]   What is your age cohort?
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:02.020]   What are your friends use messenger, Facebook messenger?
[00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:06.620]   I would say it really depends, but number one would be a text message.
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:07.980]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:08.980]   That would be a text message.
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:09.980]   Because we have it.
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.060]   We can do it.
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:12.060]   Why not?
[00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:17.020]   But I would say for internationals that I work with or that follow me, they tend to
[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:20.460]   go to Facebook and after Facebook, it's WhatsApp.
[00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:21.460]   Yeah.
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:22.460]   Yeah.
[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:26.060]   But that WhatsApp, it's joined a whole bunch of one billion.
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:27.060]   A number of billion.
[00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:28.060]   A number of billion.
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:29.060]   Yeah.
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.060]   Yeah.
[00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:33.900]   Zuckerberg, last August, 1 billion people used Facebook in one day.
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:38.140]   Google just announced last week that they have 1 billion Gmail accounts.
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:42.140]   Although my Gmail account, I looked at once every month.
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:43.140]   Accounts don't count.
[00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:45.420]   I'd love to know what the monthly active or daily active users is.
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:46.980]   It's probably still very high.
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:47.980]   I'm sure it's hundreds.
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:54.900]   And then Apple said they now have 1 billion devices active, but we all have multiple or
[00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:57.620]   a lot of people have multiple Apple devices.
[00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:59.420]   So that doesn't translate to people.
[00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:01.900]   One percent of that is Leo alone.
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:08.140]   That's probably true.
[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:09.140]   Yeah.
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:15.500]   Billion is the three comma club as they would have it on Silicon Valley, the TV show.
[00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:21.700]   So that's a nice number to have if you can generate revenue off it.
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:25.740]   And most of them are generating ad revenue.
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:30.940]   Apple is selling movies and songs, I guess.
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:34.060]   Apple Pay, get pennies per Apple Pay.
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:38.100]   Snapchat must have felt like, gosh, we're so close.
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:44.900]   Snapchat reported that users send 8,796 photos a second on Snapchat.
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:47.540]   That's 759 million a day.
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:49.540]   They're so close to a billion a day.
[00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:52.140]   They're so close to a billion a day.
[00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:53.660]   They're so close to a billion a day.
[00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:57.620]   I think Snapchat is very interesting.
[00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:58.860]   I was going to call it dark horse.
[00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:00.020]   You can't even call it a dark horse.
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:01.620]   I mean, it's clearly a huge.
[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:02.860]   It's clearly a fun runner.
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.220]   An interesting story.
[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:06.900]   I was at a hackathon a couple of weeks ago.
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:11.260]   And I met a young lady who had the most interesting job I'd ever heard.
[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:13.420]   She was a senior Snapchatter.
[00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:16.180]   Working for the company?
[00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:19.100]   A senior Snapchatter at a major company.
[00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:20.300]   Oh, interesting.
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:22.460]   Which implies they're junior Snapchatters.
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:23.460]   Exactly.
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:25.460]   Which implies this is a thing.
[00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:26.460]   I'm a sub-jr.
[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:27.460]   This is a thing that you can do.
[00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:28.460]   I'm a sub-jr.
[00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:29.460]   Snapchatter.
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:30.460]   I'm working my way up.
[00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:31.460]   I'd like to be a senior Snapchatter.
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:37.020]   Yeah, so she curates content for the Snapchat channel daily, constantly and changes it, curates
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:40.140]   it every single day and builds up the network there.
[00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:43.940]   So a senior Snapchatter, we can add that to Chief Happiness Officer.
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:44.940]   Yes.
[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:47.540]   These are interesting titles that we have in Silicon Valley.
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:48.540]   Wow.
[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:49.540]   So a tech company or a consumer?
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:50.620]   Well, it's a tech company.
[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:52.980]   I think for a consumer company, it'd be even more important.
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:57.420]   If you're Procter and Gamble, you better believe Procter and Gamble has dozens of Snapchat
[00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:58.420]   officers.
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.420]   They don't know yet.
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:02.780]   Ten years from now, they'll do it.
[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:03.780]   Some brands know.
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:04.780]   Some brands know.
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:08.140]   You see a lot of brands in the discover side.
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.140]   Definitely.
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.380]   I think more brands should be there.
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:11.380]   Senior Snapchatter.
[00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:12.860]   So go and apply for that one.
[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:16.620]   We talked, actually, we talked about this on the new screensavers yesterday with Dan Patterson
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:18.340]   who is working for Tech Republic now.
[00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:23.660]   He's for the third year for a cycle in a row covering the New Hampshire primaries.
[00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:29.980]   He's going to be covering the campaign again as he did in 2008 and 2012.
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:33.960]   As Dan pointed out, one of the things that's going to distinguish candidates is their mastery
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:34.960]   of social media.
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:39.780]   Hillary Clinton has a Snapchat story channel where she's feeding videos.
[00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:41.860]   Well, she or her senior Snapchat.
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:42.860]   Or senior Snapchat.
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:43.860]   She's a Snapchat officer.
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:47.500]   She's an opt-chat officer.
[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:48.940]   And it'll be interesting to see.
[00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:54.420]   I think when we get down to two candidates, almost the war of social media between the
[00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:55.420]   two of them.
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:59.220]   Clinton uses Twitter quite effectively, but not authentically.
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:02.060]   Whereas Donald Trump uses, it's clearly his voice.
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:07.100]   Not a senior Twitter officer.
[00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:13.620]   It's what's so totally disruptive about Trump's campaign is that he can sit there with his
[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:16.980]   iPhone and run a campaign.
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:19.540]   He doesn't need billions of dollars of TV ads.
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:21.060]   He just tweets.
[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:27.460]   Do you think that other candidates should emulate what he's doing or is that something
[00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:29.060]   only Donald Trump can do?
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:31.700]   I mean, he's after all a reality TV star.
[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:38.820]   Yeah, I would rather have a candidate who can run a government.
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:41.300]   You don't want a candidate who knows how to use Twitter?
[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:43.260]   Well, not necessarily.
[00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.540]   I mean, ideally they can do both.
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:51.060]   But first, I think, to get the job, you have to know how to run a government.
[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:53.180]   Definitely want someone who knows how to use Twitter.
[00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:55.500]   Because again, that brings us to the importance of Twitter.
[00:41:55.500 --> 00:42:00.540]   And we had that conversation earlier, how Twitter is a part of our culture.
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:04.700]   And if we have a candidate that can effectively use Twitter, they can effectively connect with
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:06.540]   the immediate pulse of the culture.
[00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:13.220]   See what we're hearing here is, and it's really interesting, is the two sides of the spectrum.
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:20.060]   People who feel that the president should be an administrator who is capable of a governor-style
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:26.980]   person who can run the country, an executive officer versus a leader who is able to galvanize
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:29.580]   the country and keep the country moving.
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.620]   And I guess we probably need a little bit of both.
[00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:37.620]   But I think that's two different, very different kinds of presidents, very different kinds of
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:38.620]   executives.
[00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:42.820]   But I think historically, you need to do both.
[00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:49.420]   Although Kennedy was probably a crappy administrator, but it was a great speaker.
[00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:51.340]   But he didn't know how to get stuff through Congress.
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:53.220]   He's kind of like Obama that way.
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:54.220]   Where's Johnson?
[00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:55.660]   Johnson was the opposite.
[00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:59.940]   He knew how to get stuff through Congress, but he was a liar.
[00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:01.860]   Nobody trusted him.
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:08.300]   And he was very maladroit at managing his image, who could forget the picture of him showing
[00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:13.580]   his appendix scar, and then the Vietnam protesters turned it into a picture of Vietnam.
[00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:17.460]   Ted Cruz kind of channels Johnson.
[00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:21.780]   Actually, I don't know who Marco Rubio was channeling last night, but there's a whole
[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:24.060]   internet meme of Marco the robot.
[00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:25.060]   Have you seen this?
[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:26.060]   I have not seen it.
[00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:28.540]   Let's get that on this screen.
[00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.660]   I have not seen it.
[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:33.420]   Because he kept saying the same thing over and over again.
[00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:41.580]   Or I think four times said the same stump quote or variation of the same stump quote.
[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:45.260]   And now the meme is in fact, is robot Rubio.
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:48.020]   In fact, I think there is a robot Rubio Twitter account.
[00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:52.140]   He said the same thing was that an edit effect, just him saying the same thing.
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:53.140]   Well, you want to see it?
[00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:54.140]   I would love to see it.
[00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:55.300]   If you missed it.
[00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:57.420]   He was after Christie called him on it.
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:01.940]   Christie said this guy just repeats campaign lines, and then he did it again.
[00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:05.140]   That's the funny thing is he kind of played right into right into that.
[00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:06.140]   Here's.
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:07.140]   That Barack Obama.
[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:08.780]   Let's get the beginning because we missed the audio.
[00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:12.140]   Let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:13.140]   doing.
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:14.140]   He knows exactly what he's doing.
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.140]   First time.
[00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:16.900]   We are not facing a president that doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:17.900]   He knows what he is doing.
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:18.900]   Second time.
[00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:21.820]   Let's dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:23.300]   He knows exactly what he's doing.
[00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:24.300]   Third time.
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:27.140]   Anyone who believes that Barack Obama isn't doing what he's doing on purpose doesn't understand
[00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:28.660]   what we're dealing with here.
[00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:35.660]   So there is now a Mario Rubio glitch Twitter account that says the same thing over and over.
[00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:38.380]   Let's dispel this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:41.620]   He knows exactly what he's doing.
[00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:43.380]   See this is why we have to have Twitter.
[00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:44.380]   That's exactly why.
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:46.180]   I would just think he's very passionate about it.
[00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:48.700]   He said it how many times for?
[00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:53.260]   I have to say I'm just I kind of bleed for the guy because you know what happens.
[00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:55.140]   You're in this very stressful situation.
[00:44:55.140 --> 00:45:02.380]   He's just accused you of being a repetitive robot and then you somehow cannot stop yourself
[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:05.500]   from becoming what he's accused you of being.
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:06.500]   I feel for the guy.
[00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.300]   He was by the end of the thing.
[00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:09.300]   He was sweating.
[00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:11.740]   He was dying out there.
[00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:13.380]   You know imagine what it's like for them.
[00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:14.700]   They do this all day long.
[00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:15.700]   Yeah.
[00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:17.260]   Even the same speech over and over and over.
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:18.260]   Exactly.
[00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:23.020]   They're moving in this bubble and you know nobody it's very hard to survive that.
[00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:26.980]   People who are very good at campaigning have a hard time.
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:31.020]   Well and I would submit it is not a good test of who's going to be a good president because
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:32.020]   no.
[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:33.020]   No.
[00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:36.180]   Really it's who's the best psychopath.
[00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:39.100]   I would say that's one of the downsides of social media is when you're running through
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:41.380]   a campaign is the memes.
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:42.580]   It could I mean the memes.
[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:43.580]   It'll kill you.
[00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:44.580]   It'll kill you.
[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:45.580]   Yeah definitely.
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:52.060]   Wasn't how you know wasn't there a Clinton meme of her sending texts because there's a picture
[00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:57.820]   of her kind of looking over her glasses at her blackberry.
[00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:03.780]   I think there was a total tumbler.
[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:05.380]   I tell you at least text.
[00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:12.700]   It is texts texts from Hillary dot tumbler dot com.
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:15.020]   And I guess it's just there she is.
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:16.020]   That's the picture.
[00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:24.260]   It's they keep they the whole mean thread is that you will show what she's texting.
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:27.140]   So there's Biden to showing the president his phone.
[00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:30.020]   She's going to love this new Justin Bieber video.
[00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:34.300]   And then she texts back to back to work boys.
[00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:41.140]   And Huffington Post Hillary Hillary post dot com.
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:42.700]   Mark Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:44.660]   Guess what I just bought.
[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:48.300]   Hillary a shirt with a big boy collar.
[00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:49.300]   That's good.
[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:50.300]   Isn't it?
[00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:53.020]   Is that good for her bad for it's good for her.
[00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:54.020]   Isn't it?
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:55.380]   I think it definitely keeps irrelevant.
[00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:56.380]   Yeah.
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:57.380]   Yeah definitely keeps it.
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:58.380]   But this is but you're right.
[00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:01.020]   This is where the candidates probably fear.
[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:02.500]   We saw I mean it's it's not new.
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:07.620]   We saw it with Mike Dukakis when he wore the giant tank helmet and he looked like a
[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:13.660]   small child in a in a tank and it tanked his campaign.
[00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:15.420]   Who's the guy who's screaming?
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:16.420]   Howard Dean scream.
[00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:17.420]   Howard Dean.
[00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:18.420]   Oh God.
[00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:19.420]   It's all about the name.
[00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:23.020]   They're calling robot Rubio the Howard Dean moment in the Rubio campaign.
[00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:24.020]   Mm hmm.
[00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:27.660]   But it's such a hard thing because you're always wanting to be authentic.
[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:31.980]   But then if you say something off the cuff and it comes out off color people are going
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:33.180]   to run with it.
[00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:38.060]   And it's so hard to be constantly under a barrage of questions and people hoping to
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:42.860]   get you with something and you're just doing your best to try not to say something silly.
[00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:46.900]   But then you don't want to seem robotic and stiff at the same time.
[00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:50.460]   So my head's off to being able to deal with that 24/7.
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:48:00.100]   It's a perfect storm of spin media and you know soundbite coverage and you're in such
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:03.700]   a it's such an abnormal environment.
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:07.420]   I guess some of those skills might be useful as president.
[00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:12.580]   But more towards the ability to inspire part than the executive administrator part for
[00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:13.580]   sure.
[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:17.140]   I think you can also see when people are overly reactive and I think that that's really important
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:19.300]   to be more non reactive as president.
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:20.300]   That's a good point.
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:25.620]   You don't want to be really upset and quick to temper and quick to get offended when you're
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:29.700]   dealing with international issues in many different people with different cultural needs
[00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:30.700]   and wants.
[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:35.460]   And so I think that things that might get garner a lot of attention in some ways are
[00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:38.500]   a way of seeing who can be common to all of this pressure.
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:39.500]   Okay.
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:40.500]   Yeah.
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.060]   I think that's interesting that she's saying you can't be quick to react.
[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:46.500]   Can you imagine the president of the United States and some sort of Twitter beef with
[00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:47.500]   a mother president?
[00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:49.220]   I can't if it's a little bit of Trump.
[00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:51.140]   I can totally imagine that.
[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:52.500]   I can see Trump pulling the Kanye.
[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:54.940]   That's what we have to look forward to and see that.
[00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:55.940]   Yeah.
[00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:58.820]   That's what Twitter beef and then we can chime in on it and like create our own hashtag
[00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:00.940]   and memes about the other kind of want that.
[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:01.940]   Can we do that?
[00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:02.940]   No.
[00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:03.940]   No, that's bad.
[00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:04.940]   People.
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:07.900]   That's bad when people have weapons.
[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:08.900]   That's fine.
[00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:10.900]   When the weapons and that does get involved.
[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:11.900]   That does get involved.
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:14.420]   You're fighting with someone that can't reach you but you know when you're representing
[00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:18.660]   a whole country of people you want someone that's going to be even tempered be able to
[00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:20.220]   handle it.
[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:23.180]   Think before they do something they're not going to press the red button just out of
[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:24.180]   anger.
[00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:25.180]   But don't you.
[00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:30.860]   I mean I have to really say that by being the only guy who's speaking in his own voice
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:35.340]   on Twitter, Trump's getting a huge value out of that.
[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:38.580]   I mean that's one of the reasons he has such support.
[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:42.660]   I doubt very much that the people who support him agree with the notion that he should go
[00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:44.900]   down Fifth Avenue shooting people.
[00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:53.180]   But the fact that he has the hoods but to say that is I think invigorating to people.
[00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:54.180]   It's fresh.
[00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:55.180]   Definitely.
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:56.180]   The guy speaks his mind.
[00:49:56.180 --> 00:50:01.260]   I may not always agree with him but the man is not a mealy mouth politician.
[00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:02.500]   He says what he thinks.
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:03.500]   Yeah.
[00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:04.500]   It's the anti-politician.
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:05.500]   It's authentic.
[00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:06.500]   It's authentic.
[00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:07.500]   The anti-politician.
[00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:08.500]   Yeah.
[00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:11.500]   Is that bad?
[00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:12.500]   I don't know.
[00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:21.500]   I think it's great but I think that the fact of his level of reactiveness, I think that
[00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:26.740]   when it comes down to really being president could be something that people will have to
[00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:27.740]   cause.
[00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:35.180]   But we do swing and President Obama is kind of icy, right?
[00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:36.180]   He's chilly.
[00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:37.180]   And he's proficile.
[00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:38.180]   He's proficile.
[00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:41.740]   And you could tell he's very calm.
[00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:44.640]   You can't see him really raising his voice very much.
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:47.300]   He shed a little tear but that's about it.
[00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:51.380]   I could see that after a while you'd say, "Hey, I want somebody who speaks in his own voice
[00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:55.580]   on Twitter and tells it like it is."
[00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:59.380]   And I think the Twitter is the perfect platform for Donald Trump.
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:00.380]   Definitely.
[00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:04.140]   He's the only person that I've seen that wasn't necessarily afraid of the social media police
[00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:05.140]   coming to get him.
[00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:06.140]   He just said.
[00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:07.140]   No, he doesn't care.
[00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:08.140]   That's true.
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:09.140]   That's true.
[00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:14.620]   I believe if you think President Obama doesn't know what he's doing, well, he knows what
[00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:16.420]   he's doing.
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:22.260]   Thank you, Jason Clantis.
[00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:24.260]   We like to call him the Jason bot.
[00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:25.900]   All right, we'll take a break.
[00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:27.420]   Come back with more.
[00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:32.940]   We're having fun talking about the world at large with Georgia Dao from iMore.com.
[00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:37.020]   Stephen Harper was also a cold fish, right?
[00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:41.300]   And Trudeau is a little bit more warm and effusive and real.
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:43.020]   You're a new prime minister.
[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:45.380]   Yeah, we're pretty impressed with him.
[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:47.780]   But it's kind of the same thing, right?
[00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:51.140]   Because Harper was an effective administrator.
[00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:53.780]   Yes, he will.
[00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:55.780]   I guess that would depend.
[00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:59.180]   He was kind of like the Lego guy.
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:01.340]   He's got the Lego hair.
[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:04.340]   He was the kind of the manufacturer candidate.
[00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:05.340]   Yes.
[00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:10.860]   And then Trudeau kind of as a youthful, you know, like his dad, kind of a swinger.
[00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:13.500]   Can you just dance again?
[00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:17.340]   There we go.
[00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:18.660]   Also Liberty Madison is here.
[00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:22.260]   It's great to have you, Liberty Madison.com.
[00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:25.500]   You make a business of helping startups with this stuff, right?
[00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:27.060]   With social media and all this stuff.
[00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:30.620]   Well, in general, just with millennials and tack and getting them interested to learn
[00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:31.620]   hardcore.
[00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:32.620]   I love your t-shirt.
[00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:34.380]   It says, "I code."
[00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:36.180]   And it's got a little...
[00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:37.180]   It's getting a shirt.
[00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:38.180]   Yeah.
[00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:40.980]   That cat with the octopus cat, that means love?
[00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:41.980]   Yes.
[00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:42.980]   I didn't know that.
[00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:44.540]   I just thought it was an octopus cat.
[00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:46.060]   Actually, it's just the GitHub logo.
[00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:47.060]   Okay.
[00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:48.060]   I code.
[00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:49.420]   I GitHub code.
[00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:50.620]   I git code.
[00:52:50.620 --> 00:52:51.620]   You git.
[00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:52.620]   You git commit.
[00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:54.780]   I commit the git.
[00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:58.820]   Also here, Philip Elmer DeWitt from the git.
[00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:00.100]   What is the new site going to be?
[00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:01.580]   Can you talk about that or is that...?
[00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:02.580]   Yeah.
[00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:04.580]   Yeah, I can talk about it a little bit.
[00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:10.460]   I'm discovering the limits of WordPress and how hard it is to make anything look good
[00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:11.460]   on it.
[00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:12.460]   But...
[00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:14.620]   Well, I wish I had a Squarespace ad right now.
[00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:15.620]   Yeah.
[00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:16.620]   Yeah.
[00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:20.060]   The plan is to do...
[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:28.340]   It's the model that a lot of guys like me are doing, $10 a month, $100 a year.
[00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:31.340]   You get the daily post in your inbox.
[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:35.500]   You click on the link and you get to be part of the conversation and see the data and so
[00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:36.500]   forth.
[00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:37.940]   That's what Ben Thompson does.
[00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:38.940]   So effective.
[00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:39.940]   Right.
[00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:40.940]   Exactly.
[00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:44.860]   The problem with that model is that once you go behind the firewall, you're invisible
[00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:46.180]   on the internet.
[00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:50.380]   So Ben gets around that by writing the public post once a week.
[00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:52.660]   There are other ways of doing that.
[00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:56.820]   My twist on it is that I'll put a window on it.
[00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:59.380]   It's behind the paywall for...
[00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:03.140]   It's adjustable, but behind the paywall for three days and then it's free.
[00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:04.660]   Oh, I like that.
[00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:05.660]   We'll see what works.
[00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:07.180]   So it all ends up being free.
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:08.180]   Right.
[00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:12.940]   But the people who could most benefit from it and really the money in paywalls is from...
[00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:16.340]   The people who do well are Financial Times Wall Street Journal where the information is
[00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:17.340]   money crowd.
[00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:18.340]   Right.
[00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:23.740]   And the sweet spot of my readership has always been people who bought Apple at $9 a share
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:29.260]   and now they're multi-millionaires and they really watch the fever chart really closely.
[00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:32.460]   They want to know if it's time to buy or to sell.
[00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:39.580]   To the extent to which I have access to the analysts and share their stuff, there's a
[00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:41.420]   timely value to what I do.
[00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:42.420]   I hope.
[00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:43.420]   We'll find out.
[00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:48.740]   I've been in ad supported environments for 36 years.
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:49.740]   Yeah.
[00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:54.860]   And now I'm going to finally find out if what I write is worth something without the ads.
[00:54:54.860 --> 00:54:57.380]   Because the ads are just driving me nuts.
[00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:58.380]   It's terrible.
[00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:01.860]   It's a fascinating experiment when I've wanted to do myself.
[00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:08.860]   Before I always said we should have a paid newsletter where the really good stuff, the
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:14.060]   stuff that's going to make people money lives and people would pay a lot of money for that.
[00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:15.660]   I think that's an excellent business model.
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:16.660]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:19.820]   Too lazy.
[00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:21.820]   We did a newsletter and we give it away.
[00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:22.820]   Twitter.tv/newsletter.
[00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:23.820]   We give it away.
[00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:26.220]   What am I thinking?
[00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:27.540]   I'm an old dog.
[00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:29.620]   I can't learn new tricks.
[00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:34.700]   The thing that scares me about paywalls, particularly with our audience, our audience
[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:37.140]   is technically very literate.
[00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:38.300]   Ignation had this problem.
[00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:42.580]   Ignation for a while thought will charge for early access.
[00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:46.900]   Remember Kevin Rose's and Alex Albrecht's because we'll charge for early access.
[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:50.700]   And then a few days later, whatever it was, we'll make it public.
[00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:51.900]   Oh, they did that.
[00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:52.900]   Yeah.
[00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:55.860]   And the problem was that they have a very technically literate audience that as soon as
[00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:59.500]   they got it, put it out publicly and there was no way to stop it.
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:04.260]   So suddenly, if you're going to make money in that model, you're playing whack-a-mole.
[00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:06.380]   And I think Kevin and Alex abandoned it.
[00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:09.060]   I don't think that lasted very long.
[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:10.060]   But that's the problem.
[00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:11.060]   I know the problem.
[00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:12.060]   Yeah, I know.
[00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:13.540]   What's your audience demographic, Bella?
[00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:15.740]   Smart and ethically challenged audience.
[00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:19.340]   No, I think your audience is different.
[00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:20.340]   What's your audience?
[00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:21.340]   No, yeah, I think your audience is different.
[00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:23.340]   I think the Wall Street Journal's audience is different.
[00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:24.860]   I pay for the Wall Street Journal.
[00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:26.740]   People pay for the Wall Street Journal.
[00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:28.300]   Pay for it because it's worth it.
[00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:31.260]   They're not interested in like, oh, I'm going to put it on BitTorrent.
[00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:32.660]   Make sure everybody gets it for free.
[00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:33.660]   That's a different audience.
[00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:37.340]   Yeah, I think this is a great, a great opportunity for him to test out his entrepreneurship.
[00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:38.340]   I love it.
[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:39.340]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:40.340]   I want you to do it.
[00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:41.340]   And I'll be watching with interest.
[00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:44.060]   I said the same thing to Jessica Lesson when she started the information.
[00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:46.660]   And I think they're succeeding, right?
[00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:48.420]   I'd love to see her financials.
[00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:49.420]   Yeah.
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:55.660]   She took some of the best technology journalists out of free media.
[00:56:55.660 --> 00:57:00.980]   And I pay 400 bucks a year for the information because it's worth it.
[00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:03.460]   And also to support Jessica because I feel like that's a good thing.
[00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:05.180]   Same thing I pay for Ben.
[00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:07.180]   I buy more of these than I should.
[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:10.500]   Mostly, same reason I bought all that shareware that I use because I want to support these
[00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:12.820]   people because I think what they're doing is great.
[00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:15.220]   And I will be your first subscriber, Phillip.
[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:16.820]   I think it goes to each right.
[00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:17.820]   Oh, right.
[00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:18.820]   Yeah.
[00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:19.820]   Definitely.
[00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:20.820]   Sign me up.
[00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:21.820]   Okay.
[00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:23.460]   I show today, Brian, this is how we pay for it.
[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:25.820]   I show today, Brian.
[00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:27.580]   I see.
[00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:29.500]   I don't mind the ads we do.
[00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:30.500]   I agree with you.
[00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:33.740]   I think ads are out of control on the internet.
[00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:38.700]   And you know, I do broadcast radio where the limit, the federal communications limit
[00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:42.020]   is 19 minutes out of an hour can be ads.
[00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:46.940]   And I don't know a single AM station that doesn't run 19 minutes an hour of ads.
[00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:52.900]   In fact, they even invented, you know, kind of a blipfert kind of add a 10 second or a
[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:53.900]   five.
[00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:58.860]   They have five second ads now on some of these radio stations that I'm on where they just
[00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:03.140]   say one word, you know, don't forget, draft Kings dot com.
[00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:07.940]   And then and then so when big bunny draft Kings got on and then it's all over.
[00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:10.220]   And it becomes wallpaper after a while.
[00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:12.660]   I don't think it's an effective way to use the meme.
[00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:16.980]   And I don't blame people for using ad blockers because it's out of control.
[00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:21.380]   I can't even believe people still think that's an effective way to connect with an on.
[00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:22.380]   That's another question.
[00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:23.980]   It just blows my mind.
[00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:24.980]   Definitely.
[00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:25.980]   Doc Serals wrote a great article.
[00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:30.900]   In fact, maybe we'll talk about a little bit of that when we come back about this, how
[00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:35.500]   misguided ad tech is doc, who's an old radio guy and wrote the clue was one of the writers
[00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:42.380]   of the clue train manifestos really a brilliant fellow says that this ad blocking thing is
[00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:46.020]   actually one of the largest consumer boycotts of all time.
[00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:47.420]   It's a boycott, he says.
[00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:49.580]   And it is, isn't it?
[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:52.660]   It's consumers saying, yeah, we're not going to take it.
[00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:53.780]   They took advantage of us.
[00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:55.620]   And now we're getting rid of them.
[00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:59.220]   So skip this ad if you wish.
[00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:02.300]   But I'd love you to if I'll tell you what, you should not you couldn't skip this ad if
[00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:07.060]   you do not mail stuff in your business, then there's no reason for you to listen to this
[00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:08.060]   ad.
[00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:12.180]   But if you are an Etsy seller or Amazon or eBay seller, if you do brochures, if you do
[00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:16.020]   fulfillment in your business, if you mail stuff out, you're really ought to know about
[00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:17.020]   stamps.com.
[00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:23.860]   We use it here in the office because it's a better way to use the postal service with
[00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:24.860]   stamp stock.
[00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:27.740]   I mean, it starts by and we always talk about the idea that you can buy and print your own
[00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:29.820]   US postage on your computer, your printer.
[00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:32.540]   You don't need a postage meter, you can do it online.
[00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:37.300]   That's the beginning, but really stamps.com is so much more because stamps.com will print
[00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:41.460]   right on the envelope, not only the postage, but your address, the return address and the
[00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:42.660]   address of the recipient.
[00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:44.060]   They'll put your company logo.
[00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:47.100]   They'll do it on a package, any kind of mail, media mail.
[00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:52.980]   If you send any kind of media books, DVDs, CDs, and you're not using media mail, stamps.com
[00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:54.940]   will say, you know that you could save a lot of money.
[00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:57.140]   Here's how the media mail works.
[00:59:57.140 --> 01:00:00.820]   It is going to save you money and plus you get discounts you can't get at the post office.
[01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:05.700]   You don't have to ever go to the post office because everything you could do at the post
[01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:07.740]   office, you could do at your desk with stamps.com.
[01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:12.780]   And that's why if you're in this business, if you are mailing stuff at work, you need
[01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:15.020]   to know about stamps.com.

[01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:27.380]   forms, automatically filled out from your site, your address book.
[01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:29.780]   It works with all popular address books.
[01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:33.340]   You can use cost codes to track postage spending by customer.
[01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:35.220]   I mean, there's so many features.
[01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:38.660]   This is the way post mailing ought to be.
[01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:40.140]   So if you're in this business, here's what you do.
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:41.300]   You go to stamps.com.

[01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:40.300]   Sesame Street is launching a venture arm.
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:41.300]   Finally.
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:44.940]   Well, it's about time.
[01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:45.940]   Finally.
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:46.940]   Yes.
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:47.940]   Yes.
[01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:55.300]   Children's television workshop, which really changed the way kids TV was.
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:56.860]   You're a Sesame Street generation kid.
[01:01:56.860 --> 01:01:57.860]   I know you are.
[01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:59.700]   You know, I watched it.
[01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:00.700]   I don't remember it.
[01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:02.180]   You really don't.
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:03.660]   I love Sesame Street.
[01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:04.900]   Muppets for the win.
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:08.420]   I'm like, there's a Muppet I'm involved.
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:11.380]   Everybody of a certain age learned to read from Sesame Street, at least learned their
[01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:12.380]   alphabet.
[01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:13.380]   Not me.
[01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:15.180]   I had Captain Kangaroo.
[01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:17.180]   Buffalo Bob.
[01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:18.180]   Buffalo Bob.
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:20.180]   And howdy dody.
[01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:21.180]   Yeah.
[01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:22.180]   Yeah.
[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:23.660]   Philip and I are of a certain year.
[01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:24.660]   Clarabelle.
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:25.580]   Clarabelle the clown.
[01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:27.060]   Clarabelle the clown.
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:28.060]   That was Bob Keisha.
[01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:30.740]   That was Captain Kangaroo before he was Captain Kangaroo.
[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:32.740]   Now we've lost the entire audience.
[01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:33.740]   Yeah.
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:34.740]   Right.
[01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:35.740]   Let's go back to Trump.
[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:39.540]   We're back to the adult diaper audience.
[01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:41.620]   So the kids are going to invest?
[01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:42.620]   Is that the idea?
[01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:43.620]   I don't.
[01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:44.620]   Okay.
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:45.620]   It's 66.
[01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:46.620]   I did.
[01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:47.620]   It's amazing.
[01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:48.620]   It's that old.
[01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:54.660]   And generations now, not just one multiple generations have grown up watching Big Bird
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:59.900]   and Elmo and Bert and Ernie show first hair in 69.
[01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:05.060]   So that's what 45, 46 years.
[01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:08.580]   So and they're actually getting kind of sophisticated.
[01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:14.220]   They started debuting now Sesame Street on HBO.
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:15.220]   Yeah.
[01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:16.220]   Interesting.
[01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:18.980]   But it'll eventually get to free TV, right?
[01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:20.980]   But they're going to start on a paid TV.
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:23.100]   Like six months later or something.
[01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:24.380]   It's the Philip Elmer DeWitt model.
[01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:28.060]   We're going to call it the head model from now on.
[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:29.060]   Okay.
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:35.060]   So they are now, they've created a venture fund.
[01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:41.420]   Many ventures, it's going to partner with venture capital firms to make investments
[01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:44.580]   in for-products, profit startups.
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:48.700]   But they'll all be about children's education early at the weekend.
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:49.700]   Yeah.
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:50.700]   Yeah.
[01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:54.580]   It's first partner is collaborative fund an early stage investor in startups like Lyft
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:56.020]   and Kickstarter.
[01:03:56.020 --> 01:04:01.940]   And they're going to have a $10 million fund called collab plus Sesame investment focus.
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:06.100]   You know, from a group that taught people how to read, that is a particularly crappy
[01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:09.860]   name.
[01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:13.260]   Collab plus Sesame investment focus.
[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:15.460]   That is a pretty bad name.
[01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:20.260]   Today's show brought to you by the letter CSIF.
[01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:21.380]   But it's a bad education.
[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:23.660]   And we all are for early childhood education.
[01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:28.900]   And they're all how can you not when a product says, you know, or a company says backed by
[01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:29.900]   Elmo.
[01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:34.100]   That's a huge, that's a huge push.
[01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:40.580]   It's a little weird because I think children's television workshop is a nonprofit.
[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:41.580]   But this would fund it.
[01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:45.420]   I mean, you know, if they've been doing this since 1969, they've spent a considerable amount
[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:48.540]   of effort in raising money to do it, right?
[01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:49.540]   So why not?
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:53.460]   Why not make some money doing this?
[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:57.180]   I don't know.
[01:04:57.180 --> 01:04:58.180]   Super Bowl.
[01:04:58.180 --> 01:04:59.180]   What about it?
[01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:04.220]   Well, there's a lot of cheerleaders and some football players right on the field.
[01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:09.580]   I've got to say, the kids have been watching a lot of old Friday night lights around here.
[01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:10.980]   Oh, that's a great show.
[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:15.500]   And you know, the Panthers and the Broncos, Coach Taylor really brought this team a long
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:16.500]   way.
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:18.500]   He took them all the way to the Super Bowl.
[01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:19.500]   What is it?
[01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:20.500]   The Dylan Panthers, that is.
[01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:21.500]   The Dylan band.
[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:22.500]   Was it clear?
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:23.500]   Clear hearts.
[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:24.500]   Clear eyes.
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:25.500]   More.
[01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:26.500]   Full hearts.
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:27.500]   Full hearts.
[01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:28.500]   Clear eyes.
[01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:29.500]   I can't lose.
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:30.500]   Yeah.
[01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:33.220]   So CBS is streaming this.
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:40.420]   This is not the first time they've streamed it, but it is available for free on the internet.
[01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:44.260]   And if you want to watch on a mobile device, again, they have the Verizon exclusive.
[01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:48.500]   You have to be a Verizon customer.
[01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:55.940]   And what they're doing right now is a countdown to kick off because their live stream doesn't
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:59.100]   have any ads on it.
[01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:04.540]   They could, I guess with the, with five million dollars, that only gets you 30 seconds on television.
[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:06.340]   It doesn't get you.
[01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:10.540]   The Broncos, the Broncos had a horse leading the charge.
[01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:11.540]   Oh, that's not.
[01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:12.540]   Oh, no, no, wait a minute.
[01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:14.500]   We're seeing, I think we're seeing the, that's it.
[01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:15.500]   That's it.
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.420]   How far behind TV is this?
[01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:18.900]   About five, 10 seconds.
[01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:19.900]   Oh, that's not bad.
[01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:20.900]   Yeah, there's the horse.
[01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:21.900]   There's the flag.
[01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:23.380]   I think I'm in trouble now.
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:28.620]   I probably can't show this on the, on the internet.
[01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:30.140]   But this is recovering news.
[01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:32.740]   Here's a test of fair use, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:39.660]   We're going to watch the Super Bowl.
[01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:41.860]   All I know is Jo name is wins.
[01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:42.860]   Jo name is wins.
[01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:43.860]   That's all I know.
[01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:45.220]   You know what's really interesting?
[01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:50.900]   I thought, I wonder if tech people really know who's playing in the Super Bowl.
[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:52.820]   What's going on in the Super Bowl?
[01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:56.140]   So we went to the streets and interviewed.
[01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:57.140]   Did you?
[01:06:57.140 --> 01:06:58.140]   We did.
[01:06:58.140 --> 01:06:59.140]   We went to the streets.
[01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:00.140]   Who'd you do this for?
[01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:01.140]   I did this for that tech girl.
[01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:03.820]   If you go to that tech girl and you can actually, we can, I think we've got it queued up here
[01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:07.220]   on YouTube and we've found an engineer over at Airbnb.
[01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:08.660]   Who actually knew?
[01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:10.340]   Oh, you've got to watch the video.
[01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:11.340]   It's on YouTube.
[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:13.460]   It is on YouTube.
[01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:16.340]   So are you, are you make money on this?
[01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:17.340]   How do you do this?
[01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:21.060]   I monetize it in various ways and always looking for partners to make that happen.
[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:23.060]   So let's talk Leo.
[01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:24.300]   Hey, we should hire you.
[01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:25.300]   We should just period.
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:26.300]   Definitely.
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:27.300]   We should definitely do that.
[01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:28.540]   I think I don't want to slow you down.
[01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:33.700]   Oh, no, I can definitely take you to a different, a different level, Leo.
[01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:36.020]   How many times have I heard that before?
[01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:42.780]   So I was at the Madden Bowl party from EA Sports and I realized I didn't know who was
[01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:43.780]   playing.
[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:44.780]   You didn't know?
[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:45.780]   I didn't.
[01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:46.780]   You're at a party?
[01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:50.100]   We've got a fucking Super Bowl party and you didn't know who was playing.
[01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:51.100]   So you're watching right here.
[01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:52.100]   Let's hear this guy talk.
[01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:53.100]   Let's start it from the beginning.
[01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:55.140]   I'm going to set this up for you.
[01:07:55.140 --> 01:08:01.900]   We're watching here as we talk to really intelligent Airbnb engineer to see if he knows
[01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:05.540]   who's playing in the Super Bowl and his so city.
[01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:07.700]   Tell you what, let's do this.
[01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:08.700]   Let's take a break.
[01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:11.500]   We'll show people what they saw this week on Twitch.
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:12.500]   There's some good stuff.
[01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.100]   It was a good week.
[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:19.460]   Little bit of highlights and then we'll come back and we'll visit with that tech girl.
[01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:21.700]   What did we see this week, Jason?
[01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:27.460]   Previously on Twitch, if you want to understand why people use Snapchat, it's fun.
[01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:29.340]   I am a woman.
[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:33.420]   And I am going to replay that and replay that.
[01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:37.220]   This week in computer hardware, they're going to show it at GDC in March.
[01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:43.100]   The ability to build new worlds in Unreal Engine using VR.
[01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:45.660]   I think in this case they're using a Vive.
[01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:47.140]   Tech news today.
[01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:50.660]   We react to YouTubers trying to copyright reactions.
[01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:54.860]   It's very likely that you would have known them by their series of React videos.
[01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:55.860]   Oh yeah.
[01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:58.820]   The Fine Brothers announced initiatives to create something called React World.
[01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:01.820]   Do you want to make your own React videos?
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:03.900]   Go ahead and pay us for a license.
[01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:08.300]   Then people started snooping around and realizing they bought a trademark for the word React.
[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:09.300]   What?
[01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:10.300]   Can we contact them?
[01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:11.300]   Should we write it to the Fine Brothers?
[01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:12.300]   What?
[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:13.300]   This week in Google.
[01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:15.540]   It's from Edward Snowden's trove of documents.
[01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:22.660]   A program, optic nerve, saved one image every five minutes from millions of Yahoo!
[01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:24.580]   Chat users' feeds.
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:29.060]   It would appear a surprising number of people use webcam conversations to show intimate
[01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:32.260]   parts of their body to the other person.
[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:34.260]   Sometimes to be used for broadcasting.
[01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:35.260]   All nogra-fay.
[01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:37.860]   I would generally define nudity as desirable.
[01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:39.780]   Well, that's what's wrong with spies.
[01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:41.780]   They're making war and not loved, Jeff.
[01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:42.780]   Just wait.
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:45.220]   Join the chat room and watch us watching you.
[01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:47.420]   We had a lot of fun.
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:49.460]   I hope you'll come back every week.
[01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:54.540]   Watch Tech News today for PM Pacific, 7 PM Eastern Time, right at midnight UTC for your
[01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:56.140]   daily dose of tech news.
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:57.820]   Actually, I think is Jason here?
[01:09:57.820 --> 01:09:59.300]   Do we have a week ahead?
[01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:00.300]   No.
[01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:03.300]   You went home early.
[01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:04.300]   He's fired.
[01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:05.300]   No.
[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:07.500]   But there will be a lot of good tech news coming up.
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.260]   Actually, we're going to go to Mobile World Congress.
[01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:13.140]   I think we have people going to Barcelona for our Mobile World Congress end of the month.
[01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:14.300]   Lots of new smartphones.
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:19.660]   Now, let us see what that tech girl found out when she asked Geeks.
[01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:21.460]   We did Ask a Techie.
[01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:23.300]   If they knew who was playing in the Super Bowl.
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:24.300]   Exactly.
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:29.420]   Let's roll it.
[01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:30.980]   The Oprah of Silicon Valley.
[01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:31.980]   How are you sitting next to me?
[01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:32.980]   Wow.
[01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:35.420]   Who is playing in the Super Bowl?
[01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:39.860]   The Broncos and someone else.
[01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:40.860]   And who?
[01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:42.860]   This is Ask a Techie.
[01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:46.540]   Who is playing in the Super Bowl?
[01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:47.540]   No.
[01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:48.540]   No idea.
[01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:49.540]   No idea.
[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:50.540]   Does he care?
[01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:51.540]   No, he does not.
[01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:52.540]   Get two friends with us.
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:53.540]   You want two friends?
[01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:55.180]   You got two friends here.
[01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:56.180]   Lifeline.
[01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:57.180]   Get a Lifeline.
[01:10:57.180 --> 01:10:58.180]   I know.
[01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:00.180]   I know it's not the Steelers.
[01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:02.540]   It's not the Steelers.
[01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:04.780]   That's as good a name for the Panthers as any.
[01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:05.780]   Get the Steelers.
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:07.500]   We got 15 seconds.
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.300]   Ask a Techie.
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:13.340]   Who is playing in the Super Bowl?
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:14.340]   No one.
[01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:15.340]   No one's playing.
[01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:16.340]   9.
[01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:17.340]   You know why?
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:19.780]   These Geeks don't care about sport ball.
[01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:22.300]   5, 4, 3.
[01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:25.740]   And that was the point that I was trying to make.
[01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:27.900]   He doesn't even care that he doesn't care.
[01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:28.900]   He doesn't know.
[01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:29.900]   He doesn't know.
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:30.900]   No, he doesn't know.
[01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:31.900]   He doesn't know.
[01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:32.900]   He doesn't know.
[01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:33.900]   He doesn't know.
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:35.900]   I was playing in the Super Bowl.
[01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:37.900]   I was playing in the Super Bowl.
[01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:38.900]   I was playing in the Super Bowl.
[01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:39.900]   I was playing in the Super Bowl.
[01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:40.900]   I was playing in the Super Bowl.
[01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:41.900]   I was playing in the Super Bowl.
[01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:42.900]   I was playing in the Super Bowl.
[01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:43.900]   I was playing in the Super Bowl.
[01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:44.900]   I was playing in the Super Bowl.
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:45.900]   I was playing in the Super Bowl.
[01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:46.900]   I was playing in the Super Bowl.
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:47.900]   I was playing in the Super Bowl.
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:48.900]   I was playing in the Super Bowl.
[01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:49.900]   I was playing in the Super Bowl.
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:50.900]   I was playing in the Super Bowl.
[01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:51.900]   I was playing in the Super Bowl.
[01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:52.900]   I was playing in the Super Bowl.
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:53.900]   I was playing in the Super Bowl.
[01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:54.900]   I was playing in the Super Bowl.
[01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:55.900]   I was playing in the Super Bowl.
[01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:56.900]   I was playing in the Super Bowl.
[01:11:56.900 --> 01:11:57.900]   I was playing in the Super Bowl.
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:03.900]   And now you know why we're doing a show during the Super Bowl.
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:04.900]   Welcome to Tech Super Bowl.
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:08.900]   Philip wrote a great article in Fortune this week.
[01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:12.900]   You actually quote Mark Andreessen's tweet,
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:16.900]   "Apple trades like a steel mill on its way out of business."
[01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:17.900]   You're talking about the Apple stock price,
[01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:21.900]   which despite the fact that Apple announced last week
[01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:25.900]   the most successful quarter in the history of American finance.
[01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:27.900]   The history of capitalism.
[01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:28.900]   The history of capitalism.
[01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:29.900]   Wow.
[01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:30.900]   I love that.
[01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:32.900]   That their stock price went down.
[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:33.900]   Right.
[01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:38.900]   They are trading like a steel mill on its way out of business.
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:41.900]   Can you show the graph that's in the center?
[01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:42.900]   Yeah.
[01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:43.900]   The center active graph behind it.
[01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:44.900]   Okay.
[01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:45.900]   Oh, it's interactive.
[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:46.900]   I can click and do things.
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:47.900]   Yeah.
[01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:51.900]   So here on the first one, you're seeing price per earnings.
[01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:54.900]   Amazon, by the way, this is, it used to be more like eight or nine.
[01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:55.900]   Yeah.
[01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:56.900]   It had left.
[01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:57.900]   It halved.
[01:12:57.900 --> 01:12:58.900]   Yeah.
[01:12:58.900 --> 01:12:59.900]   All right.
[01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:02.900]   And then Apple's just $10.
[01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:04.900]   And they're not counting the cash.
[01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:06.900]   If you take the cash out, it's $8.
[01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:07.900]   Wow.
[01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:09.900]   Now let's look at cash flow.
[01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:10.900]   Whoo!
[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:13.900]   Quite the opposite.
[01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:15.900]   Amazon, $6.
[01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:16.900]   Netflix, $4.
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:17.900]   Facebook, $6.
[01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:18.900]   Apple 57.
[01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:20.900]   These are billions.
[01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:21.900]   That's in billions.
[01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:22.900]   Yeah.
[01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:23.900]   Yeah.
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:24.900]   I didn't think it was $6.
[01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:26.900]   Actually, I should have said $6 billion.
[01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:27.900]   Yeah.
[01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:28.900]   Wow.
[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:29.900]   Now what is free cash flow?
[01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:30.900]   What does that mean?
[01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:31.900]   That's income revenue?
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:33.900]   No, no, that's how much cash you're generating.
[01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:34.900]   Wow.
[01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:35.900]   Yeah.
[01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:36.900]   It's like profit.
[01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:37.900]   Yeah.
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:42.900]   Except you can't spend it because what could you buy for $57 billion?
[01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:44.900]   Well, the trouble is it's all overseas.
[01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:45.900]   Not all of it.
[01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:46.900]   Most of it's overseas.
[01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:51.900]   So what they can do is open Chinese Apple stores and take banks and, you know, old ones.
[01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:57.900]   Why is the stock market so down on a company that's doing so well?
[01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.900]   That's a great question.
[01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:04.900]   Because the market, it's actually a very interesting question.
[01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:08.900]   It rewards growth and Apple stopped growing.
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:12.900]   See, I think that's a failing of our American stock market.
[01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:15.980]   That's why Twitter is struggling, even though they have enough cash to run for another
[01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:21.980]   four hundred twelve years, they're struggling because they don't grow.
[01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:23.540]   Right.
[01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:29.500]   The other thing is the market is really betting on what the next guy is going to be willing
[01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:31.540]   to pay for this stock.
[01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:34.700]   So it really has very little to do with fundamentals.
[01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:37.740]   They're saying, okay, what's the next sucker going to pay?
[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:38.740]   Right.
[01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:43.100]   And then the other thing is they disappointed the analysts.
[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:46.100]   And that's the other part of the stock market.
[01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:49.380]   You set expectations and if you can beat them, the stock goes up.
[01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:51.220]   And if you don't beat them, the stock goes down.
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:54.100]   Except with Apple, the rule is no matter what they do.
[01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:55.100]   The stock goes down.
[01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:56.100]   I know.
[01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:57.100]   Sell on the news.
[01:14:57.100 --> 01:14:58.100]   Any news.
[01:14:58.100 --> 01:14:59.100]   Doesn't matter if there's good news, whatever.
[01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:00.100]   Just sell on the news.
[01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:05.780]   It is kind of interesting that it's really, it's a vicious cycle.
[01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:07.820]   It's self-reinforcing cycle.
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:10.060]   How much is the next guy going to pay?
[01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:12.340]   Well, I'm not going to pay that.
[01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:14.700]   And it just kind of depresses the stock.
[01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:18.900]   But it also has the opposite effect on high flyers where it's inflated.
[01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:23.940]   We're so far removed from the original idea of the stock market, which is you need to
[01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:25.700]   raise some money for a company.
[01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:29.460]   So you sell a piece of your company to raise the capital.
[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:30.940]   Apple doesn't need the capital.
[01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:38.140]   And they're getting killed by algorithms, I think.
[01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:42.900]   These machines that see which way things are trending and they just accelerate the trend
[01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:47.380]   all the way down until it's going to go the other way and then they accelerate it all
[01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:49.220]   the way up.
[01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:54.820]   Eventually, if things are rational, oh, it's Lady Gaga singing.
[01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:55.820]   I can't talk to you.
[01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:56.820]   That's not rational.
[01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:59.620]   We're back to the Super Bowl apparently.
[01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:00.620]   Let's go.
[01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:01.620]   All right.
[01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:03.420]   Let me fire up CBS Sports.com.
[01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:05.580]   Oh, she's doing the national anthem.
[01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:06.580]   I missed it.
[01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:07.580]   Yeah.
[01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:09.900]   I was going to give it a try.
[01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:11.460]   I was going to give it a try.
[01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:13.580]   I was going to skip the game and watch the commercials, but now maybe I'll do it.
[01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:14.580]   That's the only thing I'm interested in.
[01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:15.580]   It's the commercials.
[01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:17.340]   I'm going to do that on YouTube.
[01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:18.540]   Five million dollars.
[01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:21.780]   Square spaces using K and Peele for their commercials.
[01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:22.780]   Really?
[01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:23.780]   Yeah.
[01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:24.780]   That must have cost a little bit, huh?
[01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:25.780]   Oh, wow.
[01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:27.620]   Now, actually, I kind of want to just watch that.
[01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:28.620]   They're great.
[01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:29.620]   Don't you love them?
[01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:30.620]   They're so funny.
[01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:31.620]   Didn't they cancel their show?
[01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:32.820]   They're retired or something.
[01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:33.820]   Yeah.
[01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:34.820]   Yeah.
[01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:36.140]   They decided they wanted to do any more.
[01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:40.020]   So they could make the big money doing commercials for Squarespace, apparently.
[01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:41.500]   I'm not sure.
[01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:43.940]   I think that's really telling.
[01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:47.980]   I really do think that there's a whole thing going on where it's bragging rights.
[01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:48.980]   Oh, it's corporate.
[01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:49.980]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:50.980]   We bought a A&S in all that.
[01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:51.980]   Yeah.
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:53.580]   We can afford that.
[01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:56.580]   We believe in it.
[01:16:56.580 --> 01:17:02.580]   Apple got a fairly large legal decision against them.
[01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:09.940]   They called Vernet X, sued Apple and over infringement.
[01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:11.500]   Vernet X, interesting.
[01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:17.820]   Only has 14 employees, has a little office in Zephyr Cove, Nevada.
[01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:21.100]   They don't really make anything.
[01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:23.900]   They filed suit in Tyler, Texas.
[01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:24.900]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:25.900]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:32.340]   That's where we were going to go if the podcast lawsuit had gone through Tyler, Texas.
[01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:37.820]   It was a patent infringement suit, and I think Vernet X qualifies as a non-practicing
[01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:40.180]   entity, aka a patent role.
[01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:46.580]   They said that Apple infringed on patents in I'm, communications patents, protocols,
[01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:51.660]   an I message, FaceTime VPN on demand as well as Apple devices using the software.
[01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:59.260]   The jury found Apple guilty on all claims and ordered Apple to pay Vernet X and its 14
[01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:04.300]   employees $625.6 million.
[01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:06.220]   That's a successful exit.
[01:18:06.220 --> 01:18:09.700]   Apple has fired for a mistrial.
[01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:14.060]   They often get these reduced as they pursue them.
[01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:18.780]   Apple, they could spend that much money fighting this suit.
[01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:21.580]   I don't know what the economics are, but they...
[01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:25.340]   It's a shame to put a lot of water in that because they have a lot more cash over there.
[01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:26.340]   Yeah.
[01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:27.340]   Why don't they do that?
[01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:31.180]   They give you a lot of problems.
[01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:36.860]   The reason, the justification for mistrial is in the closing arguments.
[01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:41.660]   Apparently, they used arguments outside the evidence.
[01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:48.100]   They broke the rules and misrepresented the testimony of Apple's witnesses.
[01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:49.980]   I think that's probably...
[01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:53.820]   Once you lose a $625 million lawsuit, all you're trying to figure out is, "Well, how
[01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:54.980]   can we keep this thing going?
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:57.260]   How can we avoid writing the check?"
[01:18:57.260 --> 01:18:58.700]   That's not an insignificant check.
[01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:01.300]   As much money as Apple has, that's a lot of money.
[01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:02.300]   Yeah.
[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:03.300]   Sam's...
[01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:05.220]   There's a lot of money.
[01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:08.540]   I think that the word patent troll, I think it maligns trolls.
[01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:12.540]   Trolls at least give nice riddles and they're working the bridge.
[01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:15.220]   I think that that's something we can talk about.
[01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:17.100]   No, I think that the entire...
[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:22.940]   This trial goes all the way back to 2010, where when they first sued them and then it
[01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:23.940]   was...
[01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:25.700]   They won on that one.
[01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:29.660]   Then it was overturned and now they're going back.
[01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:34.260]   It's one of these things that we blame the patent trolls, but really, US patent law is
[01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:36.340]   quite broken.
[01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:42.940]   When you have the patent office has this habit of issuing patents for things that they really
[01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:46.980]   do not understand and they're really, really vague.
[01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:51.780]   We have these non-practicing patent trolls that are not using anything.
[01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:55.020]   They're just really there to win litigations.
[01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:57.380]   You know, Vernad X has been really successful.
[01:19:57.380 --> 01:20:00.700]   They've sued many big companies, but they won 20 million.
[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:04.980]   They were settled, 200 million law suit against Microsoft.
[01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:08.580]   This encourages them to keep at it and unfortunately...
[01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:09.580]   At bankrolls.
[01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:12.700]   Tyler Texas and Marshall Texas, they win.
[01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:18.980]   They're there for a reason because they're very biased towards patent holders.
[01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:19.980]   Right.
[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:20.980]   Maybe biased.
[01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:31.260]   We were told, as some of you know, there was a podcast patent troll since defunct, but they
[01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:39.580]   sued a number of well-known podcasts, including Adam Corolla, saying that they had invented
[01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:41.380]   podcasting.
[01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:45.180]   They were quoting a particular clause of a patent that they got many years ago, like
[01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:48.340]   '95, I think.
[01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:50.780]   It would have been held, I think, in Tyler Texas.
[01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:51.860]   We hired a firm...
[01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:56.020]   I didn't talk about it at the time because on the advice of counsel, we said, "Don't talk
[01:20:56.020 --> 01:20:57.020]   about it.
[01:20:57.020 --> 01:20:58.340]   You don't want to attract attention."
[01:20:58.340 --> 01:20:59.580]   But they didn't sue us.
[01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:02.380]   We got a demand letter for a ridiculous amount of money.
[01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:06.620]   I can't remember what it was, like two and a half million dollars.
[01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:10.740]   Since I knew that even in worst case scenario, defending it would cost about a million and
[01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:13.740]   a half, I thought, "Well, why would I pay you two and a half if I can defend it for a
[01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:15.460]   million and a half?"
[01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:16.580]   So we were actually prepared.
[01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:18.540]   We hired a law firm.
[01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:20.740]   I gave money to the EFF.
[01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:25.980]   The EFF actually was, I think, part instrumental in dismantling the case because there are
[01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:28.420]   two ways you can pursue a patent case.
[01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:30.180]   You can, of course, go to court.
[01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:35.660]   The problem with Tyler Texas and Marshall Texas is, as you say, these are juries that
[01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:39.300]   tend to be in favor of the little guy, right?
[01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:44.300]   It's very often portrayed at the big company, came along and ripped off the little guy's
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:51.180]   invention and justice needs to be done here and the juries go along with it.
[01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:56.620]   There's also, I was told, the judge, there's a particular judge in one of the jurisdictions
[01:21:56.620 --> 01:22:02.940]   who just loves these cases and really kind of embraces them and does feel that very strongly
[01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:07.180]   that this is a case of the little guy standing up to the big guy.
[01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:08.180]   It was a little hard-
[01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:10.060]   -We have revenue for the town, too.
[01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:13.620]   -Oh, absolutely, because all of these companies have little offices in the town.
[01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:16.300]   I think they get a piece of the case, piece of the interesting.
[01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:18.500]   -I think that's how they fund it, actually.
[01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:19.500]   -Wow.
[01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:20.500]   -Wow.
[01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:21.500]   -I didn't know that.
[01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:22.500]   Wow.
[01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:29.660]   -That's why one partner of the patent trials are filed there.
[01:22:29.660 --> 01:22:30.660]   -Amazing.
[01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:33.740]   I thought it was just because they were kind of favorable for the plaintiff, but I guess
[01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:35.780]   there's more to it than that.
[01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:37.500]   It's an industry.
[01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:38.740]   -What happened with your case?
[01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:41.620]   -Well, so the other way you could fight it, if you don't want to fight it in court, is
[01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:47.780]   to go to the U.S. patent, a trademark organization, office.
[01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:53.140]   It turns out that there are so many patents filed in the U.S. and there's so few experts
[01:22:53.140 --> 01:22:57.860]   and so little expertise that in general, the way the patent office works is they'll
[01:22:57.860 --> 01:23:02.500]   prove the patent and say, "Let the courts settle it if it's not a good patent."
[01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:06.740]   They kind of expect there to be a certain amount of litigation around many of these patents.
[01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:12.580]   It's not quite rubber stamped, but they don't spend a lot of time looking for prior art,
[01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:14.100]   things like that.
[01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:17.180]   Another way you can pursue it, and this is what the Electronic Frontier Foundation elected
[01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:22.020]   to do, is something called an inter-partase suit, where you go to the patent and trademark
[01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:26.300]   office and you say, "We want to contest the patent."
[01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:29.700]   Now our attorney told us this is a very risky move.
[01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:33.540]   If you win, it's only $100,000.
[01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:36.060]   It's not expensive compared to a trial.
[01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:40.620]   But if you lose, it becomes very hard to win against a jury because then the opposing
[01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:45.380]   attorney says, "Well, you know, they tried to get this patent overturned.
[01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:48.740]   They went back to the U.S. patent and trademark office and they did everything they could
[01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:52.940]   and you know what the U.S. patent and trademark office said, "They said our patent is good."
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:54.700]   Is that your Texas accent?
[01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:55.700]   Yes.
[01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:56.700]   You don't like it?
[01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:57.700]   I'm a Texan.
[01:23:57.700 --> 01:23:58.700]   Yeah, I know you are.
[01:23:58.700 --> 01:23:59.700]   It's terrible.
[01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:00.700]   We don't talk like that in Texas.
[01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:03.740]   Well, you're making me feel quiet at home right now.
[01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:06.900]   You're all done.
[01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:09.420]   I just submit that this is a company here.
[01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:10.980]   Oh, this is a company.
[01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:11.980]   I'm not sure.
[01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:14.980]   That was a Texas accent in 1932.
[01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:17.380]   I got this as a spenders.
[01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:23.060]   Anyway, no, in fact, the attorney that was representing the podcast troll was from New
[01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:29.020]   York and our attorney said, "That's actually tactically a mistake on the part of the non-practicing
[01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:32.460]   entity because generally you want a good old boy lawyer down there.
[01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:40.900]   You don't want anybody from New York with those New York values coming down here."
[01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:43.940]   There were other technical mistakes that this company pursued.
[01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:49.420]   In other words, they weren't very good at being a patent troll.
[01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:52.900]   For instance, the demand letter, you're not supposed to ask for so much money because
[01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:55.100]   that incense people to fight you.
[01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:57.980]   What you want to do is ask for less than it would cost to fight.
[01:24:57.980 --> 01:25:02.900]   Look, we will settle this for $100,000.
[01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:06.620]   Apparently, they didn't know much.
[01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:09.820]   The good news is the EFF took the risk.
[01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:12.180]   A risk that hadn't been up to me, I probably wouldn't have taken.
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:16.820]   I would have followed Adam Corolla's plan, which was to meet him in court.
[01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:19.180]   Corolla was said, "We're going to fight this."
[01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:20.180]   He raised money.
[01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:22.740]   He'd had a crowd funding campaign and everything.
[01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:26.140]   But fortunately, the EFF prevailed and the patent trademark office did, in fact, overturn
[01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:27.140]   the patent.
[01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:29.500]   The whole thing just went away.
[01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:34.380]   Not that it will go away forever because there's lots of companies like this non-practicing
[01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:36.300]   entities who...
[01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:37.300]   It's a business model.
[01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:43.540]   In fact, shamefully, I think one of Microsoft's smartest people, Nathan Merfold, actually
[01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:48.980]   has a business kind of essentially doing this.
[01:25:48.980 --> 01:25:51.580]   They've got thousands of patents.
[01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:54.220]   They've patented every idea they could think of.
[01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:58.060]   And acquired many, many, many, many, many more.
[01:25:58.060 --> 01:25:59.540]   Have they actually sued anybody?
[01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:07.940]   Well, here's the thing that's interesting because it's called intellectual ventures.
[01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:10.740]   He founded it in 2000.
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:17.300]   They have 40,000 patents in their portfolio.
[01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:22.300]   Most of them were not created by them, but were acquired by them.
[01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:26.420]   The question is, well, what is happening with these patents?
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:31.260]   It seems to be the case, if you listen, there was a really good podcast put together by
[01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:33.580]   this American life on this subject.
[01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:38.460]   And I think the Planet Money guys also did a good podcast on this.
[01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:43.100]   But it turns out that there are a lot of shell companies that seem to have been started
[01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:46.220]   by intellectual ventures that are doing the actual suing.
[01:26:46.220 --> 01:26:50.220]   I don't know if the intellectual ventures was founded to sue.
[01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:57.340]   You see right on the front page, license our patents, buy our patents, sell your patents.
[01:26:57.340 --> 01:27:00.020]   So their business really is as a patent marketplace.
[01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:03.820]   I imagine that's what Mervold, who is, I don't think, I mean, this guy's got a lot
[01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:05.820]   going for him.
[01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:09.220]   He was chief strategist and chief technology officer at Microsoft.
[01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:11.220]   It's quite a brilliant guy.
[01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:18.500]   My guess is he wanted to create a patent marketplace, but they have $3 billion in licensing
[01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:20.340]   revenue.
[01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:23.460]   So clearly there is a business in this.
[01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:30.180]   And yes, they haven't gone to court, but the evidence is apparently that they've created
[01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:33.980]   some shell companies to pursue these patents in court.
[01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:36.880]   Hey, here's a question mark for you.
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:39.300]   Is Amazon really going to open 400 bookstores?
[01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:43.780]   And what the hell helps out is that crazy talk?
[01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:46.580]   Now, this doesn't come from Amazon.
[01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:55.300]   This comes from a mall CEO, a guy who runs a mall company, chief executive of general
[01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:56.740]   growth properties.
[01:27:56.740 --> 01:28:03.980]   He was on an earnings call and probably somewhat in opportunity said, well, you've got Amazon
[01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:05.660]   opening brick and mortar bookstores.
[01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:10.340]   Their goal is to open as I understand three to 400.
[01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:15.060]   I can't imagine Amazon was too happy about that news leaking out.
[01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:16.500]   He's off the Christmas list.
[01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:17.500]   Yeah.
[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:24.020]   The real question is, is that really what Amazon's thinking?
[01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:29.660]   Why would you open a single bookstore, which they did in Seattle, let alone 400 bookstores?
[01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:36.580]   The only reason that I could think for them to do that would be to directly compete against
[01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:40.700]   other brick and mortar stores, man, to force them to close down.
[01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:47.380]   Because it's so much more expensive to carry stock and to deal with building and people
[01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:51.660]   and issues that that comes up with, whereas they're so successful with the business model
[01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:54.380]   that they have now.
[01:28:54.380 --> 01:29:00.700]   One theory I heard was that they might use it as shipping way stations.
[01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:05.140]   Not stores at all, or just as long as you have the space, have a little showroom.
[01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:06.140]   See, they do have stuff.
[01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:10.780]   I think they can put the echo there, the Kindle Fire there.
[01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:15.220]   I guess some books.
[01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:17.220]   Do you have that cartoon, Leo?
[01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:20.380]   Yes, this is Joy of Tech, right?
[01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:22.460]   Nitro Zach and Snacky, who are wonderful.
[01:29:22.460 --> 01:29:24.940]   In fact, they do our album art.
[01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:26.780]   Let me see if I can...
[01:29:26.780 --> 01:29:28.980]   You got the link?
[01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:31.180]   I know it's in the doc.
[01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:32.940]   Let me pull it up here.
[01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:33.940]   Oops.
[01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:36.420]   It was in the email.
[01:29:36.420 --> 01:29:37.820]   I don't know if it made it to the doc.
[01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:39.260]   Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was.
[01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:40.700]   Here it is.
[01:29:40.700 --> 01:29:47.100]   The Amazon Store experience as envisioned by Nitro Zach and Snaggy, they now work for
[01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:49.340]   Recode, which is great.
[01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:53.260]   First of all, you walk up to a telepresence device with a human in the screen.
[01:29:53.260 --> 01:29:55.740]   Hello, George Smith of 25 Pine Street.
[01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:57.300]   Welcome to the Amazon Store.
[01:29:57.300 --> 01:30:01.300]   I am Bezos 3000, your personal assistant robot.
[01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:02.300]   Wow.
[01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:03.300]   Awesome.
[01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:08.020]   Your online data indicates you've previously purchased many books on overcoming laziness.
[01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:11.140]   Would you like to visit our procrastination section?
[01:30:11.140 --> 01:30:13.700]   Okay, but keep it quiet.
[01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:14.700]   Everyone can hear you.
[01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:18.460]   I've noticed your online shopping cart has an item in it that was never purchased.
[01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:21.580]   Would you like to buy that sexy babes calendar now?
[01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:25.620]   No, and please quit telling everyone what I've looked at online.
[01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:28.140]   Your purchase history includes several books on mental illness.
[01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:32.260]   Would you like me to escort you to our self-help mental illness section?
[01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:36.660]   By the way, do you need more rash cream for your itchy scrotum?
[01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:38.540]   Shut up.
[01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:41.660]   Did you know President Obama knows exactly what he's doing?
[01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:43.060]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:44.060]   I'm sorry.
[01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:45.060]   Run robot.
[01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:46.060]   Whoa.
[01:30:46.060 --> 01:30:47.060]   That called me.
[01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:48.980]   That was an active self-defense.
[01:30:48.980 --> 01:30:52.740]   This is precisely why we recommend the How to Control Your Fits of Rage book a few weeks
[01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:53.740]   ago.
[01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:54.740]   Yeah, that's good.
[01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:55.740]   I like it.
[01:30:55.740 --> 01:30:56.740]   That is one concern.
[01:30:56.740 --> 01:30:58.540]   Of course, Amazon does know everything.
[01:30:58.540 --> 01:31:01.740]   Especially if you have an echo.
[01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:03.740]   They're not listening to me.
[01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:05.580]   They're listening, Leo.
[01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:06.580]   Really?
[01:31:06.580 --> 01:31:07.580]   Do you think so?
[01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:08.580]   I don't think so.
[01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:09.580]   I know so.
[01:31:09.580 --> 01:31:10.580]   No.
[01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:11.580]   Why would they listen?
[01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:13.900]   Believe me, if they're listening to my house, they're not hearing anything good.
[01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:15.340]   It's not that they are listening.
[01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:16.580]   It's that they could be listening.
[01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:18.380]   No, they could be.
[01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:20.020]   You could be.
[01:31:20.020 --> 01:31:21.020]   Everything could be.
[01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:23.260]   There could be bugs in the walls from the Russian embassy.
[01:31:23.260 --> 01:31:27.500]   No, but it's so much harder to make bugs in the wall versus the government asking to
[01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:29.420]   turn on your internal mic on your phone.
[01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:31.820]   It actually installed this particular bug myself.
[01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:33.300]   In fact, like so much of us.
[01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:34.300]   You've installed yourself.
[01:31:34.300 --> 01:31:36.300]   You've been a second one for that.
[01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:37.300]   That's true.
[01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:39.300]   That's a good point.
[01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:42.460]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:45.100]   I got to hustle along here.
[01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:46.700]   We got to move along.
[01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:48.100]   Got stuff to talk about.
[01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:50.060]   And apparently there's a game going on.
[01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:52.060]   Our show today, but ads have started.
[01:31:52.060 --> 01:31:53.060]   And they started.
[01:31:53.060 --> 01:31:54.060]   Damn it.
[01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:55.060]   I'm missing the ads.
[01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:58.060]   How many times do we send out?
[01:31:58.060 --> 01:31:59.060]   Damn it.
[01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:00.060]   I'm missing the ads.
[01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:02.820]   Don't miss this ad because we love Audible.
[01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:04.340]   I am an Audible fanatic.
[01:32:04.340 --> 01:32:06.980]   Have been since the year 2000 when I first joined Audible.
[01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:11.300]   Audible saved me from road rage more times than I can count.
[01:32:11.300 --> 01:32:15.540]   Well, seriously, I had a two hour commute on a good day.
[01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:20.300]   It could be four hours on a bad day to San Francisco from Petaluma and driving back and
[01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:22.220]   forth to tech TV.
[01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:28.380]   And you know, after the 80th time I heard hit me baby one more time, I decided I should
[01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:32.220]   listen to something more edifying than Britney Spears on the radio.
[01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:34.380]   So I started listening to audiobooks and Audible.
[01:32:34.380 --> 01:32:35.860]   In those days, it was very early.
[01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:39.700]   You know, I had a diamond Rio MP3 player and you had to was complicated to get the book
[01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:40.700]   on there.
[01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:41.700]   Now it's easy.
[01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:42.700]   Now it's great.
[01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:43.700]   You know, it's on your phone.
[01:32:43.700 --> 01:32:44.860]   It's on your laptop.
[01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:45.860]   It's everywhere.
[01:32:45.860 --> 01:32:50.100]   You want to be great books written read by the best readers ever.
[01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:53.020]   I'm listening now because I'm all excited about going to see Hamilton.
[01:32:53.020 --> 01:32:56.220]   I want to go see the Broadway show handle and I haven't done tickets or anything, but
[01:32:56.220 --> 01:32:58.340]   you know, I'm aspirationally thinking.
[01:32:58.340 --> 01:33:02.380]   So I got the Ron Chernow, a biography of Hamilton, which is awesome.
[01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:06.940]   36 hours and 59 minutes of revolutionary order.
[01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:07.940]   Yeah.
[01:33:07.940 --> 01:33:08.940]   Okay.
[01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:09.940]   You're making you not into that?
[01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:12.020]   How about the life changing magic of tidying up?
[01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:15.220]   Have you read Marie Kondo's masterpiece yet, Georgia down?
[01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:16.220]   No, I haven't.
[01:33:16.220 --> 01:33:17.460]   Do you know about it?
[01:33:17.460 --> 01:33:18.460]   No, I don't.
[01:33:18.460 --> 01:33:19.980]   Oh my God.
[01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:21.540]   It's all the rage now.
[01:33:21.540 --> 01:33:22.540]   Maybe not in.
[01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:24.540]   Maybe hasn't gotten to Canada yet.
[01:33:24.540 --> 01:33:25.540]   Exactly.
[01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:27.340]   We always have to wait like another six months.
[01:33:27.340 --> 01:33:28.340]   I don't know.
[01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:30.940]   Your room looks awfully tidy.
[01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:32.780]   I won't turn the camera around.
[01:33:32.780 --> 01:33:33.780]   Okay.
[01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:34.780]   Not really.
[01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:35.780]   Okay.
[01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:36.780]   This side is.
[01:33:36.780 --> 01:33:37.780]   This is an inspiring book.
[01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:38.780]   Marie Kondo.
[01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:40.580]   It's a no.
[01:33:40.580 --> 01:33:42.940]   No, see, that's the problem.
[01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:47.700]   She says, sorry, she says, if you think in those terms, you're going to relapse immediately.
[01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:48.700]   Oh, sorry.
[01:33:48.700 --> 01:33:49.860]   No, no.
[01:33:49.860 --> 01:33:54.540]   What you have to do is you pick, you go through all your stuff that category, not by location.
[01:33:54.540 --> 01:33:57.020]   So you start with clothes, that's the easiest because you're going to end with personal
[01:33:57.020 --> 01:33:58.620]   mementos as the hardest.
[01:33:58.620 --> 01:34:02.940]   And you look at each item and you say, does it spark joy?
[01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:03.940]   That's a good plan.
[01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:04.940]   That's a good plan.
[01:34:04.940 --> 01:34:05.940]   I do.
[01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:10.020]   We did a show a long time ago about decluttering and I would like take like, you know, everything
[01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:12.620]   off and then like, you know, you put it into three piles.
[01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:13.620]   This one I like.
[01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:14.620]   This one makes me feel good.
[01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:16.420]   No, no, she says that's too complicated.
[01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:17.420]   There's two.
[01:34:17.420 --> 01:34:18.420]   It's binary.
[01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:19.420]   Does this spark joy?
[01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:22.860]   If it doesn't, you thank the item for its service.
[01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:23.860]   Exactly.
[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:27.580]   You've done this and you say goodbye.
[01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:31.460]   And the thing is, if you do this properly and you go through, you do it in a big swoop
[01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:37.540]   because what you want is like this perfect, Zen-like experience of your new clutter-free
[01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:38.900]   environment.
[01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:43.300]   She says because the magic of that will make sure you never clutter it again because you
[01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:44.740]   love it so much.
[01:34:44.740 --> 01:34:48.220]   You just put things away from now and it's not about getting better containers.
[01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:50.780]   It's not about, it's about getting rid anyway.
[01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:51.780]   This is not an ad for this.
[01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:52.780]   You did that on audio.
[01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:54.140]   You did that on Audible.
[01:34:54.140 --> 01:34:56.820]   I am listening to it on Audible and I love it.
[01:34:56.820 --> 01:34:59.260]   Are you listening or actively executing?
[01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:00.260]   Okay.
[01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:04.820]   So, so I'm gearing up.
[01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:05.900]   I'm gearing up.
[01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:09.020]   I don't want to do it until I've listened to the whole book and I'm trying to spread
[01:35:09.020 --> 01:35:11.020]   this book out a lot.
[01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:13.740]   It's only four hours and 50 minutes.
[01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:15.140]   It's taken me months.
[01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:16.260]   But I want to get it right.
[01:35:16.260 --> 01:35:19.060]   I want to know every detail before I begin.
[01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:20.060]   You don't want to make any.
[01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:21.060]   That sounds like a stall.
[01:35:21.060 --> 01:35:23.060]   I always want to go out and talk to me, Georgia.
[01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:28.820]   I suspect I should go to the procrastination section of the book.
[01:35:28.820 --> 01:35:31.580]   I'm also, I mean, there's so much there's science fiction.
[01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:32.580]   There's fiction.
[01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:33.580]   I just got the latest.
[01:35:33.580 --> 01:35:35.220]   I'm a huge William Gibson fan.
[01:35:35.220 --> 01:35:38.020]   Just got the latest William Gibson.
[01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:41.300]   Audible is a great and you got kids.
[01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:43.860]   You have, you don't have daughters though, Georgia, do you?
[01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:45.060]   Because I don't have daughters.
[01:35:45.060 --> 01:35:47.940]   See, if you had a girl, I'd say reader the secret garden.
[01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:49.580]   I don't know if boys would be as into this.
[01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:50.580]   Maybe they would.
[01:35:50.580 --> 01:35:52.300]   I remember reading this to my kid.
[01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:56.860]   And the thing is, it turns out, you might think, oh, I don't want to get my kids audio
[01:35:56.860 --> 01:35:57.860]   books.
[01:35:57.860 --> 01:35:58.860]   Then they won't read.
[01:35:58.860 --> 01:35:59.960]   No, research shows.
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:02.780]   It actually turns them into readers because they start to love the book.
[01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:04.940]   Then they pick up the book.
[01:36:04.940 --> 01:36:08.780]   Francis Hodgum Burnett's classic, the secret garden.
[01:36:08.780 --> 01:36:10.660]   Harry Potter, all of them.
[01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:12.420]   So beautifully read by Jim Dale.
[01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:14.180]   He really brings them to life.
[01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:15.180]   I can go on and on.
[01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:16.180]   Here's the deal.
[01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:17.180]   We're going to get you two books.
[01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:18.620]   If you've never, oh, interesting.
[01:36:18.620 --> 01:36:20.860]   In a different key, the story of autism.
[01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:21.860]   Interesting.
[01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:25.500]   I think this is something you would probably want to read.
[01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:29.060]   There's stuff for professional development.
[01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:34.820]   They have the entire catalog of the great courses, which means these are the best college
[01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:37.500]   courses, the best college lecturers.
[01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:42.900]   And so physics and geography, any subject you'd be interested in, we'll look at Hamilton,
[01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:49.860]   the Revolution by Lynn Moranu, Emmanuel Miranda, the guy who wrote the, oh man, this is, I've
[01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:51.460]   got to read this too.
[01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:54.060]   He's going to make a book.
[01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:55.660]   This is from the play.
[01:36:55.660 --> 01:36:57.260]   Anyway, I'm sorry.
[01:36:57.260 --> 01:36:58.340]   See how easily I get distracted?
[01:36:58.340 --> 01:36:59.340]   I love Audible.
[01:36:59.340 --> 01:37:00.340]   You will love it too.
[01:37:00.340 --> 01:37:03.300]   If you haven't listened to audiobooks, maybe you're a little nervous about the whole idea.
[01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:04.980]   Get two books free right now.
[01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:11.180]   Go to audible.com/twit and the number two, you'll be signing up for the platinum account.
[01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:14.780]   It's two books a month, but your first month's free so you can cancel that first month.
[01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:16.780]   You keep the books, but you pay nothing.
[01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:21.300]   You also get the daily digest in the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal.
[01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:24.980]   So many, so many great books.
[01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:29.900]   Maggie Guillenhaal reading Sylvia Plath's a Bell jar.
[01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:31.900]   Wouldn't that be amazing?
[01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:32.900]   Wouldn't see?
[01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:34.900]   You see what I'm saying?
[01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:41.900]   Scarlett Johansson reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.
[01:37:41.900 --> 01:37:48.020]   I love Audible and I love really long books because they last for weeks.
[01:37:48.020 --> 01:37:53.220]   So I'm just looking at the power broker by Robert Caro.
[01:37:53.220 --> 01:37:54.300]   Oh, I love that.
[01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:56.500]   That's the Lyndon Johnson biography.
[01:37:56.500 --> 01:37:58.500]   66 hours.
[01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:01.900]   I just finished the rise and followed the third right about Hitler.
[01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:02.900]   57 hours.
[01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:06.060]   John Shirer, one of the great histories.
[01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:07.060]   You know what?
[01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:08.060]   I'd like to listen to that again.
[01:38:08.060 --> 01:38:12.300]   So if you're interested in World War II, there's a really good book.
[01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:17.460]   It turns out that a lot of the research from Shirer's time, Shirer covered it for the...
[01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:18.460]   Yeah, he was there.
[01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:19.460]   He was there.
[01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:24.820]   But what we knew is what from the allies side, what we didn't know is from the Russians
[01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:26.060]   side.
[01:38:26.060 --> 01:38:31.300]   So after the fall of the Soviet Union, a lot of the Russian documentary information about
[01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:37.500]   World War II has emerged and there was a new book written on World War II, New History,
[01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:40.300]   which incorporates much of the new information.
[01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:43.260]   Oh, I wish I could find this.
[01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:44.460]   I'll find it for you.
[01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:45.780]   I read it unaudible.
[01:38:45.780 --> 01:38:46.780]   Listen to it unaudible.
[01:38:46.780 --> 01:38:48.460]   People get mad when I say I read it unaudible.
[01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:49.460]   It's like reading.
[01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:50.460]   I got every word.
[01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:51.460]   Definitely.
[01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:53.220]   Somebody read it to me.
[01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:54.220]   So I'm lazy.
[01:38:54.220 --> 01:38:58.940]   Well, it's nice because you can do that passively while you're doing other things.
[01:38:58.940 --> 01:38:59.940]   So if you're...
[01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:00.940]   There you go.
[01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:04.420]   You can do the first TV while you're doing all of the cleaning in your house or if you're
[01:39:04.420 --> 01:39:07.500]   decluttering or avoiding decluttering something else.
[01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:08.500]   You see what I'm saying?
[01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:11.820]   You can listen to a book and then you don't feel like you're wasting your time.
[01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:13.340]   And I love the idea of road trips.
[01:39:13.340 --> 01:39:17.380]   We listened to Dune on road trip all the way to Florida and it was great.
[01:39:17.380 --> 01:39:19.820]   So we got something that kept everyone awake.
[01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:21.340]   We were interested.
[01:39:21.340 --> 01:39:22.340]   It was fun.
[01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:23.340]   Kept the kids quiet.
[01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:24.340]   It was great with the kids.
[01:39:24.340 --> 01:39:25.340]   And we used to tack on road trips.
[01:39:25.340 --> 01:39:26.340]   So...
[01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:29.500]   Yeah, if you're doing road trips having an audio book that everybody likes, we did listen
[01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:32.540]   to the ups and downs of being brown, which was fabulous.
[01:39:32.540 --> 01:39:33.540]   Holes.
[01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:34.540]   These are all young adult.
[01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:36.860]   They've got great young adult fiction.
[01:39:36.860 --> 01:39:38.580]   I'm such a fan of Audible.
[01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:39.580]   Anyway, I don't know.
[01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:42.060]   We've made this an 18 hour commercial for some reason.
[01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:43.060]   You know why?
[01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:44.060]   It's really like it.
[01:39:44.060 --> 01:39:45.060]   Because we love it.
[01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:46.060]   It's good.
[01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:47.060]   That's really why.
[01:39:47.060 --> 01:39:48.060]   We actually use it.
[01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:49.060]   Yeah, definitely.
[01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:50.060]   It's fun because a lot of our hosts are Audible fans.
[01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:52.540]   So like when Paul Therrott and I are doing Windows Weekly, we'll do the same thing.
[01:39:52.540 --> 01:39:53.540]   We'll go away.
[01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:54.540]   If you listen to...
[01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:56.540]   In fact, he's the one who told me about the World War II history.
[01:39:56.540 --> 01:39:58.180]   I'm still looking for that.
[01:39:58.180 --> 01:39:59.180]   Audible.com.
[01:39:59.180 --> 01:40:04.020]   Your first two books are free.
[01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:05.420]   Here it is, Philip.
[01:40:05.420 --> 01:40:08.500]   The storm of war, a new history of the Second World War.
[01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:12.820]   If you just finished the rise and fall of the Third Reich, this would be a good companion
[01:40:12.820 --> 01:40:18.660]   volume because it has all this new information from the Soviet side, which I found.
[01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:20.380]   And this guy is a very, very good writer.
[01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:21.780]   I love this stuff.
[01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:22.780]   History.
[01:40:22.780 --> 01:40:24.340]   Nothing better.
[01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:26.340]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:29.620]   Frankly, Audible is more interested than...
[01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:30.620]   Actually, you know what?
[01:40:30.620 --> 01:40:32.940]   Amazon and the bookstores, they could have audio books from Audible.
[01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:33.940]   They own Audible.
[01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:34.940]   Definitely.
[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:35.940]   They could have...
[01:40:35.940 --> 01:40:36.940]   Oh, be fun.
[01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:37.940]   Oh man.
[01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:41.220]   As long as you're going to open something as retro as a bookstore, let's get listening
[01:40:41.220 --> 01:40:47.140]   booths and you could go in and listen to a record and see if you like it or listen to
[01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:48.140]   an audio book.
[01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:50.340]   I think you went one too far with records.
[01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:52.340]   But I think we were on the radio.
[01:40:52.340 --> 01:40:54.340]   In there, doesn't that.
[01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:59.780]   We were definitely on board with you on that one, Leo.
[01:40:59.780 --> 01:41:03.420]   Do you remember Philip Elmer to go into record stores and listening to records in little
[01:41:03.420 --> 01:41:04.420]   bit?
[01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:05.420]   Yeah.
[01:41:05.420 --> 01:41:06.420]   Yeah.
[01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:07.420]   I think that that's...
[01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:08.420]   Now you just steal it from the internet.
[01:41:08.420 --> 01:41:09.420]   Yeah, you steal it.
[01:41:09.420 --> 01:41:11.580]   Yeah, I'm sampling.
[01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:13.820]   Actually with Spotify, you're not even stealing it.
[01:41:13.820 --> 01:41:14.820]   You just...
[01:41:14.820 --> 01:41:15.820]   No, I'm the same thing for you.
[01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:17.380]   It's kind of amazing.
[01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:18.380]   Yeah.
[01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:24.420]   By the way, Jeff Bezos is worth $57 billion.
[01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:31.580]   That makes him number four on the list of the richest people on earth and the world's
[01:41:31.580 --> 01:41:37.660]   richest tech CEO, eclipsing Larry Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page, Sergey Brin,
[01:41:37.660 --> 01:41:41.740]   $57 billion.
[01:41:41.740 --> 01:41:45.580]   And that's what kind of artificially reduced stock price.
[01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:47.820]   I mean, if it really...
[01:41:47.820 --> 01:41:49.500]   Is this Forbes list?
[01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:50.860]   No, this is...
[01:41:50.860 --> 01:41:53.860]   So business and cider is doing it with WealthX.
[01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:54.860]   Oh.
[01:41:54.860 --> 01:41:59.380]   And I don't know how this compares to the famous Forbes list.
[01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:01.460]   It should be fairly close, I would think.
[01:42:01.460 --> 01:42:05.860]   Bezos has 18% stake in Amazon.
[01:42:05.860 --> 01:42:07.180]   So that's part of the reason.
[01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:10.140]   He still owns 18% of Amazon.
[01:42:10.140 --> 01:42:11.140]   I hope he said...
[01:42:11.140 --> 01:42:13.060]   So when you hit those kind of numbers, they're numbers I just...
[01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:14.060]   I couldn't comprehend.
[01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:15.060]   Meaningless.
[01:42:15.060 --> 01:42:17.140]   It's just too much.
[01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:21.100]   I don't understand how much money you must have.
[01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:22.500]   Did you all read the article?
[01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:29.020]   I thought this was really interesting.
[01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:34.460]   Actually it was a study called Going Dark, coming out of the Berkman Center for Internet
[01:42:34.460 --> 01:42:36.900]   and Society at Harvard.
[01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:46.700]   It was a study of the landscape of government surveillance for a one of a better word.
[01:42:46.700 --> 01:42:49.940]   Don't panic making progress on the Going Dark debate.
[01:42:49.940 --> 01:42:55.580]   And the debate is really kind of formulated by, on the one hand, the director of the FBI,
[01:42:55.580 --> 01:42:58.620]   James Comey, who says, "We're going dark.
[01:42:58.620 --> 01:43:05.260]   We can't read the bad guys' communications anymore because they're using modern encryption.
[01:43:05.260 --> 01:43:08.620]   And we need a way to read modern encryption."
[01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:14.380]   And on the other hand, believe it or not, places like the NSA who's saying, "Oh, no,
[01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:15.380]   encryption.
[01:43:15.380 --> 01:43:17.140]   Everybody needs that."
[01:43:17.140 --> 01:43:19.380]   Which is weird.
[01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:20.380]   We talked on Monday.
[01:43:20.380 --> 01:43:21.380]   I did a triangulation.
[01:43:21.380 --> 01:43:31.020]   It was a great episode of triangulation with a guy who was a former advisor to Hillary Clinton
[01:43:31.020 --> 01:43:32.580]   for four years as Secretary of State.
[01:43:32.580 --> 01:43:34.260]   So we worked in government.
[01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:40.060]   Like Alec Ross, his new book was about new industries that are springing up thanks to
[01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:41.900]   technological innovation.
[01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:45.460]   But he said, "The government is not monolithic on this.
[01:43:45.460 --> 01:43:49.620]   There is an active split in government between those like Comey who think, "We've got to
[01:43:49.620 --> 01:43:51.580]   have backdoors."
[01:43:51.580 --> 01:43:54.940]   And those like, believe it or not, he says, "The NSA who says, "No, no, you can't have
[01:43:54.940 --> 01:43:56.820]   a backdoor that makes everything insecure."
[01:43:56.820 --> 01:43:57.820]   Right.
[01:43:57.820 --> 01:44:03.180]   The NSA actually knows how it works as opposed to Congress, which doesn't.
[01:44:03.180 --> 01:44:05.300]   And Comey, which doesn't.
[01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:11.260]   But anyway, this Berkman study maybe should help them understand a little bit better because
[01:44:11.260 --> 01:44:18.500]   they say more than the resources for law enforcement today are more than adequate to
[01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:20.140]   tracking suspects.
[01:44:20.140 --> 01:44:26.180]   Thanks to the Internet of Things, technologies, everything packed with sensors and wireless
[01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:27.180]   technologies.
[01:44:27.180 --> 01:44:30.140]   It doesn't matter if they can't read the messages.
[01:44:30.140 --> 01:44:33.140]   They know everything else.
[01:44:33.140 --> 01:44:35.620]   So this is an interesting response everybody should.
[01:44:35.620 --> 01:44:40.380]   If you don't want to download and read the PDF, which is available from the Berkman Center,
[01:44:40.380 --> 01:44:44.620]   you can read articles like this from the New York Times, David E. Sanger, "New technologies
[01:44:44.620 --> 01:44:50.300]   give government ample means to track suspects, study, fines."
[01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:53.380]   And I hope members of Congress at least read this.
[01:44:53.380 --> 01:44:56.900]   And state legislators, because that's the other thing that's happening.
[01:44:56.900 --> 01:45:01.940]   Okay, I want to be careful here because I'm sure there's some intelligent state legislators.
[01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:07.340]   If there's anybody dumber than a member of Congress, it's a member of the state assembly.
[01:45:07.340 --> 01:45:09.340]   That's a guy who couldn't get to Congress.
[01:45:09.340 --> 01:45:10.340]   Am I?
[01:45:10.340 --> 01:45:11.340]   Is that wrong to say?
[01:45:11.340 --> 01:45:12.340]   Is that a bad thing to say?
[01:45:12.340 --> 01:45:14.100]   I think it's a bad thing to say to them.
[01:45:14.100 --> 01:45:15.580]   Yeah, I wouldn't say in person.
[01:45:15.580 --> 01:45:18.180]   If you're listening and you're a member of the state assembly, it's not you I'm talking
[01:45:18.180 --> 01:45:19.180]   about.
[01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:24.860]   But it turns out in a number of states, of course, including California, members of the
[01:45:24.860 --> 01:45:31.740]   local legislatures are proposing really bad idea, backdoor stuff.
[01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:33.340]   Maybe they could read this as well.
[01:45:33.340 --> 01:45:37.020]   Well, they're not really saying that they want that like they're saying they want the
[01:45:37.020 --> 01:45:41.460]   back doors to track terrorists, but really they want to snoop on other members so that
[01:45:41.460 --> 01:45:46.700]   they can use that as leveraging tools in order to change people's votes, deal with what
[01:45:46.700 --> 01:45:50.420]   they're saying, find out which way people lean.
[01:45:50.420 --> 01:45:54.140]   It's more about information than it is actually to track people because you can see that the
[01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:58.620]   statistics show that they really haven't used this to catch terrorists.
[01:45:58.620 --> 01:46:05.060]   Yeah, the California Assemblyman Jim Cooper submitted a bill which is very similar to
[01:46:05.060 --> 01:46:10.660]   one also submitted in New York state that would require device manufacturers and operating
[01:46:10.660 --> 01:46:16.980]   system vendors who want to sell devices in California after January 1st of next year
[01:46:16.980 --> 01:46:18.620]   to provide a crypto backdoor.
[01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:20.140]   Oh, geez.
[01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:22.460]   You want to do business in California?
[01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:24.860]   You better hobble your system.
[01:46:24.860 --> 01:46:28.180]   You have $2,500 for every device that doesn't comply.
[01:46:28.180 --> 01:46:34.220]   Of course, if California passed such a bill, it wouldn't matter that the rest of the country
[01:46:34.220 --> 01:46:42.500]   didn't because Apple's going to want to sell iPhones in California, I think.
[01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:44.660]   In just incredible.
[01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:52.860]   By the way, they never say it's, they always say it's for things like we got to stop trafficking.
[01:46:52.860 --> 01:46:53.860]   That's the excuse he used.
[01:46:53.860 --> 01:46:57.380]   We got to stop trafficking.
[01:46:57.380 --> 01:47:00.420]   I don't think they want to spy on other politicians.
[01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:03.380]   I think they just think it's a political win for them.
[01:47:03.380 --> 01:47:04.380]   Maybe.
[01:47:04.380 --> 01:47:08.620]   I think they're going to get votes if they take this stand and they're ignorant.
[01:47:08.620 --> 01:47:10.860]   They don't know how encryption works.
[01:47:10.860 --> 01:47:14.540]   Well, now this guy is a former law enforcement officer.
[01:47:14.540 --> 01:47:18.300]   He says, yeah, the cops think they need it.
[01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:19.300]   Yeah.
[01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:22.940]   He says you can get a warrant for pretty much anything and everything, not quite true, but
[01:47:22.940 --> 01:47:25.980]   you can get a warrant for pretty much anything and everything, but not for an iPhone or an
[01:47:25.980 --> 01:47:26.980]   iPad.
[01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:27.980]   That's mind boggling.
[01:47:27.980 --> 01:47:29.300]   There is a point to be made there.
[01:47:29.300 --> 01:47:32.420]   In fact, Steve Gibson, our unsecurity guy, has pointed that out.
[01:47:32.420 --> 01:47:38.740]   He says, you know, you can, if I have a locked box in my house with my plans for taking over
[01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:43.740]   the, you know, US government law enforcement, if they have re- reasonable cause, you can
[01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:48.620]   go to a judge, can get a warrant, can come in, can open that box.
[01:47:48.620 --> 01:47:52.060]   But I can put it on my iPhone and if they could still get a warrant, but they don't have
[01:47:52.060 --> 01:47:54.780]   the technological means to unlock the iPhone.
[01:47:54.780 --> 01:48:01.580]   So Gibson says there is, there's, you know, there's reason to say, you know, there's precedent
[01:48:01.580 --> 01:48:05.780]   for saying there, there should be some way to, to issue a search warrant for this.
[01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:06.780]   The problem is the backdoor.
[01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:07.780]   Yeah.
[01:48:07.780 --> 01:48:11.020]   What he says, Apple should just go back to the way they used to do it, which is just
[01:48:11.020 --> 01:48:12.660]   don't encrypt the iPhone.
[01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:13.660]   Right.
[01:48:13.660 --> 01:48:19.900]   But Apple is encouraging people to pay for bills and pay for stuff.
[01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:24.060]   You know, to replace your credit card with your phone.
[01:48:24.060 --> 01:48:26.780]   And if you're going to be doing that, if you're going to be banking through your phone, you
[01:48:26.780 --> 01:48:27.780]   want it to be safe.
[01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:30.420]   You don't want it to have a backdoor.
[01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:36.740]   And it won't work if there's a backdoor because then if you know there's a backdoor, then
[01:48:36.740 --> 01:48:40.220]   then people are just going to spend the rest of their lives trying to open it.
[01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:41.620]   So actually you cover Apple.
[01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:45.700]   So I'm curious what your thought is on this because of course this is a great selling
[01:48:45.700 --> 01:48:46.700]   point for Apple.
[01:48:46.700 --> 01:48:49.860]   They can say reasonably, we're the only company that truly cares about your security.
[01:48:49.860 --> 01:48:50.860]   Right.
[01:48:50.860 --> 01:48:51.860]   Right.
[01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:52.860]   Right.
[01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:57.660]   It doesn't cost them anything to make hay this way.
[01:48:57.660 --> 01:49:03.700]   And it hurts their competitors because they can say, "Look at Google and Facebook."
[01:49:03.700 --> 01:49:04.700]   Yeah.
[01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:05.700]   Yeah.
[01:49:05.700 --> 01:49:06.700]   Yeah.
[01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:09.500]   So there's a word for it that Ben Thompson uses.
[01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:10.500]   I forget what it is.
[01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:15.460]   Something like a strategy advantage.
[01:49:15.460 --> 01:49:18.300]   You know, it's free for them.
[01:49:18.300 --> 01:49:19.300]   Right.
[01:49:19.300 --> 01:49:28.060]   It would cost Google a fortune to give up what Apple doesn't sell.
[01:49:28.060 --> 01:49:30.180]   You know, I'm not saying that quite right.
[01:49:30.180 --> 01:49:31.180]   But yeah.
[01:49:31.180 --> 01:49:32.180]   No, I know what you're saying.
[01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:34.940]   And in a way, one of the reasons I like Android and I like Google now is because Google does
[01:49:34.940 --> 01:49:35.940]   know more about me.
[01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:38.780]   So Google now, we were just, we were talking about that earlier, is very knowledgeable
[01:49:38.780 --> 01:49:40.660]   in those when I'm going on a flight.
[01:49:40.660 --> 01:49:44.860]   So if I show up at the airport, it can put up the QR code for the ticket because it happens
[01:49:44.860 --> 01:49:45.860]   to know that.
[01:49:45.860 --> 01:49:47.940]   Why I love that it tells me to go to the airport.
[01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:48.940]   Because where my car is.
[01:49:48.940 --> 01:49:50.180]   It will tell me you need to leave.
[01:49:50.180 --> 01:49:51.180]   Yeah.
[01:49:51.180 --> 01:49:52.180]   If you want to be on time, here's your car.
[01:49:52.180 --> 01:49:53.180]   Here's where you're going.
[01:49:53.180 --> 01:49:56.260]   Stuff Apple doesn't want to do because that would be creepy.
[01:49:56.260 --> 01:49:57.260]   They actually do look at it.
[01:49:57.260 --> 01:49:59.740]   I think it's totally right.
[01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:01.180]   I think that it changes those.
[01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:04.220]   Google's model is the more the information they know, the better they can sell you ads
[01:50:04.220 --> 01:50:07.340]   and that makes Google more money versus Apple.
[01:50:07.340 --> 01:50:08.740]   It's selling you products.
[01:50:08.740 --> 01:50:11.500]   And so it doesn't need to have that information to make more money.
[01:50:11.500 --> 01:50:18.900]   And so it, since we are their main customers, they want to keep us safe first versus Google.
[01:50:18.900 --> 01:50:25.220]   And so I don't want to give up my privacy for safety when the data does not support
[01:50:25.220 --> 01:50:29.620]   that we would actually be any more safe by me giving up my privacy.
[01:50:29.620 --> 01:50:34.220]   Here's actually some great advice from the attorney general of the great state of Maryland.
[01:50:34.220 --> 01:50:36.820]   This comes from motherboard Joshua Copstein.
[01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:39.780]   The state attorney general of Maryland is taking an aggressive stance on the use of
[01:50:39.780 --> 01:50:46.100]   cell phone trackers saying, if you don't want to be tracked, turn off your phone.
[01:50:46.100 --> 01:50:49.540]   Thanks, you laugh, but that's true.
[01:50:49.540 --> 01:50:50.780]   They use stingrays.
[01:50:50.780 --> 01:50:57.580]   These are phony cell sites that intercept your phone traffic.
[01:50:57.580 --> 01:51:02.460]   Earlier this week, Brian Frosh challenged a Baltimore's court decision.
[01:51:02.460 --> 01:51:07.140]   In the case of Karen Andrews, Frosh is the attorney general of the state of Maryland.
[01:51:07.140 --> 01:51:11.580]   Andrews was targeted by a stingray.
[01:51:11.580 --> 01:51:15.980]   He faces multiple, I mean, look at this is an interesting case because this guy is charged
[01:51:15.980 --> 01:51:19.500]   with multiple murder, attempted murders.
[01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:22.700]   He told the court, you must dismiss these charges.
[01:51:22.700 --> 01:51:24.660]   This is unreasonable search and seizure.
[01:51:24.660 --> 01:51:26.940]   This is a fourth amendment right.
[01:51:26.940 --> 01:51:32.860]   The state said, well, cell phones are constantly revealing their location.
[01:51:32.860 --> 01:51:39.420]   So because Andrews uses a cell phone, he volunteered this information with third parties, including
[01:51:39.420 --> 01:51:42.860]   the police just by keeping his phone on.
[01:51:42.860 --> 01:51:48.580]   The state brief says, well, quote, while cell phones are ubiquitous, they all come with
[01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:52.660]   off switches because Andrews chose to keep his cell phone on.
[01:51:52.660 --> 01:51:57.460]   He was voluntarily sharing the location of his cell phone with third parties.
[01:51:57.460 --> 01:52:01.020]   You see, I think that's like a little bit of like a solipsism though, right?
[01:52:01.020 --> 01:52:04.460]   I don't think that people mostly think that they're going to be tracked.
[01:52:04.460 --> 01:52:09.020]   I think that people first start from the feeling of like people, one, don't really understand
[01:52:09.020 --> 01:52:10.380]   the technology that they use.
[01:52:10.380 --> 01:52:13.020]   They assume that things are private that are not.
[01:52:13.020 --> 01:52:17.380]   And I think that because cell phones are so ubiquitous to our society and the manner in
[01:52:17.380 --> 01:52:22.780]   which we go through our daily day-to-day lives, it is it should be up to the government to
[01:52:22.780 --> 01:52:30.020]   make sure that we are safe and that our privacy and the constitution is upheld first, not
[01:52:30.020 --> 01:52:33.540]   that that would be a necessary means to an end.
[01:52:33.540 --> 01:52:40.100]   I think that if they're tracking someone that's dangerous and they file to be able to subpoena
[01:52:40.100 --> 01:52:43.500]   to have the right, I think that that sounds fair, but I don't think that just by using
[01:52:43.500 --> 01:52:47.980]   your cell phone, you should expect that, well, there's a microphone on the cell phone and
[01:52:47.980 --> 01:52:52.580]   there's a camera, we could choose to turn that on at any point in time if we want and that
[01:52:52.580 --> 01:52:55.940]   should be, I should give up my rights to thinking that my life is private to them.
[01:52:55.940 --> 01:52:56.940]   Are you consenting to it?
[01:52:56.940 --> 01:52:57.940]   Is it informed consent?
[01:52:57.940 --> 01:52:58.940]   Do you want to coordinate?
[01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:01.540]   I really agree with Georgia and yeah, I like that definitely.
[01:53:01.540 --> 01:53:02.980]   Oh, they're terrible.
[01:53:02.980 --> 01:53:03.980]   Yeah.
[01:53:03.980 --> 01:53:08.820]   I think they're apple flavors.
[01:53:08.820 --> 01:53:12.380]   No, I, these are definitely not nature box.
[01:53:12.380 --> 01:53:13.380]   Put those back.
[01:53:13.380 --> 01:53:15.100]   They're like apple flavored.
[01:53:15.100 --> 01:53:16.100]   Aren't they awful?
[01:53:16.100 --> 01:53:18.180]   Please don't offer me an apple flavored.
[01:53:18.180 --> 01:53:21.420]   Who would make apple flavored corn nuts?
[01:53:21.420 --> 01:53:24.620]   What kind of fiend?
[01:53:24.620 --> 01:53:32.100]   So apparently there are, there's case law in this in 2014, the Florida Supreme Court ruled
[01:53:32.100 --> 01:53:37.020]   that requiring a cell phone user to turn off their cell phone places an unreasonable burden
[01:53:37.020 --> 01:53:42.340]   on the user to forego necessary use of his phone, a device now considered essential by
[01:53:42.340 --> 01:53:43.780]   most of the populace.
[01:53:43.780 --> 01:53:49.340]   On the other hand, in 2013, a New York judge in a DEA case said, given the ubiquity and
[01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:58.300]   celebrity of geolocation technologies, celebrity strange, famous, famous, that's a better
[01:53:58.300 --> 01:53:59.300]   business.
[01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:04.500]   An individual has no legitimate expectation of privacy in the perspective location of
[01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:09.580]   a cellular telephone where that individual has failed to protect his privacy by taking
[01:54:09.580 --> 01:54:11.660]   the simple expedient of powering it off.
[01:54:11.660 --> 01:54:14.260]   That was in 2013.
[01:54:14.260 --> 01:54:21.340]   So we'll see, I mean, this is yet to be decided in the state of Maryland, but keep in mind,
[01:54:21.340 --> 01:54:24.500]   you're giving the government permission to track you if you use a cell phone.
[01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:26.500]   If you have a phone.
[01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:33.340]   Yeah, that serial story, the first season of serial where that she looked at a 15 year
[01:54:33.340 --> 01:54:39.940]   old murder case, a lot of the evidence against this guy who was accused of killing his high
[01:54:39.940 --> 01:54:44.500]   school girlfriend was based on a cell phone location.
[01:54:44.500 --> 01:54:45.500]   It's what they use.
[01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:49.540]   Same thing and to make a murderer, the very controversial Netflix documentary about
[01:54:49.540 --> 01:54:51.260]   I haven't seen it yet.
[01:54:51.260 --> 01:54:53.140]   Yeah, well, I won't say anything then.
[01:54:53.140 --> 01:54:54.140]   It's interesting.
[01:54:54.140 --> 01:54:56.140]   Have you seen it, Georgia?
[01:54:56.140 --> 01:55:01.580]   I've read the rundowns on it when we discussed, you know, just some different psychological
[01:55:01.580 --> 01:55:05.500]   issues on the way that people feel about things.
[01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:06.580]   But yeah.
[01:55:06.580 --> 01:55:07.780]   There was some cell phone evidence.
[01:55:07.780 --> 01:55:09.020]   I think left out.
[01:55:09.020 --> 01:55:10.900]   Anyway, of the documentary.
[01:55:10.900 --> 01:55:13.780]   But anyway, how about error 53?
[01:55:13.780 --> 01:55:15.260]   Phillip, I bet you're up on this one.
[01:55:15.260 --> 01:55:20.180]   And this is an example of Apple protecting a customer's security, even perhaps to the
[01:55:20.180 --> 01:55:23.420]   detriment of the customer.
[01:55:23.420 --> 01:55:25.740]   And Apple has a good reason for this.
[01:55:25.740 --> 01:55:26.740]   Yeah.
[01:55:26.740 --> 01:55:27.740]   What is it?
[01:55:27.740 --> 01:55:35.820]   If you used if if you had someone fix your broken screen that wasn't Apple, the next
[01:55:35.820 --> 01:55:42.300]   time you updated your iOS, it it bricked your phone.
[01:55:42.300 --> 01:55:48.660]   Ricked your phone because you used an unofficial Apple repair service.
[01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:52.980]   Apple says that's because there is a tight connection between the fingerprint reader
[01:55:52.980 --> 01:55:56.820]   and a secure store on the phone that we need to keep secure.
[01:55:56.820 --> 01:56:00.900]   When you bring it to Apple to get it fixed, we will re-associate.
[01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:07.140]   But these third party guys don't do it, so we have to break your phone.
[01:56:07.140 --> 01:56:15.460]   The Guardian broke this story and they broke it because one of their own freelancers, Antonio
[01:56:15.460 --> 01:56:21.300]   Olmos, was covering the refugee crisis in Macedonia, dropped his phone.
[01:56:21.300 --> 01:56:23.900]   There are no Apple stores in Macedonia.
[01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:25.220]   So he went to a local shop.
[01:56:25.220 --> 01:56:26.740]   They repaired the screen and home button.
[01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:27.740]   It worked perfectly.
[01:56:27.740 --> 01:56:29.700]   He thought no more about it.
[01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:38.940]   Until he got offered iOS 9, he upgraded, got error 53, and the phone was bricked.
[01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:41.780]   He had to pay 270 pounds for a replacement.
[01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:48.580]   Was he the one who went back to the guy who fixed his phone and got the money back?
[01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:54.820]   No, I don't think so, but that's an interesting strategy.
[01:56:54.820 --> 01:56:56.340]   People have done that strategy.
[01:56:56.340 --> 01:57:01.700]   If the third party guy said he was going to fix your phone and it turned out he bricked
[01:57:01.700 --> 01:57:02.700]   it.
[01:57:02.700 --> 01:57:03.700]   Really?
[01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:04.700]   You blame the third party guy?
[01:57:04.700 --> 01:57:05.700]   He can't blame the third party guy.
[01:57:05.700 --> 01:57:07.900]   It worked fine when you got it back from him.
[01:57:07.900 --> 01:57:10.460]   This is why you should have AppleCare.
[01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:12.700]   There's no AppleCare in Macedonia.
[01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:13.700]   What are you supposed to do?
[01:57:13.700 --> 01:57:14.700]   Wait till you get back?
[01:57:14.700 --> 01:57:15.700]   That's true.
[01:57:15.700 --> 01:57:16.900]   Well, no one...
[01:57:16.900 --> 01:57:21.380]   I guess they could have said that Apple should have warned people about this beforehand so
[01:57:21.380 --> 01:57:23.780]   that people wouldn't know that it was one of these...
[01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:26.180]   I think this is how they got a billion users.
[01:57:26.180 --> 01:57:29.420]   You do what Samsung does.
[01:57:29.420 --> 01:57:34.620]   Samsung has a similar new secure store and they call it Nox, like Fort Knox.
[01:57:34.620 --> 01:57:40.060]   If you violate it by, say, changing the firmware on your phone, Nox stops working.
[01:57:40.060 --> 01:57:45.780]   Samsung says you can't use this for Samsung pay because it's not secure anymore.
[01:57:45.780 --> 01:57:49.900]   Some programs like, I don't know, Netflix, some programs where there's Hollywood content
[01:57:49.900 --> 01:57:53.540]   will stop working because Hollywood says, "Well, you're not secure anymore.
[01:57:53.540 --> 01:57:55.260]   You might be pirating."
[01:57:55.260 --> 01:57:56.260]   But your phone still works.
[01:57:56.260 --> 01:57:57.260]   Exactly.
[01:57:57.260 --> 01:57:59.500]   They're not going to break you.
[01:57:59.500 --> 01:58:04.900]   The nature of that error message suggests to me that Apple didn't know about this.
[01:58:04.900 --> 01:58:08.660]   If they knew that it was going to happen, they would have had an error message that said,
[01:58:08.660 --> 01:58:10.660]   "Hey, your phone doesn't work."
[01:58:10.660 --> 01:58:11.660]   Screw up, man.
[01:58:11.660 --> 01:58:12.660]   They would have used English rather than...
[01:58:12.660 --> 01:58:14.660]   Yes, he would have said I have Apple logo.
[01:58:14.660 --> 01:58:20.620]   So Friday, according to Apple Insider, Apple acknowledged it.
[01:58:20.620 --> 01:58:23.340]   This is what Apple explained to the Guardian after their story.
[01:58:23.340 --> 01:58:27.940]   You protect fingerprint data using a secure enclave, which is uniquely paired to the Touch
[01:58:27.940 --> 01:58:29.580]   ID sensor.
[01:58:29.580 --> 01:58:34.300]   When an iPhone is serviced by an authorized Apple service provider or Apple retail store,
[01:58:34.300 --> 01:58:39.820]   for changes that affect the Touch ID sensor, the pairing is revalidated.
[01:58:39.820 --> 01:58:44.020]   The representative warned with an unofficial repair that pairing can go unvalidated and
[01:58:44.020 --> 01:58:49.620]   lead to error 53 once iOS is updated or even restored, people who contact the glitch should
[01:58:49.620 --> 01:58:51.820]   contact Apple support.
[01:58:51.820 --> 01:58:59.740]   I love how they make even a PR statement like that into a sales pitch.
[01:58:59.740 --> 01:59:00.740]   Yeah.
[01:59:00.740 --> 01:59:02.540]   Basically, they're going to route you to sales.
[01:59:02.540 --> 01:59:05.900]   And here's an additional statement that came now to Apple Insider.
[01:59:05.900 --> 01:59:07.740]   We take customer security very seriously.
[01:59:07.740 --> 01:59:11.940]   Error 53 is the result of security checks designed to protect our customers.
[01:59:11.940 --> 01:59:15.540]   iOS checks that the Touch ID sensor in your phone or iPad correctly matches your device's
[01:59:15.540 --> 01:59:16.740]   other components.
[01:59:16.740 --> 01:59:20.540]   If they find a mismatch, the check fails and Touch ID, including for Apple Pay use, is
[01:59:20.540 --> 01:59:23.900]   disabled.
[01:59:23.900 --> 01:59:26.940]   The security measures necessary to protect your device and prevent a fraudulent Touch
[01:59:26.940 --> 01:59:28.300]   ID sensor from being used.
[01:59:28.300 --> 01:59:29.300]   That's fine.
[01:59:29.300 --> 01:59:30.300]   If that's all they do is disable it fine.
[01:59:30.300 --> 01:59:32.060]   If they brick the phone, that's not fine.
[01:59:32.060 --> 01:59:33.060]   So maybe you're right, Philip.
[01:59:33.060 --> 01:59:34.460]   Maybe that's an unintended consequence.
[01:59:34.460 --> 01:59:37.180]   We didn't mean to brick your phone.
[01:59:37.180 --> 01:59:38.620]   Just disable the Touch ID.
[01:59:38.620 --> 01:59:39.620]   Yeah.
[01:59:39.620 --> 01:59:41.380]   You just can't buy things with it.
[01:59:41.380 --> 01:59:42.380]   Right.
[01:59:42.380 --> 01:59:43.380]   That would be fair.
[01:59:43.380 --> 01:59:46.380]   If they fix it with the next update, that would be good.
[01:59:46.380 --> 01:59:47.380]   Right.
[01:59:47.380 --> 01:59:51.780]   All right, let's take a quick break and come back with some final thoughts from our great
[01:59:51.780 --> 01:59:56.660]   panel, Georgia Dow from iMORM, beautiful Montreal, where it's a balmy, how much?
[01:59:56.660 --> 01:59:57.660]   82 degrees.
[01:59:57.660 --> 01:59:58.660]   It's warm, isn't it?
[01:59:58.660 --> 01:59:59.660]   You're having a warm winter.
[01:59:59.660 --> 02:00:01.660]   Oh, it's so very warm.
[02:00:01.660 --> 02:00:04.260]   Toronto was one degree.
[02:00:04.260 --> 02:00:06.500]   So it's got to be cold in Montreal.
[02:00:06.500 --> 02:00:07.500]   It's cold.
[02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:09.780]   It's not like we've had really sketchy weather.
[02:00:09.780 --> 02:00:12.500]   I'm taking skiing lessons and there's not much skiing happening.
[02:00:12.500 --> 02:00:13.500]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:00:13.500 --> 02:00:15.500]   We got some snow, so it's good.
[02:00:15.500 --> 02:00:17.100]   Great to have you as always.
[02:00:17.100 --> 02:00:22.180]   So from fortune.com, but soon to be from another site, what will it be called?
[02:00:22.180 --> 02:00:23.740]   Apple 3.0.
[02:00:23.740 --> 02:00:24.740]   Apple 3.0.
[02:00:24.740 --> 02:00:25.740]   I like it.
[02:00:25.740 --> 02:00:27.780]   I had Apple 2.0 before.
[02:00:27.780 --> 02:00:30.020]   Will there be a dot in Apple 3.0?
[02:00:30.020 --> 02:00:31.020]   Yeah.
[02:00:31.020 --> 02:00:34.020]   It'll be like apple3.0.com.
[02:00:34.020 --> 02:00:38.140]   No, no, no, that was taken.
[02:00:38.140 --> 02:00:41.260]   It'll probably be ped30.com.
[02:00:41.260 --> 02:00:42.260]   Ped30.com.
[02:00:42.260 --> 02:00:46.540]   Yeah, because then you would have to own the O.com domain.
[02:00:46.540 --> 02:00:48.420]   I doubt very much that's available.
[02:00:48.420 --> 02:00:49.420]   Right.
[02:00:49.420 --> 02:00:52.220]   Also, shorter is better if I have to type it a lot.
[02:00:52.220 --> 02:00:53.220]   I agree.
[02:00:53.220 --> 02:00:54.660]   I like ped for that reason.
[02:00:54.660 --> 02:00:56.020]   It's great to have you, Phillip.
[02:00:56.020 --> 02:00:57.020]   And good luck.
[02:00:57.020 --> 02:00:58.020]   I'm really excited about this.
[02:00:58.020 --> 02:00:59.020]   I will see you in a minute.
[02:00:59.020 --> 02:01:00.020]   It's good.
[02:01:00.020 --> 02:01:01.020]   35 degrees in Greenfield.
[02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:03.020]   Ah, it's not bad.
[02:01:03.020 --> 02:01:04.020]   It's above freezing.
[02:01:04.020 --> 02:01:05.020]   No, no.
[02:01:05.020 --> 02:01:06.020]   Yeah, it's snowed the other day.
[02:01:06.020 --> 02:01:08.620]   I went cross-country skiing yesterday.
[02:01:08.620 --> 02:01:12.060]   And we are having some pretty nice weather here in the Bay Area for the Super Bowl.
[02:01:12.060 --> 02:01:13.060]   It's like in the '70s.
[02:01:13.060 --> 02:01:14.060]   Yes.
[02:01:14.060 --> 02:01:15.060]   Nice.
[02:01:15.060 --> 02:01:16.060]   It was '72 today.
[02:01:16.060 --> 02:01:21.220]   Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks.com.
[02:01:21.220 --> 02:01:24.900]   FreshBooks is the simple cloud accounting software for freelancers.
[02:01:24.900 --> 02:01:28.260]   Anybody who makes their living billing for their time and expertise.
[02:01:28.260 --> 02:01:30.740]   What's your favorite part about running your business?
[02:01:30.740 --> 02:01:31.740]   Doing the stuff, right?
[02:01:31.740 --> 02:01:32.740]   You love doing the stuff.
[02:01:32.740 --> 02:01:37.500]   What you don't love is at the end of the month, you got a fire-up word or excel and
[02:01:37.500 --> 02:01:39.500]   do the invoices.
[02:01:39.500 --> 02:01:41.220]   You got to get the-- I used to have to get together.
[02:01:41.220 --> 02:01:43.020]   I would go up to Toronto to do their show.
[02:01:43.020 --> 02:01:48.060]   I might have to get the shoebox invoices, I mean, of expense receipts and put them in
[02:01:48.060 --> 02:01:50.500]   the invoice and then keep track of the time.
[02:01:50.500 --> 02:01:51.500]   I do hate that.
[02:01:51.500 --> 02:01:52.500]   Don't you hate that?
[02:01:52.500 --> 02:01:53.500]   It's not what you got in business.
[02:01:53.500 --> 02:01:54.500]   I hate that.
[02:01:54.500 --> 02:01:55.500]   You get a business.
[02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:58.140]   You're all excited to sell videos and then suddenly you have to do all the bookwork for
[02:01:58.140 --> 02:01:59.140]   and you're like, "You know what?
[02:01:59.140 --> 02:02:00.140]   That's not any fun."
[02:02:00.140 --> 02:02:03.420]   You hate that when that happens.
[02:02:03.420 --> 02:02:05.020]   So this solves it for us, doesn't it?
[02:02:05.020 --> 02:02:06.020]   Yes.
[02:02:06.020 --> 02:02:08.300]   The funny thing is, if you don't send the invoice, you don't get paid.
[02:02:08.300 --> 02:02:10.300]   I don't know why.
[02:02:10.300 --> 02:02:13.300]   Some reason you have to do that.
[02:02:13.300 --> 02:02:15.060]   The unfortunate part.
[02:02:15.060 --> 02:02:21.100]   So in fact, the reason I laugh about that is because I went six months without invoicing
[02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:22.100]   Rogers once.
[02:02:22.100 --> 02:02:23.100]   Really?
[02:02:23.100 --> 02:02:26.260]   Yeah, because I just hated doing it.
[02:02:26.260 --> 02:02:31.060]   So I sent them an invoice for six months, which was a considerable invoice.
[02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:33.300]   The bookkeeper called me, "You can't do this.
[02:02:33.300 --> 02:02:35.300]   What are you thinking?"
[02:02:35.300 --> 02:02:38.540]   I said, "Well, I forgot to invoice you.
[02:02:38.540 --> 02:02:40.260]   You can't do this."
[02:02:40.260 --> 02:02:42.020]   She said, "If you do this again, I'm not paying it."
[02:02:42.020 --> 02:02:43.020]   I said, "Okay, okay."
[02:02:43.020 --> 02:02:44.020]   Oh, God.
[02:02:44.020 --> 02:02:45.020]   Okay, okay.
[02:02:45.020 --> 02:02:46.500]   I don't think that's legal.
[02:02:46.500 --> 02:02:48.380]   It's probably not, but I took it seriously.
[02:02:48.380 --> 02:02:51.860]   I actually went to Amber and I said, "What am I going to do?"
[02:02:51.860 --> 02:02:52.860]   She said, "Fresh books."
[02:02:52.860 --> 02:02:54.220]   This had just started up in Toronto.
[02:02:54.220 --> 02:02:55.940]   This was about 10 years ago.
[02:02:55.940 --> 02:03:00.540]   And since then, by the way, 5 million customers really doing well, they are growing all the
[02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:01.540]   time.
[02:03:01.540 --> 02:03:05.620]   So they do the invoices, email invoices that makes it very easy.
[02:03:05.620 --> 02:03:08.620]   They will actually, they have an app that will track time and hours.
[02:03:08.620 --> 02:03:14.820]   You could take pictures of receipts and expenses and it goes right in the invoice.
[02:03:14.820 --> 02:03:16.140]   They've just announced their card reader.
[02:03:16.140 --> 02:03:17.140]   Now, this is cool.
[02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:22.340]   There are a lot of people who go to homes to do things, contractors and specters.
[02:03:22.340 --> 02:03:25.500]   And so you might, for instance, go make an estimate.
[02:03:25.500 --> 02:03:29.340]   So with the FreshBooks app, you can show the estimate, get the customer approval, do
[02:03:29.340 --> 02:03:31.540]   the work, customer's standing there.
[02:03:31.540 --> 02:03:32.540]   You say, "Here's your invoice.
[02:03:32.540 --> 02:03:34.580]   I'll have this email to you."
[02:03:34.580 --> 02:03:38.380]   And here's my card reader.
[02:03:38.380 --> 02:03:42.180]   It's an EMV enabled so they can dip the chip or swipe the stripe and pay you right there
[02:03:42.180 --> 02:03:44.620]   and talk about getting paid fast.
[02:03:44.620 --> 02:03:45.620]   Wow.
[02:03:45.620 --> 02:03:46.780]   So awesome.
[02:03:46.780 --> 02:03:50.700]   I am a big fan and I used this for years until I finally, you know, I have now, I have
[02:03:50.700 --> 02:03:53.500]   a department of people helping me with this.
[02:03:53.500 --> 02:03:58.580]   Plus I don't have to invoice myself because I pay myself without the invoice.
[02:03:58.580 --> 02:03:59.580]   There you go.
[02:03:59.580 --> 02:04:00.580]   You won't forget to do that.
[02:04:00.580 --> 02:04:01.580]   I won't forget that part.
[02:04:01.580 --> 02:04:02.580]   So here's the deal.
[02:04:02.580 --> 02:04:05.860]   If you're still, if you're freelancer, if you're still suffering through this monthly
[02:04:05.860 --> 02:04:12.340]   process, please go to freshbooks.com/twit and get fresh books free for 30 days.
[02:04:12.340 --> 02:04:15.900]   Freshbooks.com/twit.
[02:04:15.900 --> 02:04:18.940]   And there's just one little favor if you would do this for me when they ask.
[02:04:18.940 --> 02:04:20.380]   How did you hear about us?
[02:04:20.380 --> 02:04:22.580]   Tell them this weekend tech.
[02:04:22.580 --> 02:04:27.980]   Thefreshbooks.com/twit.
[02:04:27.980 --> 02:04:31.140]   So we know that the Mobile World Congress is coming up at the end of the months.
[02:04:31.140 --> 02:04:32.140]   We're excited.
[02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:35.740]   The 21st Samsung is going to announce its new phones, Galaxy S7.
[02:04:35.740 --> 02:04:37.780]   They've sent out invitations.
[02:04:37.780 --> 02:04:44.100]   We expect Apple will have new phone, maybe a 4-inch screen and a new Apple Watch or at
[02:04:44.100 --> 02:04:46.500]   least some sort of update in March.
[02:04:46.500 --> 02:04:48.500]   Maybe no, you don't think so?
[02:04:48.500 --> 02:04:49.500]   Yeah.
[02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:51.220]   I don't think they'll do the hardware in March.
[02:04:51.220 --> 02:04:54.460]   Did they just say, "We'll offer update?"
[02:04:54.460 --> 02:04:56.860]   Something about new bands, probably software update.
[02:04:56.860 --> 02:04:57.860]   I would be...
[02:04:57.860 --> 02:04:58.860]   Yes, it's gonna be March.
[02:04:58.860 --> 02:04:59.860]   New bands.
[02:04:59.860 --> 02:05:00.860]   What kind of announcement is that?
[02:05:00.860 --> 02:05:02.860]   We're gonna get great new bands.
[02:05:02.860 --> 02:05:07.420]   We're gonna get the watchOS, but we're gonna get the watchOS, we're gonna get the bands,
[02:05:07.420 --> 02:05:08.420]   and then we have to wait.
[02:05:08.420 --> 02:05:10.980]   We're gonna have to wait a little while for the new phones.
[02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:11.980]   I would...
[02:05:11.980 --> 02:05:16.300]   It's just a rumor that they're gonna do hardware, and I think everybody's backed off.
[02:05:16.300 --> 02:05:17.300]   They shouldn't do...
[02:05:17.300 --> 02:05:18.300]   They're smaller phone.
[02:05:18.300 --> 02:05:19.300]   They should...
[02:05:19.300 --> 02:05:20.300]   The 5SE.
[02:05:20.300 --> 02:05:21.300]   Yeah.
[02:05:21.300 --> 02:05:23.300]   That would make sense, but they shouldn't do a new watch because people...
[02:05:23.300 --> 02:05:24.300]   Right.
[02:05:24.300 --> 02:05:25.500]   I mean, there are people be irate.
[02:05:25.500 --> 02:05:26.500]   Right.
[02:05:26.500 --> 02:05:32.820]   I don't think they'll... I would be surprised if they unveiled their phone at Barcelona.
[02:05:32.820 --> 02:05:35.580]   No, they're not gonna do mobile world congress.
[02:05:35.580 --> 02:05:36.900]   They're gonna do their own thing.
[02:05:36.900 --> 02:05:42.380]   In fact, it's amazing Samsung kind of still feels like they need to go to an event.
[02:05:42.380 --> 02:05:43.820]   That's old school.
[02:05:43.820 --> 02:05:44.820]   Definitely.
[02:05:44.820 --> 02:05:53.220]   There's a lot of... I just wanna get a little stories here.
[02:05:53.220 --> 02:05:58.380]   Samsung, by the way, Samsung's browser on Android has ad blocking.
[02:05:58.380 --> 02:06:00.020]   Interesting enough.
[02:06:00.020 --> 02:06:05.940]   Didn't Google just kill an ad blocking browser or ad blocking in its school store?
[02:06:05.940 --> 02:06:08.420]   I think they did.
[02:06:08.420 --> 02:06:15.660]   By the way, IBM's Watson has picked key as Super Bowl influencers.
[02:06:15.660 --> 02:06:20.580]   I wanna know who's gonna win if you're so smart.
[02:06:20.580 --> 02:06:24.300]   I think what they did is they... It's a key ad.
[02:06:24.300 --> 02:06:25.300]   Oh.
[02:06:25.300 --> 02:06:31.540]   And they somehow Watson has figured out who to get to tweet about the ad.
[02:06:31.540 --> 02:06:34.300]   That's a good use of a brain bigger than a planet.
[02:06:34.300 --> 02:06:35.300]   Yeah.
[02:06:35.300 --> 02:06:40.780]   They research through all social algorithms and they focus on who can actually make the
[02:06:40.780 --> 02:06:43.740]   greatest influence and impact for Hyundai.
[02:06:43.740 --> 02:06:46.100]   Not Christopher Walken with a sock puppet.
[02:06:46.100 --> 02:06:48.100]   That is strange.
[02:06:48.100 --> 02:06:49.900]   It's a very funny ad.
[02:06:49.900 --> 02:06:50.900]   Unpainous tension.
[02:06:50.900 --> 02:06:51.900]   No, don't watch.
[02:06:51.900 --> 02:06:53.340]   Yeah, we're missing these ads.
[02:06:53.340 --> 02:06:54.340]   I'm gonna close that.
[02:06:54.340 --> 02:06:56.140]   Nope, don't watch it.
[02:06:56.140 --> 02:06:57.140]   Don't watch it.
[02:06:57.140 --> 02:06:58.620]   Don't ruin it, Leo.
[02:06:58.620 --> 02:07:02.340]   There's a lot of stories about the puppy bowl in here.
[02:07:02.340 --> 02:07:03.500]   Jason.
[02:07:03.500 --> 02:07:04.700]   Jason likes dogs.
[02:07:04.700 --> 02:07:06.340]   No, it's 360 VR.
[02:07:06.340 --> 02:07:07.340]   That's the 360.
[02:07:07.340 --> 02:07:08.340]   Who cares?
[02:07:08.340 --> 02:07:11.100]   It's the puppy bowl.
[02:07:11.100 --> 02:07:14.940]   I like dogs, but the puppy bowl really.
[02:07:14.940 --> 02:07:16.180]   You don't watch the puppy bowl?
[02:07:16.180 --> 02:07:17.180]   No, you do?
[02:07:17.180 --> 02:07:18.540]   Of course.
[02:07:18.540 --> 02:07:19.540]   It's dopey.
[02:07:19.540 --> 02:07:20.540]   They don't do anything.
[02:07:20.540 --> 02:07:21.540]   They play football.
[02:07:21.540 --> 02:07:22.540]   Oh, they don't.
[02:07:22.540 --> 02:07:29.460]   That's a very, very, it is a very odd definition of playing football.
[02:07:29.460 --> 02:07:30.460]   Watch.
[02:07:30.460 --> 02:07:31.620]   These are the puppies in 360.
[02:07:31.620 --> 02:07:33.860]   This you say they're playing football here?
[02:07:33.860 --> 02:07:37.540]   No, this is the pregame practice that they brought.
[02:07:37.540 --> 02:07:38.540]   Oh, this is the practice.
[02:07:38.540 --> 02:07:39.540]   Yes.
[02:07:39.540 --> 02:07:40.540]   This is the pregame.
[02:07:40.540 --> 02:07:41.700]   Oh, there's one guy chilling on the side.
[02:07:41.700 --> 02:07:43.580]   Puppy manning on the, yeah.
[02:07:43.580 --> 02:07:45.300]   It's the official practice.
[02:07:45.300 --> 02:07:47.900]   That one's itching.
[02:07:47.900 --> 02:07:49.340]   Why would you watch this?
[02:07:49.340 --> 02:07:50.660]   Not just watch it.
[02:07:50.660 --> 02:07:51.660]   I'd attend it.
[02:07:51.660 --> 02:07:52.660]   You'd go?
[02:07:52.660 --> 02:07:53.660]   Definitely.
[02:07:53.660 --> 02:07:55.500]   Apparently they don't let real people in just paper cutouts.
[02:07:55.500 --> 02:08:00.380]   I'm not going to say anything that would, you know, incriminate me, but, you know, I
[02:08:00.380 --> 02:08:02.780]   may have money riding on the Eskimo.
[02:08:02.780 --> 02:08:04.580]   Oh, no, no.
[02:08:04.580 --> 02:08:06.420]   I have 50 on Schnazers.
[02:08:06.420 --> 02:08:08.340]   I mean, how do you win it?
[02:08:08.340 --> 02:08:09.340]   Yeah, how do you win?
[02:08:09.340 --> 02:08:11.340]   Because I get in first just to score.
[02:08:11.340 --> 02:08:12.340]   Look, there's a match.
[02:08:12.340 --> 02:08:13.340]   I'm not going to share that information.
[02:08:13.340 --> 02:08:14.340]   He's going deep.
[02:08:14.340 --> 02:08:16.180]   They're so cute.
[02:08:16.180 --> 02:08:21.420]   I don't think 360 degree video makes us any more compelling to say.
[02:08:21.420 --> 02:08:24.500]   Oh, a loser.
[02:08:24.500 --> 02:08:28.980]   NFL films presents.
[02:08:28.980 --> 02:08:36.860]   It was a cold day on Lambo Field when Puppy Manning took to the grass for his biggest day
[02:08:36.860 --> 02:08:37.860]   in history.
[02:08:37.860 --> 02:08:41.060]   Oh, he's making a poo poo.
[02:08:41.060 --> 02:08:43.580]   Okay, that's enough.
[02:08:43.580 --> 02:08:46.300]   So you're wondering, Leo, how did I get into all the Super Bowl parties?
[02:08:46.300 --> 02:08:47.300]   How did you get into all this?
[02:08:47.300 --> 02:08:48.540]   How long did I'm wondering that?
[02:08:48.540 --> 02:08:53.980]   You are wondering that I was actually with a very, very popular pomeranian called Jeff
[02:08:53.980 --> 02:08:54.980]   Palm.
[02:08:54.980 --> 02:08:55.980]   Wait a minute.
[02:08:55.980 --> 02:08:56.980]   You got in because of a dog?
[02:08:56.980 --> 02:08:57.980]   A dog.
[02:08:57.980 --> 02:08:58.980]   Okay, I take it all back.
[02:08:58.980 --> 02:08:59.980]   You take it all back.
[02:08:59.980 --> 02:09:01.940]   So Jeff Palm is an Instagram powerhouse.
[02:09:01.940 --> 02:09:07.380]   He has over three million followers and he was able to get into all of the parties that
[02:09:07.380 --> 02:09:09.660]   the NFL players could not get into.
[02:09:09.660 --> 02:09:11.220]   Oh, wait a minute.
[02:09:11.220 --> 02:09:15.020]   Jeff Palm, I got to sit down and have an exclusive interview with him.
[02:09:15.020 --> 02:09:17.420]   He looks like there's another dog that looks just like him.
[02:09:17.420 --> 02:09:20.940]   He walked in the NFL show, the NFL runway show.
[02:09:20.940 --> 02:09:24.260]   He was at the Maxim party, the Playboy party.
[02:09:24.260 --> 02:09:27.940]   Every party you can imagine he headlined.
[02:09:27.940 --> 02:09:30.100]   Jeff Palm is his mom.
[02:09:30.100 --> 02:09:31.100]   You got to find him.
[02:09:31.100 --> 02:09:32.100]   He's amazing.
[02:09:32.100 --> 02:09:35.500]   Jeff Palm has over three million followers.
[02:09:35.500 --> 02:09:36.860]   What is the world coming to?
[02:09:36.860 --> 02:09:38.900]   I'm not following him, apparently.
[02:09:38.900 --> 02:09:39.900]   G-I-F-P-O-M.
[02:09:39.900 --> 02:09:40.900]   J-I-F-S-P-O-M.
[02:09:40.900 --> 02:09:47.140]   Oh, like the peanut butter, not like the graphics interchange format.
[02:09:47.140 --> 02:09:52.780]   Do you feel like, Philip, do you feel like sometimes the world has just left us behind?
[02:09:52.780 --> 02:09:55.540]   No, I'm trying to stay with it.
[02:09:55.540 --> 02:10:00.580]   I know, I am too, but I'm starting to understand why as you get older, you start to think,
[02:10:00.580 --> 02:10:04.060]   I don't get the world anymore.
[02:10:04.060 --> 02:10:06.180]   So that's him.
[02:10:06.180 --> 02:10:07.980]   That is the verified Jeff Palm.
[02:10:07.980 --> 02:10:08.980]   Wow.
[02:10:08.980 --> 02:10:13.020]   And when I said, oh, I'm with the dog that I was talking about friends.
[02:10:13.020 --> 02:10:14.020]   He does.
[02:10:14.020 --> 02:10:15.020]   He has a check.
[02:10:15.020 --> 02:10:16.020]   He's a blue check.
[02:10:16.020 --> 02:10:17.020]   He's verified.
[02:10:17.020 --> 02:10:18.020]   2.1 million followers.
[02:10:18.020 --> 02:10:19.020]   That's hilarious.
[02:10:19.020 --> 02:10:20.860]   But it's his business model.
[02:10:20.860 --> 02:10:23.220]   He actually does have a business as well.
[02:10:23.220 --> 02:10:24.220]   He's got a website.
[02:10:24.220 --> 02:10:25.220]   I bet he does have a business.
[02:10:25.220 --> 02:10:26.220]   He does.
[02:10:26.220 --> 02:10:27.220]   See, look, he's got a calendar.
[02:10:27.220 --> 02:10:28.220]   He's got a poster.
[02:10:28.220 --> 02:10:29.220]   Wow.
[02:10:29.220 --> 02:10:30.220]   Basically, he's got products.
[02:10:30.220 --> 02:10:32.300]   He's got a sizzle reel.
[02:10:32.300 --> 02:10:34.140]   Here's the Jeff Palm sizzle reel.
[02:10:34.140 --> 02:10:36.300]   He was with Katy Perry in her--
[02:10:36.300 --> 02:10:38.860]   --the other lady in called Jeff.
[02:10:38.860 --> 02:10:44.020]   And he was basically the star of the show, stealing all of my thought.
[02:10:44.020 --> 02:10:45.020]   A billion views.
[02:10:45.020 --> 02:10:46.020]   That's Jeff.
[02:10:46.020 --> 02:10:47.780]   And it wasn't Katy Perry.
[02:10:47.780 --> 02:10:48.780]   Oh, no.
[02:10:48.780 --> 02:10:49.780]   They were there for--
[02:10:49.780 --> 02:10:53.300]   And you all know how much I love Jeff the Palm radio.
[02:10:53.300 --> 02:10:54.300]   Oh, yes, we do.
[02:10:54.300 --> 02:10:56.020]   But this morning, breaking news.
[02:10:56.020 --> 02:10:57.980]   It turns out he's a record center.
[02:10:57.980 --> 02:10:59.980]   The Guinness World Records of the Flash.
[02:10:59.980 --> 02:11:00.980]   He's Louise.
[02:11:00.980 --> 02:11:01.980]   What?
[02:11:01.980 --> 02:11:02.980]   He can do hands.
[02:11:02.980 --> 02:11:03.980]   He's talented.
[02:11:03.980 --> 02:11:04.980]   He's talented.
[02:11:04.980 --> 02:11:06.860]   Do you actually know Jeff?
[02:11:06.860 --> 02:11:08.220]   Can you bring him to the next show?
[02:11:08.220 --> 02:11:09.940]   That's how I got into all the events.
[02:11:09.940 --> 02:11:13.900]   If you go to LibertyMadison.com or check out YouTube, you see videos of him doing all his
[02:11:13.900 --> 02:11:14.900]   tricks.
[02:11:14.900 --> 02:11:16.340]   Sit down, interview with him.
[02:11:16.340 --> 02:11:17.940]   I think the chatroom's got it right.
[02:11:17.940 --> 02:11:22.820]   He's paying Japanese dogs to follow-- Chinese dogs to follow him on Instagram.
[02:11:22.820 --> 02:11:23.820]   I think so.
[02:11:23.820 --> 02:11:25.300]   I think the world has no hope now.
[02:11:25.300 --> 02:11:27.780]   I have to see them turn down NFL players.
[02:11:27.780 --> 02:11:29.740]   They let Jeff Palm on the list.
[02:11:29.740 --> 02:11:30.740]   Really?
[02:11:30.740 --> 02:11:31.740]   I kid you not.
[02:11:31.740 --> 02:11:33.780]   Oh, you're on the Browns.
[02:11:33.780 --> 02:11:34.780]   You can't get it.
[02:11:34.780 --> 02:11:35.780]   Jeff Palm, come on.
[02:11:35.780 --> 02:11:36.780]   Come on in.
[02:11:36.780 --> 02:11:37.780]   Wow.
[02:11:37.780 --> 02:11:41.020]   That's what happened.
[02:11:41.020 --> 02:11:43.420]   I think we should just wrap this up and go home and watch a football game.
[02:11:43.420 --> 02:11:44.420]   What do you say?
[02:11:44.420 --> 02:11:45.420]   Georgia Dow.
[02:11:45.420 --> 02:11:46.420]   You're following Jeff Palm.
[02:11:46.420 --> 02:11:49.460]   I'm following Jeff Palm now.
[02:11:49.460 --> 02:11:50.460]   You better believe.
[02:11:50.460 --> 02:11:53.340]   No, I'm not going to really follow him.
[02:11:53.340 --> 02:11:55.380]   She's Georgia Underscored Dow on Twitter.
[02:11:55.380 --> 02:11:57.740]   That makes it hard to find, but it doesn't matter.
[02:11:57.740 --> 02:12:00.540]   That is another therapist, Georgia Dow.
[02:12:00.540 --> 02:12:01.540]   Oh, man.
[02:12:01.540 --> 02:12:03.100]   I think people might be following.
[02:12:03.100 --> 02:12:07.980]   Hey, at least Sarah Lane had a ballerina named Sarah Lane.
[02:12:07.980 --> 02:12:08.980]   That's pretty cool.
[02:12:08.980 --> 02:12:09.980]   That is pretty cool.
[02:12:09.980 --> 02:12:10.980]   Yeah.
[02:12:10.980 --> 02:12:14.300]   I'm sure she's cooler than the ballerina though, so just not to worry.
[02:12:14.300 --> 02:12:18.020]   It's a battle for who's coolest, which is the coolest, Sarah Lane.
[02:12:18.020 --> 02:12:19.020]   Thank you, Georgia.
[02:12:19.020 --> 02:12:20.020]   Great to see you.
[02:12:20.020 --> 02:12:21.020]   Thank you.
[02:12:21.020 --> 02:12:26.300]   Can I mention that we have a new video up for anxiety dash videos dot com and it's on
[02:12:26.300 --> 02:12:31.820]   relaxation techniques for if you're feeling stressed out and we also have our sleep video.
[02:12:31.820 --> 02:12:33.020]   I'm not feeling stressed out.
[02:12:33.020 --> 02:12:35.860]   Why do you keep saying I'm feeling stressed out?
[02:12:35.860 --> 02:12:37.860]   I would never say that on air.
[02:12:37.860 --> 02:12:39.700]   I bet you have patience to do that.
[02:12:39.700 --> 02:12:41.700]   What do you mean anxious?
[02:12:41.700 --> 02:12:43.700]   I don't pray.
[02:12:43.700 --> 02:12:46.540]   I don't pray.
[02:12:46.540 --> 02:12:49.380]   This is actually a great sign.
[02:12:49.380 --> 02:12:50.620]   A lot of great videos.
[02:12:50.620 --> 02:12:53.460]   Georgia does these with her partner and it's there.
[02:12:53.460 --> 02:12:54.980]   There's sleep on here.
[02:12:54.980 --> 02:12:57.380]   It's just great stuff.
[02:12:57.380 --> 02:12:59.900]   And you know, I mean, it's in Canadian.
[02:12:59.900 --> 02:13:01.180]   So it's almost free.
[02:13:01.180 --> 02:13:03.540]   We're almost paying you to buy them.
[02:13:03.540 --> 02:13:05.700]   They're apologetic during the year.
[02:13:05.700 --> 02:13:06.700]   Yeah.
[02:13:06.700 --> 02:13:08.100]   No, it's really great.
[02:13:08.100 --> 02:13:09.700]   I highly recommend it.
[02:13:09.700 --> 02:13:14.420]   Anxiety dash videos dot com and your sleep series is still there, right?
[02:13:14.420 --> 02:13:15.620]   Yes, it is.
[02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:16.620]   Yeah.
[02:13:16.620 --> 02:13:17.620]   That was really good.
[02:13:17.620 --> 02:13:18.620]   I really enjoyed that.
[02:13:18.620 --> 02:13:21.860]   You can you can also buy DVDs if you have a DVD player.
[02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:23.460]   Yeah, just down low.
[02:13:23.460 --> 02:13:24.460]   Digital down low.
[02:13:24.460 --> 02:13:25.460]   Yeah, that's just down low.
[02:13:25.460 --> 02:13:26.460]   Yeah.
[02:13:26.460 --> 02:13:27.460]   Most people should do that.
[02:13:27.460 --> 02:13:28.460]   Yeah.
[02:13:28.460 --> 02:13:29.460]   Most people probably do.
[02:13:29.460 --> 02:13:30.460]   Thank you.
[02:13:30.460 --> 02:13:33.220]   Thank you to Philip Elmer Doet.
[02:13:33.220 --> 02:13:34.300]   We don't know the domain yet.
[02:13:34.300 --> 02:13:40.660]   We're thinking PED30.com, but his Apple 3.0 newsletter will be starting soon.
[02:13:40.660 --> 02:13:41.660]   Real soon now.
[02:13:41.660 --> 02:13:42.660]   That's exciting.
[02:13:42.660 --> 02:13:43.660]   Congratulations.
[02:13:43.660 --> 02:13:44.660]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:13:44.660 --> 02:13:48.340]   It's the most entrepreneurial thing I've done since I delivered papers, I think.
[02:13:48.340 --> 02:13:52.580]   You know, there's a lot of people like you and me who made our way in mainstream media
[02:13:52.580 --> 02:13:57.380]   for years and just decided to, I mean, that was the best thing I ever did was decided
[02:13:57.380 --> 02:13:59.060]   to go on my own.
[02:13:59.060 --> 02:14:04.380]   I've been very lucky as a result, but you know, but I think it was a good move in hindsight.
[02:14:04.380 --> 02:14:05.980]   So we'll scare you.
[02:14:05.980 --> 02:14:09.220]   Yeah, you don't have your Tesla yet, but it's coming.
[02:14:09.220 --> 02:14:11.220]   As long as Elon's not mad at me.
[02:14:11.220 --> 02:14:13.300]   I hope he wasn't listening to the show.
[02:14:13.300 --> 02:14:15.100]   I hope you're not mad at me.
[02:14:15.100 --> 02:14:16.100]   No, he knows.
[02:14:16.100 --> 02:14:17.100]   He knows I love it.
[02:14:17.100 --> 02:14:18.100]   He loves Tesla.
[02:14:18.100 --> 02:14:19.100]   I love my Tesla.
[02:14:19.100 --> 02:14:20.340]   Actually, I'll probably be one of those.
[02:14:20.340 --> 02:14:21.340]   I already am.
[02:14:21.340 --> 02:14:22.340]   I don't even have it.
[02:14:22.340 --> 02:14:25.700]   I'm one of those insufferable people can't stop talking about his car.
[02:14:25.700 --> 02:14:26.700]   I know.
[02:14:26.700 --> 02:14:27.700]   I fully understand that.
[02:14:27.700 --> 02:14:29.700]   He's like, "I'm not going to be a real person."
[02:14:29.700 --> 02:14:33.660]   He's like, "What's cool is I have solar panels on the roof, so I'm not -- I'm just using
[02:14:33.660 --> 02:14:35.700]   the sun to drive around."
[02:14:35.700 --> 02:14:36.700]   I think that's --
[02:14:36.700 --> 02:14:37.700]   Oh, I love that.
[02:14:37.700 --> 02:14:38.700]   Yeah.
[02:14:38.700 --> 02:14:39.700]   Makes me look good.
[02:14:39.700 --> 02:14:40.700]   I love that.
[02:14:40.700 --> 02:14:41.700]   It's so cool.
[02:14:41.700 --> 02:14:46.200]   You know, attention to the hot tub, the wine cooler, the, you know, the -- the lights burning
[02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:51.380]   all hours of the day and night, the 15 computers, the giant Minecraft server, nothing -- pay
[02:14:51.380 --> 02:14:53.180]   no attention to that.
[02:14:53.180 --> 02:14:54.740]   My car is solar power.
[02:14:54.740 --> 02:14:55.740]   Yeah.
[02:14:55.740 --> 02:14:56.740]   Great.
[02:14:56.740 --> 02:14:57.740]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:14:57.740 --> 02:15:00.940]   I really appreciate your making your way up, even though you could be probably at some big
[02:15:00.940 --> 02:15:02.780]   Super Bowl event right now.
[02:15:02.780 --> 02:15:03.780]   With Jiff Palm.
[02:15:03.780 --> 02:15:04.780]   With Jiff Palm.
[02:15:04.780 --> 02:15:05.780]   She could be with Jiff.
[02:15:05.780 --> 02:15:06.780]   She's left Jiff for us.
[02:15:06.780 --> 02:15:07.780]   That matters.
[02:15:07.780 --> 02:15:08.780]   You did.
[02:15:08.780 --> 02:15:09.780]   I gave Leo my Super Bowl Sunday.
[02:15:09.780 --> 02:15:10.780]   That's how much I loved that.
[02:15:10.780 --> 02:15:11.780]   That's amazing.
[02:15:11.780 --> 02:15:12.780]   Oh my God.
[02:15:12.780 --> 02:15:13.780]   That's amazing.
[02:15:13.780 --> 02:15:20.140]   You have to make like a Liberty Loves Leo t-shirt with Jiff Palm at the bottom.
[02:15:20.140 --> 02:15:21.380]   I could brush my hair like that.
[02:15:21.380 --> 02:15:22.380]   I just, you know.
[02:15:22.380 --> 02:15:23.380]   I'm going to get a little bit.
[02:15:23.380 --> 02:15:30.380]   I can walk on my legs and everything.
[02:15:30.380 --> 02:15:31.380]   I think.
[02:15:31.380 --> 02:15:32.380]   It's telling.
[02:15:32.380 --> 02:15:36.140]   Hey, we thank you all for being here, even on Super Bowl Sunday.
[02:15:36.140 --> 02:15:37.140]   You know what?
[02:15:37.140 --> 02:15:38.460]   We've got a great live studio audience.
[02:15:38.460 --> 02:15:39.460]   Thank you for coming.
[02:15:39.460 --> 02:15:40.460]   I know you're bored, but that's okay.
[02:15:40.460 --> 02:15:41.460]   It's almost over.
[02:15:41.460 --> 02:15:43.460]   Oh, are they asleep?
[02:15:43.460 --> 02:15:44.460]   Let's see them.
[02:15:44.460 --> 02:15:45.460]   Let's see them.
[02:15:45.460 --> 02:15:46.460]   Let's see them.
[02:15:46.460 --> 02:15:47.460]   She was drifting off.
[02:15:47.460 --> 02:15:48.460]   Was she drifting off?
[02:15:48.460 --> 02:15:49.460]   Oh, yeah.
[02:15:49.460 --> 02:15:50.460]   Jiff Palm.
[02:15:50.460 --> 02:15:51.460]   I didn't even think we were going to have a seat.
[02:15:51.460 --> 02:15:56.380]   I said, my God, how long does this go on for?
[02:15:56.380 --> 02:15:57.700]   They said it would be a short show.
[02:15:57.700 --> 02:15:58.700]   It was.
[02:15:58.700 --> 02:16:01.540]   Only two hours, 14 minutes.
[02:16:01.540 --> 02:16:03.540]   Nothing.
[02:16:03.540 --> 02:16:06.340]   If you want to be in the studio audience, tickets, just email tickets at Twit.tv.
[02:16:06.340 --> 02:16:07.340]   We're glad to have you.
[02:16:07.340 --> 02:16:09.100]   Somebody flew all the way from where?
[02:16:09.100 --> 02:16:10.100]   Milwaukee.
[02:16:10.100 --> 02:16:11.100]   Milwaukee.
[02:16:11.100 --> 02:16:12.100]   No, Milwaukee.
[02:16:12.100 --> 02:16:13.100]   To be here.
[02:16:13.100 --> 02:16:14.100]   Yes.
[02:16:14.100 --> 02:16:15.100]   That's so cool.
[02:16:15.100 --> 02:16:16.100]   I've touched.
[02:16:16.100 --> 02:16:17.100]   I'm on it.
[02:16:17.100 --> 02:16:18.100]   It's dedicated fans here for Twit.
[02:16:18.100 --> 02:16:19.100]   Isn't that nice?
[02:16:19.100 --> 02:16:20.100]   Yeah.
[02:16:20.100 --> 02:16:21.180]   There's been a lot of live watchers.
[02:16:21.180 --> 02:16:22.180]   That's nice.
[02:16:22.180 --> 02:16:24.660]   But if you don't want to watch live and you can't make this studio, guess what?
[02:16:24.660 --> 02:16:26.140]   On-demand audio and video.
[02:16:26.140 --> 02:16:27.420]   Don't tell anybody.
[02:16:27.420 --> 02:16:29.020]   Always available after the fact.
[02:16:29.020 --> 02:16:30.980]   Either go to Twit.tv or YouTube channel.
[02:16:30.980 --> 02:16:31.980]   We've got a great one.
[02:16:31.980 --> 02:16:34.540]   Actually, youtube.com/twit is the starting point.
[02:16:34.540 --> 02:16:36.220]   Each show has its own channel.
[02:16:36.220 --> 02:16:40.740]   There's also Twit bits, little shorts from all the shows, including a whole product review
[02:16:40.740 --> 02:16:43.140]   playlist where we put all our product reviews.
[02:16:43.140 --> 02:16:45.540]   That's youtube.com/twit.
[02:16:45.540 --> 02:16:50.020]   You can also go to your favorite podcatcher, including out.
[02:16:50.020 --> 02:16:51.640]   There's five Apple TV apps.
[02:16:51.640 --> 02:16:52.640]   There's Roku.
[02:16:52.640 --> 02:16:53.640]   There's everything.
[02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:54.640]   Everything.
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:55.640]   iOS, Android.
[02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:56.640]   And subscribe.
[02:16:56.640 --> 02:16:58.420]   That way you won't miss an episode.
[02:16:58.420 --> 02:16:59.900]   Thanks for being here, everybody.
[02:16:59.900 --> 02:17:00.900]   Have a great week.
[02:17:00.900 --> 02:17:01.900]   We'll see you next time, another Twit.
[02:17:01.900 --> 02:17:02.900]   It's in the can.
[02:17:02.900 --> 02:17:03.900]   It's in the can.
[02:17:03.900 --> 02:17:03.900]   Bye-bye.
