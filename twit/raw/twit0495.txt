[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.100]   It's time for Twit this weekend tech, the show where we cover the latest
[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.100]   news super Sunday episode. Nick Bilton is here from the New York
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.100]   Times fashion and leisure section. What are you talking about?
[00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.100]   What section are you in now? Just keep going.
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.100]   Author, I live in the future and Skype works here.
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.100]   He's also the author of Hatching Twitter, a fabulous book and he's working on a new one
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.100]   we'll talk about in just a second.
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.100]   Also, right next to him actually, Baratunde Thurston of CultivatedWit.com.
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.100]   Baratunde, of course, the author of How to Be Black.
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.100]   That was a joke, the How to Be White book. He's not doing that.
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.100]   It's already been done.
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.100]   It's already been done.
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.100]   Other books.
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.100]   Baratunde, great to see you again.
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.100]   It's so good to be back. It's been quite a while.
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.100]   I've not done a remote inset to it forever.
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.100]   And it's good to sort of see your face.
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.100]   I love getting Baratunde and built in on.
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.100]   These are your magical shows.
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.100]   Let's not build it up too much. Let's see how this all plays out.
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.100]   We've got some fun technical startups.
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.100]   Yeah.
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.100]   We should just point out Nick at any time could fall off the face of the earth.
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.100]   But I'll be here in Digital Spirit.
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.100]   In Digital Spirit.
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.100]   So you're working on a success.
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.100]   That's not a successor to Hatching Twitter.
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.100]   It's a new book about the Silk Road.
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.100]   It is.
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.100]   The news came out this week and I'm writing the book about the Silk Road and the Dread Pirate Roberts
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.100]   and a crazy, crazy, crazy story.
[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.100]   The trial going on right now.
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.100]   Yeah. I was in New York the last couple of weeks covering the trial.
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.100]   And I have finally, I finally understand why they call it courtroom drama.
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.100]   Why?
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.100]   Because there's so much drama. It's just so intense and everyone is the prosecution and the defense.
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.100]   And you know, it's one of the few instances where I think on television,
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.100]   they are not able to capture the real drama that's taking place.
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.100]   In a courtroom, it's really, really intense.
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.100]   I agree. And you know, whenever I have free time, I like to sit in court rooms and watch.
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.100]   Because sometimes it can be really is better than the TV shows.
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.100]   It's really great.
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.100]   Well, it's amazing because you're in there and, you know, I'm in the press gaggle with, you know,
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.100]   great reportish and forms and wired and so on that have been covering the whole thing from the beginning.
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.100]   And to the left of us in the other seats is the family.
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.100]   Ross Ulbrich, who is accused of being the Dread Pirate Roberts.
[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.100]   You see his dad and his mom and his sister and all these people.
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:20.100]   And it's incredibly difficult to kind of watch that to see the reality of kind of what the story could end up doing to them.
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:32.100]   So what do you noticing from, like, we all, especially people on this show who listen to the show are much more tech literate about things like the dark internet and whatnot.
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.100]   Now you're in the mainstream. You're in a public courtroom where maybe they don't know what's going on.
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.100]   Maybe they don't know nearly as much as these listeners.
[00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.100]   Is that from what you've seen, even the little bit you've seen?
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.100]   Is that an issue? Are you, like, pulling your hair up?
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.100]   Like, no, that's not how it works.
[00:04:48.100 --> 00:05:01.100]   That is an excellent, excellent question because there's a couple of things that are going on in the trial where somebody from Vice wrote this really great piece that said the problem with the jury in the Silk Road trial is they don't understand the internet.
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:09.100]   And they literally, as far as we're all concerned, they don't. They've never heard of Bitcoin. They've never heard of Tor, the dark web. They don't know what cryptocurrencies are.
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:15.100]   You know, they don't even understand. I mean, they don't understand certain instances of emoji and things like that.
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:24.100]   So there's these instances in court where there was one, one of them, why the prosecution was reading the chat log between the Dreadfire Roberts and one of his people that worked for him.
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:36.100]   And he didn't mention a smiley face emoji. And so there was, after the jury had walked out at lunchtime, there was a big discussion and debate about whether the emoji should be explained and so on.
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:53.100]   And, you know, just that alone was really fascinating. The other thing that's been interesting is the prosecution and the judge have been pushing for a glossary that the jury can have that would explain what a, you know, the Bitcoin means or what's going on in the case of the jury.
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:06:06.100]   Bitcoin means or what this or that the other are. And the defense is kind of pushing against it because I think that one of the goals of the defense is like, is to kind of confuse a little bit as to what these things mean and what they are.
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:15.100]   But there's also, it's really difficult for them to come up with a conclusive definition of what certain technologies are because they mean different things to everyone.
[00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:29.100]   If you're the prosecution, you could say, "Tor is a network that is used for the dark web mostly to go and buy drugs." If you're the defense, you can say, "Tor is a network that people who live overseas can safely talk to their family and friends with."
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:37.100]   So it's been really fascinating seeing that. But you definitely get the sense that they have no concept of what people are talking about most of the time.
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.100]   Were you there for jury selection?
[00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.100]   I was there for jury selection.
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.100]   I mean, obviously both sides wanted this jury, right?
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:50.100]   Yeah, so both sides didn't want anyone who understood tack too much. They didn't want people to know.
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.100]   No, seriously.
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.100]   It's true.
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:59.100]   It's true. One of the questions they would ask to decide who they were going to put on the jury was.
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:04.100]   They didn't want anyone on the jury who read the news on their mobile devices or on their computer.
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.100]   They wanted people to read the news and using traditional newspapers and media sources.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:17.100]   It really is interesting. It is definitely a wide range of our peers of all walks of life.
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:23.100]   It's funny. There's one guy in the back who you've seen kind of fall and sleep sometimes.
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:32.100]   He catches himself. When they're explaining how a Bitcoin exchange works, they get into the minutia of every single aspect of it.
[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.100]   They're showing MD5 hashes and this, that and the other.
[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.100]   They're hoping to obfuscate it.
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.100]   Yeah.
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.100]   Confuse them.
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.100]   Yeah, I wonder. I mean, one of these.
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.100]   Because they don't need to know that to understand.
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:50.100]   No, no. And that's part of the beauty. I mean, justice should transcend your understanding of networking protocols.
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:56.100]   There's the sense of right and wrong should somehow still be available if the story is being told effectively.
[00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:02.100]   And I'm just like for us, it would be like traveling 20 years into the future and being jurist on a trial about things we've never heard of.
[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:08.100]   But we can still somehow suss out when someone's being wronged or being wrong in a situation.
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:16.100]   That's like an, as I said, interesting theoretical test for me of like how much information is required to render a sound judgment.
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:21.100]   Although I have to say, I've watched a lot of the good life. So I feel like I understand how this works now.
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.100]   Well, yeah, obviously. I mean, I'm not.
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.100]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:30.100]   No, you're actually, if you're actually right, I know a lawyer, a couple of lawyers I've spoken to.
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:35.100]   And they said the good wife is exactly right every single time in the legal aspects.
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.100]   Wow.
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.100]   So you probably do know.
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:50.100]   I feel like there's this ideal, which, Baratunde, you just described of, hey, we don't need to understand the nitty gritty, the technical details to understand this case.
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:55.100]   But then there's the reality of it, which is that both sides are really trying to obfuscate.
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:09:01.100]   They are their interest is in not having the jury understand this case.
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:09.100]   In either case, because the more they don't understand, the easier it is for them to slant it in a way that favors their night.
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:15.100]   Yeah, you can manipulate people who are ignorant much more than you can manipulate people who have a full understanding.
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:20.100]   And that is the premise of our democracy.
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.100]   USA, USA, USA.
[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:33.100]   Well, I do have to say, though, it has been a very eye-opening experience to see that because you have this assumption that people do understand Bitcoin and so on.
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:40.100]   And the other thing that's been really fascinating is, you know, as a reporter, the New York Times, my job is to kind of explain these things in layman's terms to people.
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:45.100]   And you definitely see that there are other industries where that is completely 100% necessary.
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:58.100]   You should have, there should be someone on the legal teams of both groups, you know, being able to come up with really good analogies for, you know, how bitcoins are exchanged or what's towards.
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:04.100]   It's a challenge of storytelling not to get too much in the weeds, but, you know, cereals, obviously a podcast people have been talking about a lot.
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:11.100]   And I ended up having a conversation with an assistant district attorney who said, "Look, every case is muddy."
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.100]   And there is no pure truth that we have access to.
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:20.100]   Like, people think, "If I just had more information, I could absolutely know exactly what happened when and where."
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:24.100]   And that's not the case. We never have full information. We have our best judgment.
[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:29.100]   We have our best storytelling capabilities. And we have a little bit of faith and trust.
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:35.100]   And that's better than zero. That's better than like random slaughter and assassination executions.
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:41.100]   So we're above that, we're not medieval anymore. But pure justice is probably not attainable.
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:51.100]   And someone in the chat room also added like, "Yeah, there's a lot of tech in this case, but if you are looking at a case that involves high performance automobiles, and that's key to the case, like most people don't know about that either."
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:59.100]   So there's always going to be some gap in full education. Our system shouldn't require everyone to be an expert on internet technology.
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:09.100]   It's really easy to understand that what was going on, that Silk Road was kind of a black market using the internet to sell illicit goods, including drugs online.
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:13.100]   You don't need to know Tor. You don't need to get a special degree to know about that.
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:23.100]   Any of this, but what you have to do is the jury is follow the logic of Ross Albrecht being the kid who ran it.
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:32.100]   And that's tough because the evidence, I don't, I don't, I, I dimly remember the FBI catching him about a year ago and how they caught him.
[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:40.100]   And I think that's what the jury is going to have to assess is, is this electronic evidence compelling that he did it?
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:44.100]   Because there's no, there's no smoking gun. It's not like, well, he was seeing that.
[00:11:44.100 --> 00:12:00.100]   I'll tell you what the smoking gun was. The smoking gun was actually the defense's opening statement where the judge, Dre Tell, who is representing Ross, came out out in the open and the beginning.
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:07.100]   Not judge attorney. Sorry, the judge, the attorney, Dre Tell came out in the beginning and said, "My client started the Silk Road."
[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:12.100]   But then he, it got a little overwhelming and he, he, he left soon after.
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.100]   And he's not the dread pirate Roberts.
[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:18.100]   And he's not the dread pirate Roberts and the real dread pirate Roberts framed him and so on.
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:27.100]   But, but that was, I mean, that was a shock in the courtroom when he said, "My client started it because from the beginning, the defense has always said that they had nothing to do with it."
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:34.100]   Dre Tell said, quote, "He created as a completely freewheeling free market site that could sell anything."
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:38.100]   In other words, it's just a marketplace except a couple of items that were harmful.
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:44.100]   But after several months, the work became too stressful and Mr. Obrick handed it off to others.
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:50.100]   And then he's, then he's the fall, a perfect fall guy for the real guy.
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:13:04.100]   One of my favorite little moments in the trial was when they had one of the FBI forensics experts come out and explain what they found on Ross's laptop when they caught him in the library.
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:19.100]   And as he was logged into the Silk Road as mastermind and all these things, he was also bit torrenting at that very moment a video interview with Stephen Colbert and Vince Gilligan of the Creative Breaking Bad,
[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.100]   which I thought was, which was quite ironic.
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.100]   I like that.
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.100]   Yeah.
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.100]   So the one who knocks.
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.100]   We've learned some interesting things from this trial.
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:37.100]   One of the things that was kind of a huge story was that Mount Gox, was this, am I right on this, had invested in Silk Road? What's the story there?
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:47.100]   There was a point in time when the CEO, Mark Carpellus of Mount Gox was considered the possible to rip out Roberts.
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:53.100]   And that was originally going to be the defense's case that it could have been him.
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:58.100]   But the prosecution argued, well, there was 400 people that it could have been until we found the right person.
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.100]   There were always other suspects in the case.
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:08.100]   But there was some stuff that went on with the servers being housed in certain places that could have been perceived.
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:13.100]   And there was all these different things, but that was all kind of squashed after the fact.
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:18.100]   The Catholic force, the judge said, no, that's inadmissible.
[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:24.100]   The fact that the Department of Homeland Security thought it might be Mark Carpellus is inadmissible.
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:25.100]   Yep.
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.100]   It's fascinating to watch this.
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.100]   How much more longer is this trial expected to go on?
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:38.100]   The prosecution was supposed to rest actually Monday tomorrow, but because of the snow, they're expecting to delay the trial a day.
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.100]   So the prosecution will probably rest on Tuesday.
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:44.100]   And the defense is expected to take two more days.
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.100]   They have seven-day character witnesses coming.
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.100]   And then there are two big questions.
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:54.100]   The first big question is, will Ross testify?
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:57.100]   If he does, it's going to be two days.
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:03.100]   They think of back and forth, but it's a risky, risky, risky bet for him to testify.
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:12.100]   And as in every case, if he doesn't testify, there's some presumption that Jerry might think he's avoiding being questioned because he's guilty.
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:16.100]   If he does, he could absolutely say something stupid in the trials over.
[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.100]   It's always a challenge.
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.100]   I know this from watching The Good Wife, by the way, I'm...
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.100]   I'm exactly real.
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.100]   I went to the law school.
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.100]   Serial is law school, isn't it?
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.100]   Podcast.
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.100]   That works.
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.100]   It's great.
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.100]   It's much more affordable than actual.
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:47.100]   So after the defense rest, they're going to do their closing statements, which I think are going to be very, very intense, because that's when they're going to really kind of get into the murders that didn't necessarily happen, but they were...
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:51.100]   He was accused of offering Bitcoin to assassins?
[00:15:51.100 --> 00:16:02.100]   Yes, so that's when they're going to get into that from the prosecution side, and that's when the defense is going to get into all these other people that could have been and how his laptop may have been taken over by hackers and so on.
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.100]   And then the jury has to decide.
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:11.100]   And there are a lot of charges against him, some of which there's a kingpin charge, which could be life in jail.
[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:14.100]   There's numerous drug charges.
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:19.100]   And if he's found guilty, he's going to be in quite some trouble.
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:22.100]   30 years old, he could be spending the rest of his life in that prison.
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.100]   Yeah.
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.100]   There was one moment in the...
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:43.100]   It's amazing to see all the things that take place in the courtroom when there's not court and session, but there was one moment when one of the days when during the lunch break, the judge, the same judge sentenced someone else, a man to jail for 12 years for drug dealing, and his family were there and they were screaming and crying.
[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.100]   It's intense stuff.
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.100]   Like to see it firsthand, it's really, really, really intense.
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:50.100]   I was on a jury for one of the trials.
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.100]   I remember the...
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:57.100]   God, the horrible thing they used to do on NBC to catch a predator.
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.100]   Uh-huh.
[00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:05.100]   MSNBC, where they would set up a house and they would entice people to come there and credit for date on young girls.
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:09.100]   And I was on the jury of one of these guys who was being tried.
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:10.100]   Wow.
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:13.100]   And it's a similar kind of thing because the jury has to...
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:16.100]   You know, they're reading transcripts from chat rooms and all sorts of stuff.
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:20.100]   And a very similar issue of how much technical information you need for this.
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:25.100]   But it was interesting because we heard the prosecution's case and then the judge threw it out saying it's entrapment.
[00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.100]   You don't have to hear the defense.
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.100]   It's over.
[00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.100]   Wow.
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.100]   He like that.
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:37.100]   But I've had a similar experience, but what we didn't have and what you have, which is great, is the stuff where the jury's out of the room.
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.100]   All the wrangling over a smiley face.
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:45.100]   The judge finally did rule that the smiley face is part of the information of the message and should be read.
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:51.100]   And the judge ruled that they didn't want the chat logs being read with any sort of special emphasis.
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.100]   Don't they just...
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:56.100]   Why don't they not have a big screen in the courtroom to show?
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.100]   Like this is a visual medium.
[00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.100]   Why are we...
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.100]   They still have to speak...
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:03.100]   There has to be for the record so that someone still has to speak what they're showing.
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.100]   Um, and it's...
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.100]   We did the same thing.
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:10.100]   You have people reading in a dry dull voice.
[00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:17.100]   You know, this young girl supposedly who's not as an adult woman talking to this adult.
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.100]   Uh, and it's very...
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:20.100]   Oh, they should.
[00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.100]   This is like...
[00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.100]   I'm in a lay the past few months.
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.100]   There's a lot of out of work actors here.
[00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:25.100]   I think we should...
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.100]   No, because any dramatization slants it.
[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.100]   Any dramatization slants it.
[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.100]   And we'll do multiple versions of it.
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.100]   That's even more work.
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:38.100]   I guess what I'm saying guys is I support the arts.
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.100]   I agree.
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.100]   It's a higher in our arts programs in this country.
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.100]   Especially in our criminal justice.
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:44.100]   We'll watch with interest.
[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.100]   Nick, you're in the middle of writing a book about this.
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.100]   Uh, boy, what a story.
[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:51.100]   And obviously it would be a great movie.
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.100]   Fox has already optioned the book.
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:57.100]   Uh, yeah, I'm working with these two guys from Epic Magazine.
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.100]   They are...
[00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:03.100]   Uh, one of the guys, Josh Berman did the movie Argo.
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.100]   And we're in the magazine piece that became Argo.
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.100]   So we're kind of teaming up to do the movie stuff.
[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.100]   And I'm doing the book stuff.
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.100]   It'll be a great movie.
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:11.100]   Yeah.
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.100]   Yeah.
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.100]   It's a really, really fascinating story.
[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:16.100]   How long after the trial do you expect the book to come out?
[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:20.100]   Is it one of those things where you're going to try to turn around right away while there's still interest?
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.100]   Or...
[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:23.100]   Um, I think there'll be interest for quite some time.
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:28.100]   I think it's, you know, it's a story that, you know, it's breaking bad.
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.100]   Um, you know, in real life.
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:34.100]   Um, uh, so, um, without the crystal math, but maybe the...
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.100]   Well, it was crystal math.
[00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.100]   It was crystal math.
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.100]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.100]   That's the whole exciting...
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.100]   And hired, and hired assassins.
[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.100]   I mean, this is a great...
[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.100]   Amazing.
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:43.100]   So I'm hoping that the...
[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:50.100]   Hopefully we'll get the book done by the end of the year, um, and, uh, and we'll see how long Hollywood wants to take to do the movie.
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.100]   Yeah.
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.100]   Will they get Johnny Depp to play the Dread Pirate Roberts?
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.100]   That would be kind of neat.
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:56.100]   That would be epic.
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:00.100]   And then we could get far too today to play his mistress.
[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.100]   I don't know what that means.
[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.100]   I don't know what that means.
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.100]   I don't know where that's going.
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.100]   He's wearing a boys in the hood hat.
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.100]   Where do you get that hat?
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:13.100]   I, uh, I got it from this shop on a neighborhood called Fairfax.
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.100]   It's kind of retro, is that considered nostalgia?
[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.100]   Yeah, the shop is called Youth.
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.100]   And, uh, they're just, they have some really cool stuff.
[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.100]   And I felt like, you know, I'm doing this...
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.100]   I live in New York.
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:26.100]   I also am starting to live more here.
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:31.100]   And this is me trying to embrace, instead of pretending like I'm just visiting, like, let me try to have a ride.
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.100]   You want to, you want to feel old?
[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.100]   You know how old that movie is?
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.100]   23 years old.
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.100]   No, Boys in the Hood?
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.100]   In 1991.
[00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.100]   You want to feel old?
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.100]   It's funny, Leo.
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:45.100]   That somehow makes me feel younger and more invincible.
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.100]   Okay, whatever it takes, uh...
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.100]   Your dark magic doesn't work.
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.100]   We're gonna...
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.100]   I'm trying.
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.100]   We're gonna take a break.
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.100]   What a hat.
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:56.100]   I'm gonna grab my power cord while you take a quick break.
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:01.100]   Grab your power cord, 'cause battery life is a terrible thing to waste.
[00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:07.000]   When we come back, we're gonna talk about the most successful quarter, the highest quarterly
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.100]   profits in the history of the world.
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:11.100]   In the history of the world.
[00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.100]   But first, you know what's...
[00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:15.100]   Super Sunday.
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:19.100]   And we got a big Super Bowl ad coming up from our favorite guys.
[00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.100]   They're doing it again, Squarespace.
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.100]   And I'm really excited about this.
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.100]   You know Squarespace.com.
[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:30.100]   It's a great place to create your own website, whether it's for a business or for personal,
[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.100]   for a portfolio.
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.100]   So they've teamed up with Jeff Bridges.
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:39.100]   You remember the scene in the Big Lebowski where he's bowling and he's flying over the
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:40.100]   bowling alley?
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:44.100]   They have made a dreamingwithjef.com site.
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.100]   This will be a great test.
[00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:47.100]   We've always said you cannot...
[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.100]   You cannot bring a Squarespace site down.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.100]   They are going to...
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.100]   How many people watch the Super Bowl?
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:56.100]   40 million people will be going to this site at once.
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:03.100]   If they can survive, 40 million people visiting a website at the same time they can host your
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.100]   site.
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:10.100]   The Jeff Bridges Sleeping Tapes is a Super Bowl ad featuring his album of relaxing sounds
[00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.100]   and stories to put you to sleep.
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.100]   What is he out there?
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.100]   Can you put the sound up?
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.100]   What is he recording?
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.100]   Squarespace.
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.100]   I want to show you guys how you can make your own Squarespace.
[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.100]   Dude is a character.
[00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:22.100]   He is a character.
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.100]   Kevin Flynn is also in this...
[00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.100]   Or he was Kevin Flynn from Toronto.
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:29.100]   I don't know if Kevin Flynn makes an appearance in this.
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:33.100]   Squarespace.com, if you want to check out not only the ad but also his site.
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:37.100]   And if you want a great site like Jeff Bridges, go to Squarespace.com.
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.100]   Take a look at Squarespace 714 new designs.
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:45.100]   That means there's a total of 30 templates, even one that Jeff Bridges uses.
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.100]   For musicians, for architects, for artists, they've got some great custom sites.
[00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.100]   For anybody, weddings, restaurants, e-commerce.
[00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:56.100]   Making changes is so much easier because now you can edit on a live edit on a single screen.
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.100]   You don't have to go back and forth to a preview mode.
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:01.100]   They have Getty images for just $10 each.
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.100]   Thousands of images for you.
[00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.100]   Social media is built in.
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:07.100]   Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, Tumblr, YouTube, Pinterest and more.
[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.100]   They got the social media.
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:10.100]   They got it locked in, man.
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.100]   They know how to do that.
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:17.100]   And I think, you know, for you, Baratunde, as you build this new career, Squarespace,
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.100]   would be a great place for you.
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.100]   Oh, man.
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.100]   I mean, tour dates.
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:25.100]   One of the things that I like about your advertisers is that I already use all of them.
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:28.100]   So I have no issue whatsoever with like jumping in.
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.100]   Don't we love them?
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.100]   Don't we love them?
[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:31.100]   Yeah.
[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.100]   I found out about Squarespace, I don't know, six years ago because of Twit,
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.100]   been using them since we used them.
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.100]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:40.100]   For a cultivated whit, we're doing this comedy hackathon at comedyhackday.org.
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.100]   Try to bring that down Twit.
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.100]   Is that a Squarespace site?
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:43.100]   That's a Squarespace site.
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:46.100]   They're actually a sponsor of our music.
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.100]   Oh, that's great.
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:53.100]   And so we'll be the part of San Francisco Sketchfest in exactly one week, February 8th Marines.
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:56.100]   Everybody go to comedyhackday.org now.
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:57.100]   Bring it down.
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:58.100]   That can't try.
[00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:59.100]   Try your horse.
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:02.100]   You can't throw your iPads at it.
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.100]   Just do it.
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.100]   And you know what's great?
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:05.100]   You could try it free for two weeks.
[00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:06.100]   You don't need to, oh, look, a Neil Dash.
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:10.100]   You don't need to pay for the first two weeks.
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:12.100]   You don't even need to give them a credit card.
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.100]   That'll give you a great sense of what it can do.
[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.100]   Then if you decide to buy it as little as $8 a month, you buy a year.
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.100]   You get the domain name free.
[00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:22.100]   I mean, it really is a great deal for the best hosting and the best software.
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:23.100]   You've got to try it.
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.100]   When you do buy, make sure you use Twit.
[00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.100]   I hope you use Twit to get 10% off.
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:30.100]   We should, well, because they were working with us.
[00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:31.100]   You didn't have to worry about that.
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:32.100]   You didn't have to do it that way.
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.100]   We had your own code.
[00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.100]   Other sites for sure.
[00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.100]   Now, it's February 6th through 8th.
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.100]   Oh, boy.
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.100]   Yes, it's a three-day event.
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.100]   People show up.
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.100]   This is like a fun, weird, weird thing.
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:45.100]   We have all the other
[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:49.100]   ingredients and software developers get together to make funny apps on purpose in a 48-hour sprint.
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.100]   And Veronica Belmont is one of your judges.
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:58.100]   Yeah, we have Scott Ockerman is a judge on Natasha LeGero, Jonah Ray from Nerdist, and Veronica Belmont.
[00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.100]   What a great panel.
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:05.100]   And I'm hosting it so if people are not disgusted by me, they should show for that as well.
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:11.100]   Yeah, so it's like sometimes Silicon Valley produces ridiculous apps that we all love to make fun of.
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.100]   We're doing it on purpose.
[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:17.100]   What was the weirdest one last time that you did this?
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:20.100]   You know, my recent favorite was a hardware one.
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:26.100]   These kids from Stanford, they actually created an API and hacked into a Furby.
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:29.100]   And they made the Furby wearable.
[00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:36.100]   They were really, obviously lampooning a bit of Google Glass, a bit of Siri at the same time.
[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:37.100]   A wearable Furby.
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:42.100]   They asked for directions, but the Furby would be really inappropriate with its responses.
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.100]   It would judge people around you.
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:51.100]   It was amazing feeder engineering for them to pull that off in basically 30 hours and be ready to perform that in front of a live audience.
[00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:55.100]   We never know what people are going to make when they come into the weekend.
[00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:56.100]   We start on a Friday.
[00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:00.100]   But by Sunday evening, these things actually work.
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:03.100]   And here's to the hackathon rules of workable demo.
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.100]   And here's to the comedy rules of funny as hell.
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:07.100]   By the way, great looking sight.
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.100]   Really nice.
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.100]   Thank you.
[00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.100]   That's our team over at Cultivated with.
[00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:12.100]   I'm so proud to say I had nothing to do with the sight.
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:14.100]   Like I said, let's put it on Squarespace.
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.100]   It's nice.
[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:16.100]   It's really nice to be a part of a...
[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.100]   And they liked working with Squarespace.
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:19.100]   It was easy for them to get this sight.
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.100]   Squarespace has been with us almost from the very beginning.
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.100]   Yeah, that's nice.
[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:25.100]   And not to just keep kissing their butts, but they really are.
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:26.100]   They're good.
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:29.100]   Like the reason they let you trial without giving up a credit card.
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.100]   Yeah.
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.100]   That tells you something, doesn't it?
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:33.100]   Trust.
[00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.100]   Who asked for your money before they delivered a service?
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.100]   Right.
[00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.100]   That's because they don't have faith in their product.
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:41.100]   I like the idea that, hey, we're going to let you use it for four different days.
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:44.100]   If you still like it, then you can start paying.
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:48.100]   Hey, if the dude uses Squarespace and Baratunde uses Squarespace.
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:49.100]   Squarespace abides, y'all.
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:51.100]   Squarespace abides, baby.
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:52.100]   And I can't wait.
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.100]   I'm going to watch that in the Superb...
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.100]   Squarespace.
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:56.100]   We'll just mention this again.
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.100]   Then we'll move on.
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.100]   Squarespace.com, offer code.
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.100]   Twit.
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:02.100]   I have to say I'm DVRing the Superbob, but it's because I'm not.
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:04.100]   I'm not doing the Superbob, but it's because I want to see the commercials.
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:05.780]   What time does it start?
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:06.780]   I don't know.
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.580]   It starts in 37 minutes.
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:09.580]   Shut up.
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.500]   How long has it last?
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.500]   Hours.
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.500]   47 hours.
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.420]   You know, I actually read it somewhere.
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:20.820]   If you edit out all the extra stuff, the huddles even and the commercials, an entire NFL game
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:22.580]   is 11 minutes long.
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:26.740]   It's 11 minutes of actual action of people running into each other.
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:28.220]   That's great.
[00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.340]   Isn't that funny?
[00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.820]   In the Superbob is usually three and a half to four hours.
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:34.660]   A normal football game is three hours.
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:37.140]   You need a large container to hold all that money.
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:38.860]   How much is this...
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:39.860]   You must...
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:40.860]   Maybe you know this.
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.060]   How much is an ad on the Superbob this year?
[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:44.060]   It can be...
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.060]   Well, it depends where you are.
[00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:51.740]   I mean, there was the news that the Verge had bought a $700 Superbob ad.
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.180]   And it's playing in a town and like...
[00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:56.180]   Try and find it.
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:00.340]   Playing in a town and somewhere in the Midwest that has like 15 people live there.
[00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:04.020]   But if you're getting a Superbob ad on actual NBC...
[00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:05.020]   Millions.
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:07.420]   I think it's $2 million a minute.
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:12.020]   It says, "The Wall Street Journal tweeted, quote, "A 30 second ad in this year's Superbob
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:15.300]   will set a brand back about $4.5 million."
[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:16.300]   What?
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:17.300]   For 30 seconds?
[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:18.300]   30 seconds.
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:19.780]   That is the Wall Street Journal.
[00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:20.780]   So...
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:23.700]   Squarespace, I'm told, but two minutes.
[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:25.740]   And so how much did they pay you?
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:26.740]   $4.3 million?
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:27.740]   No.
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:29.740]   And I think we're better than the Superbob.
[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:30.740]   I might be wrong.
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:34.060]   Actually, Gary Vannerchuk wrote a really good piece in which he said, "No, it's worth it.
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:39.540]   I know it's $4 million, but it's worth it because of not just the ad, which does play
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.340]   to a huge audience, but the buzz.
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:47.500]   I mean, how many times have I already watched the Budweiser ad and the GoDaddy parody?
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.780]   No, and this year they got the social bowl.
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:51.980]   Like people are looking at all the interactive stuff that's going on.
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:56.820]   Have you seen Kim Kardashian's Superbob ad?
[00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:57.820]   Break the Superbob?
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:58.820]   Is that what she's going to do?
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:00.020]   I think she broke my TV.
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:01.580]   I haven't seen her.
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:02.580]   I haven't seen any of the ads.
[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:04.620]   It's an ad for a team mobile.
[00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:05.620]   Huh.
[00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:06.620]   Data sharing.
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.060]   Is it team mobile?
[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.060]   For some phone company.
[00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:10.060]   See, that's the problem.
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.060]   This is the problem.
[00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.060]   So it was a very effective example.
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.060]   The problem.
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:14.060]   I'm looking at Kim.
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:17.500]   I don't remember who the ad was.
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:18.500]   That's the problem.
[00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:19.500]   You can be too good.
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.500]   That's the problem.
[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:23.220]   You know, the earned immediately you get out of spending all that money.
[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:24.220]   It's probably worth it.
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:25.820]   We're talking about it, right?
[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:28.060]   If I had $9 million a minute to spend, I wouldn't.
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.780]   You know who has lots of money that could probably do this?
[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:31.980]   And I wonder if they will.
[00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:32.980]   Apple computer.
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:34.740]   Holy kaboli kamole.
[00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:35.740]   Look at that.
[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:36.980]   The second way, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:37.980]   Holy mackerel Andy.
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:40.620]   How much money we talking?
[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:41.620]   Eight.
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:42.620]   Okay.
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:43.620]   It's profit.
[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:44.620]   Eight.
[00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:50.020]   Eighteen billion dollars in three months at six billion dollars a month.
[00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:52.220]   How do they have $1.5 billion a week?
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:56.100]   They could create their own league and have a competing Super Bowl, which gets more viewers
[00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.100]   than the original one.
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:00.380]   Well, they have $142 billion cash in the bank.
[00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:01.380]   Like they could write a check.
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:05.220]   Like Tim Cook could walk up to me today, say, Leo, I like to cut to your jib.
[00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:08.460]   Here's a check for $142 billion.
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:09.620]   Sign Tim Cook and he can.
[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:10.620]   It would be good.
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:11.620]   It wouldn't bounce.
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.340]   What would you buy with that kind of money?
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:16.820]   What would you do with that money, Leo, if you had that money?
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:19.820]   I'd buy the Super Bowl ad.
[00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:23.420]   And you would just sit there and be like, my name is Leo LePore.
[00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:25.620]   I have one hour in potential.
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:29.340]   This is the one is the most commercial in the Super Bowl.
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:30.340]   Like come back to the game.
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.340]   Sorry, guys.
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:32.340]   I know.
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:33.340]   I bought it.
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:38.220]   I hope you got to look at this head.
[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:39.220]   Now 70.
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:40.940]   Now, by the way, all of that.
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:41.940]   Interesting.
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:49.620]   That's a note is Apple made more money in its last quarter than Amazon did in the entire
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:53.380]   year last year.
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:58.700]   66 million in revenue from Amazon.
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:30:59.700]   Not Amazon.
[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:00.700]   Sorry, Google.
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:01.700]   And Apple was 75.8.
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:04.540]   Is that right?
[00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:05.540]   Yeah.
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:06.540]   32.
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:07.540]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:10.860]   I have to go back now to the let's see.
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.700]   They sold it.
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:14.540]   iPhone sales.
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:16.540]   It was really.
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:22.340]   It was a revenue with Apple's revenue was 74.6 billion.
[00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:24.660]   74 billion dollars.
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:27.540]   And Google's for the year was 66 billion.
[00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:28.940]   In one quarter, that's revenue.
[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:31.740]   18 billion in profit, though, is what blows me away.
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:35.820]   There's no company in the history of the world that has made that much profit that
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:36.820]   fast.
[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:39.900]   And then if you look at the breakdown of it, it's iPhone.
[00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:40.900]   It's iPhone.
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:41.900]   It's just it's iPhone.
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:45.100]   In fact, iPad sales down 22%.
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:49.980]   When you make a phone that looks as big as an iPad, it's in the six plus.
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.220]   It was kind of a little redundant.
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:58.820]   They sold 74.5 million iPhones, a mere 21.5 million iPads.
[00:31:58.820 --> 00:31:59.820]   Yeah.
[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:00.820]   Yeah.
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:03.620]   So I was not a part of that.
[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:08.540]   I actually I just my right the last page in Fast Company every month.
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:13.580]   And I did my most recent column one slowing down the tech upgrades because I'm just starting
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:19.100]   to get a little more conscious about the costs of these devices, not in dollars, but
[00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:20.940]   in said, human lives.
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:21.940]   Absolutely.
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:26.300]   All that stuff is a film on IndieGoGo who pays the price, which digs really deep into
[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.300]   this.
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:29.540]   And so it's like, okay, I sold my five works fine.
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:31.380]   I got a new case and I cleaned the screen.
[00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:32.380]   Good for you.
[00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:33.380]   Very new.
[00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:34.380]   Good person.
[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.820]   If I really want the phone to feel new, then I'll just like reform it.
[00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:38.380]   Wait, you got a new case?
[00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:39.380]   Yeah.
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:40.380]   Stop being a second.
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:41.380]   Stop being a second.
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:43.380]   So now that's messed up.
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:48.180]   You know, that case, everything you believe in that case saying, yeah, it's blood case.
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:49.580]   That's a blood case.
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:52.300]   That case, you know, many people were killed for that case.
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:53.660]   That's a blood case.
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.700]   It's made out of elephant hide.
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:04.940]   But no, there's a I'm curious, you know, their dependence on when do they saturate?
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:11.060]   Or is this how sustainable is the growth of a still for Apple and how how do I was
[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.740]   saying apples over a year ago?
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.060]   I was so wrong.
[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:17.020]   I was along with other people.
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.620]   As spec as spec as spec.
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:20.980]   I didn't believe it.
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:24.260]   I was watching for Gabula.
[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:25.260]   I love that.
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:26.260]   Skeptical.
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:27.260]   I was skeptical.
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:28.760]   I was skeptical.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:32.340]   I felt like Tim Cook had lost a little mojo that Apple wasn't going to be able to keep
[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:33.980]   it going.
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:36.420]   And I got to say this, it is not technologically.
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:42.020]   I mean, iPhone is a beautiful piece of work, but it is not software, especially not particularly
[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:43.900]   sophisticated technologically.
[00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.260]   People don't people are.
[00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:46.260]   They don't care.
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:47.540]   That's not what they're looking for.
[00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:49.180]   Technical sophistication.
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:50.180]   So here's something that's interesting.
[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.180]   Typical technical sophistication.
[00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:55.780]   We're doing this on my phone because I don't want to screw up my Skype connection.
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:34:02.140]   So I tweeted this the other day that IDC reported that was 1.3 billion smartphone chip last
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.140]   year.
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:09.780]   318 million that were Samsung and 192 million that were Apple and then a bunch of other
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.420]   stuff on top of that.
[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:16.140]   But you just asked when is it going to saturate?
[00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:20.580]   There are still multiple billions of people that don't own smartphones and they won't
[00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:21.580]   for several years.
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:23.500]   That's why Apple and others are embracing China, right?
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:24.500]   It's big market.
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:29.660]   And as long as they create something that actually like the world of non-smart phone users are
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:30.660]   not buying iPhone 6s.
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:31.660]   That is a ridiculous part.
[00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:33.660]   So many in the chat room said a good thing.
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:35.540]   Apple's technical supremacy may be over.
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:36.540]   That doesn't matter.
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:38.340]   Their sales supremacy is far from.
[00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:40.980]   Brand supremacy is brand supremacy.
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:45.740]   No, they've convinced a big chunk of the world that they are smartphones.
[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:47.740]   And yet Samsung's out sales them.
[00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:48.740]   Yeah.
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:49.740]   And it's losing money.
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:51.500]   They don't out profit them.
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:52.500]   Yeah.
[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:53.500]   They don't out profit them.
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.660]   They make a device that people love and they have business that people.
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:59.740]   40% margin on Apple sales.
[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:07.500]   Well, but I mean, if you're, if you're, I mean, the Shane company Jewelers, they got a thousand
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:08.580]   present margin.
[00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:10.140]   That's not the only factor.
[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:14.260]   Didn't sell 74 million diamond tennis bracelets.
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:15.260]   Thank God.
[00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:20.780]   That'll be the end of humanity.
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:25.260]   And Tim Cook let drop that in April, the Apple Watch will ship.
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:28.740]   Oh, and is it going to, will it last like an hour?
[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:30.180]   What's the, what's a battery life on that thing?
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:34.460]   Oh, that's actually the last length of a $4.3 million Super Bowl ad.
[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:35.460]   That would be good.
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.260]   That's the anticipated length of the note.
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:40.780]   It's going to, it's they're saying a day, but that, you know, if you're sitting there
[00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:44.500]   playing with your watch all the time, it'll probably be a couple hours.
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:49.780]   That's, I'm really curious about the real world life on that because if you have to constantly
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:53.060]   take, I mean, basically there are so many, you'll just take it off at night and charge
[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:54.060]   it.
[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:57.500]   But if you have to do that in the middle of the day at any point, that breaks the flow.
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:58.500]   Absolutely.
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:35:59.500]   Yeah.
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:03.900]   So Mark Herman had a great, Mark Herman had a great post as often as often the case.
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:09.060]   He's a good scoop from inside Apple on nine to five Mac in which he said they are working
[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:11.700]   very hard on battery life.
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:16.420]   Obviously a big issue and they have, and he says they believe internally they can, they
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:18.980]   have more to eke out of it.
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:23.660]   And, and, but what they're saying, let me see if I can find it.
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:26.500]   I love that the, the laws of physics are resistant.
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:27.500]   I know.
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:33.780]   You got 18 billion dollars, how many billions in the bank you can't just buy.
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:36.140]   You can't buy your way into a better battery future.
[00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:39.260]   Like how much profits have been generated since the last innovation of batteries.
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:40.260]   We're just not doing it.
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:41.260]   Yeah.
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:46.100]   So there's something else happening there that, that even the mighty Apple is the law of physics.
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:47.100]   Yeah.
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:50.420]   You know, and be weak in certain, in a certain sense, because we don't want to have to charge
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:51.620]   our watches in the middle of the day.
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:52.620]   That's silly.
[00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:53.980]   I can't find the numbers.
[00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:58.300]   But I think they were, their goal was three hours of screen time a day.
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:01.940]   So obviously it's really true, as anybody knows, who has a smart watch.
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:05.660]   I use the Android Wear watches that use, and this is true of smartphones.
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:07.660]   Use makes a big difference.
[00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:08.900]   And everybody uses it differently.
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:11.420]   If you don't use the watch, it lasts forever.
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:12.420]   Right.
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:13.420]   No.
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:14.420]   No, actually 19 hours.
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:15.420]   19 hours.
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:16.420]   All right.
[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:19.060]   If you don't use forever in device data.
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:21.060]   Wait, just 19 hours?
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:24.660]   No, actually two to three days when sleeping.
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:25.660]   Okay.
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:26.660]   Got it.
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:27.660]   You're in a coma.
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:28.660]   But here's the thing.
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:29.660]   Here's the thing.
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:34.820]   We don't know how people are going to use this because we don't know what the apps are.
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:35.820]   It's brand new.
[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:36.820]   It's brand new.
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:37.820]   Here's what people are going to do with the Apple Watch.
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:39.700]   Hey, check out my Apple Watch.
[00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:42.300]   They're going to be the most annoying people, and they're going to tap the screen for their
[00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:44.260]   friends for the first three months.
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:47.540]   And then we'll figure out what the actual use is once the novelty wears.
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:51.020]   Apple, according to 9-5 hopes the battery will last two and a half to four hours.
[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:55.420]   They're hours of nonstop like I'm playing a game on the watch.
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:56.420]   Right.
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:59.300]   19 hours if I'm looking at something and putting it down.
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.300]   And you know, they have...
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:01.660]   If you're in Dick Tracy mode, right?
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:02.660]   Right.
[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:03.660]   Two and a half to four hours.
[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:04.660]   But they have...
[00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:05.980]   And by the way, there are no standalone apps on the watch yet.
[00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:07.300]   That's later this year.
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:10.060]   So most people will be doing as I do with my Android Wear watch.
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:12.980]   You look at it, you get the time, maybe you're checking a notification, then you put it
[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:14.620]   down, screen goes off.
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:16.380]   19 hours, which is more than enough.
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:17.380]   That's fine.
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:18.380]   Yeah.
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:19.980]   And I mean, just look at what we just did with the Super Bowl math.
[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:23.020]   It's an 11 minute event that somehow stretches out for four hours.
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:24.020]   It's kind of like that.
[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:27.860]   Actual phone use, like when you actively engage in your phone screen, probably 11 minutes
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:28.860]   a day.
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:29.860]   Of course, we'll know.
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:35.300]   The other story that I think is great from 9-5 Mac that just broke today is the Apple
[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:41.540]   stores are installing safes to put the expensive watch.
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:43.300]   Oh, is that the old one?
[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.300]   The edition.
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:47.380]   They're really going to stock those in the store.
[00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:52.140]   They're going to Apple stores to be outfitted with safes to house gold Apple watches.
[00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:55.580]   People who are experts on watches say if that is a solid gold watch, which Apple's saying
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:58.580]   it is, obviously it's not solid solid gold or something inside.
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:05.020]   But if that's gold there, that we're talking $5,000 to $6,000 minimum, that would be, and
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.460]   it could be a lot more depending on, you know, process.
[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:11.820]   I don't like that Apple doesn't currently have safes in their stores with thousands
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:15.340]   of dollars of Apple displays.
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:16.940]   This is how valuable this watch is.
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:19.780]   You finally had to install safes.
[00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:22.620]   If I were an investor, which I'm not, I would be like, "Yo, it's him.
[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:23.620]   Cook.
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:26.380]   Maybe the safe should have happened."
[00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:27.820]   Protect my investment.
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:34.820]   The aluminum and glass Apple watch sport will start at $349.
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:37.540]   Then there's a stainless steel one that we don't know how much it's going to be.
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:39.460]   And then there's the gold one.
[00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:40.940]   I have no desire for the gold one.
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:41.940]   It looks tacky.
[00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:44.420]   It looks like an Apple watch.
[00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:51.460]   I actually do because I know people that have them and that use them.
[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:54.620]   And they say that it really kind of does change things a little bit.
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.820]   It's not like it, you don't need your smartphone anymore.
[00:39:56.820 --> 00:40:01.180]   But you know, that moment when you're in a meeting and your phone rings and you look
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:02.420]   at it or you get a text.
[00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:04.660]   You have friends who are using an Apple watch?
[00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:07.780]   Well, I know people at Apple that use the watches.
[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:11.620]   They say, "Mark's there is more than a thousand prototypes in use at Apple now."
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:12.620]   Correct.
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:13.620]   That is correct.
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:16.220]   I mean, I think they're the...
[00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:17.220]   So what do you...
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:18.220]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:20.140]   He knows people wearing Apple watches.
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:21.140]   Hold on, Darrick, don't they?
[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:23.300]   I broke the first story on the Apple watch.
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:24.300]   Hold on there.
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:25.300]   That it was being made.
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:26.300]   I had the first...
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:27.740]   I know, and I didn't believe it.
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:29.740]   I didn't believe it for a long time, Nick Builden.
[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:31.620]   I thought you were making it up.
[00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:33.100]   But no, you were right.
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:34.860]   What have we learned, Leo?
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:35.860]   The listen to Nick.
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:36.860]   Listen to me.
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:37.860]   Listen to Nick.
[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:39.860]   Unless he's talking about a Skype set up.
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:40.860]   Even though...
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:41.860]   Yeah.
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:42.860]   Well, there...
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:45.020]   When you live in the future, you know these things.
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:46.020]   That's all.
[00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:47.020]   Yeah.
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:48.020]   He's already worn one.
[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:50.460]   So what do your friends tell you about wearing an Apple watch?
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:57.060]   Well, so like one guy I know who has won, he said that an Apple, it could not be a guy,
[00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:58.300]   maybe a woman.
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:01.980]   So don't go finding someone.
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:07.260]   He was saying that there'll be times that he's in a meeting and he doesn't necessarily
[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:09.620]   pull his phone out and put it on the table anymore.
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:10.620]   It stays in his pocket.
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:14.060]   And if he gets a message, he'll like look at his watch.
[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:18.940]   And he was saying that the feature where you can kind of write to someone by drawing on
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:23.660]   your wrist, this thing where you can draw a little thing and you can send it to someone.
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:24.660]   Well, yeah.
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:29.340]   He said that like there's a colleague he works with and they get lunch a lot together.
[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:32.940]   And sometimes he'll just literally write like L and send it.
[00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:34.140]   And it's like, oh, like lunch.
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:35.140]   Oh, that's tastic.
[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:37.340]   I can't wait to have that.
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:39.140]   Well, but here's the thing.
[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:43.300]   Like this, if I was like, Bertun, let's go get lunch, you know, I got to open up my phone.
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:46.300]   I got to swipe to Bartun, his name, I got to type this.
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:52.020]   Like what if I could just be like, Bartun de L. So first of all, hashtag first world
[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:53.020]   problems.
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:57.340]   Second of all, there's the level of weight.
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:58.340]   That's so sad.
[00:41:58.340 --> 00:41:59.340]   It's an issue.
[00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:04.140]   I think at the opposite end of the spectrum, I've started doing something that has a similar
[00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:08.420]   effect on my like getting up, going over to the person saying, Hey, would you like to
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:09.420]   have lunch?
[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:12.740]   Well, the idea of like being in a meeting or being at dinner, if you're in a physically
[00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:16.740]   social situation and you're always on your phone, you're probably millennial because
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:18.300]   that's just normal for you.
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:22.820]   But if you're not, which most of the world still isn't, then I have a paper notebook
[00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:23.820]   that I write things down on.
[00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:27.540]   It's just far less offensive to be writing on a piece of paper while in a meeting in
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:28.540]   front of someone.
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:32.380]   It is to take out your phone and theoretically be doing Snapchat and texting.
[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:33.740]   I disagree with you.
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:37.500]   I interview people all the time and I always say to them, I'm sorry.
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:38.620]   I'm taking notes on my phone.
[00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:39.620]   I'm not texting someone.
[00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:40.820]   They're like, Oh, it's really cool.
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:46.820]   Like I think that they don't like they don't you put them in a socially like untenable
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:49.060]   situation to call you a liar.
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:53.980]   I'm inviting you to L. Okay.
[00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:56.500]   Have you ever heard of tech neck?
[00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:01.540]   No, that's when you get wrinkles when you're in your twenties, but you got wrinkles here
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:05.860]   because you spend the whole time looking down as your phone.
[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:11.060]   So smart phones cause drooping jowls and tech neck wrinkles and 18 to 39 year olds.
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:17.740]   By the way, I should say this is from the the international business.
[00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:21.500]   The international business times despite its name is not the best.
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:26.300]   It's not the journal of record for this kind of stuff, but neck.
[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:27.300]   That's weird.
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:28.300]   Tech neck.
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:30.860]   The problem of wrinkles and sagging of the jowls and neck used to begin in late middle
[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:37.180]   age said Dr. Christopher and Roland Payne, a consultant dermatologist at London clinic.
[00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:41.660]   In the last 10 years because of tech neck, it's become a problem or generation of younger
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:42.660]   women.
[00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:48.620]   I mean, there is, I think even if we skip, you know, Nick being kind of an asshole in his
[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:55.420]   meetings, there's the L there's a there's a there's a no else else.
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:59.380]   L L for it stands for love.
[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:00.660]   That's what the question is.
[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:02.100]   Do you know what that even means?
[00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:03.100]   Yeah.
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:04.100]   Yeah.
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:09.500]   But no, but the idea that to to find out what time it is, I've got to pull a thing, you
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:12.020]   know, out of my pants or purse or bag.
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:13.900]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:15.620]   I look at this screen.
[00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:18.300]   He's keeping his pants versus pivoting my wrist.
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:22.420]   I have to say though, as it and by the way, if Apple, apparently these guys at Apple never
[00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:26.060]   wore an Android Wear watch or a Pebble watch, but we've had watches for a couple of years
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:27.060]   now.
[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:28.060]   No, no, there's never been anything until Apple's.
[00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:29.660]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:31.260]   The Android Wear, that's exactly true.
[00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:32.620]   You do get your notifications there.
[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:34.100]   You can respond to them on the watch.
[00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:35.100]   I don't know if you'll be able to do that.
[00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:37.580]   I guess there's a microphone on the Apple watch, right?
[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:38.580]   I could talk to it.
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:39.580]   Do you like secret service?
[00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:40.580]   Will it talk back?
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:43.340]   Oh, here was another example someone was telling.
[00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:44.340]   Okay.
[00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:45.340]   Good.
[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:47.900]   They were walking with their with someone.
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:48.900]   They were walking.
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:49.900]   I'm walking right now.
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:50.900]   Was there a bay?
[00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:51.900]   Okay.
[00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:52.900]   We'll say bay.
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:53.900]   Okay.
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:54.900]   They were walking and they were in a conversation.
[00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:55.900]   Yeah.
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:45:00.740]   Their phone did something and they pressed on the thing.
[00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:02.100]   I think it was serious or something like that.
[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:07.220]   They were at Apple and they said reply on my way, see you in a second, and then continued
[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:08.220]   the conversation.
[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:11.420]   And they said that afterwards the person was like, that was insane.
[00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:15.780]   I just had a conversation with my wrist and told someone that I would be right there.
[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:18.340]   I do it all the time with an Android Wear watch.
[00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:19.340]   Yeah.
[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:20.340]   Okay.
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:21.340]   So there you go.
[00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:23.060]   So there's there's value to it.
[00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:25.980]   However, I haven't worn out and a couple of I haven't I changed phone.
[00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:28.020]   So I haven't worn it a couple of days, maybe a week.
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:30.180]   And it's not like I'm going, Oh gosh.
[00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:31.620]   Oh, it's horrible.
[00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:34.500]   I have to now take the phone out of my pocket.
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:35.500]   So you're both right.
[00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:37.500]   Oh, look at this guy.
[00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.460]   I'm trying to have it both ways.
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:41.140]   So basically what do you think is I'm right, Nick?
[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:42.140]   I'm sorry.
[00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:45.500]   I'm saying it's a it's a nice thing, but it's a luxury.
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:50.100]   And I think that's part of the issue is going to be and you know, so so so so it's pasteurized
[00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:51.740]   milk at a, at a time.
[00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:52.740]   Oh, you know what?
[00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:53.740]   That's the thing.
[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:54.740]   Here's what's going on.
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:55.740]   Right?
[00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:56.900]   This is all part of a larger thing that is taking place.
[00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:57.900]   I live in the future.
[00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:58.900]   I know how this works.
[00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:05.380]   So what's going on is, is they're all like Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, they're all competing
[00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:09.700]   for this intelligence where you actually have a voice, voice commands.
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:12.180]   So like one of the things is Alexa, right?
[00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:13.900]   The Amazon little dude.
[00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:15.220]   Have you guys, have you seen that?
[00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:16.300]   It's starting to come out now.
[00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:17.300]   Yeah.
[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:18.820]   It's when it works, it's amazing.
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:20.060]   It's smart.
[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:26.060]   You can say Alexa ordered me some pens and Alexa will it will add it to your to your Amazon
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:27.060]   on list.
[00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:28.780]   Like, and I think that one click.
[00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:29.820]   I mean, is that like a one click?
[00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:32.940]   Is that now I will get pens in the mail or do I have to take another step?
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:34.140]   I think there's a way you can set it.
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:37.700]   See, well, but I think it mostly what it does it gets put in your in your queue.
[00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:39.500]   I'm not 100% sure about that.
[00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:40.500]   Sorry.
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:41.500]   We have somebody in the chat room.
[00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:44.020]   Dr. Mom has got just got her echo.
[00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:46.060]   So I'm curious about that.
[00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:47.060]   Okay.
[00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:49.060]   So, so the the the.
[00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:54.460]   By the way, if you said, order me some pen or enemy some pens and you get depends in the
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:58.060]   mail, that would be bad.
[00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:00.820]   So how accurate is is important to it?
[00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:03.420]   It's it's it depends on your, you know, they're still working on that.
[00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:04.420]   But here's the thing.
[00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:09.180]   The reason why I bring that up is because this is all part of a larger thing where these,
[00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:12.620]   these companies are all trying to build services where you're connected at all times.
[00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:14.300]   I have an Xbox in my living room.
[00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:19.180]   I say, Hey, Xbox, pull up the latest Stephen Colbert, it goes and gets it.
[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:23.380]   And, and the, the, it's not that Apple's trying to build a watch because they want to build
[00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:24.380]   a watch.
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:26.700]   It's they're trying to build a service that you can connect it service gateway.
[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:27.700]   They're building a gateway.
[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:28.700]   They're building a gateway.
[00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:32.100]   Even Microsoft and certainly Google have more information about us.
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:35.100]   They Google just added more cards to Google now.
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:36.300]   Oh, yes.
[00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:37.300]   But okay.
[00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:40.940]   But if you're a Mac user, they know where you go.
[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:42.740]   They know who your friends with.
[00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:45.460]   If you're totally in the iOS and Apple space.
[00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:46.460]   Yes.
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:47.460]   They don't need.
[00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:51.460]   I think from a, if you look again back at the numbers that we started with, this 18
[00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:54.220]   billion dollars in profit, they don't need the whole world.
[00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:55.220]   Right.
[00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:58.420]   They need a strong enough segment that's all into their system.
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:47:59.420]   Right.
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:05.340]   That those 70 billion in iPhone sales becomes part of, you know, this, this contextual
[00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:07.860]   voice driven world that, that Nick's talking about.
[00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:08.860]   And that's good enough.
[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:10.420]   They don't need seven billion customers.
[00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:14.460]   They might need just one billion, but just a country one.
[00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:17.460]   They're a high margin company with expensive stuff.
[00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:21.140]   I think really what's happening right now is that the bartenders admitting that I'm
[00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:22.140]   right.
[00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:23.140]   Yeah.
[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:26.700]   I mean, I think, you know, there, sometimes, you know, you have these historic events
[00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:28.580]   that, that happen.
[00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:29.780]   We put a man on the moon, right?
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:31.620]   Is it like a major moment?
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:33.380]   And we're like, Oh, look what we are capable of.
[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:35.620]   And then sometimes Nick built in his right.
[00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:37.300]   And so I will acknowledge that.
[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:41.420]   Is it because Nick built and looks like he's behind an Instagram filter right now that
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:42.420]   he's right?
[00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:43.420]   Is that it?
[00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:44.420]   I'm moving.
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:45.420]   Yeah.
[00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:46.420]   He's got the listening.
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:48.020]   He actually looks like that's the heffee.
[00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:49.940]   You're, you got the heffee filter on.
[00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:50.940]   There you go.
[00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:51.940]   Yeah.
[00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:53.820]   Or he had that, that, that, that I should like the other look.
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:56.940]   The other look was more witness protection kind of look as well.
[00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:57.940]   That's silhouetted.
[00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:01.860]   Like I've done something that I look complaining in the chat room that I'm not that, that my
[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:02.860]   camera's moving.
[00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:03.860]   So now I can move.
[00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:05.620]   My camera will stay still.
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:06.620]   Wow.
[00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:08.860]   It just changed in the game.
[00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:09.860]   Wow.
[00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:10.860]   But we're on both sides.
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:13.900]   And you thought you would be watching the Super Bowl this time of day, huh?
[00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:14.900]   It's a big game.
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:15.900]   Aren't you glad you're here?
[00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:16.900]   It's a big game show.
[00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:22.900]   How many, how many nerds are here that are actually like not watching the Super Bowl?
[00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:26.700]   Nobody who watches Twit cares or listens to Twit cares about the Super Bowl and the
[00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:27.700]   least.
[00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:28.700]   Got it.
[00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:29.700]   So it's pretty much.
[00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:31.540]   They call it hand egg.
[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:34.020]   They don't understand the rules.
[00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:37.060]   They think it's the Miami Heat that's playing.
[00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:38.660]   They don't know.
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:41.620]   So that would be kind of fun if they just put a basketball team out there.
[00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:45.020]   It's one side is a basketball team of the football.
[00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:46.220]   They call it sport ball.
[00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:47.220]   They don't care.
[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:48.500]   See who wins that contest.
[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:50.740]   Our show today brought to you by Audible.com.
[00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:51.740]   Is this one you use also?
[00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:52.740]   Baritonea?
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:53.740]   Yes, it is.
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:55.380]   I love Audible so very much.
[00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:59.420]   Let me let you do your read and then we can jump in on the praise.
[00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:00.420]   Audible.com.
[00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:02.340]   Go get some more Woodford Reserve.
[00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:05.500]   Audible.com is the place to get audiobooks.
[00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:06.500]   150,000 titles.
[00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:07.620]   I think it's even more than that now.
[00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:09.700]   It's always growing.
[00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:10.900]   Every new book comes out.
[00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:13.140]   When Nick puts out a book, you know it's unaudible.
[00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:15.660]   In fact, Hatching Twitter, it's unaudible.
[00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:19.460]   In fact, I think all of Nick's books are unaudible.
[00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:25.180]   Hatching Twitter is the best because it's read by a guy who was an actor on The Walking
[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:26.180]   Dead.
[00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:27.180]   Daniel May.
[00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:28.180]   Yeah.
[00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:31.660]   He reads the voices very carefully.
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:32.660]   It comes to life.
[00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:33.660]   That's what's so great.
[00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:36.180]   I can't wait to hear the Silk Road book on Audible.com.
[00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:37.180]   If maybe...
[00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:39.260]   If you have the Breaking Bad Guy read it.
[00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:40.660]   That'd be good.
[00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:42.660]   I'm the one who knocks.
[00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:46.620]   There are so many great books on Audible.
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:50.220]   Not just business books and stories about the technology industry.
[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:53.260]   There's fiction of all kinds as well.
[00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:54.260]   Classics.
[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:55.260]   You know, here's...
[00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:56.260]   Look, Jack London White Fang.
[00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:57.580]   What a great book to listen to with the kids.
[00:50:57.580 --> 00:50:59.260]   A great book for everybody.
[00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:00.820]   The kids will get into it.
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:01.820]   It just comes to life.
[00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:05.100]   If you've got a long car trip coming out, if you've got a long commute, Audible is a
[00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:06.100]   lifesaver.
[00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:09.140]   What are you listening to right now, Leo?
[00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:10.140]   I am listening to...
[00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:13.500]   And it's a long book, so I've been listening to three or four books at the same time.
[00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:18.420]   But I'm listening to a book, The Definitive Biography of The Beatles, which is called Tune
[00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:19.420]   In.
[00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:24.660]   Book One is at 40 hours for the first book, and it doesn't even get them up to the record.
[00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:26.940]   That's just reading the song lyrics.
[00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:28.420]   They're talking about the lines.
[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:29.420]   Incredible.
[00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:32.140]   I read every book about The Beatles and a huge fan.
[00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:37.460]   And this book just is incredible, the detail when I'm learning from it that I'd never read
[00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:38.460]   anywhere before.
[00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:39.460]   So that's great.
[00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:40.460]   Let's see.
[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:42.980]   What I like to do is alternate fiction and nonfiction.
[00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:46.380]   So the next book is going to be...
[00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:47.380]   Let's see.
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:48.380]   Peter F. Hamilton book.
[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:49.620]   He's my favorite science fiction author.
[00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:57.900]   He does very long great trilogies, and he's got a new book that just came out beginning
[00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:00.980]   a new trilogy, and I'm looking for the name of it here.
[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:03.300]   You guys actually, Twit's been a good source of auditors.
[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:04.300]   We have great recommendations.
[00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:06.820]   I followed up on the Scott Sigler recommendations.
[00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:07.820]   Yes.
[00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:09.740]   And read that whole series.
[00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:13.460]   I wasn't so much into the Whiskey Tango Fox-Trot one that you...
[00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:16.660]   You know, I liked it a lot, and then it fell apart at the end.
[00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:17.660]   Yeah, at that point.
[00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:19.260]   Because it turned out it was the postal service.
[00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:21.460]   I actually thought I had to give away the end.
[00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:23.420]   I thought I had missed something from the story.
[00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:24.420]   Oh my God.
[00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:25.420]   What's wrong with you?
[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:26.980]   All of a sudden, it's a mailman.
[00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:28.980]   And I'm like, what?
[00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:30.980]   I thought it was really good.
[00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:31.980]   What?
[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:32.980]   Are you serious, Nick?
[00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:35.820]   I spoke to the guy I interviewed him.
[00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:36.820]   He was really nice.
[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:37.820]   Whiskey Tango Fox-Trot?
[00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:38.820]   Yeah.
[00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:39.820]   Yeah, I interviewed the author.
[00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:48.780]   He spent seven years in his basement writing it, and he decided that he wanted the ending
[00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:49.780]   to be this thing.
[00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:52.620]   I'm not going to say what it was, but he wanted the ending to be what it was because
[00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:55.780]   he wanted people to be able to decide for themselves.
[00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:58.020]   And I think it was a pretty big gamble to do that.
[00:52:58.020 --> 00:52:59.020]   It was.
[00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:03.660]   It's a great book about surveillance, about themes are super strong in the book.
[00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:06.420]   And I don't want this to turn into, "Let's crap on this book thing more."
[00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:07.420]   No, no, no.
[00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:09.820]   I really enjoyed it, but I agree it had some structural issues.
[00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:10.820]   You know what?
[00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:12.660]   You know what else was really good?
[00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:18.740]   That I just read, is all the light we cannot see was stunning.
[00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:20.420]   I mean, stunningly, stunningly stunningly stunningly stunning.
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:21.420]   Anthony Dore.
[00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:22.420]   Yeah.
[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:23.420]   I'll put it in my queue basically.
[00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:24.420]   Yeah, and this is what I do.
[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:26.420]   If you're an Audible subscriber, you go to your wish list.
[00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:30.140]   You just add a book to your wish list so you always have books to listen to.
[00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:31.780]   This is fiction?
[00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:32.780]   It's fiction, yeah.
[00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:36.460]   It's set in during the World of Life War.
[00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:37.460]   Yeah.
[00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:39.980]   And it's two main characters.
[00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:46.180]   It's a young blind girl who lives in France and a boy who lives in Germany who falls in
[00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:47.180]   love with radios.
[00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:49.140]   And it's a really, really fascinating book.
[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:50.940]   Beautifully, beautifully written.
[00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:52.660]   There's so much great stuff on here.
[00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:55.660]   And that's one of the reasons why we like in the ad to talk about what we're listening
[00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:56.660]   to because it helps you.
[00:53:56.660 --> 00:54:02.340]   The hardest part about Audible is you only get, like you only get these credits and you're
[00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:04.420]   like, oh my God, which book do I hit?
[00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:05.420]   I'm so stressed.
[00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:06.420]   What do I get?
[00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:07.420]   I know.
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:08.420]   You just want to get that one.
[00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:09.420]   Because there's so many great books.
[00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:12.340]   I have the opposite problem, which is I have a collection.
[00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:13.340]   It's like Insta paper.
[00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:14.340]   I just like, I know.
[00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:15.340]   I'm behind.
[00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:16.340]   I feel really good.
[00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:18.300]   I'm like, yes, I just got an audiobook.
[00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:19.300]   I'm behind.
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:22.220]   But then I have to commit 50 hours to actually digesting.
[00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:24.420]   You need a longer commute, Mr. Barretunde Thurston.
[00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:26.420]   Yeah, I need to live in LA.
[00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:29.180]   I've grown up in an environment where I can walk in and bike to work.
[00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:30.180]   Or go to the gym.
[00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:31.180]   I don't do gyms.
[00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:32.180]   I'm not a gym guy.
[00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:33.180]   Yeah.
[00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:34.180]   Just spray with the treadmill.
[00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:35.340]   The abyss is the one I was talking about.
[00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:38.380]   The Abyss Butteon Dreams is the new Peter F. Hamilton.
[00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:40.140]   Oh, so many great books.
[00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:41.500]   And yeah, I'm really behind.
[00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:42.500]   I just got this.
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:43.500]   My dad recommended it.
[00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:47.860]   The righteous mind why good people are divided by politics and religion.
[00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:50.940]   It's by Jonathan Haidt who's a social psychologist.
[00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:57.380]   And it sounds like a great book about why we are so polarized these days.
[00:54:57.380 --> 00:55:00.020]   Because you're stupid, Leo.
[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:01.020]   That's why.
[00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:02.180]   Yeah, that's why.
[00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:04.660]   So I guess I won't have to read that now.
[00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:07.020]   So anyway, go to Audible.
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:08.020]   Here, you know what?
[00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:09.020]   We got two books for you.
[00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:10.540]   So it's not as big a deal as it could be.
[00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:11.700]   We're going to get you two books.
[00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:12.700]   Audible.com/twit2.

[00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:25.980]   You also get the Daily New York Times or Wall Street Journal Digest to listen to.
[00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:26.980]   That's the plan I have.
[00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:27.980]   I love.
[00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:28.980]   But it's up to you.
[00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:29.980]   Give it a try.

[00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:35.660]   You cancel and you owe them nothing.
[00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:36.660]   It really is great.
[00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:37.660]   I love it.
[00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:38.660]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:40.780]   And the number two.
[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:41.780]   Sign up today.
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:42.780]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:45.780]   And the number two.
[00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:48.940]   And boy, there are so many good books.
[00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:52.820]   I was just looking through my library all the books I haven't gotten around to yet.
[00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:54.860]   Yeah, that's intimidating and exciting.
[00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:58.260]   I mean, when I have a big long, super long flight or something, I don't know.
[00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:00.500]   How do you maybe both of you guys?
[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:05.860]   What I find is for me with audio, I'm either in podcast mode or I'm in book mode.
[00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:06.860]   Yeah.
[00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:08.300]   But it's hard to do both.
[00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:15.180]   So if I'm listening to a book, I don't want to interrupt that with other weekly or daily
[00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:18.780]   shows because it kind of throws off the narrow one audio.
[00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:21.380]   It sounds like you were big into serial.
[00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:23.180]   Yeah, it was.
[00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:27.340]   I read all the stuff that came after it and I listened to the full series.
[00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:29.020]   So can I ask you a question?
[00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:30.500]   Did he do it?
[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:31.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:32.980]   Yeah, there's no question, right?
[00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:34.780]   I think he did it.
[00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:36.340]   Thank you very much.
[00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:39.260]   Because everyone's like, no, J did it.
[00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:40.260]   And here's the thing.
[00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:42.380]   Here's one little thing.
[00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:45.620]   But one thing, everyone says that J did it.
[00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:49.340]   There was in the 30 hours that she interviewed at Adnan.
[00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:52.420]   He never once said, Hey, do you think J did it?
[00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:54.180]   Because he did it.
[00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:55.180]   Adnan did it.
[00:56:55.180 --> 00:57:00.780]   So there's nothing more exciting a podcast to then to talk about another podcast.
[00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:04.220]   You haven't listened to and debate.
[00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:06.740]   Oh, the ending of it.
[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:08.140]   So let's end this right here.
[00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:10.460]   I have not listened to because I'm just jealous.
[00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:14.020]   I have been podcasting for 10 freaking years.
[00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:15.420]   I'll tell you it's running Leo, though.
[00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:16.420]   Here's the thing.
[00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:18.820]   When I first started listening to it, I was like, this is fantastic.
[00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:20.300]   This is great storytelling.
[00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:24.860]   The more I listened to it, the more I realized it was some weird line between journalism
[00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:26.220]   and entertainment.
[00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:28.580]   And it was unfair to the family in my eyes.
[00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:31.060]   And I don't think it was handled very well towards the end.
[00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:36.580]   I think it became it got so much hype that it kind of it didn't take into account that
[00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:40.300]   there were human beings that were being talked about and analyzed and so on.
[00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:41.300]   I know we just did that.
[00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:43.380]   Bartender and I just did that.
[00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:47.020]   And I will not listen to the next one.
[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:48.020]   Good.
[00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:49.020]   And say that.
[00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:50.020]   Go.
[00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:55.820]   Because I think it was an exploration down a line of a new form of storytelling.
[00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:58.100]   I think that was what's really interesting about it.
[00:57:58.100 --> 00:57:59.300]   I don't think it worked.
[00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:03.500]   The internet cultural side of this was maybe even to add on to this and be interesting
[00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:09.500]   for this weekend tech part is the way parts of the tech community specifically read it
[00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:13.700]   jumped on this and in a way that was pretty irresponsible.
[00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:16.940]   Not everybody who engaged on Reddit was irresponsible.
[00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:22.900]   But I think it created a forum and an excuse for people who heard this story and thought
[00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:28.100]   because of the way that the internet and technology makes you think about problem solving, I just
[00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:30.660]   need more data and I can solve this.
[00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:31.660]   I just fix it.
[00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:33.940]   Like this has been this is a bug in the system.
[00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:38.020]   And I'm going to debug this case and I'm going to go find Jay at his home and I'm going
[00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:39.020]   to go with the records.
[00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:40.020]   Yeah.
[00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:41.020]   They have to go around.
[00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:42.020]   Oh, that's terrible.
[00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:44.940]   I mean, this is 20 years later.
[00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:48.180]   And these people have their kind of moved on.
[00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:53.060]   And so part of the the unintended consequence, I'm sure it was truly unintended, but because
[00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:55.140]   they didn't expect it to be as popular as it was.
[00:58:55.140 --> 00:59:00.260]   But when you assume things are going to be public and could become very popular, the
[00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:03.500]   level of like ethics and responsibility to make it even more interesting.
[00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:08.700]   And when internet communities decide to try to play detective at digital private eye and
[00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:13.700]   start harassing people and making phone calls and sitting outside of people's houses, that's
[00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:17.420]   like you've unleashed another undesirable thing in society.
[00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:19.180]   And there's a little bit of responsibility.
[00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:20.180]   You know what else?
[00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:21.180]   Ugliness associated with that.
[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:24.620]   What else was released as a society that was irresponsible and ugly?
[00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:25.620]   What?
[00:59:25.620 --> 00:59:26.620]   No.
[00:59:26.620 --> 00:59:27.620]   What's the segue?
[00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:28.620]   Jerome Jure.
[00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:32.580]   It wasn't irresponsible and ugly.
[00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:33.580]   That was a great column.
[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:34.580]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:35.740]   No, it's interesting actually.
[00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:36.740]   Here's Jerome Jure.
[00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:40.540]   He is a what would you he's French guy, right?
[00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:42.860]   Who came to the United States penniless.
[00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:46.580]   And this was the vine that really put why am I not getting audio?
[00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:50.300]   Is there something about vine I need to do the click in the upper left corner of the left
[00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:51.300]   corner?
[00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:52.300]   There we go.
[00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:55.740]   Why is everybody afraid of love?
[00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:56.740]   Love.
[00:59:56.740 --> 01:00:00.340]   Why is everybody kind of funny?
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:05.100]   But the problem with vine is there's six seconds long and yet this guy has apparently become
[01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:11.100]   a compelling figure and vine and now snapchat with his little mini things.
[01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:12.420]   So this was my column this week.
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:14.260]   I know that's why I'm talking to you about it.
[01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:16.940]   No, but I'm going to tell you a little bit about it.
[01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:17.940]   Tell me a little bit about it.
[01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:18.940]   Tell me.
[01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:19.940]   Tell me.
[01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:22.620]   It was it was really interesting because I met with him in New York a couple of weeks
[01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:26.740]   ago and really, really sweet guy, really nice guy.
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:32.540]   And I found out that his story is pretty fascinating, which is I tell him the column, but he came
[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:35.940]   to New York via, you know, he dropped out of school in France and so on.
[01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:36.940]   He showed up.
[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:40.980]   He took an overnight bus from Toronto, showed up with $400 in his pocket.
[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:42.900]   No place to live, no job, no anything.
[01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:49.180]   But he had a vine account and a front facing camera on his smartphone and went from literally
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:54.260]   for about a year living off like other people's leftovers and sleeping on a floor in an office
[01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:59.980]   that no one knew about to being offered, you know, to having a billion views, literally
[01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:04.940]   one billion views on his vine videos to being offered a million dollars to mention a product
[01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:06.140]   on his social networks.
[01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:10.940]   You talk about taking a walk through around New York through Union Square with him.
[01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:11.940]   Yeah.
[01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:16.180]   And you said he was stopped every few feet by screaming teenagers who beg to take a selfie.
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:17.940]   Some girls were brought to tears.
[01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:23.020]   Others proclaimed they couldn't breathe at the mere sight of him during one loop around
[01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:24.020]   the park.
[01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:26.180]   He was stopped more than 50 times.
[01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:27.180]   It was insane.
[01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:33.860]   It was, I mean, it was the best analogy was the Beatles, you know, he was every few feet
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:37.340]   like there were just this gaggle of teens that would run up with their cell phones and like
[01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:41.500]   scream and cry and hug him and tell him how much they loved him and everything.
[01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:43.340]   And it was pretty, it was pretty fascinating.
[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:50.660]   And the other thing that happened was we, he mentioned me on Snapchat and he said, go
[01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:52.180]   and go and follow this guy.
[01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:53.180]   Nick built on Snapchat.
[01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:54.500]   He used his name is Nick built.
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:02:00.900]   And I literally got 100,000 messages over 24 hours after that from the consumption.
[01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:01.900]   100,000.
[01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:03.900]   It's insane.
[01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:09.540]   Robert De Niro recorded a Vine video with a Jare during the Tribeca Film Festival.
[01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:10.700]   It got so much attention.
[01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:15.860]   He's providing office space for a new show, a Snapchat show.
[01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:21.780]   First of all, six, sometimes I feel like I don't understand the world.
[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:24.100]   So this is what's going on.
[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:26.260]   Explain to me, you guys, young and hip.
[01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:27.860]   So you'll take a deep breath.
[01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:28.860]   Okay.
[01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:29.860]   It's just the future is happening.
[01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:30.860]   Yeah.
[01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:31.860]   Okay.
[01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:32.860]   It doesn't have to hurt.
[01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:37.460]   On Friday, he challenged people watching the Snapchat show to stop trying to take perfect
[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:42.180]   selfies online to post ugly selfies instead by the end of the weekend.
[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:51.580]   Two days, 120,000 ugly selfies tagged with his name or the hashtag ugly selfie challenge.
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:57.300]   He was telling me the story about how when he was he was in Iceland and earlier last
[01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:03.380]   year and he went on social media and he said, Hey, I'm going to go to this mall.
[01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:06.460]   And if you want to come and take a picture with me or hang out, like meet me.
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:08.420]   And he thought maybe like 20 people would show up, right?
[01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:09.420]   He's in Iceland.
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:11.820]   There's not that many people that are probably on social media there.
[01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:14.340]   And he thought he showed up at the mall.
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:16.460]   It's this tiny mall with one security guard.
[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:19.260]   The security guard was in a panic because he thought there was a terrorist attack because
[01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:21.100]   there were 7,000 teens.
[01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:22.900]   The more the photos.
[01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:26.980]   The same, by the way, is the definition of a terrorist attack.
[01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:28.380]   Oh my God.
[01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:30.020]   That security guard was technically correct.
[01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:31.020]   Oh my God.
[01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:33.380]   So what is the secret?
[01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:35.860]   The secret is that he is this two secrets.
[01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:36.860]   One is he's very funny.
[01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:37.860]   He's cute.
[01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:39.420]   He's funny, right?
[01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:45.740]   The other, and Leah, while I'm explaining this, go on Google and look up Jiram Jirah, Iceland
[01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:47.100]   and try and look at the pictures.
[01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:49.420]   We can show some of the pictures.
[01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:51.660]   But the one thing is he's very funny and he was cute.
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:55.220]   But the other thing is, because I spoke to a lot of kids that really liked him.
[01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:58.100]   I like talked to all the kids around Union Square and everything.
[01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:01.060]   And they were saying he's so positive all the time.
[01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:02.060]   And he really is.
[01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:03.060]   He's very positive.
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:04.060]   He never says anything negative.
[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:05.900]   He's always smiling and laughing.
[01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:08.980]   And I think that the internet is such a revolting place a lot of the times.
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:12.220]   People on comments and so on saying really mean things.
[01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:16.100]   And I think that they have this opportunity to see somebody who's really nice.
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:17.100]   So he's sweet.
[01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:18.980]   That's what makes people excited about it.
[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:22.140]   And he gives them, he's nice to them.
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:24.140]   He responds to them.
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:26.340]   It's really fascinating.
[01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:27.340]   So I'm trying to find...
[01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:31.780]   Well, I found pictures of him in an ice cave, but I guess it is Iceland, right?
[01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:34.740]   There's some YouTube videos of like mobbed.
[01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:38.660]   Here's the one on Facebook.
[01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:40.020]   So he's with another guy.
[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.020]   That's another one?
[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:42.020]   Nash.
[01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:43.020]   Go back.
[01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:44.020]   Yeah.
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:45.020]   And just click on images.
[01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:47.020]   I don't know how to use Google.
[01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:48.020]   Hold on a minute.
[01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:49.220]   Something strange has happened.
[01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:50.220]   Oh my god.
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:53.140]   So what should I do on the Google?
[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:54.140]   Do I type?
[01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:57.060]   This is what happens when we're not in the studio.
[01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:58.300]   Do I type?
[01:04:58.300 --> 01:04:59.300]   Okay.
[01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:00.300]   Jerome.
[01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:01.300]   Jay.
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:02.300]   Can I put in the chat room?
[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:04.140]   A-R-E Iceland, right?
[01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:05.940]   That should be enough.
[01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:06.940]   Maybe I should add mall.
[01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:07.940]   Do images.
[01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:08.940]   Images.
[01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:09.940]   Images search.
[01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:10.940]   Really?
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:12.940]   Then I'm going to get a lot of weird pictures.
[01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:13.940]   Hold on.
[01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:14.940]   I'm going to get it for you.
[01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:15.940]   Give me two seconds.
[01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:16.940]   Here he is in the mall in Iceland.
[01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:17.940]   This is a YouTube video.
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:20.940]   View image, view page.
[01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:24.940]   You know, the internet doesn't work all that well.
[01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:25.940]   No, it doesn't.
[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:26.940]   Google sucks.
[01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:28.940]   So somebody in the chat room said this is a good term.
[01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:30.940]   I think we live in the age of micro-celebrity.
[01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:33.940]   Well, he's more than a micro-celebrity.
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:35.940]   Well, he's a celebrity from a micro-celebrity.
[01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:38.740]   Next year will anybody know the name?
[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:40.340]   I've already forgot his name.
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:41.340]   Jerome Jare.
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:43.140]   Jerome Jare.
[01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:44.740]   Jare.
[01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:51.740]   We certainly have the ability for someone to catapult, you know, into very well-known,
[01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:54.340]   without having agents and like handlers.
[01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:56.140]   Look at this.
[01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:59.020]   This is like a vlogger in Iceland.
[01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:01.340]   They're all, we think he's around here.
[01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:02.340]   Where is he?
[01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:03.340]   Oh my God.
[01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:04.340]   Look like a flat.
[01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:06.340]   This is insane.
[01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:08.340]   Here's the thing that's insane, right?
[01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:10.340]   He's in there somewhere.
[01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:11.340]   He looks like where's Waldo.
[01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:15.340]   The thing that's insane is I've seen pictures of this mall beforehand.
[01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:17.340]   There's like three people in there.

[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:49.340]   I'm going to tell you about it.
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:50.340]   I'm going to tell you about it.
[01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:51.340]   I'm going to tell you about it.
[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:52.340]   I'm going to tell you about it.
[01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:53.340]   I'm going to tell you about it.
[01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:54.340]   I'm going to tell you about it.
[01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:55.340]   I'm going to tell you about it.
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:56.340]   I'm going to tell you about it.
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:57.340]   I'm going to tell you about it.
[01:09:57.340 --> 01:09:58.340]   I'm going to tell you about it.
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:09:59.340]   I'm going to tell you about it.
[01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:00.340]   I'm going to tell you about it.
[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:04.340]   You know what I find interesting is that this -- you could say this is what Vine was
[01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:07.340]   made for, but you sure can't say that's what Snapchat was made for.
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:08.340]   No.
[01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:14.340]   I mean, that's something that I have learned very recently is Snapchat stories is just -- I
[01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:16.340]   think one of the next big things.
[01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:17.340]   Yeah.
[01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:18.340]   They're Snapchat celebrities big time.
[01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:20.340]   It's fun and broken at the same time.
[01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:21.340]   Yeah.
[01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:22.340]   I agree with you.
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:23.340]   Yeah.
[01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:24.340]   I started playing with it more basically because Nick won't shut up about it.
[01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:25.340]   Well, what should I do with it?
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:29.340]   I mean, besides sharing pictures of my butt with my girlfriend or my wife now.
[01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:30.340]   What else?
[01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:32.340]   Congratulations on that, by the way.
[01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:35.340]   I got married a couple of days ago and you don't have --
[01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:36.340]   What?
[01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:37.340]   Are we breaking this?
[01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:39.340]   Is this the first tweet that this is known?
[01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:40.340]   No, it was on the Internet.
[01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:42.340]   It was the first tweet that you already had in the micro --
[01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:45.340]   I've been mobbed in a mall already.
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:46.340]   This is -- this is --
[01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:47.340]   No, thanks.
[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:48.340]   Well, yeah.
[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:49.340]   Congratulations.
[01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:50.340]   This is nothing.
[01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:51.340]   You just --
[01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:52.340]   Nothing.
[01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:53.340]   I've done this before.
[01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:54.340]   I've done this before many times.
[01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:56.340]   No, Lisa and I got married finally, which is --
[01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:57.340]   Rats.
[01:10:57.340 --> 01:10:58.340]   Yeah.
[01:10:58.340 --> 01:10:59.340]   Very, very, very --
[01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:00.340]   Yay.
[01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:01.340]   So, but I'm getting back to the topic of the hour.
[01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:03.340]   Snapchat stories and like --
[01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:04.780]   What should I do with Snapchat?
[01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:09.340]   If I were going to be capitalizing -- why are you telling Baratunde to use Snapchat?
[01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:10.340]   Okay.
[01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:11.340]   So, the reason --
[01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:12.340]   Not the Tunde, by the way, on Snapchat.
[01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:13.340]   Snapchat.
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:14.340]   Snapchat.
[01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:15.340]   Snapchat.
[01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:16.340]   Tunde.
[01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:17.340]   Is that really?
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:18.340]   Wow.
[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:19.340]   And I'm Nick Filton, all one word.
[01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:23.060]   So, what I've been doing is -- like, I do like a daily -- sometimes I do like a daily product
[01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:24.060]   review.
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:25.060]   So, I reviewed the other day.
[01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:28.660]   I reviewed these fun little cameras that attach to the top of your iPhone.
[01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:30.500]   How long can the Snapchat be?
[01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:32.660]   So, each clip can be 10 seconds.
[01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:34.500]   You don't really want to -- you don't want to go that long.
[01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:35.500]   Wait for it.
[01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:36.500]   Wait for it.
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:37.500]   Each clip can be 10 seconds.
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:38.500]   And you string them together.
[01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:39.500]   There.
[01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:40.500]   Six -- succession.
[01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:44.060]   Like, so, one of the best people on Snapchat stories, Jerome's really good.
[01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:45.940]   This guy, Dino Fonte, who's really good.
[01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:50.180]   He does what's called "commute cast," where he, like, literally does his commute.
[01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:52.620]   The other person that's amazing is Casey Neistat.
[01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:54.620]   I'm trying to see if I have Casey on here.
[01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:59.060]   And also, now this news does it.
[01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:02.060]   Can I see this on the web or is there no web interface for Snapchat?
[01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:03.060]   Oh, no web interface.
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:04.060]   That's Shundoris.
[01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:05.060]   Here's Shundoris.
[01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:06.660]   I'm going to play him.
[01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:07.660]   So --
[01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:11.220]   So, now, does this going to self-destruct after you watch it?
[01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:12.220]   Yeah.
[01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:13.660]   Well, story watch at once.
[01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:15.100]   Stories you can rewatch.
[01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:18.420]   The rules are odd if you're not familiar with them.
[01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:20.460]   You can really sell down the landscape board.
[01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:22.060]   Well, here's the thing.
[01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:23.740]   So, here -- there's a couple of things here.
[01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:27.100]   One is, if I let go of my finger, I'm no longer watching.
[01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:30.540]   The engagement on here is -- there's nothing that is as engaging.
[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:31.540]   There's nothing.
[01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:33.180]   Because you have to hold your finger to it.
[01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:34.180]   So, that's the one that --
[01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:36.420]   We live in a nation of freaking idiots.
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:38.620]   This is the end of the world, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:39.620]   You can't text me.
[01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:40.620]   Mike Judge was right.
[01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:42.620]   Idiocracy has now happened.
[01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:43.700]   I'm going home.
[01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:44.700]   I'm going to -- okay.
[01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:45.700]   I'm going to --
[01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:48.300]   It's engaged because you have to hold your finger to it.
[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:49.300]   Here's the thing.
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:50.300]   Leo, the --
[01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:53.100]   No, why does that make you so incredulous?
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:56.980]   Because instead of being on two laptops and reading a book, I had to --
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:59.180]   It's engaging because I was on it.
[01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:01.340]   Because I can't watch it unless I touch it.
[01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:02.340]   Okay.
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:03.740]   But no, here's the thing.
[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:04.740]   Two things.
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:06.500]   First of all, okay.
[01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:09.420]   I know we kind of like dis all the social media stuff.
[01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:11.980]   And at this time, I get super frustrated with it.
[01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:13.820]   And everyone's like, "Well, I wanted a flying car."
[01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:15.420]   And all I got was Facebook.
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:16.420]   Okay.
[01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:21.900]   Imagine for a second that none of this stuff existed, that we weren't talking on this
[01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:24.540]   thing and that we were all standing in a field somewhere.
[01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:26.100]   We're a bunch of idiots.
[01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:29.460]   And someone comes along and they're like, "You see that thing over there?
[01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:31.100]   That car can fly.
[01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:32.100]   You can have that."
[01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:33.980]   Or, "Here's this thing.
[01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:34.980]   It's a smartphone.
[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:39.740]   You can connect to anyone in the world instantly, millions and millions of people."
[01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:40.980]   I'm going for this.
[01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:41.980]   Yeah.
[01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:42.980]   No, I agree.
[01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:44.540]   The smartphone is an amazing thing.
[01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:45.540]   I agree.
[01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:46.540]   Yeah.
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:48.380]   And I think that we kind of underestimate the power of these things.
[01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:51.880]   And one of the things that I've learned with Snapchat stories specifically, because they're
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:54.780]   so many kids on there and they're not rude and they're not mean.
[01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:58.860]   Like if I go on Twitter, it's just a drizzle of people being like, "I'm smarter than you
[01:13:58.860 --> 01:13:59.860]   and you're an idiot.
[01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:00.860]   Your article is an idiot."
[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:03.100]   And Bartsunde is an idiot just getting birthday.
[01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:04.100]   So they're credit.
[01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:05.540]   They're right about all three of those things.
[01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:08.460]   So you're saying Snapchat succeeds because Twitter is so god awful?
[01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:11.300]   No, I'm saying Snapchat succeeds because it goes away.
[01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:18.300]   And I'm saying, and I will go on there and be an idiot and have fun and just goof off
[01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:22.800]   and make these fun little videos that are essentially still here is super low.
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:27.520]   And the thing that I can attest to, the rages that I had show at a high school recently,
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:33.080]   a comedy show at a high school, and the kids there, that's all they do.
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:34.080]   They're on Facebook.
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:36.080]   I'm not going to spend some obligation.
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:40.080]   But they're not active in a meaningful way there because Facebook equals drama.
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:43.120]   Facebook equals somebody liking or not liking.
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:44.720]   That stuff sits there forever.
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:49.580]   Developers can eventually find it if you don't protect these settings in the right way.
[01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:55.300]   When the performance piece disappears, it liberates you a little bit.
[01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:58.380]   It's why people do open mics in the performing world.
[01:14:58.380 --> 01:15:02.980]   It's why there's residency programs for people or artists to just get experimental.
[01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:09.180]   So that low bar, that low burden of history, a system that doesn't impose history on its
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:14.700]   users gives them a level of freedom to ease something that they're not allowed to be
[01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:19.120]   in a more publicly performative and like historical setting.
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:22.760]   That sounds like an academic, but I think that all hopefully made sense.
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:26.360]   Especially when you're a kid and you're changing and you're messing around and your
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:31.320]   words can be twisted to mean something that don't really mean, this is a relatively safe,
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:33.360]   much safer environment for that level of performance.
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:37.560]   It's not even being afraid that things will come out there.
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:38.960]   It's just being real.
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:39.960]   It's like having fun.
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:42.200]   It's, you know, I don't know.
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:47.940]   Does it help that also adults, especially parents, don't understand it at all?
[01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:49.500]   It probably helps.
[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:54.860]   And then once your parents and your, you know, on the list.
[01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:58.180]   I think there's Facebook because grandma's there.
[01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:00.980]   You don't use Twitter because I don't know, but there's a lot of reasons.
[01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:03.500]   But I noticed by the way, my son's 22.
[01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:04.500]   Snapchat's it.
[01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:05.500]   It's every.
[01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:06.500]   Yeah.
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:07.500]   Yeah.
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:09.980]   I think that you, I think the part of it is that you get to just kind of, you just get
[01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:12.660]   to do whatever you want without worrying about the consequences.
[01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:16.580]   There's no one that's going to come in and say, you know, leave a nasty comment that
[01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:17.580]   everyone else is going to jump on.
[01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:18.580]   There's no comments or comments.
[01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:22.900]   And it's, and it's not just, I mean, I think the, the structure of it, I just, this part
[01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:24.460]   just hit me too.
[01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:27.100]   Like Instagram, but even simpler.

[01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:18.940]   What's happening with it?
[01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:24.180]   Google's results were just saying, here's a company that was inventing the future and suddenly
[01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:25.940]   boom, they're old school.
[01:28:25.940 --> 01:28:26.940]   They're out the door.
[01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:30.940]   I think that's probably like, what's the word wrong?
[01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:31.940]   Oh.
[01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:34.940]   I don't think they're over.
[01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:35.940]   Right?
[01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:38.940]   They're just, they're making $14.5 billion.
[01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:39.940]   Yeah.
[01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:40.940]   Yeah.
[01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:43.940]   And I told the revenue, which is still, they're a major, major, major company.
[01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:45.940]   They're like investing in space.
[01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:47.940]   So they plan to be around with us.
[01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:50.940]   But ad revenue is, the growth in ad revenue is slowing.
[01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:52.940]   I mean, it's an old model.
[01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:55.940]   People shift their attention to other places.
[01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:56.940]   Is that true?
[01:28:56.940 --> 01:28:57.940]   Isn't it strong?
[01:28:57.940 --> 01:28:58.940]   Exactly.
[01:28:58.940 --> 01:28:59.940]   Where's Google?
[01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:04.780]   As you're holding your finger down for 10 minutes a day, you are literally not looking
[01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:05.780]   at anything else.
[01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:08.940]   Are we going to have like a disease called Snapchat finger?
[01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:10.940]   Um, that finger.
[01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:12.940]   It's a technique.
[01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:14.940]   Technic and Snapchat finger.
[01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:19.940]   So the thing is with Google, is their search sucks now.
[01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:21.340]   Am I right?
[01:29:21.340 --> 01:29:22.540]   Because they've junked it up?
[01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:23.540]   Why?
[01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:25.940]   Because I think the people have figured out how to work the system.
[01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:27.220]   It doesn't work anymore.
[01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:28.260]   I think it comes and goes.
[01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:33.340]   I mean, there certainly was a time when all you got was link farms.
[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:37.180]   And then a Mac cuts and the anti-spam team did a, I think a good job of pruning that
[01:29:37.180 --> 01:29:38.180]   out.
[01:29:38.180 --> 01:29:39.940]   You think we're back to those battle days?
[01:29:39.940 --> 01:29:44.660]   I think just spend 20 minutes trying to find the picture from Iceland of Rome's
[01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:45.660]   alright.
[01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:46.660]   It didn't show up.
[01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:47.660]   Yeah.
[01:29:47.660 --> 01:29:48.660]   But here's the other challenge.
[01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:52.140]   I think maybe it's the same things that are affecting their slowing, you know, growth
[01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:54.060]   in ad revenue, right?
[01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:57.700]   Attention to shifting new platforms are emerging that they have nothing or almost nothing to
[01:29:57.700 --> 01:29:58.780]   do with.
[01:29:58.780 --> 01:30:03.780]   And as the internet and the web part of it get populated with all this extra media,
[01:30:03.780 --> 01:30:06.380]   you're looking for, you know what you're looking for.
[01:30:06.380 --> 01:30:07.380]   Nick, when you put it.
[01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:09.620]   Bear, I say the web is dead.
[01:30:09.620 --> 01:30:11.100]   Google doesn't know what you're looking for.
[01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:12.220]   Is the web in trouble?
[01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:14.460]   Well, Google should know what I'm looking for.
[01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:15.460]   But the source of credibility.
[01:30:15.460 --> 01:30:17.100]   Web pages don't matter anymore.
[01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:21.900]   Yeah, the sources of credibility that conferred that knowledge in the past were like, oh, you're
[01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:26.220]   clearly because of New York Times linked to it or 10,000 people blogged about a thing.
[01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:30.540]   Not that that's where Google is exactly stuck, but it certainly doesn't take advantage of,
[01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:34.180]   oh, on Tuesday, two years ago, this is the super popular thing you were looking for.
[01:30:34.180 --> 01:30:35.820]   Now Facebook showed good revenue.
[01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:36.980]   They figured out mobile.
[01:30:36.980 --> 01:30:44.180]   In fact, Facebook basically said their mobile views are now more than half of all
[01:30:44.180 --> 01:30:46.820]   views, mobile revenue, more than half of all.
[01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:48.060]   I mean, they showed good revenue.
[01:30:48.060 --> 01:30:49.260]   They showed good growth.
[01:30:49.260 --> 01:30:51.980]   But I also feel like Facebook might be kind of dead.
[01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:55.260]   And then auto playing all your video ads certainly helps.
[01:30:55.260 --> 01:30:56.260]   Yeah.
[01:30:56.260 --> 01:30:59.260]   Like I don't actually ever engage in those things, but they're just they're scrolling.
[01:30:59.260 --> 01:31:02.260]   Those non-cents are playing as I'm scrolling past them.
[01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:09.740]   Did you see in their opinion that in their financial report, they said that they consider
[01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:12.340]   a video viewed if it's been viewed for three seconds.
[01:31:12.340 --> 01:31:13.340]   Yeah.
[01:31:13.340 --> 01:31:15.940]   So you look at the analytics and you see the advertisers feel that one.
[01:31:15.940 --> 01:31:19.220]   You know, it certainly doesn't feel like you've gotten what you paid for.
[01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:22.820]   You should have to hold your finger onto the Facebook.
[01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:24.060]   That would solve that, wouldn't it?
[01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:25.060]   Actually, I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:31:25.060 --> 01:31:28.380]   I mean, we're in a copycat world, like view source and then paste.
[01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:32.300]   And so people will start to replicate that because they think that that's the secret
[01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:33.620]   sauce.
[01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:35.180]   What's going on with cyanogen?
[01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:39.780]   I have a I like cyanogen, where I'm in fact, I bought a OnePlus one because I love cyanogen.
[01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:42.820]   OnePlus once taken the branding off, they've announced they're going to have their own operating
[01:31:42.820 --> 01:31:48.700]   system, O2 coming out sometime this, well, they're going to announce more on February
[01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:49.700]   12th.
[01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:50.980]   We don't know when it's going to come out.
[01:31:50.980 --> 01:31:55.300]   And Microsoft announces it's making an investment in cyanogen.
[01:31:55.300 --> 01:31:56.300]   What?
[01:31:56.300 --> 01:32:01.020]   It's a crazy, no, just a, can you verify my understanding with cyanogen was initially
[01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:05.580]   making jailbroken versions for iPhone way back in the day, right?
[01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:09.500]   Didn't they have a mod for iPhone when you jailbroken iPhone, you could load their OS?
[01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:13.100]   No, I think you're confusing that with, uh, said, yeah.
[01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:14.100]   Okay.
[01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:15.100]   Okay.
[01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:18.580]   So cyanogen is, I first experienced it when you took, you would take a Samsung, let's
[01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:21.860]   say, Galaxy S2 and you really don't want the touch whiz.
[01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:26.260]   So you root it, you put a new recovery, uh, system on it and then you can install your
[01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:29.380]   own ROMs and cyanogen was always one of the best.
[01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:31.220]   They were version, they took Android.
[01:32:31.220 --> 01:32:32.220]   I use iPhone.
[01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:33.220]   It wasn't Android.
[01:32:33.220 --> 01:32:34.220]   Yeah.
[01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:35.220]   Yeah.
[01:32:35.220 --> 01:32:36.220]   You know, you're right.
[01:32:36.220 --> 01:32:39.220]   If you say I'm rotted my, my Android way back in the day.
[01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:40.220]   Yeah.
[01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:42.900]   So you root your Android and you put a different ROM on it.
[01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:48.820]   You get rid of touch whiz and cyanogen did something that was quasi, I think quasi not
[01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:54.660]   right, but they would make it based on AOSP, the open source, but then nobody really wants
[01:32:54.660 --> 01:32:56.260]   just AOSP Android.
[01:32:56.260 --> 01:32:58.940]   They want all the Google services and Google apps.
[01:32:58.940 --> 01:33:03.180]   So they do a side load of all of that, which will put the Play Store and Play Services on
[01:33:03.180 --> 01:33:04.180]   there.
[01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:05.820]   And now it's a better Android phone.
[01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:10.300]   In fact, this was kind of the end game on it was putting it on a legitimate handset.
[01:33:10.300 --> 01:33:14.740]   The fact cyanogen on a one plus one is great.
[01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:15.940]   Excesses.
[01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:18.980]   I don't know where Sanjay is going.
[01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:22.700]   Their new CEO said we're going to, we're going to kill Android.
[01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:23.980]   They want to be the new Android.
[01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:27.820]   They say Google is not a good steward of Android and they've taken it, but then they take
[01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:28.820]   money.
[01:33:28.820 --> 01:33:29.820]   Sorry.
[01:33:29.820 --> 01:33:31.060]   Didn't mean to mention Google.
[01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:32.660]   My phone woke up.
[01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:37.500]   And then they take money from Microsoft.
[01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:38.500]   Any thoughts on that?
[01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:39.500]   This probably not in your.
[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:42.860]   No, I mean, look, I might only thought I think it's good.
[01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:47.460]   I think having one company run the operating systems on half the phone being sold.
[01:33:47.460 --> 01:33:48.460]   Yeah.
[01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:50.300]   No, I'm rooting for Sanjay.
[01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:51.300]   I get it.
[01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:52.300]   Rooting.
[01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:53.300]   That was good.
[01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:54.300]   I'm rooting.
[01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:55.300]   I attended.
[01:33:55.300 --> 01:33:57.940]   However, I'm not rooting for Microsoft, Sanjay.
[01:33:57.940 --> 01:33:58.940]   Why not?
[01:33:58.940 --> 01:34:01.660]   I mean, actually Microsoft's the new the new.
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:04.260]   I only have 3% of the smartphone market share.
[01:34:04.260 --> 01:34:05.260]   They're not really.
[01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:08.460]   Is it Microsoft the new black with the HoloLens and.
[01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:12.100]   Yeah, that that's so that actually if you want to talk HoloLens for one second, that
[01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:15.540]   reminded me so much to go way back to the book, Demon and Freedom.
[01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:16.540]   Yeah.
[01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:17.540]   Those despatients.
[01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:19.260]   I was like, Oh, it's happening.
[01:34:19.260 --> 01:34:20.980]   Oh, look at the little dog.
[01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:22.980]   That your newest?
[01:34:22.980 --> 01:34:26.980]   That's my fiance's dog for the folks at home without cameras.
[01:34:26.980 --> 01:34:30.140]   Nick, put a dog and I was just trying to you guys are talking about boring stuff.
[01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:32.700]   I was just trying to make it really exciting by putting a little.
[01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:37.020]   If I snapchat you and your dog, does I get me more viewers?
[01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:38.020]   Maybe.
[01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:39.540]   Phoebe say hi.
[01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:40.620]   Why is it pointed at me?
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:41.940]   How do I flip the phone?
[01:34:41.940 --> 01:34:43.180]   Why is it pointed at me?
[01:34:43.180 --> 01:34:44.180]   That's it.
[01:34:44.180 --> 01:34:45.620]   That's the answer to everything right there, Leo.
[01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:47.620]   That's the title of the show.
[01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:48.620]   I swear.
[01:34:48.620 --> 01:34:50.620]   Why is it the funny at his snapchat?
[01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:51.620]   The mobile media.
[01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:52.620]   Okay.
[01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:53.940]   And then I add that to my stories.
[01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:56.260]   And now Nick, you're part of my story.
[01:34:56.260 --> 01:34:57.260]   Phoebe.
[01:34:57.260 --> 01:34:58.260]   That's Phoebe.
[01:34:58.260 --> 01:34:59.260]   It's Phoebe.
[01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:01.260]   It's a mini pixel.
[01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:02.260]   Oh, sweet.
[01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:03.260]   All right.
[01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:06.340]   Yeah, we're bored by Google.
[01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:07.500]   We're bored by Microsoft.
[01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:08.500]   I'm telling you.
[01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:12.180]   Resting to try to take Google out of its own operating system.
[01:35:12.180 --> 01:35:13.180]   It's like Game of Thrones.
[01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:14.940]   Hey, can I ask you guys a question?
[01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:15.940]   Yes.
[01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:20.020]   Did you see the deflate gate thing with the football thing?
[01:35:20.020 --> 01:35:21.020]   Yeah.
[01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:22.020]   The science behind that.
[01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:23.020]   Yeah.
[01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:24.020]   What's the science behind deflate gate?
[01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:29.820]   The science is about gases and it's about the temperature of a room and it's about what
[01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:31.460]   happens in pressure.
[01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:39.780]   So for those of you who don't follow sport ball, deflate gate is a controversy following
[01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:44.860]   I think it was the AFC playoffs between the Colts and the Patriots in which the Patriots
[01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:50.380]   are accused of under inflating footballs to make them easier to grasp and pass.
[01:35:50.380 --> 01:35:55.620]   Now, I don't understand exactly how this would benefit one team but not the other.
[01:35:55.620 --> 01:35:58.180]   Maybe I don't know, they switched footballs.
[01:35:58.180 --> 01:35:59.180]   No.
[01:35:59.180 --> 01:36:04.460]   The idea is that there are rules about how with the PSI of the ball.
[01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:08.620]   They're supposed to be to 12 and a half to 13 and a half pounds per square inch.
[01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:14.260]   So if one team has avoided those rules and then made it much easier to grip the ball,
[01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:19.540]   when they're playing offense, then they couldn't, in theory, have some kind of advantage.
[01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:21.740]   I think that's the basic like allegations.
[01:36:21.740 --> 01:36:25.820]   Apparently the Patriots game balls were re-inflated at halftime.
[01:36:25.820 --> 01:36:31.180]   What this really is, it gave everybody in the media over a week a chance to say balls.
[01:36:31.180 --> 01:36:32.180]   What's up to talk about?
[01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:35.980]   Yeah, because to be real cute for like five days in a row.
[01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:37.300]   So what's the science though?
[01:36:37.300 --> 01:36:40.180]   Are they saying, well, it was an altitude thing or?
[01:36:40.180 --> 01:36:44.380]   So the last I just talked to a super Pat's fanatic yesterday, I haven't dug into this
[01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:45.380]   myself.
[01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:49.460]   I just I'm not that into it because football is not super important to me.
[01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:51.220]   Obviously you're here right now.
[01:36:51.220 --> 01:36:52.220]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:53.220]   The game has probably started.
[01:36:53.220 --> 01:36:56.740]   But the guess the idea is the Patriots are saying we didn't do anything wrong.
[01:36:56.740 --> 01:36:58.220]   Like this just happened.
[01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:01.020]   And so there's a question of deflation happens.
[01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:05.860]   Yeah, is it possible for footballs to lose pressure?
[01:37:05.860 --> 01:37:07.300]   I'm not going to play into the balls.
[01:37:07.300 --> 01:37:09.180]   I can't do the balls pun thing anymore.
[01:37:09.180 --> 01:37:12.980]   Is it possible footballs to lose their pressure naturally or do they have to be interfered
[01:37:12.980 --> 01:37:16.340]   with by a person who is basically trying to cheat in some way?
[01:37:16.340 --> 01:37:19.140]   People Bill and I come out and say that it was nonsense.
[01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:21.420]   They're skews for it.
[01:37:21.420 --> 01:37:22.420]   Bill and I the science guy.
[01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:23.420]   Isn't that right?
[01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:24.420]   I don't.
[01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:28.340]   I literally tried to filter out any information related to this story over the past week.
[01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:29.340]   Okay.
[01:37:29.340 --> 01:37:30.340]   Well, this has been.
[01:37:30.340 --> 01:37:32.140]   And that's how you kill a topic.
[01:37:32.140 --> 01:37:33.140]   Boom.
[01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:35.580]   Or as a missional chess, y'all.
[01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:39.140]   Actually, how you kill a topic.
[01:37:39.140 --> 01:37:41.540]   Whoa, where did there leave?
[01:37:41.540 --> 01:37:46.340]   Did we lose him because we were so boring?
[01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:47.860]   He went to go watch the Super Bowl event.
[01:37:47.860 --> 01:37:48.860]   He's been lying for a while.
[01:37:48.860 --> 01:37:51.860]   Literally, we just bored Leo to death.
[01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:54.500]   Well, this is where the studio is empty and Nick and I are.
[01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:55.500]   What do we call this?
[01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:57.500]   What do we call this bartender when we take over the studio?
[01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:58.500]   Occupied, occupied, occupied.
[01:37:58.500 --> 01:37:59.500]   The last time.
[01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:02.980]   I just went to get a beer and a hot dog.
[01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:03.980]   It's all right.
[01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:04.980]   I'm not.
[01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:05.980]   I'm over.
[01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:06.980]   Oh, good.
[01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:07.980]   We thought you were a defendant.
[01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:09.780]   We were about to do an occupied twist.
[01:38:09.780 --> 01:38:12.260]   People at home won't get this, but it was really spooky.
[01:38:12.260 --> 01:38:14.940]   It looked like you had been disappeared.
[01:38:14.940 --> 01:38:17.860]   I got deflated.
[01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:19.180]   Sky Mall is dead.
[01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:20.180]   Oh, man.
[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:23.980]   This is, I don't know what I'm going to drool on on the airplane anymore.
[01:38:23.980 --> 01:38:25.220]   Well, you know what?
[01:38:25.220 --> 01:38:28.460]   Coronne Sky Mall, it's the smartphone that killed it.
[01:38:28.460 --> 01:38:29.980]   And then how do they explain?
[01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:33.180]   How do they explain blaming the smartphone for their death?
[01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:38.340]   Because now that the hit, it all started when the FAA said that you didn't have to.
[01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:43.300]   Apparently, the only time people were looking at Sky Mall, the catalog and the seat back
[01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:44.300]   of your plane.
[01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:45.300]   The law forced them to.
[01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:48.220]   When the, and then the pilot said, okay, now that's it.
[01:38:48.220 --> 01:38:50.340]   You can't use your electronics for 10 minutes.
[01:38:50.340 --> 01:38:51.340]   Let's look at Sky Mall.
[01:38:51.340 --> 01:38:52.340]   Yeah.
[01:38:52.340 --> 01:38:55.260]   As soon as somebody could keep their electronics on, boom.
[01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:57.660]   The bottom falls out of Sky Mall.
[01:38:57.660 --> 01:39:02.740]   Oh, so the, so the true market for Sky Mall is I hate people, right?
[01:39:02.740 --> 01:39:05.380]   Because we could also have talked to each other.
[01:39:05.380 --> 01:39:06.380]   No, no, no, no.
[01:39:06.380 --> 01:39:07.380]   No, no, no.
[01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:09.300]   I need anything but the person next to me.
[01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:10.300]   Anything but that.
[01:39:10.300 --> 01:39:11.660]   That everybody gets a window.
[01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:16.140]   So Sky Mall was basically taking up space for us to avoid our fellow human beings.
[01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:17.820]   And then we got the internet for that in the palm of our hands.
[01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:21.620]   You know, it's a shame because the very next month of Sky Mall's catalog, they were gonna
[01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:22.620]   have flying cars.
[01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:23.620]   Oh, man.
[01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:25.660]   And if they hadn't gone bankrupt.
[01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:30.340]   I know a lot of people telling me this was my fault.
[01:39:30.340 --> 01:39:31.340]   Your fault?
[01:39:31.340 --> 01:39:32.620]   I mean, fault is the wrong word.
[01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:34.260]   It's like you're doing.
[01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:36.780]   Because I did the FAA stuff.
[01:39:36.780 --> 01:39:37.780]   It's your fault.
[01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:38.940]   You were the one.
[01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:39.940]   You were the one.
[01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:41.220]   You rattled the cage.
[01:39:41.220 --> 01:39:43.740]   You said, why do we have to turn these things off?
[01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:44.740]   That's right.
[01:39:44.740 --> 01:39:45.740]   Yeah.
[01:39:45.740 --> 01:39:46.740]   I, oh yeah.
[01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:47.740]   They, yeah.
[01:39:47.740 --> 01:39:48.740]   The FAA hated me for a while.
[01:39:48.740 --> 01:39:49.900]   Probably still do whatever.
[01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:51.660]   Are you on a no fly list?
[01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:54.980]   No, but I was on a no pick up the phone list.
[01:39:54.980 --> 01:39:55.980]   Really?
[01:39:55.980 --> 01:39:56.980]   Yeah.
[01:39:56.980 --> 01:39:59.140]   So now you're bitching about the sorry state of inflight Wi-Fi.
[01:39:59.140 --> 01:40:00.940]   Is this your next crusade?
[01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:02.460]   Yeah, it could be.
[01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:03.460]   Maybe we'll see how it goes.
[01:40:03.460 --> 01:40:06.380]   A lot of people seem to get behind it.
[01:40:06.380 --> 01:40:11.140]   Have you flown lately on how sorry internet on the plane is?
[01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:12.140]   It's pretty slow.
[01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:13.140]   Yeah.
[01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:16.300]   And before, before everyone says, well, did you see that the Louis C.K.
[01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:17.300]   Skit?
[01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:18.300]   Yes, it's in the article.
[01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:19.300]   Thank you very much.
[01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:20.460]   I didn't get that far.
[01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:22.060]   Only read the first paragraph.
[01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:26.420]   I had a couple of colleagues that responded to my, to my Twitter, to my column.
[01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:28.460]   And they were like, you should see this Louis C.K.
[01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:29.460]   Skit.
[01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:30.460]   And I was like, well, have you actually bothered, I responded.
[01:40:30.460 --> 01:40:33.220]   And I said, have you actually bothered to read the piece?
[01:40:33.220 --> 01:40:34.220]   You would see the last four paragraphs.
[01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:35.860]   You should have led with it.
[01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:40.580]   Well, the whole point was to try to catch them in the act of tweeting without reading.
[01:40:40.580 --> 01:40:41.580]   Ah.
[01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:42.580]   And it's part of your point, Nick.
[01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:44.580]   Not that like, oh, yay, we live in magic.
[01:40:44.580 --> 01:40:45.580]   Great.
[01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:46.580]   But you're charging me for this.
[01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:48.020]   Yeah, 12, 13 bucks.
[01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:49.020]   Sometimes we need to--
[01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:50.020]   No, it's $34.
[01:40:50.020 --> 01:40:52.460]   It started out just $12, $13.
[01:40:52.460 --> 01:40:53.460]   It's now $34.
[01:40:53.460 --> 01:40:55.100]   It depends on your airline.
[01:40:55.100 --> 01:40:57.060]   But isn't the problem that everybody's using it?
[01:40:57.060 --> 01:40:59.900]   I mean, that they didn't have that much bandwidth, but when you were the only one using it,
[01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:00.900]   it wasn't so bad.
[01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:01.900]   But now everybody's using.
[01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:02.900]   Yeah.
[01:41:02.900 --> 01:41:05.740]   So, but here's the thing.
[01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:09.260]   You have about 70 people on a flight from the east coast to the west coast that will
[01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:11.420]   pop on and use the Wi-Fi.
[01:41:11.420 --> 01:41:13.820]   You're not going to-- I think anyone that's using it is using it.
[01:41:13.820 --> 01:41:17.380]   So, why screw is over with the cost of it, first of all?
[01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:19.900]   And second of all, there are technologies out there.
[01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:24.460]   There are companies that have developed technologies where you can do 100 megabits a
[01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:26.460]   second through satellite and so on.
[01:41:26.460 --> 01:41:28.380]   They do exist on certain airlines.
[01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:29.380]   JetBlue has it.
[01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:30.700]   They are upgrading now, yes.
[01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:31.700]   They are upgrading.
[01:41:31.700 --> 01:41:36.660]   So, it's like, you know, why charges the air to ground stuff is 3 megabits per second.
[01:41:36.660 --> 01:41:37.660]   It's--
[01:41:37.660 --> 01:41:42.700]   Well, because, Nick, the airlines are in the business of making money and frankly for
[01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:44.580]   a while they were about to go out of business.
[01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:46.940]   And so, they're just grasping for every dollar they can get.
[01:41:46.940 --> 01:41:51.100]   Well, here's the thing that I found out in the reporting in the column is that in Europe,
[01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:55.860]   there are some airlines that pay for the Wi-Fi and give it to their customers for free.
[01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:56.860]   Right.
[01:41:56.860 --> 01:41:58.460]   And entices people to take those airlines.
[01:41:58.460 --> 01:42:00.460]   So, why can't we have that here in America?
[01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:01.460]   Hotels.
[01:42:01.460 --> 01:42:05.620]   We overpay for Wi-Fi and Hotels is not as crappy, but it's often not so good.
[01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:07.500]   It's not me, but the same is.
[01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:09.900]   But the difference is that an airplane, you've got to put lots of heavy equipment.
[01:42:09.900 --> 01:42:11.620]   It uses more fuel because you've got this equipment.
[01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:12.700]   How much does it weigh, do you know?
[01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:13.700]   The Wi-Fi boxes?
[01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:14.700]   It's not that much.
[01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:15.700]   It's not that much.
[01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:16.700]   No.
[01:42:16.700 --> 01:42:21.740]   Well, it creates-- it certainly creates like-- you have tech support in your plane.
[01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:23.580]   Like, that's an issue when things don't work.
[01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:26.340]   People get really, really angry in it and they're going to harass the flight attendants
[01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:27.340]   who may not know.
[01:42:27.340 --> 01:42:29.660]   Like, they have to be trained on how to answer that if not fixed it.
[01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:32.900]   I think because of Nick, they're going to take Wi-Fi out of airplanes.
[01:42:32.900 --> 01:42:35.980]   And now we can blame him for the death of Skymall.
[01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:40.060]   And he and Nick, they're going to put-- they're going to replace Wi-Fi with the new version
[01:42:40.060 --> 01:42:43.100]   of Skymall available on the Kindle.
[01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:45.580]   We should have said, hey, don't shut down yet Wi-Fi.
[01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:49.540]   Well, you'll have gigabit ease of SBS, but only for Skymall.biz.
[01:42:49.540 --> 01:42:52.180]   That's the only site you can actually really fast.
[01:42:52.180 --> 01:42:53.740]   The only free one.
[01:42:53.740 --> 01:42:54.740]   Drones, guys.
[01:42:54.740 --> 01:42:55.740]   You like drones?
[01:42:55.740 --> 01:42:56.740]   You're excited about drones?
[01:42:56.740 --> 01:42:57.740]   Drones?
[01:42:57.740 --> 01:42:59.580]   You know, the guy, the drunk guy who crashed his drone.
[01:42:59.580 --> 01:43:00.580]   Into the White House?
[01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:01.580]   Yeah.
[01:43:01.580 --> 01:43:04.540]   See you in trouble?
[01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:05.540]   This is the drone, by the way.
[01:43:05.540 --> 01:43:09.020]   I love the secret service picture that went over the wire.
[01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:11.020]   It's a DJI Phantom.
[01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:12.380]   Yeah, I fancy them.
[01:43:12.380 --> 01:43:18.820]   That apparently is being flown by a drunken government employee at 2 in the morning.
[01:43:18.820 --> 01:43:19.820]   Oh my goodness.
[01:43:19.820 --> 01:43:23.260]   What are the aircraft batteries when that thing is cleared?
[01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:24.260]   Well, this is the problem.
[01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:27.900]   These things are so small and fly so low that the radar doesn't see them.
[01:43:27.900 --> 01:43:29.260]   And what are you going to shoot them with?
[01:43:29.260 --> 01:43:32.620]   Isn't that going to be worse than the drone?
[01:43:32.620 --> 01:43:33.620]   It's crazy.
[01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:34.620]   The balloons.
[01:43:34.620 --> 01:43:38.940]   This is really interesting because, yeah, the guy was an idiot and drunk and whatever
[01:43:38.940 --> 01:43:40.740]   and just having fun and screwed up.
[01:43:40.740 --> 01:43:45.580]   But they, you know, when what I keep finding that's really fascinating with technology
[01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:49.140]   is every time some new amazing technology comes out, we're like, "Wow, this is the greatest
[01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:50.700]   thing ever, like 3D printing."
[01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:52.940]   And then somebody thinks of something really bad to do with it.
[01:43:52.940 --> 01:43:54.340]   Like make guns.
[01:43:54.340 --> 01:43:56.100]   And I think that you're starting to see that with drones.
[01:43:56.100 --> 01:43:57.100]   And we first saw it.
[01:43:57.100 --> 01:43:58.540]   It was like, "Wow, this is really amazing."
[01:43:58.540 --> 01:44:05.500]   And now people are coming out saying, "Well, but they're using the being used on the border
[01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:08.060]   to pass drugs back and forth and so on."
[01:44:08.060 --> 01:44:09.620]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[01:44:09.620 --> 01:44:12.140]   A great idea.
[01:44:12.140 --> 01:44:15.460]   And the real concern is if they get weaponized, people are worried about them.
[01:44:15.460 --> 01:44:20.180]   In fact, I guarantee you there at the Super Bowl, there's some serious concern about weaponized
[01:44:20.180 --> 01:44:21.180]   drones.
[01:44:21.180 --> 01:44:22.180]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:44:22.180 --> 01:44:25.300]   And by the way, the weaponizing doesn't mean putting a bomb on it.
[01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:27.060]   But if you load it up with a little anthrax pack.
[01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:29.500]   So here's the beautiful thing to counter.
[01:44:29.500 --> 01:44:33.060]   I mean, every tool is a weapon as well.
[01:44:33.060 --> 01:44:36.340]   The hammer can be used to bash them once head in, the knife can be used to end someone's
[01:44:36.340 --> 01:44:42.660]   life in a second and also carve a delicious, delicious roast on a Sunday afternoon.
[01:44:42.660 --> 01:44:44.540]   So we should be very careful.
[01:44:44.540 --> 01:44:46.020]   I'm very glad I knew that delicious.
[01:44:46.020 --> 01:44:47.020]   That was like...
[01:44:47.020 --> 01:44:48.460]   I think you're in a hurry.
[01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:54.740]   But this White House situation, like, yes, a junk employee flew a drone over, but also
[01:44:54.740 --> 01:44:57.540]   a dude just jumped over the fence and then ran.
[01:44:57.540 --> 01:44:58.540]   Right.
[01:44:58.540 --> 01:44:59.540]   Well, they got other issues.
[01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:00.540]   Inside the building.
[01:45:00.540 --> 01:45:01.540]   Like there's just...
[01:45:01.540 --> 01:45:04.660]   The thing is they can do something about the dudes jumping over the fence.
[01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:05.740]   These drones are hard to...
[01:45:05.740 --> 01:45:11.140]   By the way, DJI's response, I think DJI and other phantom manufacturers are totally terrified
[01:45:11.140 --> 01:45:14.940]   that because the president said there needs to be more regulation.
[01:45:14.940 --> 01:45:23.500]   And so DJI has now got a mandatory firmware update that will stop the drones from flying
[01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:26.260]   over Washington, DC.
[01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:27.260]   Over the whole city?
[01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:28.740]   They don't work.
[01:45:28.740 --> 01:45:32.460]   So if you're a resident of Washington, DC and you wanted...
[01:45:32.460 --> 01:45:33.460]   Don't buy a DJI.
[01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:37.420]   If you're in high school in DC and you're part of a science project, your drone won't...
[01:45:37.420 --> 01:45:38.900]   That doesn't make any sense, Leon.
[01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:41.740]   The updated firmware will be released in coming day, says DJI.
[01:45:41.740 --> 01:45:46.860]   It adds a no-fly zone centered on downtown Washington, DC for a 15 and a half mile radius
[01:45:46.860 --> 01:45:48.820]   in all directions.
[01:45:48.820 --> 01:45:54.100]   Some pilots in this area will not be able to take off from or fly into this airspace.
[01:45:54.100 --> 01:45:55.100]   What?
[01:45:55.100 --> 01:45:56.100]   What?
[01:45:56.100 --> 01:46:04.420]   Furthermore, they're going to start programming its drones to stop flying when they get within
[01:46:04.420 --> 01:46:06.420]   a certain distance of airports.
[01:46:06.420 --> 01:46:09.860]   See DJI's, unlike some cheaper drones, have GPS built in.
[01:46:09.860 --> 01:46:13.260]   Man, is my audio sounding really walker to you?
[01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:14.260]   No, you sound marvelous.
[01:46:14.260 --> 01:46:16.860]   You sound weird to me, but maybe that's just how you...
[01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:20.020]   Take a break, Bertrand is going to fix his audio.
[01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:21.500]   We got to wrap this up.
[01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:22.500]   Yeah.
[01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:25.500]   Bertrand is starting to fantasize about roast beef.
[01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:26.980]   That's always about time.
[01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:28.980]   Always about time.
[01:46:28.980 --> 01:46:29.980]   What?
[01:46:29.980 --> 01:46:30.980]   What?
[01:46:30.980 --> 01:46:31.980]   What?
[01:46:31.980 --> 01:46:32.980]   I just...
[01:46:32.980 --> 01:46:35.900]   If he starts looking at Pixel with, you know, gleaming his eye, I'd be careful.
[01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:36.900]   I'm just saying.
[01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:39.180]   Yeah, you are silonning hard for me to do this.
[01:46:39.180 --> 01:46:43.420]   Oh, unplug and re-plug your headset while we talk about freshbooks.com.
[01:46:43.420 --> 01:46:48.700]   It is cloud accounting software designed for small businesses or freelancers.
[01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:53.740]   A lot of us, you know, for years, was going to Canada doing the TV show up there and I
[01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:56.100]   had to build them every month and I would forget and forget.
[01:46:56.100 --> 01:46:57.100]   I didn't forget.
[01:46:57.100 --> 01:46:58.100]   I hated it.
[01:46:58.100 --> 01:46:59.260]   Who wants to launch Microsoft Word?
[01:46:59.260 --> 01:47:02.660]   Tanking and making the whole thing printed out like a stan...
[01:47:02.660 --> 01:47:06.860]   I would put it off, which means I wouldn't get paid for months.
[01:47:06.860 --> 01:47:11.620]   And then they'd complain when they get five invoices at the same time.
[01:47:11.620 --> 01:47:13.140]   Freshbooks saved my life.
[01:47:13.140 --> 01:47:16.380]   Freshbooks makes it easy to invoice.
[01:47:16.380 --> 01:47:18.940]   Beautiful, professional looking invoices.
[01:47:18.940 --> 01:47:23.140]   You can have them automatically created every month, if you wish.
[01:47:23.140 --> 01:47:24.140]   They have...
[01:47:24.140 --> 01:47:27.100]   When you email the invoice, a pay button, your clients will love because they press that
[01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:31.940]   button and you can use top credit cards, online payment systems.
[01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:37.140]   On average, we'll get paid five days faster when you use freshbooks.
[01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:38.140]   That's amazing.
[01:47:38.140 --> 01:47:42.100]   Freshbooks integrates with your apps and services too, like Google Apps and PayPal and Stripe
[01:47:42.100 --> 01:47:44.980]   and MailChimp and FunBox and ZenPayroll and on and on and on.
[01:47:44.980 --> 01:47:47.260]   You can work in multiple currencies, which is great for me.
[01:47:47.260 --> 01:47:52.260]   I was billing in US and Canadian dollars for a long time.
[01:47:52.260 --> 01:47:54.180]   Freshbooks customers spend less time on paperwork.
[01:47:54.180 --> 01:47:58.140]   You free up on average two days a month to focus on the work you love.
[01:47:58.140 --> 01:48:03.740]   And if you've been using a paper system or a stopwatch to build time and hours, don't.
[01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:07.740]   They've got apps for Android and iOS that will do that automatically and put it right
[01:48:07.740 --> 01:48:08.740]   in the invoice.
[01:48:08.740 --> 01:48:12.780]   Snap photos of receipts right from your phone, enter the details and freshbooks, makes it
[01:48:12.780 --> 01:48:16.620]   very easy for you to build for expenses as well.
[01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:17.620]   Never been better.
[01:48:17.620 --> 01:48:21.780]   And with an open API, developers can integrate with Freshbooks platform and so more features
[01:48:21.780 --> 01:48:24.780]   are being added all the time, the best support in the world.
[01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:28.020]   PC Magazine calls Freshbooks simple and friendly.
[01:48:28.020 --> 01:48:30.980]   Its invoice management is among the best.
[01:48:30.980 --> 01:48:34.860]   Got editor's choice for both web application and mobile apps and I agree, I've been using
[01:48:34.860 --> 01:48:36.460]   it for years.

[01:48:51.700 --> 01:48:52.700]   Freshbooks.com/twit.
[01:48:52.700 --> 01:48:58.900]   Actually, we've offered both of you stipends to appear more often on this show because
[01:48:58.900 --> 01:48:59.900]   I love you guys.
[01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:02.900]   Well, you know, I $10,000 a show, which just doesn't cut it from me.
[01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:03.900]   Is that what it's going to cost?
[01:49:03.900 --> 01:49:04.900]   Is that what it's going to take?
[01:49:04.900 --> 01:49:06.900]   It's going to cost $4.5 million.
[01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:12.340]   How about if I just send a drone to your house?
[01:49:12.340 --> 01:49:13.340]   I have a drone.
[01:49:13.340 --> 01:49:14.340]   Is that a threat?
[01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:15.340]   Do you what kind of drone do you have?
[01:49:15.340 --> 01:49:16.340]   I have a DJI.
[01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:17.620]   It's my third one.
[01:49:17.620 --> 01:49:19.940]   I crashed one into a wall.
[01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:24.140]   I crashed one into the river and it disappeared and this is the third one.
[01:49:24.140 --> 01:49:26.740]   I don't fly because I'm afraid to make a break.
[01:49:26.740 --> 01:49:28.020]   So I have a very similar story.
[01:49:28.020 --> 01:49:31.660]   I bought a very inexpensive drone, a SEMA.
[01:49:31.660 --> 01:49:35.220]   Because Padre, Father Robert, who is one of our hosts here is an expert on drums.
[01:49:35.220 --> 01:49:36.980]   He's building him on know-how.
[01:49:36.980 --> 01:49:38.140]   We have drone school.
[01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:39.740]   We do a lot of drone stuff here.
[01:49:39.740 --> 01:49:42.700]   And he said, look, the first drone, you shouldn't get an expensive one.
[01:49:42.700 --> 01:49:43.700]   No.
[01:49:43.700 --> 01:49:44.700]   Get a $40 drone.
[01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:45.700]   So I got the $40 SEMA.
[01:49:45.700 --> 01:49:49.300]   It's not quite disposable, 40 bucks.
[01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:51.540]   But also it has a advantage of being very light.
[01:49:51.540 --> 01:49:53.180]   It couldn't really hurt anybody.
[01:49:53.180 --> 01:49:57.540]   So first I'll put batteries in, charge the battery up on the drone, got the remote, you
[01:49:57.540 --> 01:50:01.580]   push the joystick forward to make it go up and it goes up.
[01:50:01.580 --> 01:50:03.900]   And then I try to go backwards, it doesn't go backwards, it goes up.
[01:50:03.900 --> 01:50:05.780]   I try to left, it goes backwards, it goes up.
[01:50:05.780 --> 01:50:07.500]   I try to, it goes up.
[01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:10.180]   It's like a helium freaking balloon.
[01:50:10.180 --> 01:50:12.060]   I lose sight of it.
[01:50:12.060 --> 01:50:13.060]   I can't see it.
[01:50:13.060 --> 01:50:15.660]   I'm going, where to go, where to go.
[01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:16.660]   It's gone.
[01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:17.660]   First time.
[01:50:17.660 --> 01:50:18.660]   No, that's the last drone.
[01:50:18.660 --> 01:50:19.660]   You never found it again?
[01:50:19.660 --> 01:50:21.700]   I walked the property.
[01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:24.060]   I walked three acres looking for it.
[01:50:24.060 --> 01:50:25.060]   Wait, are you serious?
[01:50:25.060 --> 01:50:26.060]   Isn't it happening?
[01:50:26.060 --> 01:50:27.060]   Gone.
[01:50:27.060 --> 01:50:28.060]   Into it.
[01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:29.060]   Gone in 30 seconds.
[01:50:29.060 --> 01:50:30.060]   This was gone in five.
[01:50:30.060 --> 01:50:31.540]   How do you know someone isn't stealing your drone?
[01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:33.260]   They could steal it if they could find it.
[01:50:33.260 --> 01:50:35.060]   You need a remote.
[01:50:35.060 --> 01:50:39.740]   So I had the DJI sent me the Phantom, the latest woman that first came out.
[01:50:39.740 --> 01:50:40.740]   That's nice.
[01:50:40.740 --> 01:50:45.940]   And I was doing a product review and I was in San Francisco and the big business editor
[01:50:45.940 --> 01:50:49.540]   was in town from the New York Times and I took him down to the water and I took this
[01:50:49.540 --> 01:50:53.380]   other reporter down to the water too.
[01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:57.380]   And we were flying down in this big, big, big, big parking lot.
[01:50:57.380 --> 01:51:00.380]   And I said to my editor, I was like, take it over the water.
[01:51:00.380 --> 01:51:02.380]   Let's take some photos of the boats.
[01:51:02.380 --> 01:51:06.700]   And he was like, okay, so he flew it out over the water and he looks at me and he goes,
[01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:08.220]   it's not working, Nick.
[01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:10.220]   And I was like, let me try.
[01:51:10.220 --> 01:51:15.020]   And as he handed it to me, the drone literally just fell out of the sky.
[01:51:15.020 --> 01:51:17.220]   And we ran to the water and that was it.
[01:51:17.220 --> 01:51:18.220]   It was gone.
[01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:19.220]   Now the other one again.
[01:51:19.220 --> 01:51:23.940]   Now you didn't buy that one, so you just had to call DJI and say I lost your drone.
[01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:26.900]   Yeah, so and they weren't too happy about it because it was like a prototype that was
[01:51:26.900 --> 01:51:30.300]   like 10 of them in the world.
[01:51:30.300 --> 01:51:34.420]   And so I wanted to be trying to figure out what was this like drone business?
[01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:36.260]   No business like drone business.
[01:51:36.260 --> 01:51:39.380]   We were trying to figure out what happened and one of the things we thought was in these
[01:51:39.380 --> 01:51:42.260]   early prototype ones, they had the switch on.
[01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:47.820]   There's a law that a drone can't go within a certain distance of an airport.
[01:51:47.820 --> 01:51:48.820]   Yeah.
[01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:52.940]   And we thought that maybe they had it on that it was turned on and that it automatically
[01:51:52.940 --> 01:51:56.300]   shut down, unknowing that it was in the water.
[01:51:56.300 --> 01:51:57.300]   Yeah.
[01:51:57.300 --> 01:51:58.300]   One theory.
[01:51:58.300 --> 01:51:59.300]   It's also sky net could be defending itself.
[01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:00.300]   Yeah.
[01:52:00.300 --> 01:52:01.300]   And the other or Isis.
[01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:03.180]   And you don't have to get that fancy.
[01:52:03.180 --> 01:52:06.660]   I mean the drone flew out of range basically and then just plummeted.
[01:52:06.660 --> 01:52:07.860]   I use drones all the time.
[01:52:07.860 --> 01:52:08.860]   They're paper airplanes.
[01:52:08.860 --> 01:52:11.260]   That's the best versus that's what I'm using from now on.
[01:52:11.260 --> 01:52:15.060]   I tried using one a few weeks ago and then just as I started to get the hang of it, the
[01:52:15.060 --> 01:52:16.060]   battery died.
[01:52:16.060 --> 01:52:17.060]   Right.
[01:52:17.060 --> 01:52:18.060]   I'm bored.
[01:52:18.060 --> 01:52:19.060]   Like Nick, I have a drone in a box.
[01:52:19.060 --> 01:52:22.740]   I don't want to take out because I know it'll just fly away and I'll lose it.
[01:52:22.740 --> 01:52:25.980]   It's like a big open like football field.
[01:52:25.980 --> 01:52:28.300]   I was like an a pretty open property.
[01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:30.100]   I don't because it went.
[01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:31.100]   So that's the thing to know.
[01:52:31.100 --> 01:52:33.300]   This thing can go so high you can't see it anymore.
[01:52:33.300 --> 01:52:34.300]   Oh yeah.
[01:52:34.300 --> 01:52:35.300]   They go.
[01:52:35.300 --> 01:52:36.300]   They can go thousands of feet in the air.
[01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:37.300]   Maybe a bird.
[01:52:37.300 --> 01:52:39.980]   Maybe you're like an eagle snatched your drone.
[01:52:39.980 --> 01:52:41.740]   I really like more creative understand.
[01:52:41.740 --> 01:52:44.100]   No, I flew it into the water.
[01:52:44.100 --> 01:52:45.100]   That's pretty much what happened.
[01:52:45.100 --> 01:52:47.300]   I'm talking about Leo's disappearing drone.
[01:52:47.300 --> 01:52:48.300]   Leo's disappearing.
[01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:49.300]   It's a mystery.
[01:52:49.300 --> 01:52:52.260]   Maybe it went to maybe went to drone heaven.
[01:52:52.260 --> 01:52:53.260]   It's in drone heaven.
[01:52:53.260 --> 01:52:54.260]   Where do drones know?
[01:52:54.260 --> 01:52:55.260]   You know what I have been in heaven.
[01:52:55.260 --> 01:52:56.900]   I really like you guys.
[01:52:56.900 --> 01:52:59.100]   I think I'm having a little romance.
[01:52:59.100 --> 01:53:02.500]   Why don't I just I want to why did you move to LA?
[01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:03.500]   Why?
[01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:04.500]   Have you seen my house?
[01:53:04.500 --> 01:53:05.500]   Yeah, it's gorgeous.
[01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:06.700]   I have seen your house.
[01:53:06.700 --> 01:53:08.420]   I mean it's gorgeous.
[01:53:08.420 --> 01:53:13.580]   I have like I you know I have great fruit trees in the back and lemon trees and there's
[01:53:13.580 --> 01:53:15.700]   like a spot over here to sit and relax.
[01:53:15.700 --> 01:53:16.700]   And a fiance.
[01:53:16.700 --> 01:53:18.500]   And you acquired a fiance.
[01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:19.580]   A couple of dogs.
[01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:24.700]   How long have you been telling this new lady where'd you find her?
[01:53:24.700 --> 01:53:25.700]   Internet.
[01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:26.700]   Internet.
[01:53:26.700 --> 01:53:28.300]   You could find women on the Internet.
[01:53:28.300 --> 01:53:29.300]   Twenty five dollars.
[01:53:29.300 --> 01:53:30.300]   Pretty cheap these days.
[01:53:30.300 --> 01:53:31.300]   Wow.
[01:53:31.300 --> 01:53:32.300]   You guys are terrible.
[01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:34.580]   Barret Sunday you're doing great too.
[01:53:34.580 --> 01:53:36.660]   And you're still in Brooklyn though, right?
[01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:38.180]   I'm in I'm in two places.
[01:53:38.180 --> 01:53:43.820]   I came out to LA in October to do a TV show which got which no longer exists.
[01:53:43.820 --> 01:53:46.060]   I was on the pivot network called Take Part Live.
[01:53:46.060 --> 01:53:47.060]   So I was living here.
[01:53:47.060 --> 01:53:48.060]   Oh, it was cool.
[01:53:48.060 --> 01:53:49.060]   I was very cool.
[01:53:49.060 --> 01:53:51.260]   He was working with Simon.
[01:53:51.260 --> 01:53:53.700]   So did what happened?
[01:53:53.700 --> 01:53:56.540]   Was it prematurely terminated or was that was the length of the time the show was going to
[01:53:56.540 --> 01:53:57.540]   be renewed?
[01:53:57.540 --> 01:54:00.180]   I would say it was prematurely terminated.
[01:54:00.180 --> 01:54:04.060]   They didn't have plans to not continue it when I joined for example.
[01:54:04.060 --> 01:54:08.140]   But so the show was probably up about a year before I joined and then I joined and then
[01:54:08.140 --> 01:54:09.140]   it didn't exist.
[01:54:09.140 --> 01:54:10.940]   Make of that what you will.
[01:54:10.940 --> 01:54:14.540]   Correlation not causation at any rate that's that part is done.
[01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:15.540]   But I just watched this.
[01:54:15.540 --> 01:54:16.540]   Watch this.
[01:54:16.540 --> 01:54:19.540]   Barret Sunday Thurston with Larry King ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:19.540 --> 01:54:23.260]   I mean this was like this was an amazing show.
[01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:28.620]   It looks like this is a seal of the press of the United States and I see T-Pain and Larry
[01:54:28.620 --> 01:54:29.620]   in the middle.
[01:54:29.620 --> 01:54:30.620]   Okay.
[01:54:30.620 --> 01:54:31.620]   As we all know.
[01:54:31.620 --> 01:54:32.620]   Wait a minute.
[01:54:32.620 --> 01:54:33.620]   That's not you.
[01:54:33.620 --> 01:54:34.620]   That's T-Pain.
[01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:35.620]   Where are you?
[01:54:35.620 --> 01:54:36.620]   I'm not I'm not in this.
[01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:37.620]   Oh.
[01:54:37.620 --> 01:54:38.620]   Was this before you arrived?
[01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:41.620]   He was no Larry King was on when I was on but it was a later episode.
[01:54:41.620 --> 01:54:43.460]   Yeah, I thought I saw pictures of you with Larry King.
[01:54:43.460 --> 01:54:45.860]   So that's his that's his first time on the show.
[01:54:45.860 --> 01:54:46.860]   His second visit.
[01:54:46.860 --> 01:54:47.860]   I was there.
[01:54:47.860 --> 01:54:50.620]   So what was the idea of of um.
[01:54:50.620 --> 01:54:52.620]   It's been 10 days much better looking than T-Pain.
[01:54:52.620 --> 01:54:53.620]   I agree.
[01:54:53.620 --> 01:54:57.740]   The idea of the the idea of the show was let's have a daily live show to help anchor this
[01:54:57.740 --> 01:54:58.740]   new network.
[01:54:58.740 --> 01:54:59.740]   Nice.
[01:54:59.740 --> 01:55:02.300]   Owned by participants as well as social impact plus entertainment.
[01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:03.300]   Yeah.
[01:55:03.300 --> 01:55:06.020]   And there were three hosts Megan McCain who's John McCain's daughter Senator John McCain
[01:55:06.020 --> 01:55:10.740]   is daughter Jacob sober off and myself and we would run down the days news.
[01:55:10.740 --> 01:55:13.300]   We would debate and have a bit of a round table.
[01:55:13.300 --> 01:55:15.300]   We would interview people.
[01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:18.500]   Sometimes celebrity sometimes activist people doing something kind of interesting in the
[01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:19.500]   world.
[01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:23.780]   The field pieces, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded a whole set of stories
[01:55:23.780 --> 01:55:26.140]   that had to do with public health and the developing world.
[01:55:26.140 --> 01:55:27.140]   It was too good.
[01:55:27.140 --> 01:55:28.140]   Good stories.
[01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:30.140]   It was it was a lot of good for television.
[01:55:30.140 --> 01:55:31.300]   It was a ton of good in the show.
[01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:33.260]   They also just learned a lot of things.
[01:55:33.260 --> 01:55:35.660]   And one of the things they learned is we shouldn't keep doing this.
[01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:38.180]   So I'm not doing that anymore.
[01:55:38.180 --> 01:55:40.300]   But I'm one of the nightly show look how handsome.
[01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:43.940]   Look how handsome Baratunde is on this show.
