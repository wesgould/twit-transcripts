[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.880]   topics, roughly in order, but mostly not.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.160]   Joining us today in studio, Mr. John C. Devorak.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.160]   The real.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:43.640]   Devorak, and by the way, the real Devorak, not real Devorak, the real Devorak on Twitter.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.640]   Right.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.080]   And we're going to, David Pogge is going to join us at the end of the show.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.280]   And channel Devorak.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.280]   And channeldevorak.com.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.980]   And also the real blog.
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.580]   I don't do the channel Devorak or the real blog, but they are approved.
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.820]   But before the show began, we recorded an interview with David Povey.
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.900]   He wanted to respond to the criticisms that he got last week from the Twit panel and
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.100]   even kind of the week before.
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.220]   And he did so, I thought, well, but he included you in the criticizers.
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.220]   And it turns out, and I'll make sure David learns this, that he was reading a spurious
[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.220]   Devorak tweet.
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.220]   A fake.
[00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.060]   It was reading, well, we won't even give it out.
[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.740]   I don't want to give him any publicity.
[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.480]   But somebody with a mere 200 followers, you have far more.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.480]   60,000.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.480]   Okay.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.160]   Although it could be millions now that I think about it.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.320]   So anyway, we'll talk to David.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.580]   He will get his chance to respond to what we talked about last week in terms of conflict
[00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:45.200]   of interest and the issues about how he talked to Steve Jobs and so forth.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.040]   Also joining us this week, we have an international cast.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.040]   I'm very thrilled about that.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.320]   From France, Patrick Bezia, he does a number of podcasts in France, including one that
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.160]   I keep meaning to be on the Phileus Club and never managed to get on.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.160]   Patrick, what is the...
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.160]   Would be great to have you on.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.160]   I'd love to come on.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.160]   It's frenchspin.com.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.480]   Is that the place people should go for your podcasts?
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.480]   Absolutely.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.920]   frenchspin.com is the site.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.840]   And yeah, you can find all of the different podcasts over there, both in French and English.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.280]   The Phileus Club is in English.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.640]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.680]   And that combines journalists from all over the world to talk about.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.080]   It's very much like an international twit.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:31.880]   Yeah, well, it's an international sort of general news twit, political and general topic.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.200]   And we try to get opinions from really different people like we have a regular contributor
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.720]   from Saudi Arabia and we try to get people from the US, South America, etc.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.720]   Excellent.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.720]   I look forward to it.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.480]   What's the website?
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.880]   frenchspin.com.com.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.360]   And I bet you they'd like you on that Phileus Club too, John.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.440]   Sounds like it's not the wrong hour.
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.440]   It's late at night.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.480]   Speaking of late at night, it is almost midnight in the UK.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.680]   But that hasn't stopped John Graham coming from joining us, an old friend and a man I
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.800]   would like to honor on twit today.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.800]   Wow.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.800]   John, it's good to talk to you.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.880]   Well, it's very nice to be here.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.120]   He's a little bit late.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.600]   So I'm a programmer.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.840]   So this is actually no normal working time.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.840]   That's true.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.840]   That's right.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:22.840]   That's right.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.840]   Just imbibe more coffee.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.640]   John is the more coffee and then get up early.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.040]   Get up late as possible.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.040]   Right.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.040]   Sleep in.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.040]   That's the problem.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.040]   That's the hard one, isn't it?
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.040]   Because tomorrow's Monday.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.040]   That is the hard bit.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.040]   Yep.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.040]   So John, I first met John.
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.520]   I think during the screensaver's days, he wrote a really good with Andy Spam, open source
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.920]   Andy Spam Bayesian filter called Popfile, which is on I think not just Windows, but
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.760]   Mac and Linux too, yes?
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.000]   It's written in Perl and it was done completely cross-platform.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.960]   I know it's even been run on things like an Amiga.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.960]   Wow.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.960]   John, you'd like that.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.960]   That wasn't me.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.960]   Yeah, I still have a little.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.960]   He still has an Amiga.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.840]   So the reason I wanted to John on, we talked about John's book, by the way, The Geek Atlas,
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.320]   which came out a few weeks ago as a wonderful, wonderful book.
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.240]   It's a series of articles about places that are famous in geek history.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.360]   Did you visit all of those places?
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.240]   A lot of them, not all of them.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.800]   128 of them, fittingly.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.640]   Yeah, 128 places.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.760]   When I got the idea for the book, I actually just went on Amazon because I wanted to buy
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.760]   that book.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.720]   I thought it must already exist.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.440]   And then when I found out it didn't, I wrote down a list of about 70 places where I'd already
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.840]   been.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.040]   And then I started researching the additional number to make it up to 128.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.200]   Wow, that's cool.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.920]   And like any good open source programmer, you scratched your own itch.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.400]   You wrote the book.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   Yes, basically.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.160]   It's like, well, somebody's got to write it, so I guess I will.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.240]   Among the places you visit, of course, Bletchley Park.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.040]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.640]   This is where this was the top secret installation that the British government set up to crack
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.640]   enigma.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.880]   I'm sure it had other roles as well, is where Ultra was, right?
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:15.520]   Well, I mean, the thing about Bletchley Park is it was a location owned by the British
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.800]   Secret Service just before the Second World War.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.080]   And it became the place that was used to break basically as many as possible of the Nazi
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.440]   German and Italian and Japanese codes during the Second World War.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.960]   Something there was that where you learned about Alan Turing?
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.480]   Actually, funnily enough, I learned about Alan Turing when I was very young.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.880]   My parents sent me to a thing at Cambridge University when I was quite a young kid.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.000]   It was for bright kids to go and have fun in the summer.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.520]   And I went up to a man there who was probably a professor at Cambridge University and said,
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.040]   so how does a computer work?
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.200]   So this is talking in the 70s.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.600]   And this man said, well, this is a thing called a cheering machine.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.040]   And he drew a piece of paper, a Turing machine.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.800]   And he just basically told me the fundamental underpinnings of computer science as a young
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.800]   kid.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.960]   And I was fascinated by the idea of this tape that goes back and forth.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.480]   If anyone's read about Turing machines, it's mechanical.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.120]   So I'd known about Turing forever.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.520]   And then of course I studied computer science and I studied cryptography.
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.120]   So Alan Turing was a man who I'd known quite a lot about for a while.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.680]   In 1999, Time Magazine named it one of the most important people of the 20th century
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.720]   because of his role creating the modern computer.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.080]   Although he never was able to build one, I don't think.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.200]   Well, actually after the Second World War, he worked at what's called the National Physical
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:45.640]   Laboratory in Britain on something called the ACE, which was a computer, as we would
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.440]   now recognize it.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:52.720]   Ironically, one of the problems was during the Second World War, he had worked on some
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.440]   part of a thing called Colossus.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.320]   He wasn't the main person on it, but he was well aware of Colossus.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.640]   And that was a valve-based special purpose computer built at Bletchley Park.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.640]   For Americans?
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.520]   Are you going to an American audience?
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.520]   Valves are vacuum tubes.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.400]   Yeah, sorry, vacuum tubes for the American audience.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.520]   And yes, funny, it puts you in translation.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.200]   A valve is a very different thing in America.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.200]   A valve-based...
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.200]   Very true.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.200]   A valve is actually a valve.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.200]   It's actually a valve.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.200]   But it's also actually a valve in the UK.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.200]   Oh, so you have both?
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.200]   Okay.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.160]   Yeah, so you had total confusion.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:29.720]   But anyway, Turing said, "We could actually make a computer using vacuum tubes valves
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.080]   and designed it."
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.240]   And he was almost poo-pooed because he said, "No, no, that'll never work."
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.320]   But of course, during the Second World War, he'd seen something related work, but he couldn't
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.680]   tell anybody because it was a big secret.
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.680]   So he was sort of stuck with this, and then I'm pretty sure it would work.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.880]   Yeah, you should try it, guys.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:46.880]   Try it out.
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.880]   It might work.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:54.840]   So obviously other computers did get built using vacuum tubes, and it did turn out they
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.840]   worked.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:00.600]   Now, the great tragedy, I mean, Turing, of course, helped crack the Enigma code.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.400]   He was a national hero, really.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:08.320]   But the great tragedy, he was gay, which was, of course, illegal and considered to be a
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.320]   mental illness in his life.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.320]   Right.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.960]   And we also know the so few British gay men.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:18.920]   It was so rare that the government went after him.
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.320]   In fact, this is really sad.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.960]   They prosecuted him in 1952 and gave him a choice.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:26.960]   What was that choice?
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.960]   Right.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:28.960]   They gave him a choice.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:35.000]   He could either go to prison, which was the normal punishment for essentially being caught
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   being gay.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.560]   And of course, that's what happened to Oscar Wilde, not exactly the same law.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.240]   He got two years of hard labor.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:46.920]   And Turing was given the choice of either that, or he could try a sort of experimental cure
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:52.640]   thing for homosexuality, which was to be injected with female hormones, which would, the idea
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:57.880]   was it would kill his libido, which of course it did, and would sort of stop him being gay
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.240]   by curing him.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.600]   Unfortunately, he did agree to it, and then he grew breasts because of it and had a major
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.840]   effect on him mentally and physically.
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.160]   He killed himself just a couple of years later.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.160]   Right.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.680]   And then two years later, he killed himself by eating an apple that had been dipped in cyanide.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:23.520]   It's really kind of an unfortunate chapter in British history.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.840]   But John, I like it because you decided to do something about it.
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.520]   Tell us that story.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:33.480]   Well, this is one of these stories that's always upset me because it's like basically,
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:38.200]   if you look at the timing, the Second World War ended in '45, seven years later Turing
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.240]   was arrested.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.800]   And nine years after the end of the Second World War, he was dead.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:49.480]   And then only 12 years after he was dead, what he had done was no longer illegal.
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.000]   I being gay was no longer illegal in 1967.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.440]   And so this is this awful thing where you've got this man who's an absolute genius, and
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.200]   then he basically, we essentially make him kill himself.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.360]   And it's always annoyed me.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.240]   And then for some reason this year on Turing's birthday, which is June the 23rd, I just got
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.440]   really, really mad about it.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.560]   And I put this blog posting off my blog and said, you know what?
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.800]   British government ought to apologize to Alan Turing about this, something ought to happen
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.680]   officially.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:20.880]   And the next day after some comments came in, I thought, you know, actually what I'm going
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.760]   to do is I'm going to start a petition to the British government.
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:30.040]   It's quite a long tradition in Britain of directly petitioning the Prime Minister.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:34.800]   People go and gather all these signatures and they deposit this big pile of paper on the
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.200]   doorstep of number 10 Downing Street where the Prime Minister lives.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:43.360]   And there's actually a web 2-0 version of that, which is E petitions run by the government.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:48.600]   And so that night on the 24th of June, I then signed up for a petition to say we ought to
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.560]   apologize for this treatment of Alan Turing.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:56.240]   And about a month later, a little bit over a month later, on August the 4th, that petition
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.320]   became public so people could sign it.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:04.960]   And what happened over the next 37 days was through my effort and through a lot of people
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:11.480]   tweeting and also other things happening, 31,000 people signed that petition.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:16.320]   And Thursday night on September the 10th, I got a call on my mobile phone from the Prime
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.320]   Minister.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.320]   Wow.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.320]   Gordon Brown called you.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.320]   He just called you.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.840]   Well, he didn't call me directly.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:29.000]   What happened was I had the flu and I'd been at home and I hadn't been looking at my email.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   And on the Thursday night, I thought, I've got to look at my email because of a work thing
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   tomorrow.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.400]   I had to tell someone to do something.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:40.120]   So I log into my email and there's this email that says, please urgently call number 10
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.000]   Downing Street, read your petition.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.520]   So, you know, I looked at the number and I called and I was put straight through to somebody
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.520]   in number 10 Downing Street who said, well, we're actually going to make this apology.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.760]   It's going to happen.
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.400]   We think it's a great thing.
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:13:00.160]   And in about an hour, it's going to be made public and, you know, they read the apology
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.560]   to me to give me an idea of what they were going to say.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:07.000]   And I was completely blown away because if you read the apology, there's no nuance to
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.480]   it at all, which of course is always a worry with anything that's political.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.840]   And then this woman says to me, Gordon would like a word with you.
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:17.840]   Wow.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.960]   So I was at that point, my heart started beating and about 10 minutes later, my mobile phone
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.160]   rang.
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.680]   And she says to me again, well, I've got Gordon for you and hands him the phone.
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.680]   What did he say?
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:33.400]   So that was, well, he sort of things you might expect.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:38.080]   He thanked me for bringing up this petition, you know, making getting so many people to
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.080]   sign it.
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:43.280]   He said he thought it was very public spirited of me to go off and do this.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:47.880]   He taught for a while about how he hadn't really realized the story of Alan Turing, you
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:52.200]   know, hadn't really seen, you know, what happened at the end of his life.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.320]   And he thought it was a wonderful opportunity to talk about that.
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.200]   And he also links it, of course, with all the other people who were prosecuted under
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.200]   these laws.
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:03.960]   So if you look in the, in the apology, he talks about the probably about 100,000 other people
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.520]   who had been prosecuted over the years.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.760]   So he just, you know, it's just an amazing thing that he suddenly came out with this
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.760]   apology.
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.760]   I was in it for the long haul.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.440]   I thought, you know, I've got 31,000.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:19.240]   I was trying to get to the number one spot on the, on the website because I was number
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.320]   five fifth most popular petition.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.200]   So it all happened rather quickly.
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.480]   It was a rather amazing month, actually, because there was a lot of things going on
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:31.760]   behind the scenes to get that number up there.
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:36.920]   Did you start the petition with the hopes that it would actually get through or was
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:41.480]   that just, you know, something to do because you thought it was the right thing to do without
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.920]   any, you know, hopes that it actually happened?
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:50.680]   I really hoped it would happen because I really thought it was just an awful story.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.720]   And every time I think about Alan Turing, I'd suddenly get angry about it again.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.720]   I think this was terrible.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.320]   It shouldn't have happened.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:00.040]   But if you read my blog, I said quite clearly, God, I don't think I'll get 500 people to
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:04.800]   sign this, you know, he's known, he's known, of course, to computer people Alan Turing,
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:09.680]   but he's not well, wasn't well known, in my opinion, by the general public.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.680]   So I was pretty blown away.
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:14.400]   Actually, I was pretty blown away once I got to 5,000 signatures.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:18.960]   And then on August the 31st, the BBC wrote a story about it.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:24.160]   And that really blew it up because that night I had gone to bed feeling pretty happy about
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.160]   5,000 signatures.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.000]   And at some time later on in the day, I punched up on my iPhone, the petition website, and
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.920]   there were 16,000 signatures.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:38.120]   And if you look on the story I wrote for a Riley about it, there's this incredible graph
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.440]   where you can see the effect of certain news organizations.
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:45.200]   And there's this almost vertical jump in the number of signatures when the BBC spoke about
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.200]   it.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.200]   Yeah.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.200]   Yeah, obviously touched a nurse.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.200]   Yeah, it obviously touched a nurse.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.280]   Bam, it just goes up low.
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.840]   That's the power of the bead.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:59.680]   I have to say Gordon Brown, who's not notorious for his eloquence, is really quite eloquent
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.000]   in this apology.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.760]   He says, Alan and the millions, Alan and the many thousands of other gay men who were convicted
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:10.680]   as he was convicted under homophobic laws were treated terribly.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.040]   Over the years, millions more lived in fear of conviction.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.480]   I'm proud that these days are gone.
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.600]   In the last 12 years, this government has done so much to make life fairer and more
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.760]   equal for our LGBT community.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.040]   This recognition of Alan's status is one of Britain's most famous victims of homophobia
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.320]   as another step towards equality and long overdue.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.760]   Have they ever apologized to Oscar Wilde?
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:30.760]   No.
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.040]   Maybe we should start another petition.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.240]   He'd be another one, he'd be number two.
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.160]   He says, I'm going to do another one.
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.160]   There was a lot of work.
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.160]   I bet.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.320]   After the British government, we should start petitions.
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.600]   I want that system in France.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.440]   It's a wonderful thing.
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.440]   It's a wonderful thing.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.440]   It's a really cool thing.
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:53.280]   The really cool thing is that all the code for that petitions website is open source.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.560]   You can just go download it.
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.240]   We can set up our own petitions website.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.960]   In the US here, we just take the code.
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:00.960]   Then look at that.
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.760]   You can look under the fact that you're coming.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.680]   I think I needed an apology from David Paul.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.680]   Let's start.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:09.120]   Can we have the Prime Minister give you that apology?
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:12.160]   It's really an eloquent apology.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.320]   It's actually quite moving at the end.
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:17.600]   He says, on behalf of the British government and those who live freely, thanks to Alan's
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.840]   work, I'm very proud to say, we're sorry.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:20.840]   You deserve so much better.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:21.840]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:30.400]   Even when he was on the phone with me, he was really quite clearly moved by the story
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.440]   and happy to be talking about it.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.480]   Well, John, thank you for doing that.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.240]   I think it's wonderful that you did that.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:41.200]   It brought a lot of attention to a guy who is very important to our industry and to a
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.720]   grave injustice that was done to him.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.720]   I think in a number of ways you've done a really great thing.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.880]   Well, let's get in some publicity for this book.
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.680]   Tell us about some of these places that you've been--
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:50.680]   Oh, it's so cool.
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.680]   I have a copy here.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.680]   You've got to look at this book.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.480]   Yeah, well, I'm looking at what I have online, but you have a copy.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.880]   Let me get a copy, right?
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.880]   Go ahead, John.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.120]   What's some of the places?
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:03.760]   I mean, it'd be kind of a challenge for people to come up with places that you left out because
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.280]   you actually have a lot of places to do that I didn't think about.
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.280]   Let me grab the book.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.080]   The book is right behind me up here.
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.080]   Here.
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.080]   See, you were looking for it.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.080]   Oh, hold on.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.080]   This is the geek out list.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.760]   I'm guessing a couple that you might have left out.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.680]   I can try as a game.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.680]   Go on.
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.680]   Go ahead.
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.680]   Well, how about Area 51?
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.680]   Do you have that one in there?
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.680]   No.
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.680]   Because it's not--
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.680]   Because it's not in there.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:25.680]   Area 51 was not.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.680]   Okay, good.
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.680]   I got one.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.680]   I thought it was.
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.680]   How about Cape Canaveral?
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.680]   No.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:31.680]   Yeah, of course Cape Canaveral.
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.680]   Okay, okay.
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.240]   Wait, Alamogordo, New Mexico.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.240]   That's a good one.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.960]   The testing range.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.760]   Is that where the sound of--
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.440]   Well, they sent some rockets up in the name--
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.440]   Alamogordo, yeah.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.720]   There's a couple of things--
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.200]   I'm sorry, the Werner von Braun kind of--
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.200]   Right, right.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.200]   No.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.200]   White Sands Missile Range.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.200]   White Sands is in there.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.200]   White Sands is good.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.200]   That's pretty good.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.200]   What about Vandenberg?
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.200]   No, I didn't have Vandenberg.
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.480]   There's one of the problems with the US sites.
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:03.520]   There's a lot of military and NASA sites, and so you get lots of overlap.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.360]   So in the end, I had to cut views.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.440]   So if you look at the NASA ones, there's the Glenn Research Center because they do lots
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.400]   of interesting basic science stuff there.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.600]   And of course, there's Kennedy Space Center.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.480]   But you know, lots of people are written to me and said, "Well, what about Houston?
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.480]   What about, you know--?"
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.520]   Yeah, no, I mean, that's what you're going to get, obviously.
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.920]   But those are places that I think would be cool to visit.
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.920]   Oh, they are.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:24.920]   They are.
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.920]   The skunk works at Lockheed.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:27.920]   You know, you can't get in.
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:33.560]   Funny that, actually, I wrote to them and asked them if there were ever any public visits.
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:38.320]   And they did have the, you know, the good humor to actually reply to me.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.720]   And probably put me on the no-fly list as well, just for us.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.800]   I'd like to visit your super-secret facility.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.720]   I'm writing a book.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.720]   Gunk works.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.520]   No, I think I brought the book home.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.080]   But, John, it's a beautiful book.
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.080]   It's glossy.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.840]   It really is like a regular, you know, like a travel guide.
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.480]   But with lots of pictures, it really isn't-- you did a nice job.
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:58.480]   I love it.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.040]   Well, people should go buy it then.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.120]   What's itself or where can you get one?
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.120]   Everywhere.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.120]   Oh, where can you get it?
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.120]   Well, it's just, you know, how does it cost?
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.120]   I actually don't know.
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.120]   I'll have to look at the back.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.120]   It says it's $29.99.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.120]   Is it a Riley?
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.120]   It's a Riley, yeah.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.120]   So it's everywhere.
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.120]   Oh, it says--
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.120]   So it's everywhere.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.760]   John says, oh, Riley, oh.
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.760]   You know.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.760]   The rut.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.200]   I was thinking it'd be a random house or something.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.880]   It's, you know, they did a gorgeous job.
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.320]   There's no animals on the front or anything.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.320]   It's a really nice--
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.320]   No, no, there's no animals around here.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.600]   I'll show you the cover one more time in the front.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.600]   It's beautiful.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.600]   Look at it.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:31.600]   It's seen lots of pictures.
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:35.240]   It's got Darwin and Mary Curie and various other people on the front cover.
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.240]   So--
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.240]   What was your--
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:41.440]   Give us one of your favorite places and then we'll move on to the news of the week.
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:46.160]   The one that's most unusual, I think, in the US is probably Experimental Breedery Act
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.040]   2.1, which is in Arco, Idaho.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.560]   And the best thing about that, I was a breedery actor, obviously.
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:57.240]   But in the parking lot outside, there are two nuclear aircraft engines.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:00.280]   The US had this idea that they were going to use nuclear reactors.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.680]   Yeah, I remember that big.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.680]   Terrible idea.
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.680]   I remember making that concept.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.680]   That's such an awful idea.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.680]   Yeah, well, they were even talking about putting in cars with--
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.680]   Sure.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.240]   But you know, as long as the oil crisis continues, it may happen.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.240]   A little car with it.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:18.400]   As long as the plane didn't crash or, you know, get the crew back alive or anything like
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.600]   that, then it was pretty much fine, you know.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:25.440]   But the engines are worth kind of looking at because they are simply this sort of completely
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.440]   crazy contraption.
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.880]   You know, here's a nuclear reactor, here's half a jet engine.
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.480]   And it seems like the size of a small house.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.680]   And you've got to say to yourself, how big was the aircraft that was going to go in?
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:39.080]   Well, the answer is pretty freaking big.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.400]   The runway was going to have to be miles long.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.400]   Oh, dear.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.400]   Oh.
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.400]   It's like a three-layer.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.400]   It's like a three-layer.
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.840]   We're going to talk tech news in just a bit.
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.120]   The book, again, would just give you another plug.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.720]   And I know it's really late in the UK.
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:56.200]   So if you start to pass out, you can go to bed and we'll just leave.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.200]   I'll get a pillow.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.960]   You can get a pillow for yourself.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:02.360]   But we are going to cover the tech news, all of it in just a little bit.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.360]   Before we do that, I do want to mention our friends at GoToMeeting.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:11.120]   I'm going to send you to gotomeeting.com/twit so you can get that great deal on the best
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.480]   meeting software in the world.
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:17.800]   Our friends at Citrix, our big sponsors of the show, and we thank them so much for
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.720]   all the support.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.520]   And one way you could support us is by taking a look at GoToMeeting.
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:27.160]   Now, we've arranged a 30-day free trial so you can see if it'll help you with what you...
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.640]   Let me give you an idea of what GoToMeeting is.
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.480]   It's a very affordable way to meet with clients and colleagues.
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:36.960]   I think we all have decided that travel is kind of not in the picture these days.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.440]   It's awfully expensive.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:43.000]   American Express says, "The average cost of a business trip is what would you guess?
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   $1,000."
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   That's low.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.680]   I would have thought more.
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:47.680]   Yeah.
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.760]   I mean, businesses that include business trips across town and stuff, but pretty serious
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:52.760]   costs.
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.600]   $49 a month as many meetings as you want.
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.560]   And these are, I have to say, effective.
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.360]   We use them on the shows.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:05.320]   We use them all the time in meeting with other people because it is a very engaging, effective
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.320]   way to meet.
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.560]   You know, conference calls are a snooze, but this way you're seeing something.
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:10.600]   It's visual.
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.600]   You can collaborate.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.520]   I can give you control of my computer, so it's great for training.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.640]   You can actually, while we're having a go to meeting, give me control of your computer
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:22.600]   as a meeting, it's completely flexible that way.
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:23.600]   Very easy to install.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.280]   If you go to go to meeting.com/twit right now, you'll have it installed in just a couple
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.280]   of minutes.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:32.240]   Set up that account, but make sure you use that site so we get credit for that.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.600]   You can try it free for 30 days.
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.480]   I think you're going to find a lot of uses for it.
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.480]   Highly recommended.
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:41.760]   Tell the boss and your colleagues and your clients, go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.360]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:47.440]   Have this week in tech.
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:52.520]   Once again with us, John C. Devorek from Channel Devorek, also here for the first time.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:57.520]   I'm very glad to have him, Patrick Bejaw from the Philius Club and other podcasts in
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:58.520]   France.
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.920]   Where are you in Paris, Patrick?
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.560]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.800]   I think France is pretty much Paris.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.160]   There's no other city.
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.760]   Apparhesion would say, right?
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:07.760]   Apparhesion would say that.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.360]   I know it's not true because my daughter was in Ren for a year or less.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.400]   First time I went to France, it was years ago.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.680]   I didn't know what I was down at Bordeaux.
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.680]   People kept running me off the road and giving me the finger.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.680]   I kept saying, "Hey Americans."
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:23.080]   The guy says, "No, you're driving around a car with Paris plates."
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:26.160]   They thought you were Parisian.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.160]   Really?
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.160]   Is that true?
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.160]   I'm telling you, it's a fact.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.480]   It's very interesting.
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.480]   It does happen sometimes.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.560]   By the way, can you move a camera and show that dog?
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.440]   You actually have a giant bookshelf in here.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:42.840]   In the bookshelf, within the bookshelf itself, the dog sleeps.
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:43.840]   Isn't that nice?
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:44.840]   It does.
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:45.840]   It'll cozy the little tin for him.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.200]   The dog sleeps within the bookshelf.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.240]   That's our spy code.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:52.240]   If you meet John at an airport, you say, "The dog sleeps."
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.920]   He goes, "Within the bookshelf."
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:54.920]   Then you'll know.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:55.920]   Then we know.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:56.920]   Then you know.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.600]   Stories, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:02.040]   There's some really big stories this week.
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:07.840]   The Department of Justice filed its brief in the ongoing Google Book Search settlement
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:08.840]   issue.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:14.120]   In about a month, a judge is going to decide whether to let this settlement go through.
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:17.520]   The Department of Justice said some interesting things.
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:22.520]   One thing it said that I thought I was glad to hear him say is that allowing Google to
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:30.000]   scan in the works of the world, even ones currently in copyright, is of benefit.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.360]   However, they said, "We don't want you to reinvent copyright law with this settlement."
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.800]   We think that's possibly what it's going to do.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.480]   We want you to make sure you consider visually impaired people.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.600]   The full access is important.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:47.040]   We also think that the data has to be open in a variety of ways.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:52.240]   A lot of criticism on this data because Google has asserted the rights to sell it to own
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:53.240]   it.
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.600]   They say, "We'll scan it, but we'll get to keep it."
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:00.480]   Also, Google has been criticized for potential privacy issues.
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.720]   Everybody would know what you're reading in Google.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.880]   We trust Google with a lot of information about us.
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.880]   I'm not sure that's it.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:10.640]   Anybody actually run this thing down in any meaningful way that makes sense because every
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:14.640]   time I read these stories, it's all a lot of vagaries.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.000]   People are moaning and groaning about what Google's up to.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.920]   I'll give you an example.
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.200]   There's a guy named Jeffrey Nunberg.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.360]   I love him.
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:24.520]   He's a regular contributor on NPR's Fresh Air.
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.520]   He's a linguist.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.520]   I think he's at Stanford.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.520]   Maybe he's at Cal.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.880]   He's in the Bay Area.
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.720]   He said, "You've got to look at the metadata that Google's recording on this stuff.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.720]   It's worthless.
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.800]   This stuff is worthless for research.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:42.040]   Google's attributing the year 1899 to half the books just randomly.
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.760]   He's got a long list of metadata issues.
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:45.960]   That's one.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:46.960]   The privacy complaint.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.680]   You're always going to hear about that whenever Google's involved.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.680]   What are they doing?
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.720]   What are they keeping our information?
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:55.840]   I don't think that's a red herring.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:01.560]   I do think that the biggest issue is that Google seems to want to control these orphan
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:02.560]   works.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.760]   They can't scan them.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:11.120]   They have the right because they've paid to this fund to resell them, to use them in
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.120]   various ways.
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.160]   I think that that's something that's concerning to a lot of people.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.640]   I think there's some legitimate concerns about it.
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:20.280]   I think there are two, but I've never seen a really good breakdown.
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.280]   You know what I mean?
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.880]   I think you should read the DOJ's brief, actually.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:28.400]   I thought it was surprisingly good and not particularly legalistic.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.360]   Danny Sullivan has a good breakdown and analysis of it.
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:35.000]   I'll link on his search engine land to the full PDF.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Okay.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.560]   Well, make sure to read that before the next show.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:42.960]   It says the United States is committed to working with the parties constructively.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:49.480]   I think the DOJ is saying we want to support this going forward, but we just think that
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:52.960]   they say the inaccessibility of many works due to the lack of clarity about copyright
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:58.160]   ownership and copyright status is a matter of public, not merely private concern.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.160]   Yeah, it is.
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.360]   I think it's a huge deal.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.360]   Yeah.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:07.600]   It is a big deal, but the real problem is everyone is having problems with Google doing this,
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.760]   but really Google shouldn't be doing this.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:13.480]   I mean, they're only doing it because no one else came in and did it before.
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.480]   I agree.
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:18.800]   They'd be waiting and waiting and waiting and where is it maybe even the government
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.600]   should have done it or.
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.880]   I think it's clear now that nobody's going to do it.
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.160]   Google has been doing this for five years.
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.320]   They have a huge head start.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.040]   They've done millions of volumes.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.840]   Microsoft started it last year and abandoned their book.
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.360]   They started in 2006.
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:36.160]   Google, I believe, started in 2004, a group of Microsoft two years later and then they
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.160]   abandoned it.
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.920]   And then they said, "I don't know why."
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:43.560]   Now, the thing, I agree with this, that why is Google having to do this?
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:47.680]   Because I remember in the 1980s when computers were really getting ahead of steam and people
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:49.480]   were talking about these issues.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:52.920]   And the big concept was everything's going to be digitized.
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:56.120]   All the books in the world will be digitized the entire Library of Congress is going to
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:00.600]   be digitized and we're going to have information at our fingertips kind of thing before the
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.600]   internet came along.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.800]   That was the buzzword.
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:07.440]   And meanwhile, so Google, nobody does it, like you said, and then Google starts doing
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.640]   it and everybody starts complaining about it.
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:13.680]   Eric Schmidt said, "I'm open to a better solution.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:17.440]   You'll recall we had our solution and we were sued over it.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:22.200]   And then we had a God knows how many years of negotiations with 27 parties and we've
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.920]   actually produced a deal."
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:27.440]   This is quoted by Danny Sullivan again in search engine land.
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.520]   We shouldn't be sued in the first place.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:33.720]   In fact, a lot of people said that Google was doing his fair use.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:36.280]   They weren't scanning to publish.
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:40.720]   They were scanning to index and then they would put an excerpt on if you search for the...
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.720]   Yeah.
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.720]   So that's kind of what they do with the websites, right?
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:44.720]   Yeah, but they...
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.720]   Is it so different?
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.720]   Well, the different...
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:47.720]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.920]   I mean, this is what makes it weird.
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:56.200]   A website is...you presuppose that when a website exists, it's there to be scanned, it's there
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.440]   to be accessed, it's there to be linked to.
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:00.800]   There's a bunch of givens with websites.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:04.680]   But books that are published, there were newsletters or newspapers or magazines, are
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.280]   meant to be distributed only by the print medium.
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:10.520]   There was never any assumption that they were going to be scanned and then show up on the
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:11.600]   Internet.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.440]   So I'm not absolutely sure that argument's valid.
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:19.880]   BFF worried about privacy, of course.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.520]   Well, I mean, hey, good.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:22.680]   Somebody's watching this.
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.240]   So Patrick, what is the attitude?
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:30.840]   A lot of the critique of this has come from the EU because I think there's just...
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:35.280]   I get the sense that there's this kind of an anti-American corporate sentiment in the
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.320]   EU in general.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:41.280]   Microsoft's not much beloved nor is Google.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.880]   What is the sense in France?
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.200]   What do you hear from people about this?
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.400]   Oh, we lost Patrick.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.400]   Patrick, you're muted.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.400]   Hello, Patrick.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.400]   That's okay.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.400]   Go ahead.
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.400]   You're good.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.400]   My back?
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.400]   Okay.
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.400]   Sorry.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.760]   Yeah, I feel like, you know, there's really...we're really behind in that field.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:07.240]   We don't have any...we're not worrying about digitizing books yet.
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.280]   It's really not something that we care about.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:12.920]   So we really don't have an opinion about it.
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:17.960]   Don't you think this is, as John said, a huge...I mean, this is what we always wanted, is everything
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:22.480]   that is known, available for searchants and scan and find online?
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:28.120]   Yeah, I personally think it's very important and definitely it should be done.
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.120]   It's too late.
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.640]   Well, not too late, but it's definitely time.
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:35.000]   And the real fault is on the industry, which hasn't modernized enough.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:41.440]   It's the same way Apple came in with iTunes to force people from the music industry to
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.680]   get with the times.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.680]   And that's definitely something that should be done.
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:48.360]   And we want to have everything at our fingertips.
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:58.080]   But in Google's with the orphan works issue, the problem is that they are appropriating
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.240]   these works for themselves, isn't it?
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:05.520]   Can someone else then go and digitize these books and use them also?
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:07.760]   That's the main concern.
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:08.760]   You can.
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.600]   Do you have to do the whole process?
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.200]   Don't I Google it?
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.560]   If Google grabs one of these books, and Microsoft grabbed a lot of books, in fact, a lot of
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:20.320]   them are...you know, you can turn into books because they gave, released everything to
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.320]   the public domain.
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:26.400]   But essentially what Google's doing is that they actually own a copyright in some sense
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.880]   to the scan itself.
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:28.880]   They don't own the books.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.400]   Say it's even a public domain book from 1910.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.680]   They scan it in and they now own the scan.
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:35.680]   They don't own the book.
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:36.680]   They don't own the words.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:37.680]   They own the scan.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:40.240]   And what you'd have to do, if you wanted to say you wanted to republish the book for some
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:46.040]   reason or make it a part of a collection, you'd have to either scan it yourself or find
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.560]   some way to extract the scan from the Google scan.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:52.400]   But in fact, you know, there may even be codes in there to catch people doing that.
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:55.440]   I don't think they'd go that far, but I can imagine it being possible.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:03.040]   So both Germany and France have filed briefs to the judge to this court against it, saying
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.000]   it would essentially create a monopoly for Google.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   That's what their concern is.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Now there is...
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   I found on...
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.880]   I'm an only in the sense that they'll have more books than anybody else.
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:12.880]   Because they've done it.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:13.880]   That's right.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.880]   But you can still sit down tomorrow and scan in 500 books and you got your little collection.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.600]   You could distribute.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:20.600]   There was a...
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.160]   I had an interesting problem with this.
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:27.440]   And when I was writing my book, which is that I wanted to include a diagram drawn by Charles
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:32.400]   Darwin in one of his notebooks, the famous diagram of the Tree of Life.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.320]   And that is definitely out of copyright.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.320]   Darwin's death...
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:41.440]   My mother made a hooked rug of that, as a matter of fact.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.840]   So that's a gift from my family andologist father.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:44.840]   I have it.
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:45.840]   You have it.
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:48.560]   That explains it all.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:51.520]   So that diagram is actually in Cambridge University.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.160]   They have the original.
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:59.360]   To get a high quality scan of that, you have to pay a license fee to Cambridge University.
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.320]   Because what they're licensing is the scan.
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:04.280]   So the claim is that the scanning is a new work.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.280]   Right.
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.440]   They can then buy copyright law to that.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.440]   I agree.
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.440]   And that is actually absolutely true.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.440]   That's reasonable.
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:13.920]   And that's why a lot of museums around the world won't let you take photos of the artwork
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:18.400]   in there because they're selling slides usually of the same artwork in the front.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.520]   Lobby store.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:25.520]   But the fact of the matter is a Monet, for example, typically is in public domain.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:28.160]   And if you wanted to copy it and make another painting that...
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:29.160]   But how would you...
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.400]   Because they won't let you take a picture.
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.680]   Well, the thing is the great museums are not...
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.680]   That's not their business.
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:39.480]   So you go to the museum, the Met in New York, and you can take all the pictures you want.
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.480]   Oh, really?
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:41.480]   But you can't...
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.640]   Yeah, and you can take most great museums unless you take photos.
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:44.640]   But you can't...
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:45.640]   Yeah, I took pictures in the Louvre.
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:46.640]   That's right.
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:50.720]   You can take usually pictures of the special collections that are on loan because the people
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:51.720]   who loan those paintings...
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:52.720]   They want the rights.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:53.720]   They want the rights.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:57.200]   There is a European answer to Google Book Search.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.800]   It's called "Europeana."
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:59.800]   No.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:03.040]   When it went online, it went down.
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:06.040]   Ten million hits in the first week.
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.720]   You think, Patrick, this is not the answer.
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.200]   No, sure.
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:14.960]   I mean, there are efforts, but there are other efforts in the US also.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:19.440]   Google is the only one who is doing this really seriously and really systematically.
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:25.480]   And they are the only ones who can bring the costs down enough that it's feasible on a
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:26.480]   large scale.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.480]   So I think...
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.960]   I don't know.
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.200]   I just don't get what the big deal is.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:36.640]   If they want to go and do it and license it properly and then want to use it, why do
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:40.960]   the people who complain not go and do it instead of complaining?
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:41.960]   Yeah.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:42.960]   That's my ground.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.160]   I think the libraries have...
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:48.640]   The states also have an initiative which is way, way, way behind.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:49.840]   Why not let Google do it?
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.640]   I think this is what's going to happen.
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.360]   I think this is appropriate.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.200]   It's appropriate for the judge to look at this.
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.440]   It's appropriate for these parties to weigh in.
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.520]   Google has not said we won't negotiate.
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.920]   They have not been intransigent.
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.560]   They've been trying to solve this.
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:06.440]   It's appropriate to assert all of these interests and let it work it out with Google if they
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:08.040]   can, if we can.
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.040]   And let them go ahead.
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.520]   I don't think they should have free reign.
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:16.200]   One of the writers unions, not the writers Guild in LA, but the writers union or something.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:19.120]   This is something group out of my camera and which group it is.
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:24.080]   They were moaning and groaning about this to an extreme saying that Google's stealing
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.080]   their copyrights.
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:31.920]   But again, one of the things that we're missing out on here is that most of the books, despite
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:35.480]   the fact they have a lot of new books that have scanned in, are these weird books that
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:36.480]   are out of print?
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.480]   They're out of heaven.
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:38.480]   They're orphaned.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.480]   They're being thrown away.
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.880]   They've mentioned this, by the way.
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:43.960]   The University of California, which has one of the largest libraries in the world, I think
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:48.920]   only second to the third to the Library of Congress and the New York Public Library.
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:53.920]   Those are huge, but UC Berkeley has the other one, the big monster.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:57.760]   You can go over there to a couple of the rooms there and they are selling off lots of
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:02.040]   the books because so many books are still being printed that the collection is out of
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.040]   control.
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.840]   And there's books that are just basically being lost to time.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:11.000]   I mean, there will be no copies of these books available for anyone who wants to do some
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   back research.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.360]   And who knows what valuable products or books are being discarded.
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.640]   I see nothing wrong with any of this personally.
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:22.480]   I think you've let them scan everything in.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:26.160]   You don't worry about it creating some sort of rights for Google or limitations and what
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.640]   you can do.
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.520]   You can always nationalize them.
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.520]   You're a socialist.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:38.480]   Bring in the cops and then get a bus stop without going the French route.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:46.680]   Let them just get it in digitized formed and then we'll worry about what we were going
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:47.680]   to do with it.
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:48.680]   At least get it on the computer.
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.200]   Yeah, don't stop them in other words.
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.200]   Let them keep doing this.
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:56.040]   I mean, I'm actually disappointed that Microsoft crapped out in this deal because they worked
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:00.040]   I think they did about two years with the scans and they did I think 700,000 books or
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.320]   something along those lines.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:06.400]   And I've been a copy most of the University of California and I because I keep working
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.880]   on these perpetual projects that I never finished.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:12.680]   And I was using that Microsoft search because their search was actually superior to the
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:15.040]   Google one for going plowing through books.
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.200]   And I was searching and finding all kinds of interesting things and some things, especially
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:22.800]   in these economics books that were written around in the late 1800s and early 1900s.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.160]   Then I could search them this way.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:27.800]   And I was thinking to myself, at least for this two year period, God, I should go back
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:33.560]   to grad school because I could do research on a thesis or a or a, you know, any sort
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:39.600]   of paper so quickly with really good data and find stuff really fast.
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:41.960]   It would be it just was marvelous.
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:45.160]   But then boom, they decided to just drop it.
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:46.160]   The Google.
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:48.120]   Yeah, you know, I guess I guess.
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.120]   That's the point.
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:53.520]   I don't just want I don't want people to think that I'm a Google fanboy or that I want
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.520]   to defend them.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.520]   I don't want just Google to do this.
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:58.080]   I want Microsoft to do this.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.760]   I want Amazon to do this also.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:05.120]   And I want every government in the world to digitize all their books in their national
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.120]   libraries.
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:07.120]   Right.
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.120]   And I actually all the publishers.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:10.840]   In fact, the publishers were working with John Warnock son for a while with some company.
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.000]   He had a camera with the name of it.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   You might.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.760]   And he was they were sending him all the digital files that because books today, there's
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:23.080]   not a really a book being published today that doesn't have a digital format somewhere
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.600]   along the line in the publishing process.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:29.200]   And so they were giving him stuff, but then he would resell in a digital form in some
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.720]   way that would make them money.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.360]   And I don't know what happened to that initiative.
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:35.360]   But the fact is that everything should, yeah, everything should be digital.
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:41.200]   It should be backed up all kinds of different ways and kept here and there and then be searchable.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:46.080]   So somebody, for example, in Lawrence, Kansas can walk into their little library that's run
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:48.120]   by one of these modern librarians.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:51.920]   And there's many of them who know more about, you know, how to search and find things than
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:55.560]   anybody else and go up to a terminal and be able to get get all the world's great.
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:59.360]   Works and be able to do some research in Lawrence rather than having to be in, you know, some
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:02.120]   big, you know, university somewhere.
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:03.120]   I agree.
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:06.840]   And also these books then become printable with these espresso book machines.
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:09.880]   And I think that'd be fantastic because there are so many books that aren't available.
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:13.200]   You might want to get one copy of in some random place.
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:19.000]   Ironically, that's one of the plaintiffs in this that put together the Gary Reebach Alliance.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.920]   He's of course the attorney that went after Microsoft in 1998.
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:29.960]   He's representing Microsoft and actually he defended Microsoft.
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:31.080]   I shouldn't say went after Microsoft.
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.240]   The DOJ went after Microsoft.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.240]   He's representing Microsoft.
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:43.360]   I think the EFF is in on this Amazon, but it's also the Internet Archive, which is one
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:44.360]   of the groups.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.480]   Bruce J. Kales, the one who was going around with the bookmobile and the instant print
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.160]   thing and trying to get books in people's hands.
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:50.160]   Yeah.
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:51.280]   And Bruce is the one who picked up the Microsoft.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:54.720]   Microsoft people gave their huge collection to the database.
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:55.720]   Right.
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:57.360]   So I'm not sure why, but the search engine's missing.
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.560]   This database is there, but there's no more search engine.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:04.120]   I don't understand frankly why they would fight it, but we'll give them a chance to
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.120]   respond.
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:10.280]   Hey, here's an interesting story that really won't affect you, Patrick, or you, John Graham
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:15.040]   coming because it's a US issue.
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:17.040]   And the US doesn't affect the rest of the world.
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.040]   Well, no, it's related.
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:21.640]   Wait until you hear what I'm about to say and you'll understand.
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:27.000]   You know, we're debating here in the US about healthcare, nationalized healthcare.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:34.760]   And Roger Ebert, who as you know, he had a cancer surgery, lost his voice, went to Medicare,
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:38.680]   asked for a device that would help him talk.
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:45.320]   Medicare's response, he said, they offered me an $8,000 custom device with a tiny little
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.760]   computing power, a small dim screen.
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:52.840]   He says, I tried the built in speech software on my Mac book, found it much more practical.
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:56.880]   It'll read anything aloud, including what I did find on a webpage or an email message.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:57.980]   Several voices are built in.
[00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:59.440]   Others are downloadable.
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:02.120]   I combined talking and web surfing.
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:07.120]   He said, for instance, sharing a news headline with my wife, insurance companies will not,
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:11.880]   the Medicare will not allow him to spend the money on a Mac book because get ready for
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:15.560]   this, it can be used for something else.
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:16.560]   Government.
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:19.400]   So, wait, let me get this story straight.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:22.920]   It can be used for something besides speech synthesis.
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:29.400]   So instead of like the $2,000 for a reasonably decent Mac book, that's no good.
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.560]   $8,000 is okay.
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:33.560]   Okay.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:37.080]   Many users with disabilities, this is from an article on Apple Insider, are barred from
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:42.360]   choosing cheap off-the-shelf technologies by Medicare or private insurance companies who
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:48.880]   insist on only covering far more expensive devices that don't work as well.
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:53.440]   For instance, then the New York Times article about a woman named Carol Lynn, who lost her
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:43:01.080]   voice to ALS, Medicare paid for an $8,000 Windows PC running speech synthesis software,
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:07.680]   the government rules require the PC be disabled from doing anything other than speech in the
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:13.680]   fear that Lynn might benefit from features unrelated to her disability.
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:18.880]   The vendor will, after the insurer pays, the vendor will, if you give him 50 bucks, will
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.320]   reactivate the computer.
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:22.880]   But the government will not...
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:23.880]   Ridiculous.
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:24.880]   The government.
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:25.880]   That is not happening.
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:26.880]   It's not a kind of job.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:27.880]   It's not a kind of job.
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:28.880]   It's not a kind of job.
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:29.880]   It's not a kind of job.
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:30.880]   It's not a kind of job.
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:31.880]   It's a cheap shot.
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:33.880]   I'm sure there's a perfectly good reason.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:34.880]   Oh yeah.
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:35.880]   Oh yeah.
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:36.880]   There's a Frenchman talking.
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.240]   There is a reason why the government would do it.
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:44.000]   Instead of buying this $8,000 computer, she bought herself an iPhone for $300 running
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.400]   a $150 text-to-speech application.
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:47.480]   She says it works better.
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:48.960]   It's portable.
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.200]   And I don't care if it's not insured.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:53.680]   I don't want the $8,000 broken computer.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.240]   All right.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:44:04.800]   There's always, you can always frame, they have to have rules and special sets where
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:07.200]   they can accept some things and not some others.
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:14.280]   And you take one example where it doesn't make sense at all and then make a generalization.
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:16.040]   You're going to be reasonable in all that.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.040]   I don't know.
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:18.040]   It's so fun.
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:22.960]   I'm not a fan of the US healthcare system.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:23.960]   Believe me.
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:29.440]   And more money to get crappier healthcare than basically any other country in the world.
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:33.280]   I've never asked John, who's our resident conservative, where do you stand in the healthcare
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.440]   debate?
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:36.560]   I think that we need a single-payer system.
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:37.560]   I'm with you.
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:38.560]   That's very liberal of you.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:39.560]   Yeah.
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:40.560]   Wow.
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:41.560]   I'm surprised.
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:42.560]   You mean like in France?
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:44.760]   No, the French system right now is one of the best in the world.
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:45.760]   I mean, people always moan about it.
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:47.480]   Oh, the British, the British, the British.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:49.120]   The British go to France.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.720]   Is that true, John Graham coming?
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:53.920]   Actually, this seems to you say that because I've lived in the US, Britain and India.
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:54.920]   In France.
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:56.160]   And I've had healthcare in all of them.
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.160]   There you go.
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.160]   Here's an expert.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.160]   Well, an expert.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.800]   At least I've sampled all three.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:06.400]   Now, as you have my Lasik surgery in France, and I have to say that the French system for
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:08.960]   me was the best.
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:09.960]   Absolutely no question.
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:10.960]   And it's a tough thing.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:11.960]   In fact, yeah.
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:12.960]   I think it's widely agreed.
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.960]   France and Germany have the best health care.
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:15.960]   Yeah.
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:19.680]   Well, I worked with a group that's involved in the medical system and they told me that,
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:24.200]   you know, France may have the best system, but the way the infrastructure is, the French
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:27.160]   doctors don't make as much money and they're all, they come out of school, they're actually
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:28.240]   trained a different way.
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:34.800]   There's a whole, the entire French health industry infrastructure is so alien to what
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:40.280]   we do here or England or Canada for that matter, that there's no real apples and orange.
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:43.040]   Yeah, but what about those death panels, Patrick Bezier?
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:44.440]   What about those death panels?
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:45.440]   Do you have?
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:46.440]   We have those, of course.
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:47.440]   Oh, okay.
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:49.480]   I mean, there's no way it could work twice as many in England.
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.280]   Actually there was a, I won't get off on too much of a tangent, but there's a very good
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:53.280]   article.
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:54.280]   Yes, we must go.
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:56.760]   Well, it's kind of technology because one of the reasons is so expensive is because
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.760]   it's so highly technical.
[00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:01.760]   It's true because, well, that, a lot of, because they have to do over testing to this one of
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:02.760]   the problems.
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:06.200]   Over testing because of, but you know, there was a great article in the Newsweek where
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:10.280]   he said, nobody can talk about the real truth of it, which is most of this money is spent
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:16.400]   in end of life attempts to keep you alive for a few extra weeks.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:19.920]   Nobody wants it, but it's, but it's, but it's, the doctors feel they must do it.
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:22.200]   And that's really where the expense is.
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.200]   There's a lot of expensive.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.200]   Nobody will talk about it.
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.520]   Nobody wants to talk about anything.
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:26.520]   No, I don't know.
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:30.520]   It's either, you know, the Democrats have their shot and ramen it through.
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:32.560]   And if they can't do it, well, then there you have it.
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:33.560]   They've lost their nerve.
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:34.560]   I guess.
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:38.120]   Hey, here's a good thing the Democrats did for us.
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.120]   Finally, the F C.
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:40.360]   Wait, let me in my pen.
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:42.560]   I'm right this down, John.
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:47.320]   Like this day in date, 407 p.m. on Sunday.
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:53.560]   On Monday, the chairman of the FCC, Julius Jannikowski, will urge rules from the FCC
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:58.840]   requiring internet service providers to protect net neutrality, to treat all traffic on the
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:46:59.840]   internet equally.
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:04.320]   And in fact, it's expected these rules will apply to wireless networks too, which is a
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.920]   really great thing.
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:10.120]   It's expected that he does have the votes on the commission.
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:14.600]   Lead of three out of five is what he needs, a simple majority, to make these be the rules.
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:18.840]   It may be that we will have net neutrality in this country.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:19.840]   That's unbelievable.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:20.840]   How about in France?
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:21.840]   I never have.
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:22.840]   You don't have anything like that.
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:26.680]   In fact, in France, now let's contrast the French.
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:30.240]   I knew it was going to pick on the French for the moment.
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:33.080]   It was going to have to do this.
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:38.400]   But the French National Assembly has passed a draft law that would allow illegal downlaters
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:46.320]   to be thrown off the net, probably the hardest line policy in all of the world.
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:48.160]   It's absolutely ridiculous.
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:52.600]   We've been trying to fight it for a few months now, and they've had a really hard time to
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.560]   pass it.
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:59.440]   But yeah, so to explain to people what it is, it's a three strikes law where if you're
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:06.560]   caught, quote unquote, downloading something illegal three times, first time you get a
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:12.640]   letter from your ISP, second time, same thing, third time you are barred from using the internet
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:20.080]   for two months to a year, and you are on a list that doesn't let anyone provide you
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:22.600]   with internet access.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:26.000]   And nobody in the country would be illegal for them to give you access.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   Yeah, great.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   Exactly.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.800]   And what you're proud of.
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:36.520]   Well, you know, in the defense of the assembly, it's probably American music.
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:39.560]   The companies, movie companies, television companies that have proposed this.
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:40.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:41.560]   Probably.
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:48.480]   And by the way, the way they find that you download illegal material is the commission
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:55.480]   that will bring down the hammer once again, receives anonymous or maybe not anonymous,
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:59.880]   but tips from maybe the music industry.
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:05.080]   So they will say this IP address has downloaded this and this material.
[00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:06.080]   They should be banned.
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:07.080]   Or any process.
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:08.480]   I mean, can you defend yourself?
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:09.480]   Is there?
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:17.120]   So that was the reason for the delay because the constitution constitutional counsel said
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:26.720]   that you couldn't do that kind of condemning.
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:28.760]   Oh, I'm losing my words here.
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:30.000]   You couldn't.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.640]   Sorry.
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:33.040]   It happens to me all the time.
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:34.040]   You couldn't.
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:36.040]   You couldn't.
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:37.040]   There you go.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:40.240]   You couldn't convict someone like this without due process.
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:44.840]   And that was the initial plan, which of course was ludicrous.
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:50.480]   And so now what they're doing is that they are liking this offense to something like
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:52.360]   a speeding ticket.
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:58.000]   So you will have due process but in an accelerated fashion.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   All right.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:04.120]   So it's not just France is doing this because Britain has this thing called digital Britain
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:07.760]   was a report about how we're going to make everything digital and wonderful.
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:12.000]   And part of that was also cutting people off who were persistent file sharers.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.080]   So this has been inspired to British to do something similar.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:19.040]   I think they had something like that in New Zealand too.
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:26.200]   But the real shame in this is that the people who are writing these laws, I remember one
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:30.560]   reaction from one of the people who was behind the law, which was, you know, we lived perfectly
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:32.920]   well before we had the internet.
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:34.920]   There's no need for it.
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:39.320]   Oh, that's you don't really need it.
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:40.320]   It's a luxury.
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.320]   So it's a mini tell.
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:43.320]   What can you have?
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:44.320]   Mini tell.
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:48.920]   So you need it to be for we had the, you know, electricity.
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:49.920]   We've talked about this before.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:50.920]   That's very good.
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:51.920]   No, I think the argument is the same.
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:53.720]   You know, you don't need electricity.
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:54.720]   No.
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:56.520]   In fact, who needs indoor plumbing?
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:57.520]   Really need it.
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:58.720]   You don't need it.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:02.720]   This is asking water for get it too much.
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:03.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:04.720]   So now it's basically passed.
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:10.520]   It needs to be approved by the council again, but it probably will be this time.
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:13.520]   And you think it will?
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:15.120]   It might be because.
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:21.120]   Well, you know, I think there's some pressure being placed in these countries.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:26.640]   I mean, it's no accident that it's England, France and New Zealand by white bow and by
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:30.920]   eventually American copyright interest.
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:34.400]   I think they're probably would like to get a couple of precedents out there, especially
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:35.400]   the white bow people.
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:36.400]   You bet.
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:38.240]   And then bring it over here and see how far it gets.
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:42.040]   Well, I don't know if the white bow treaty calls for something like this, but I, but,
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:46.400]   you know, if you want to be a trade partner, you, you know, you've got to, you know, protect
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:47.640]   other countries, copyrights.
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:52.840]   And this is oftentimes seen as what you have to do to be a trade partner with the, with
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:54.720]   the net neutrality act act.
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:58.720]   I'm sorry, the law that's going to be probably rules.
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:51:59.720]   We call them rules.
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:00.720]   You're a rule.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:01.720]   Okay.
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:06.720]   Does that mean that that the ISPs cannot do deep packet inspection and cannot see what
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:10.000]   you're, you know, restrict on, you know, I imagine they can still do it, but they can't
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   act on it.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:15.720]   So this is what Comcast was accused of was running, you know, software from Canada that
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:20.320]   found out that you were doing BitTorrent and, and, and in terminated that BitTorrent,
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:23.000]   where they throttled you, the throttled you or they terminated it.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.120]   And I know in Canada, it's certainly a big problem.
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:29.640]   And whenever we're on a Skype call with somebody after about an hour, it starts to deteriorate
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:33.160]   because the ISPs up there just say, well, you've had enough.
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:35.080]   That's enough of a brief.
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.080]   Enough.
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:37.080]   Enough.
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:38.080]   Voip for you.
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:43.080]   Well, yeah, I guess as, as important as it is for us in the negative sense of this law
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:46.600]   that which is passed, it's extremely important.
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:50.280]   And the net neutrality one is extremely important.
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:56.840]   And I really want to applaud you guys because I consider you, you know, as part of the American
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:00.040]   people for voting it because it might show us the way.
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:03.160]   It's extremely important rule and it should be voted.
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:04.160]   Yes.
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.200]   Well, there are people that debate that.
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:09.640]   Well, most of the people who don't think that the government should be involved in this,
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:11.320]   that they should let the market bear on.
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.240]   No, no, it's not even that so much.
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:18.280]   There's, there's, I don't know, you know, Andrew Orlowski is the biggest, he is the biggest
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:20.440]   complainer about this of every, of anybody.
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:23.560]   And every once, if you actually listen to him, we should get him on the show even though,
[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:26.760]   to be honest about, he's hard to understand because he's so British.
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:32.040]   But he actually makes a logical argument and it's actually more complicated than that.
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:36.600]   And he, there's other people I've heard that don't like the idea of net, of this net neutrality
[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:38.680]   thing because it's, it's not even just the market.
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:43.760]   It's just the, you know, some, I mean, if I'm paying for paying extra money, I mean, it's
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:45.080]   going to create a situation.
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:49.120]   So I'm paying for the Comcast double speed blah blah blah and I'm going to pay a hundred
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:50.480]   bucks a month for it.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:57.040]   You get half the speed for half the price or let's say, how's that net neutrality?
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:58.840]   This is Orlowski writing in The Guardian.
[00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:03.800]   He says, the UK's most prominent internet engineer, Professor John Krautcroft of Cambridge
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:08.440]   University thinks that activists had imagined a bogus demon.
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:12.720]   Net neutrality is a misdirection, a red herring, he says.
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:17.520]   It's true that we haven't, well, now I gave an example in Canada, but we haven't, I don't
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:22.160]   think we have an example in the US or do we, of discriminating against Google, let's say,
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:23.160]   or Skype or.
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:26.920]   No, I mean, this whole thing began largely because, yeah, I think it was the CEO of AT&T
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:30.160]   who came out shooting his mouth off about stuff he didn't know anything about.
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:33.560]   And says, I don't see why Google should be getting a free ride.
[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:36.560]   Orlowski, Google's not paying for their bandwidth.
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:41.440]   Orlowski quotes Robert Kahn, one of the fathers of the internet who says, the internet has
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:42.440]   never been neutral.
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:44.760]   Oh no, this is Krautcroft talking.
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:48.120]   Without traffic shaping, we won't get the convergence that allows the innovation of TV
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:51.800]   and online games we've seen in data and telephony.
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:55.760]   That's the defense the Comcast uses too, is well, we've got a shape bandwidth.
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:55:00.000]   We've got to keep the bandwidth hogs from stopping everybody else from using the internet
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   in a useful way.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.200]   Yeah, that's a different piece.
[00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:06.720]   You can open up a million pipes up and just bloom, you can bring the whole thing down.
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:09.560]   I didn't think that was the issue of net neutrality.
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:15.480]   I mean, sure, you can do tiered speed and pay more to get more speed.
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:16.480]   That's fine.
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:22.840]   But the real issue with net neutrality is selecting who you allow your users to have access to
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:24.360]   and who you don't allow.
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:27.120]   That's a much deeper, more troubling thought.
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:28.120]   Yeah.
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:29.440]   I'm with you on that.
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:30.440]   Speed, who cares?
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:31.440]   No, I agree with that too.
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:32.440]   We'll get everyone.
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:33.440]   I'd like to get everybody.
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:34.440]   I'd like to get everybody.
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.440]   I'd like to get everybody.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:37.440]   Both sides of this argument because of the orlowski points are interesting.
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:41.000]   But the other points are more logical.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:45.080]   He does make a good point when he says this is a straw man because it hasn't been a problem.
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:46.080]   So now you're making rules.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.080]   Right.
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:48.080]   I agree with that too.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:49.080]   This hasn't been a problem.
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:50.080]   I haven't seen anything.
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.160]   I don't get my Skype choked off.
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:52.320]   It doesn't get cut off.
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:53.320]   Right.
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:58.600]   Niesa, it would be interesting to see an ISP try and cut access to Google and then see
[00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:00.160]   how the market reacted to that.
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:01.680]   Well, this is the problem, at least in the States.
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:06.520]   I imagine it's the same in the UK and France is that there isn't really any competition
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:07.880]   among internet service providers.
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:13.120]   There's a positive potential companies you can work with.
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:14.640]   In France, there is.
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:15.640]   That's not true at all.
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:20.840]   I mean, in the UK and in France, we have much higher bandwidth available.
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:22.440]   There's a lot of competition.
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:27.600]   When I lived in France, I had a 100 megabit connection at home and it was costing tens
[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:29.200]   of euros a month.
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:30.680]   There's tremendous competition.
[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:36.080]   So in France and in England, it's not a government run.
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:38.320]   It's run by private parties for the most part.
[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:39.320]   Absolutely.
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:43.000]   I mean, the process of switching broadband providers at home because I've got it fed
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   up with them.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   How many different companies could you choose from?
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   I have three or six.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   Ten.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   Yes.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   In most of us...
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   You're going to get a...
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.360]   Wait a minute, let me get this straight.
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:57.480]   You can choose from like six providers and you're getting like 100 megabits per second
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:00.080]   and you're paying like 10, 20 bucks a month or 30 bucks.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:03.120]   Wait a minute, you're saying 10 euros, which is about 50 dollars US.
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:04.120]   No, 10 euros.
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:05.120]   It's something like that.
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:06.120]   It's some ridiculous.
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:11.840]   So when I lived in France, I had a choice of one megabit, 20 megabits or 100 megabits.
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:15.600]   And I think the 100 megabits had 20 megabits up, but I...
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:16.600]   Wow.
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:17.960]   I'll take that.
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:20.160]   And it was not expensive because it was...
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:23.840]   I pay $700 a month for nine megabits up and down.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:24.840]   Of course it's...
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:26.000]   Yeah, you're in a dedicated...
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   It's quality line.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   But it's not...
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.880]   I had a 30 euros a month for 30...
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:34.120]   30 down and eight up.
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:37.080]   See, in the States, we generally have a couple of choices.
[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:38.080]   You're going to have a...
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:41.520]   You might, if you're lucky, you have a cable company that's offering internet service.
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:42.960]   Your phone company might be...
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:45.880]   There might be a few independent ISPs on that phone company's line.
[00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:48.080]   Or maybe a fiber provider that may be...
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:49.080]   May be.
[00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:50.080]   Well, it depends.
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:51.080]   If you're out in the suburbs where there's fiber...
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:52.080]   Give Verizon.
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:53.080]   You can get it.
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:55.840]   But usually, most people have two or three choices and not many more.
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:58:01.800]   So that's what makes net neutrality an issue because if you get a couple of people colluding
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:04.440]   saying, "Well, yeah, let's cut back on that YouTube.
[00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:05.440]   It's killing us."
[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:07.600]   Well, either that or if they're just colluding the price.
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:09.320]   Well, they clearly do that.
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:11.080]   Yeah, the prices are too high.
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:12.080]   Way too high.
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:13.480]   It's two different issues, really.
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:15.720]   I don't think we should lump them together.
[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:18.920]   Maybe they are effectively lumped together.
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:23.720]   But pricing is one issue and selecting which content you...
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:25.680]   You throttle is another one.
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:29.560]   Stroll or cut because you were talking about Google just now.
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:31.080]   Google is not going to be the issue.
[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:33.400]   BitTorrent is going to be the issue.
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:34.680]   Well, it depends what your business is.
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:37.080]   If you're a cable company, it's BitTorrent.
[00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:40.120]   If you're a phone company providing the internet access, it's Skype.
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:45.080]   One of the reasons I find this argument is kind of...
[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:49.600]   Maybe I don't care so much about it because we're having so much non-net neutrality now
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:52.200]   that's part of the system.
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:59.240]   For example, and Leo will agree to that when I bring it up, my site, Devorak Uncensored.
[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:03.880]   And the word "uncensored" is blocked all over the country.
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:09.160]   And for no other reason than the word "uncensored" is in the URL or not even in the URL.
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:11.400]   It's just in the header.
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:15.360]   And it's done by these third parties that are filtering systems that are all over the
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:16.360]   place.
[00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:20.040]   They're in libraries, they're in corporations, they're in universities, they're in research
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:21.040]   companies.
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:22.040]   They're everywhere.
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:26.560]   And there's about 25 or 30 of these guys and they block content.
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:29.080]   And where's the laws against this nonsense?
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:32.960]   Well, I thought if you were on the internet, you should be able to see what's on the internet.
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:36.560]   Well, imagine the situation if your last name was coming.
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:38.280]   So, see you in the line.
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:40.040]   Do you get blocked, John?
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:41.240]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:42.240]   I get blocked.
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:46.000]   And I also, famously, Udora would splash up this...
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.320]   Oh, you get the hot pepper.
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:48.320]   The red pepper.
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:49.320]   The red pepper.
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:52.400]   Using disgusting language and emailing this guy.
[00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:55.320]   In fact, how do you get any emails delivered at all?
[00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:56.320]   Really?
[00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:57.320]   You have my email.
[00:59:57.320 --> 00:59:58.320]   It's like being named Freddy Villagra.
[00:59:58.320 --> 00:59:59.320]   I mean, it's not a good...
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:05.160]   It's funny because my whole family at one point had hotmail accounts and hotmail would
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:07.560]   not allow you us to use our actual name.
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:08.560]   Oh, dear.
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:10.560]   So, we all had to fake last names.
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:11.560]   Oh, dear.
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:13.360]   So, we all actually had quite offensive fake last names.
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:15.560]   We just have to get through the filter from the hotmail.
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:16.560]   It's a very large...
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.960]   You know, maybe relay, but there's a very...
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:22.240]   Well, I guess this is Cummings, which is a very large motor manufacturer in the United
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:23.240]   States.
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.560]   They make some of the top diesel engines in the world.
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:28.280]   You know, there's so many things to think of now when you're naming a child.
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:30.280]   You really get a point of interest.
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:33.760]   Well, because, yeah, you know, when it's your last name, it's a bit more difficult,
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:34.920]   but it is a problem.
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:38.320]   And, you know, I do get blocked in some places and it's actually got to the point now where
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:40.480]   it just amuses me because it's so stupid.
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:46.480]   But early on, Google used to serve up pornographic ads if you searched for these.
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.480]   And...
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:50.840]   I actually wrote to Google and asked them to stop it.
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:54.280]   And to their credit, they did do something that that doesn't happen now.
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:55.280]   Oh, wow.
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:58.280]   Yeah, I actually haven't seen much porn on a Google search.
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.280]   I don't think they do search.
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.280]   They don't do that.
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:01.280]   Sell those ads anyway.
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:02.280]   They've done a good job.
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:07.120]   So you write a petition to 10 Downing Street and you get it like a written apology.
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:11.960]   You write to Google and they stop sending you the spam you don't want.
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.000]   How exactly do you worry about these things?
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   I want to know.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   He's British.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   He's British and properly.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.400]   What you do is you ask very, very politely.
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.480]   That's what they say in Britain that works.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:26.000]   I actually published some of the emails I sent to people about the petition on the O'Reilly
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   website.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.760]   And you can, particularly for the BBC because that big hit from the BBC, I just wrote to
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.320]   them and said, "You need to cover this story.
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.880]   It's important."
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:34.880]   And they did.
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.720]   So it's always worth a try.
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:37.880]   Says, "Asking nicely."
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:41.800]   I'm a pretty Nigerian bank scam wrote and tells us.
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:46.720]   All right, we're going to, I want to remind people that you can, we did, you know, I said
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:49.200]   it's briefly last week, but I want to emphasize it.
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.240]   You can now call us.
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:54.480]   We have our own Google voice number and leave a message.
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:56.960]   And I'd like to start incorporating your thoughts into the show.
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.560]   We don't want to leave you out.
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:00.200]   So we have an easy to remember number.
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:03.400]   It's 9513 Twit VM.
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:04.800]   Okay, I lied.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:06.840]   It's not that easy to not remember.
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:10.320]   But that's the number 9513 Twit VM.
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:13.320]   That's 951-389-4886.
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:18.960]   It's one of those cases where the number is actually easier to remember than the letters.
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:23.160]   But do call us, leave us a message and maybe next week we'll be including your message.
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:24.640]   Try to keep it short.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:29.680]   Remember that if you leave us a message, you're giving us permission to use it on the air.
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:33.760]   And we do reserve the right to edit it for clarity and length.
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:36.480]   Isn't that what the New York Times says when you send them?
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:37.480]   Is that what they say?
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:38.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:41.520]   We reserve the right to edit for clarity and length.
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:47.240]   We're going to get back to our great panel, John C. Devorek of channeldevorek.com.
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:50.680]   John Graham coming of GCG.org.
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:52.760]   No, no, JGC.
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:03:01.000]   No, the use of initials in the URL and Patrick Bezha of, what is it, French Spin?
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.840]   Yes, it's really not the easiest name to remember.
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:05.400]   It's a spin.com.
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:06.400]   French Spin.
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.960]   I like it.
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:09.520]   I like it.
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:14.080]   But right now I want to remember our friends from Squarespace who have been very supportive
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:17.240]   of the show and we love Squarespace right back at them.
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:18.240]   Go ahead, John.
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:19.240]   You can just sneak right by.
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:21.480]   He's going to get a little drink of water.
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:22.480]   Take a break.
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:23.840]   You all can if you want.
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:32.840]   Squarespace is the place to go to create your website, whether it's a blog, a photo
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:35.080]   blog, a forum.
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:37.560]   They have a huge variety of templates.
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:38.560]   And boy, is it great.
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:41.840]   Now, I don't want to knock them when they're down.
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:48.040]   But lately, a number of other blogging platforms have had major security issues.
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:52.960]   And that's one of the reasons why running a hosted blog at a place like Squarespace is
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:54.560]   just the right way to do it.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:58.560]   You don't have to worry ever about security.
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:03.320]   You don't have to worry about sudden bandwidth demand because Squarespace, boy, they have
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:09.720]   a very sophisticated technique for keeping the sites up no matter how much traffic you
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:11.400]   get their virtual hosting.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:15.880]   You don't have to know about this, but the virtual hosting that they use is very sophisticated.

[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:21.760]   and fans.

[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.320]   Go to our inside Twit blog.
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:14.800]   That's where we post all of our inside Twit postings.
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:17.280]   They did a great job setting up a wonderful blog for us.
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:21.240]   In fact, that's a good place to go today because we're giving away the ultimate gaming
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:22.240]   machine.
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.800]   Yay, finally.
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:27.320]   And you can win or actually we have the entries already.
[01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:31.040]   So you can't win unless your entry is one of the top 10 we've picked, but we would like
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:32.240]   you to vote.
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:40.120]   So go to inside.twit.tv, read and look at the 10 entries and then you can vote for your
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:43.440]   favorite and we have a couple of weeks I think we're going to end this October 2nd, something
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.840]   like this.
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:49.360]   But we want to give everybody a chance to vote and you can vote by creating a count on
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:54.800]   our, it explains it all there, but you create an account on our Twitter army site and you
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:56.200]   can count your cast your vote there.
[01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:58.080]   But Colleen's got the entry up.
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:59.080]   The entry is up.
[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:00.560]   All the different reasons.
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:01.560]   We asked people.
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:07.480]   What are your top 10 reasons why you of all people should get the ultimate gaming machine
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:08.840]   that we designed last year?
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.960]   Really beautiful, beautiful box.
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.600]   Colleen did a great custom paint job.
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:14.800]   It's custom cooled.
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:18.160]   It's at inside.twit.tv and while you're there, you can really take a look at what you can
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:20.000]   do with a, with a Squarespace blog.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.960]   It's such a, such a nice job.
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:25.960]   Squarespace.com/twit.
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:29.920]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:31.720]   So John have a seat.
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:33.560]   John's back with his beverage.
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:35.320]   Would you like a glass of wine or anything?
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:37.960]   Do you have any, do you have any Bordeaux in the house or something?
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:38.960]   I don't think we have some.
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:39.960]   I think we've gone through all the Bordeaux.
[01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:40.960]   Do you know all or something decent?
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:41.960]   You want a Sinon or Bordeaux?
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:43.960]   I don't think you have any Sinon.
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:46.200]   Is that going to be with the Parisians drinking?
[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:47.920]   That's what, that's what Patrick is drinking.
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:51.160]   Are you drinking any wine today, Patrick?
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:53.080]   Well, it's half past one.
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:54.080]   So not right now.
[01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:57.640]   Half past one should be drinking the army yuck.
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.040]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:00.040]   It's time for Randy.
[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:02.760]   Yeah, that's a good suggestion actually.
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.520]   And two is, stick to the water though.
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:05.520]   It's my first twit.
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:07.360]   You know, maybe it, maybe it probably was.
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:09.760]   In fact, I used to drink and now I realized.
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:10.760]   That's really what I had.
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:11.760]   It was a bad idea.
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.760]   One time I had to hold group half sloshed.
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:15.240]   Everybody was sloshed.
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:16.240]   You know, it's funny.
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:17.440]   We haven't done that.
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:20.440]   I think we did it for a few episodes because we had a wine sponsor and we haven't done
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:23.480]   it since, but we still have the reputation as being a bunch of drugs.
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:25.280]   Well, you know, the woodford is still around, isn't it?
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:27.040]   Or do you guys wipe it out?
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:28.560]   I, I believe it would be there.
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:29.560]   Is that a wine?
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:30.560]   No, that's the bourbon.
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:32.560]   Oh, I, oh, let's see what we have.
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:34.560]   Would you like some bourbon?
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.360]   Well, you know, wait a minute.
[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:37.560]   Oh, yeah, it's right there.
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:39.160]   Oh, no, this is that stuff, right?
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:41.760]   This is the Evan Williams named after the founder of Twitter.
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:42.760]   Right, this is the way.
[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:45.880]   By the way, I just want to say I did apply to Twitter because you, because you, you told
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:50.200]   me where and somebody put a link up where you fill out the form for the verified thing.
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:51.200]   Yeah.
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.960]   And I guess this shouldn't be much of a surprise, but look what happened.
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:57.560]   It says something is technically wrong.
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:58.560]   Yeah.
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:03.760]   It's that shouldn't be, shouldn't be much of a surprise, but I guess I won't be getting
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:05.080]   my verification either.
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:08.200]   No, well, you know, the funny thing is I was thinking about it and you say you don't,
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:13.360]   you know, even Paul who was suckered by the phony, you know, the other one, the phony
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:14.360]   de Vorek.
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:15.360]   The phony de Vorek.
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.880]   I mean, it doesn't say verified on there, but you know, who's to know that is still
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:18.880]   not me?
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:22.000]   I mean, because I, you know, so the, what's good is the verified do?
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.640]   They, if you're, if you don't know about the real, about the real site, they say on
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.320]   here, we can't verify everybody.
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:29.440]   So, you know, don't expect a miracle.
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:30.440]   Yeah.
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:32.160]   No, but they verified there are certain supporters.
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:35.960]   I verify the celebrities, the Oprah's of the world are verified.
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:37.960]   O'Reilly's verified.
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:38.960]   What's this?
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:39.960]   What is he do that so special?
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:40.960]   Yeah.
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:44.840]   I mean, I think you and I, both are probably more famous than O'Reilly.
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:47.240]   Not if you go look at his numbers, he's got over a million.
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:49.560]   Well, that's because he's on the suggested user list.
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:54.680]   Well, so you're, you're kind of telling me here, even though I, I don't think you're,
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:55.680]   you're expressing it properly.
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.400]   So there's a level of corruption.
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:59.400]   That's, that's one way to put it.
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:00.400]   Yes.
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:03.800]   I don't know if there's bribes being handed out or anything like that.
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:07.720]   I want to disassociate myself from this discussion.
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:09.240]   I love Twitter.
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:12.880]   What is your, what is your handle on Twitter, Patrick?
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:13.880]   Not Patrick.
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:14.880]   Really?
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:15.880]   Not because Patrick was taken.
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:16.880]   Yeah.
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:17.880]   Yeah.
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:18.880]   Yeah.
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:19.880]   You know, my, my, well, Patrick was taken.
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:23.720]   So I figured I should find something that's somewhat similar.
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:27.400]   And so I, I started with not Patrick.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:33.040]   And then a few people start, a few people, a few listeners started naming themselves,
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.600]   not their name.
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:38.600]   So there's a few, not someone on Twitter who named this, this.
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:42.360]   But that's confusing because you are Patrick.
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:44.080]   That's the whole genius of it.
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:47.760]   It might be some of my college genius.
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:49.000]   John Graham coming.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.600]   What is your pornographic Twitter handle?
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:53.600]   It's not pornographic.
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:55.600]   It's J Graham C.
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.560]   Oh, there you have it.
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.080]   Would they have let you have coming?
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:00.080]   I wonder.
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:01.080]   I have no idea.
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:03.200]   I mean, I have my real name on there.
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.760]   So they didn't block me from that.
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:08.720]   So what's the, so the chat room, I'm watching a chat room going on with the jokes about
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:10.520]   the basting the meat.
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:11.720]   But just as I go.
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:14.920]   Whenever John gets up during a show, we, we, yeah, it's an old gag.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:15.920]   It goes way back.
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:16.920]   Goes way back.
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:18.280]   Asking what that zipper is doing on your shirt.
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:19.280]   And I'd like to know myself.
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.280]   Yes.
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:21.280]   Here's a zipper.
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:23.040]   In the middle of nowhere on your shirt.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:24.040]   Like in case the L.A.
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:25.040]   Gotta shoulder operation.
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:26.840]   That needs to be been there.
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:31.200]   I could get Arthur's Copic surgery in this shirt without taking it off.
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:32.200]   That's true.
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:33.200]   It is, you know, it's rather prominent.
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:38.360]   I didn't really notice that this is a Scotty vest polo shirt, a twit polo shirt.
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:39.440]   And this you could put you.
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:41.080]   Did you get that shirt free Leo?
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:42.080]   Did you get that shirt?
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:43.080]   I did actually.
[01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:44.080]   You gave it.
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:45.080]   Yeah.
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:46.080]   I got it for free.
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:47.080]   I did.
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:48.080]   Oh, there I did.
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:49.120]   And look, I put my iPod in there.
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:51.480]   Now it looks like I didn't have that shoulder surgery.
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:53.080]   There's a big clunky thing.
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:54.800]   You got like some of my old breast.
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:57.840]   My breast has been flattened and pushed over to the left.
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:58.760]   This is the Allen T.
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:05.640]   You know, I was at the cottage, I think, last year with Nicole and Mark Spagnolo.
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:07.640]   And you gave me a cap.
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:08.640]   Yes.
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.280]   That has a zipper in it as well.
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:11.280]   Yes.
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:12.480]   It has 30.
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:14.160]   You have a zipper inside.
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:16.080]   You have a zipper on the side.
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:18.800]   They own a stock and a zipper.
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:19.800]   I think so.
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:24.440]   No, I love Scotty Vets stuff because that's exactly his ideas, pockets and zippers everywhere.
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.200]   So that's why I have a zipper on my shirt.
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:27.200]   That's all.
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:29.120]   That's a very comfortable shirt.
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.120]   Let's see.
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.120]   News.
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.120]   Hey, there's a thought.
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:33.520]   I can get back to the news.
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:38.520]   The Nissan company is adding blade runner sound effects to their electric cars.
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:40.000]   Yeah, I don't get what that means.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.160]   Well, you know, an electric car so quiet.
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:43.160]   No, no, no.
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:44.160]   It's like.
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:46.160]   It makes it.
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:50.920]   Yeah, I don't, I have to listen back, but I think blade runners cars made a kind of
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:51.920]   a hum.
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:56.080]   Is that the issue of the electric car is not making any noise?
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:57.080]   They're very quiet.
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.080]   You're them coming.
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.080]   That's exactly right.
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:01.440]   People getting run over by electric cars because they're expecting.
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:05.080]   I was in a parking lot and sandwich was going one of those little things came by a scare.
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:06.080]   The crap.
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:08.080]   Where'd you come from?
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:09.080]   Exactly.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:10.080]   Hey, here's the idea.
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.080]   That's just Darwin.
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:14.200]   Darwin isn't a work, you know, eventually we'll kill all the people who don't realize
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:16.520]   there are electric cars around and it'll just be gone.
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:20.840]   I get to Britain and I look to the right and the car's coming from left.
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:22.520]   You know, it takes weeks to get over that.
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:23.600]   Yeah, you look the wrong way.
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:26.240]   You look the wrong way and it even though there's big, you know, they haven't plastered
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:28.160]   all over the street in England.
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:29.160]   Look left.
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:30.160]   Look left.
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:31.160]   No, I'm still the enough.
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:32.160]   You're looking right.
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:35.960]   Yeah, you look right and step into traffic and there's an electric car and you're squished.
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:39.800]   Well, you mean in Amsterdam, you always get hit by bicyclists doing the same thing because
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:42.000]   they're racing around in this.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.320]   And I know it's dangerous.
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:46.720]   They say once they get to do a 20 kilometers an hour, they're going to turn off the electric
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:49.760]   sounds because the cars are more noisy anyway.
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:54.240]   But the slower speeds where they can creep up on you.
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:55.240]   Actually somebody.
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:59.040]   Do you think maybe this is an opportunity for iTunes like ringtones now?
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:00.040]   Cartones.
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:03.040]   That's what I was trying to say.
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:04.040]   There you go.
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:05.040]   We think like cartones.
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:06.040]   We thought good idea.
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:07.040]   We thought good idea.
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:08.040]   Yeah.
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:09.040]   Cartones.
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:12.480]   That's because they can't get any music on their iTunes.
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:16.480]   That's a good one.
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:19.440]   I don't get the air mint noise.
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:20.440]   Yeah.
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:21.440]   Yeah.
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:22.440]   That's still.
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:23.440]   It's that.
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:31.920]   Twenty two states have made texting illegal while you drive.
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:33.800]   I didn't know it was ever legal.
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:34.800]   It's legal.
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:36.320]   Well, it's a loophole, I guess.
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.080]   And California is considering it.
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.200]   However, why would anybody consider it?
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:42.920]   It should just be illegal.
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:52.720]   Many of these states have traffic, traffic updates via Twitter.
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:57.440]   So they're asking that you tweet when you get in a traffic situation.
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:59.240]   Well, this makes no sense.
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:00.240]   However, it is illegal.
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:03.760]   I guess if you're stopped dead on the freeway, that would be a time you could tweet that
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:04.760]   this, you're stopped dead.
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:05.760]   I don't know.
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:06.760]   I don't think so.
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:12.040]   I mean, if you're running around 60 miles an hour, roads clear.
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:15.040]   State transportation officials insist these are not mixed messages.
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:19.280]   The tweets are to be read prior to driving.
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:21.560]   Know before you go.
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:22.560]   Drivers are you ready?
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:24.400]   How do they present it before they...
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:25.400]   Well, yeah.
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:28.720]   We don't want people reading their tweets to send an update.
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:31.280]   This is all done by GPS and things like that, isn't it?
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:32.280]   I think it should be done.
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:34.200]   It's a heads up on the right on the windshield.
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:37.880]   It's just a heads up display that has all the stuff right there and you can drive all
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:38.880]   the things...
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:39.880]   My Facebook feed, my YouTube...
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:41.040]   Just have it all up there.
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.880]   Like the jet pilot has.
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:48.640]   You want that new Motorola Clickphone that has a screen saver, it just floats Twitter
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:50.720]   tweets and stuff past you.
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:51.720]   But you're on the windshield.
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.040]   It should be heads up.
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.720]   I think there is a device, isn't there?
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:57.000]   You could put it on your phone that would project it under the...
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.080]   That'd be cool.
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:00.840]   If it's not been invented, it should be.
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:05.000]   Well, good news, the Supreme Court upheld an order on Friday to reimburse $300 million
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.160]   in overpayments collected from residential phone customers.
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:10.160]   That's the good news.
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:12.160]   The bad news is it was in Canada.
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:15.920]   I don't know, that's part of the British Commonwealth.
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:16.920]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:17.920]   Oh, you're happy.
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:18.920]   Okay, good.
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:20.920]   I'm glad to hear it.
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:23.600]   I'll get the Queen onto you.
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:29.480]   Would you like to buy Gene Roddenbury's old Mac Plus?
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:34.840]   You're on the topic of that Gene Roddenbury gave his Mac Plus apparently which is an '01
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:35.840]   serial number.
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:38.560]   They say it's '01 although apparently it's confusing.
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:40.480]   Yeah, well, yeah, it is confusing.
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:41.480]   Because they upgraded it.
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:43.480]   Now, I don't know.
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:46.280]   Last time you got to see Woz, is he coming much?
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:47.280]   I haven't seen him lately.
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:48.280]   He doesn't answer.
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:50.440]   I'd like to get him up here because I want to come up here with my...
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:54.480]   I have one of the original Macintosh's, not the Plus, the real one.
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:55.480]   The 128?
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:56.480]   Yeah.
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:57.480]   Wow.
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:01.400]   The 128 with no shielding inside so it still has all those autographs inside.
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:02.400]   You know what that right?
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:03.400]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:04.400]   They signed the plastic mold.
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.400]   Yeah, they signed the plastic mold.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:06.400]   All the people on the team, yeah.
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:07.400]   Right.
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:08.400]   I want Woz to...
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.400]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:11.480]   To autograph the outside.
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:12.480]   Because one of those...
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:16.480]   I can't believe there's one of these things showed up on the Antiques Road Show.
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:17.480]   Yeah.
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:18.720]   You know, there's money to be made.
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:20.200]   Did they say there was worth something?
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:21.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:22.200]   Really?
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:23.200]   Oh, he's not saying anything.
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:24.200]   He wants to keep it a secret.
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:25.200]   Just telling you.
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:26.200]   I'm going to talk to Woz.
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:27.200]   We'll get him to come.
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:28.200]   Yeah, we'll get him up here.
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:29.200]   I got the Delta 10 Sharpie.
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:31.200]   We'll supply the Sharpie.
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:32.200]   Sharpie.
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:33.200]   Sharpie.
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:36.200]   And we can use a box of Sharpies if anyone's listening.
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:43.320]   The Auction House Profiles in History is auctioning off a Macintosh Plus given by Apple to Gene
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:44.960]   Rodenberry.
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:48.880]   They say this is the very first Mac plus one megabyte personal computer to come off the
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:50.680]   assembly line.
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:54.920]   It is serial number F 4200NUM0001.
[01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:55.920]   Yeah.
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:58.920]   It sounds like the first one to me.
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:05.160]   Well, apparently they were only planning to make 10,000 because after that you run out
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:06.160]   of numbers.
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:07.400]   You got lots of letters.
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:09.800]   Oh, maybe they were going to use letters too.
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:10.800]   Yeah.
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:15.440]   It's a megabyte of RAM expandable to four megabytes.
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:22.720]   But then, which is kind of weird, the machine was originally a 128 K Mac that was upgraded
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:25.280]   to a Macintosh Apple plus by Apple.
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:27.200]   But you know what they're saying?
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:30.880]   So if you look at the back of it, well, they have a picture of the back of it and it does
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.480]   say M0001 on it.
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:35.480]   It might be legit then.
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:36.480]   Yeah.
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:39.880]   On the other hand, they say they'll only expect to get $8 to $1,200 at it, which would
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:42.520]   kind of maybe if Woz had signed it.
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:46.720]   Well, it's like if actually if Rodenberry had signed it with that would be worth it.
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:47.920]   That would be worth it for the big fell tip pen.
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:48.920]   It would be worth something.
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:49.920]   I got this.
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:51.560]   Did you get that free gene?
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:53.600]   You got it free.
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:18:04.000]   So I have a keyboard from Northgate and the back of it is signed by Stan Freeberg.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000]   Wow.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.640]   What's the connection?
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:07.640]   Wow.
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:09.440]   You just have it have a keyboard line around?
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:10.440]   No, no.
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:15.280]   Freeberg was doing some promotion work and advertising for Northgate when they had their special
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:18.520]   keyboard that had the asterisk in the right place and they had a bunch of it was like
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:19.520]   meant for easy.
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:21.720]   Why did they got Stan Free must have been ancient?
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:22.720]   Yeah.
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:23.720]   I was a guy.
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:26.960]   And this Freeberg was there and I met him talk to him, asked him different questions about
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:29.960]   radio and why he liked it so much.
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:33.400]   But anyway, he gave away a few of these keyboards that he signed because they were given these
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:36.200]   keyboards to people to evaluate.
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:38.200]   And so to evaluate.
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:43.440]   So I grabbed the keyboard and Freeberg stopped me.
[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:44.480]   Hey, hold on a second.
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:45.480]   He signed.
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:46.480]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:49.960]   Now I'm sure Patrick and John aren't familiar with Stan Freeberg because a radio pioneered
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:50.960]   a lot of ads.
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:51.960]   He'd recognize his voice.
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:53.840]   He had a very famous voice.
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:55.840]   He actually started off as a puppeteer.
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:56.840]   Really?
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:57.840]   Benian Cecil.
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:58.840]   Oh, I remember Benian Cecil.
[01:18:58.840 --> 01:18:59.840]   That's right.
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:00.840]   Yeah.
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:01.840]   That's right.
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:03.440]   That's absolutely he was born on August 7.
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:04.440]   Winky Pedia.
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:08.480]   Winky Pedia.
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:10.280]   So grew up in Pasadena actually.
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:15.480]   I believe you're right, Patrick, as long as Winky Pedia is accurate.
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:20.680]   So real quickly, I want to get to one of the bigger stories that we have left out, but
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:27.000]   we will, which is Skype again, more in court and it's just a mess.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:31.000]   Have you figured out the story?
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.680]   I mean, I've been reading this.
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:34.440]   This isn't like the Google Book Search story.
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:36.080]   This is one of those crazy stories.
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:38.360]   Well, here's the issue.
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:39.360]   It happened again.
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:42.320]   But I'm going to explain what that means in just a second.
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:43.320]   It happened.
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:45.480]   I thought it couldn't happen again, but it did.
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:46.920]   It happened again.
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:52.520]   I thought that only eBay could be that dumb, but it happened again and you'd think they
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:54.440]   would have learned, but no.
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:57.080]   But before we do that, I do want to mention our friends at audible.com.
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:59.360]   You could base your meat, John, if you, you know, wait a minute.
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:01.320]   You're not cooking today.
[01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:02.320]   He's not making it.
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:03.320]   I'm having raw oysters.
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:04.760]   You know, we're back in the months with ours.
[01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:07.560]   So I'm going to start checking the oysters out again.
[01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:09.360]   Oh, September.
[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:10.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:12.440]   Because August didn't have an R.
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:13.440]   Right.
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:14.800]   It's the hot months.
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:19.080]   In fact, you can get some confirmation from our French friend.
[01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:24.960]   The French believe that the absolute great month for eating oysters is January.
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:27.600]   And I have to say, I started picking up on that concept.
[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:28.680]   Because it's the coolest.
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:32.760]   I'm telling you oysters in January are astonishing.
[01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:37.360]   Which now, Patrick, I know the French are very proud of their wheat, but I think that
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:38.840]   we have better wheat here.
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:42.360]   Well, I think if you go out, move up to, if you get the ones in Oregon and you go up
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:43.360]   to British Columbia.
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:44.360]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:45.360]   You're going to have to leave this panel.
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:48.280]   You've got the British Columbia oysters.
[01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:49.600]   You know, it just blow your mouth.
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:51.720]   Even Hogg Island out here, just our local oysters.
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:55.920]   Just a very delicious, fresh, crisp flavor.
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:58.560]   But all right, well, we won't get in a battle over this.
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:20:59.560]   You're an oyster lover.
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:03.080]   Are you going to start speaking with a French accent if we do it?
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:05.560]   It's going to be messy.
[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:10.480]   One thing that is available everywhere that this show has heard, including the UK and
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:12.560]   France, is the great audible.com.
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:16.480]   I want to tell everybody about the audible deal now.
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:21.120]   This audible deal is available in the US only, but you can get your audible books all over
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:22.680]   the world.
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:28.400]   It's just a wonderful place to get online and find something great to listen to.
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:30.400]   My friend, Roz Savage, just got back.
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:32.000]   She's been rowing across the Pacific.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.040]   She was three months at sea.
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:41.040]   Before she left, I gave her my iPod stocked with 323 audible books.
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:42.560]   She says, "I could not..."
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:46.080]   I mean, she's rowing solo for three months all by herself.
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:47.600]   She said, "Autrible saves my life."
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:49.200]   She loves these audible books.
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:57.600]   Now, if audible can get her across the ocean, audible can get you across town, home from
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:00.640]   work, great for your commute, great for the gym.
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:02.640]   Here's one for John.
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:04.960]   Ron Paul's book, "End the Fed."
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:05.960]   Ron Paul.
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:08.720]   Yeah, thanks.
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:12.840]   It's actually, I think this is a speech by Ron Paul.
[01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:14.360]   That's one of the neat things about audible.
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:15.360]   Well, maybe not.
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:17.440]   No, I think you did come up with a book.
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:18.440]   He wrote a book.
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:24.160]   He's been trying, I just don't want to get into politics on this show about Ron Paul.
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:25.200]   But that's the point.
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:30.080]   You can from left, from right, from the center, from way out in the left field or right field,
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:35.040]   you can find books about all the topics in the world, science and technology, sci-fi
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:37.560]   and fantasy.
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:43.440]   Audible's even recording some of the great sci-fi books that were never recorded.
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:46.160]   I just have to thank them for that.
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:48.800]   You can get stuff that has never been on audio before.
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:51.960]   In fact, go to their Audible Frontiers section.
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:53.600]   These are the books that they've recorded.
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:54.440]   They have two that.
[01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:56.440]   When I first started joining Audible, they had a handful.
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:58.400]   Now, they have almost 2,500.
[01:22:58.400 --> 01:22:59.400]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:00.400]   Great sci-fi books.
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:02.200]   You should do a book or two.
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:03.720]   You know, I want to do a book.
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:05.600]   They've asked me to do a book and we're just trying to find one.
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:10.760]   I'm going to recommend, I mean, there's, oh man, our friend Jerry Pournell, the last
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:12.640]   time he was on, they did not have this on Audible.
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:16.400]   They do now, Lucifer's Hammer by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournell.
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:17.400]   What a great book.
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:22.960]   I mean, this is a 24 hours worth of listening and you can get it absolutely free.
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:27.040]   Actually, you know, I think the Moten God's eye, that'd be the one I'd start with.
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:29.160]   What a classic this is.
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:33.200]   Go to audible.com/twit2, you get them both.
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:37.520]   Get the Jerry Pournell Larry Niven collection and absolutely free.
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:38.880]   You're going to sign up for the platinum account.
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:42.920]   That's two books a month and the first two books are yours to keep free, even if you decide
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:43.920]   not to stick around.
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:44.920]   I know you will though.
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:46.760]   This is a great way to listen.
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:51.960]   On your iPod, on your iPhone, on your Nano, on your Kindle, on your Zoom, works great on
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:53.480]   the Zoom HD.
[01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:58.200]   Audible.com/twit2, we thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:02.880]   As I mentioned earlier, David Pogue will be on in just a few minutes.
[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:08.440]   He's going to record this earlier, a rebuttal for all the nasty mean things we said about
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:09.440]   him last week.
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:10.440]   You said you recorded this earlier though.
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:11.440]   Yeah.
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:12.440]   Well, then I don't get to complain.
[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:17.280]   You don't get to complain to him and he will mention that he considers that you were
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:18.840]   one of the people who was savaging him.
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:21.200]   Yeah, because he was on some bogus site.
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:22.200]   It wasn't you.
[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:23.200]   It wasn't me.
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:26.040]   I've never maybe mentioned him on Twitter ever.
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:27.040]   Okay.
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:28.040]   I'm going to send a note.
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:31.360]   And on here I've talked about because you brought it up in the conversation.
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:33.280]   I did say it's a fanboy, but so what?
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:34.280]   It's obvious.
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:35.280]   Yeah.
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:38.440]   Now, there's a new story here that I don't know if you covered it last week or not.
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:40.080]   Please, go right ahead.
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:42.200]   Did you Google acquires recapture?
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:44.720]   Yeah, isn't that wild?
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:45.720]   Why?
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:47.720]   I don't know.
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:48.720]   You know what a capture is?
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:51.240]   Of course, folks, those are those funny letters that they put on.
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:55.280]   In fact, which you sign up for Gmail, you have to decipher the letters.
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:57.800]   Really no computer can, but only humans can.
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:01.200]   It keeps the spammers from signing up for a million Gmail accounts.
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:02.560]   That's not the way they do it, of course.
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:09.120]   What you do is they have these systems available where a spammer will run into, they essentially
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:14.600]   have, they get to a, the machine gets to a capture and then it sends the web page in
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:19.720]   mass like hundreds of them to people in India or wherever they have them so they can just
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:20.720]   type in the things that they--
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:21.720]   What does this mean?
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:22.720]   It means it.
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:23.880]   I can't take that too.
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:24.880]   They type in the--
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:26.400]   But they type it in with an accent.
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:27.400]   So does that work?
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:28.400]   Yeah, type it in.
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:32.400]   And then they're actually not only in, but they're in like permanently so the capture
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:33.400]   has never come up again.
[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:36.040]   They're like members now and then the spammers just go crazy.
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:37.040]   So this capture doesn't work out.
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:39.880]   They've even got a man in the middle, a really clever man in the middle.
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:44.680]   When you go to a porn site to sign up, you'll get a capture which is just forwarded from
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:50.000]   Gmail so they have humans signing up for their sites and they just use them and they say,
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.000]   "Oh, thanks."
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.000]   You're right.
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.520]   But the question in my mind is why does anybody--
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:55.520]   Well, it's interesting.
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:59.160]   Now, recapture was created at Carnegie Mellon with a kind of altruistic band.
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:00.920]   It gives you two words, right?
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:02.120]   One word is the actual capture.
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:03.880]   But they don't tell you which of them.
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:07.320]   The other one is something that was scanned in from a book that they can't figure out
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:08.320]   what it is.
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:10.240]   It's part of a book scanning effort.
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:12.760]   And so Google's going to use this for their Google Book Scan.
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:18.840]   When they get to a word that their scanner can't interpret, they add it to the capture.
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:21.520]   You don't know which one's a real word, which one's a capture word.
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:24.200]   You type in both because it's a two-word capture.
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:27.440]   And now they've got a human doing their work for them.
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:29.240]   Clever, eh?
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:32.520]   They've learned something from the pornographers.
[01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:33.520]   That's actually genius.
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:34.520]   Isn't that genius?
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:35.520]   It is genius.
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:36.520]   But what did they pay for this company?
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:37.520]   A lot.
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:39.960]   Ridiculous amount because what's interesting is I thought that recapture was kind of a--
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:40.960]   I don't know.
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:45.040]   I got the impression it was like a more of an open source thing.
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:46.040]   But I guess--
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:50.400]   I thought they were going to use it for that idea that I can't remember which blogger
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:54.360]   had which was to put ads in the capture.
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:55.840]   But it makes sense too.
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:57.160]   Oh, wouldn't that be cool?
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:58.160]   That would be good too.
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:26:59.160]   There's a lot of uses here.
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:00.160]   Now I'm starting to see the life.
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:02.640]   Now you realize why Google bought recapture.
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:04.560]   There's all kinds of puzzles.
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:05.560]   Let me see.
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:06.560]   You know, actually, it's funny.
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:07.560]   I took that out of the stories because I thought--
[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:08.560]   Drink Pepsi.
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:10.560]   There'll be nothing to say it.
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:11.560]   Wow.
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:12.560]   Drink.
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:14.360]   And then you type in a drink Pepsi.
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:16.240]   So it gets embedded in your brain.
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:17.400]   It's a great genius.
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:18.400]   Drink Pepsi.
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:19.400]   Okay, I'll drink Pepsi.
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:20.400]   It's a great idea.
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:21.400]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:22.400]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:23.400]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:24.400]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:25.400]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:26.400]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:27.400]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:28.400]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:29.400]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:30.400]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:31.400]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:32.400]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:33.400]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:34.400]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:35.400]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:36.400]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:37.400]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:38.400]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:39.400]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:40.400]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:41.400]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:48.400]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:49.400]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:50.400]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:51.400]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:52.400]   I'm not going to say it.

[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:24.400]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:28.400]   I wonder if they'll abandon Yodley and make mint use into it.
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:32.800]   I have to say, one of the reasons I loved mint was I never got quickened to do a very
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:34.400]   good job of importing all my data.
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:37.200]   I had to do a lot of by hand tweaking and stuff.
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:39.400]   Mint just does it automatically categorize it.
[01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:41.760]   It's probably as you haven't got banks of bookkeepers.
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:42.760]   I do, actually.
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:45.400]   I just haven't been around a Tuesday.
[01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:49.400]   I'm just coming on Tuesday and they count my money for me.
[01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:52.400]   Then we have a little vat that we keep it all in.
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:54.400]   I'm going to flip through the dollars.
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:56.400]   It's just like that.
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:57.400]   Just like that.
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:34:59.400]   Hey, I really want to thank you all for being here.
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:04.400]   I especially want to thank you, Patrick and John Graham, for staying up so late with us.
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:07.400]   Patrick Bezia is a podcaster from Paris.
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:12.400]   His site is Frenchspin.com.
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:18.400]   Will you turn the favor and allow me to be on your show at some point?
[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:19.400]   Absolutely.
[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:20.400]   That would be a great pleasure.
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:21.400]   I'd love to be in the film.
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:23.400]   You could be on the movie "Licious."
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:24.400]   I do.
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:26.400]   Is that an English language one as well?
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:27.400]   Yes.
[01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:29.400]   Do you talk about movies?
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:30.400]   You review movies?
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:36.400]   Yeah, well, I'm reluctant to say review because it really implies a level of professionalism that
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:38.400]   we don't really have.
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:41.400]   We just discussed the movies that we've just seen.
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:42.400]   Modern movies.
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:44.400]   You know what I loved?
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:46.400]   I just saw it as in "Glorious Basterds."
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:47.400]   You liked it?
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:48.400]   It was a great one.
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:49.400]   You know why?
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:51.400]   Hitler gets it in the end.
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:54.400]   I don't think I'm spoiling anything when I say.
[01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:56.400]   I think we have a...
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:59.400]   ...come to some understanding that Hitler actually did die.
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:02.400]   Yeah, but not the way it shows it in the movie.
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:03.400]   No.
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:05.400]   It's really kind of...
[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:08.400]   It's quite a Tarantino, so it's very, very violent.
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:11.400]   Are you think they're revealing the absolute truth, though?
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:13.400]   Maybe this is what really happened.
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:14.400]   It could be.
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:16.400]   It could be a cover-up for what really happened.
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:19.400]   As violent as it is, it is a comedy.
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:20.400]   It's very funny.
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:21.400]   Violence has been comedic.
[01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:22.400]   Yeah, very funny.
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:24.400]   I mean, that one with the Kill Bill.
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:26.400]   Reservoir Dogs or Kill Bill, please.
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:29.400]   Reservoir Dogs, I don't think you really had the soft touch with that one.
[01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:36.400]   But with the Kill Bill and the girl chops off the woman's head and the blood squirts up like a little geyser that goes on forever.
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:37.400]   It's so awful.
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:38.400]   It's so beautiful.
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:41.400]   You don't have a talent to make for making gruesome stuff sort of funny.
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:43.400]   I think you need to get jotting me on.
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:45.400]   Have you done "Glorious Basterds" yet?
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:46.400]   We have.
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:47.400]   Oh, I'm absolutely.
[01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:48.400]   I'm sure we'll find some.
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:49.400]   Oh, you've got to go see it.
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:50.400]   I think you can show it.
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:51.400]   Yeah, watch it.
[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:52.400]   Because of the World War II history.
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:54.400]   I'll watch it on the 100-inch screen at home.
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:55.400]   Oh, shut up.
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:56.400]   You have 100-inch screen.
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:57.400]   You should see, though.
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:36:58.400]   Did you buy that?
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:36:59.400]   You should see the projector.
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:00.400]   Go ahead, Patrick.
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:05.400]   No, I was just wanted to mention the 500 days of summer.
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:06.400]   Oh, is that good?
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:07.400]   Easy.
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:08.400]   Oh, I have to go see it.
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:09.400]   Oh, you've got to go see it.
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:10.400]   I think you can show it.
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:11.400]   Yeah, watch it.
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:12.400]   Yeah, watch it.
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:13.400]   I'll watch it on the 100-inch screen at home.
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:14.400]   Oh, shut up.
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:15.400]   What's your name?
[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:16.400]   Chloe, what's your name?
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:17.400]   Zoe Dissonell.
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:18.400]   Zoe Dissonell.
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:19.400]   I'm in the world with her.
[01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:21.400]   So 500 days of summer is about global warming.
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:22.400]   Yeah.
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:23.400]   Very good.
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:24.400]   Very quick.
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:26.400]   Thank you for being here, Patrick.
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:27.400]   We really appreciate it.
[01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:30.040]   Also want to thank my friend John Graham Cumming.
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:35.120]   I really want to thank you for the great job you did rehabilitating and bringing people's
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:37.920]   awareness to the great injustice it was done to Alan Turing.
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:38.920]   That was great.
[01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:39.920]   Yeah.
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:40.920]   Success.
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:41.920]   Thanks very much.
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:42.920]   Don't forget his book, A Must Read Geek Atlas.
[01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:43.920]   It's on Amazon.
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:45.920]   It's available everywhere from O'Reilly and Sons.
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:46.920]   His website, JGC.org.
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:50.240]   Thanks for staying up late with us, John.
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:51.240]   Yeah, no problem.
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:52.960]   I was talking to you.
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:58.920]   And John C. Devorak, we appreciate your great contributions as always.
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:05.680]   You can find me at channeldevorak.com and on Twitter, I am the real Devorak spell T-H-E-A-L
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:06.680]   Devorak.
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:10.320]   D-V-R-A-K, if I can get that right.
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:12.680]   And he has never mentioned David Poe about Twitter.
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:19.680]   He never mentioned David Poe and really had no desire to until now, which I did mention
[01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:25.000]   him in Twitter asking people to give me where I mentioned him and somebody on Twitter in
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.000]   my audience.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.160]   But somebody said, "Here, here it is."
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:28.160]   Twitter is a great crowdsourcing.
[01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:29.160]   It is.
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:30.160]   I love it.
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:31.400]   In fact, I don't know if I could do it.
[01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:37.440]   I'm at the limit where if your crowdsourced was 60,000, it's harder than 30 because you
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:38.440]   started getting a lot of push-ups.
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:39.440]   You get too much redundancy.
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:40.440]   Yeah.
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:41.440]   Well, thank you for being here, John.
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:42.440]   We really appreciate it.
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:43.440]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:45.040]   EastmeastWest is coming up next.
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:48.760]   Remember, you can watch this show live every Sunday afternoon, 6 p.m.
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:52.400]   Eastern 3 p.m. Pacific at live.twit.tv.
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:57.040]   But make sure you subscribe on iTunes or the Zoom store as well because those subscriptions
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:00.520]   make us lots more money, frankly, than you're watching on the stream.
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:01.520]   Did you know that?
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:02.520]   I'm glad for you.
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:04.520]   You make no money on the stream.
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:07.960]   Well, the stream is just floating out there.
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:08.960]   Yeah.
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:09.960]   Another trip.
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:10.960]   This is amazing.
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:11.960]   You said, "Hit the can."
[01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:12.960]   You said, "Hit the can."
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:13.960]   You said, "Hit the can."
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:14.960]   You said, "Hit the can."
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:15.960]   It's hit the can.
[01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:17.600]   Don't go.
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:21.160]   We're not done yet because David Polk joined us right before the show.
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:25.200]   I asked David on, actually he asked to be on, and I was very glad to have him on, to
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:31.000]   rebut our conversations about him and the conflicts of interest that we considered were
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:35.000]   happening at the New York Times with his coverage, particularly of Apple.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.680]   So David agreed to call in from the road.
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:40.200]   He's in Syracuse.
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:43.280]   And the conversation went something like this.
[01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:46.440]   David Polk is here with us.
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:51.760]   Just to kind of set this up over the last couple of weeks, we've been pretty hard on
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:56.840]   David, which is hard for me because I consider David a friend and I really like you, David.
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:39:57.840]   But we've been very hard.
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:01.560]   I know you've received criticism in other areas as well because the New York Times public
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:09.520]   editor responded to a conflict of interest issues, in particular the public editor responded
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:14.000]   to the issue of you reviewing Snow Leopard while at the same time writing a book on Snow
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:18.200]   Leopard, which might lead one to think that you have some vested interest in the success
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:19.920]   of Snow Leopard.
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:24.480]   And then I think we were more critical in general of the fact that as times gone by, you've
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:31.840]   become more and more apparently a Mac fan and that it just seemed like you, it was inappropriate
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:40.840]   for the times to use use as a reviewer because it just didn't seem like you were unbiased
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:41.840]   in the issue.
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:46.560]   So I wanted to give you, is that a fair summary of what you feel like we've been saying about
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:47.560]   you?
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:49.920]   Yeah, I think that's about right.
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:52.240]   So I wanted to give you a chance to respond, absolutely.
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:56.240]   And I do want to say up front, I think the world of you, David, you're super talented.
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:03.240]   I really admire you.
[01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:05.400]   I don't believe that you would in any way act unethically.
[01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:10.760]   And I hope that that wasn't the feeling that you got from this.
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:15.480]   But I do think that there is an issue and it's a different issue than perhaps somebody
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:21.640]   like me who's a podcaster, who's an opinion person, that because you write for the times
[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:24.360]   you have a higher standard to adhere to.
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:27.720]   Well, I think you're right.
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:33.600]   I think there is clearly an evident and apparent conflict of interest.
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:37.920]   But what I thought was interesting about your segment with the panelists to talk about me
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:44.560]   when I wasn't there is that I think you had Dwight Silverman, right, from the Houston
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:45.560]   Chronicle.
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:47.360]   Well, it happened several times.
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:50.880]   So last week it was Jason Callicannis onto it.
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:53.520]   And then the week before I believe it was Dwight Silverman.
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:59.520]   And Dwight, I think, was defending you because he in fact also writes books about these topics.
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:00.520]   Right.
[01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:06.600]   And in point of fact, this is a problem with the industry and not so much with me alone.
[01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:08.000]   And this is what I wanted to bring up to you.
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.100]   It's about context.
[01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:15.000]   So Dwight admitted to you that he writes for the Houston Chronicle and he wrote a Windows
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:20.160]   book at the same time that he was writing about Windows for the paper.
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:26.800]   And Ed Begg, who writes for an even bigger newspaper than I do, he writes for USA Today,
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:31.400]   the equivalent column, he wrote Max for Dummy's home pre-the missing manual.
[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:37.600]   He wrote an iPhone book at the same time he was reviewing those Walt Mossberg for the
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:42.760]   Wall Street Journal makes I think the New Yorker set a million dollars a year off of the
[01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:48.660]   Deconference where Steve Jobs and Bill Gates make exclusive appearances, the very guys
[01:42:48.660 --> 01:42:50.120]   whose products he reviews.
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:52.520]   So it's a growing problem.
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:57.720]   You probably have a hard time finding someone who doesn't have a problem like this.
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:02.000]   So I'm not going to say there's no visible conflict of interest.
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.400]   Obviously there is one.
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:09.480]   The question is, the only thing I can say in my defense, our defense is does that conflict
[01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:11.320]   of interest affect the writing?
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:13.680]   Does it affect the conclusions?
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:18.200]   So in other words, can you look at a column I've done about some Apple product and say,
[01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:23.600]   oh my gosh, this thing that he has a book about is so much more of a positive review
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:27.240]   than any of the other national reviewers gave them?
[01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:28.240]   And I don't think so.
[01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:29.240]   Well, I can.
[01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:31.480]   So let me bring that up.
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:36.680]   So and this is where, you know, to be honest with you, for a long time I've been aware of
[01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:43.640]   the conflict of interest and you're right, it is endemic and I think it's a big problem.
[01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:47.120]   But we can, and let's talk about that because I think it's a good subject.
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:49.200]   So let me talk specifically about you first.
[01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:54.800]   So where it really started surface for me as an issue was your snow leopard review, which
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:44:00.600]   was a very positive review and left out what I thought was something fairly critical.
[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:05.760]   You talked in a blog posting, and I'm trying to remember who you talked to, about some
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:08.960]   significant problems you'd had with leopard.
[01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:14.960]   But Leo, there are two paragraphs about the glitches in the review.
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:16.520]   That's what boggles my mind is.
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:20.920]   But you didn't mention the fact that you hadn't, you never got CS3 working, that your printer
[01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:22.120]   never did work.
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:25.360]   It felt to me like you downplayed the glitches that it was.
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:29.960]   And in, in my opinion, I, I, I realized I was swimming upstream on this because you're
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:30.960]   right.
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:33.120]   Most of the national reviewers are very positive about snow leopard.
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:38.040]   I was much more critical of snow leopard and I really felt that, that the tech reporting
[01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:43.160]   had done a disservice to Apple users by recommending the upgrade when in fact, I don't think it
[01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:48.520]   was ready for most people, the problems that it caused did not outweigh the benefits that
[01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:49.520]   people were going to have.
[01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:50.880]   But I, I must disagree with you about that.
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:45:00.200]   I specifically in the New York Times mentioned Microsoft Word, Photoshop CS3, the FTP program
[01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:06.200]   that was crashing all the time, and a couple of other, I named them specifically.
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:07.200]   Okay.
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:12.560]   And so when Paul from Venture Beat emailed me and asked me to elaborate, I said, I named
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:16.440]   the exact same problems, except for the printer one, which happened later, later I was not
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:20.960]   able to, after the review for the Times was done, I was not able to connect to my HP laser
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:25.960]   printer, which turns out is because they took out Apple Talk and it's pretty easy to fit
[01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:27.880]   back in and you just switch it to IP addressing.
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:30.360]   So really wasn't an incompatibility.
[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:35.840]   As a matter of fact, the word problem went away as soon as I did a reinstall, I think
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:38.760]   my normal template was corrupted.
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:42.960]   That turned out, as far as I know, not to be a snow leopard thing at all.
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:48.120]   The Photoshop CS3 crashes, a few people, other people have had, Adobe's talked about it a
[01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:50.280]   lot on their website.
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:56.320]   And supposedly that was corrected as I predicted by the 10.6.1 update from Apple.
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:58.400]   So you're wrong.
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:00.760]   I did not mention that in the Times.
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:05.040]   In fact, I mentioned the same things except that I mentioned to Venture Beat.
[01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:10.600]   And the reason it was only two paragraphs was because these things always happen when something
[01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:14.840]   new comes along and then there are bugs, fix and patches and they go away.
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:19.240]   I said exactly the same thing about the Microsoft Zoom the following week.
[01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:22.600]   There were little glitches and I'll say the same thing again this week about the product
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:26.520]   I'm reviewing now that's brand new with a 1.0 operating system.
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:27.520]   Okay.
[01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:31.760]   I will, you know, point taken.
[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:36.800]   I felt the tone of the, I won't defend it, but I felt the tone of the snow leopard review
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:40.040]   was more positive than I would have given it, but that's a difference of opinion.
[01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:42.280]   But you had problems, right?
[01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:43.280]   Yeah.
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:44.280]   Yeah.
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:45.440]   And significant ones.
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:50.120]   And I feel like in general, the snow people should have been a little harder on snow leopard.
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:56.200]   The second issue that came up was your conversation with Steve Jobs right after the Apple event,
[01:46:56.200 --> 01:47:00.320]   where you, and to your credit, you immediately asked the question everybody was asking, why
[01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:01.320]   no camera?
[01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:07.400]   Steve gave you a pretty spinny answer and I would have, I was hoping for more follow up
[01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:08.400]   there.
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:13.480]   And I wonder if the impression I got was that perhaps you were reluctant to challenge Steve.
[01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:18.400]   Well, see that's, that was a really bizarre situation, first of all.
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:24.120]   By the way, what did you think of Walt Mossberg's interview with Jobs and Ed Begg's interview
[01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:25.120]   with Jobs the same day?
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:27.040]   I didn't actually read them.
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:28.040]   I read you.
[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:29.040]   Yeah.
[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:30.040]   Because they didn't write them.
[01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:32.040]   They didn't write them at all.
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:34.040]   Well, did you have it?
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:35.800]   It was unclear to me.
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:38.600]   You did not have an exclusive and Walt did get interviews with them.
[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:40.720]   Oh, all the big guys had the interviews.
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:41.720]   One right after another.
[01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:42.720]   We were all sitting in the same way.
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:46.120]   Why do you think they didn't write them?
[01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:51.240]   So I think Apple clearly wanted to focus on the products.
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:57.960]   So they declined every times and Wall Street Journal and USA Today reporters, business
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:00.120]   reporters request for interviews.
[01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:05.120]   So only the product guy has got in and not the business, not the business interviewers.
[01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:11.160]   So my editors asked me, by the way, we'd like to do a news story about this.
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:17.320]   While you're there, can you ask these newsy related questions and we'll use quotes from
[01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:19.080]   it for a business story?
[01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:23.200]   And they gave me some questions that they hoped that I wouldn't pass along.
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:32.280]   So you have 10 minutes with the man and already, by the way, after this, John de Borack went
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:35.720]   on Twitter and said, David Pogue is a disgrace to journalism.
[01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:41.000]   Jason Calicana said, "No one in the protect business takes you seriously.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.920]   It's a joke that the New York Times employs you.
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:47.640]   They're just unbelievably harsh."
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:55.240]   And one guy on the David Pogue blog said, "You should have nailed jobs as asked to the wall."
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:49:00.640]   And I'm going to like, "Dude, that is not how you get, I mean, yeah, maybe I should
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:02.880]   have, but is that my job?
[01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:04.560]   But let me ask you this, Leo.
[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:10.000]   What would you have said if he spun you if he said, "Well, the reason we didn't put
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:15.440]   a camera in the iPod touch is because we're positioning it as an inexpensive game machine."
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:16.560]   And you didn't buy it.
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:17.560]   So let's role play.
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:20.560]   You said we're hard not to laugh when he said that.
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:24.600]   Now I've talked to Steve and I know that the follow up question, which I would have said
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:29.840]   is, I'm not sure exactly what I've said, but I would have said, "Well, Steve, that
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:31.400]   doesn't make any sense."
[01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:33.640]   He would have left.
[01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:40.440]   And this is the issue I think that a lot of trade press has and press that covers narrower
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:47.440]   fields have and certainly it's a problem in the beltway with balancing access with fairness.
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:49.080]   Now we're talking.
[01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:50.080]   That's the point.
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:51.080]   He would have left.
[01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:54.600]   And I got to tell you, that's why I was, I have never been offered an interview with
[01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:57.000]   Steve Jobs, although I've asked many times.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:00.560]   It's why I was never allowed to speak to Bill Gates because every time you have to speak
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:02.680]   to Bill Gates, you have to submit questions in advance.
[01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:05.880]   And I, for ethical reasons, don't believe I should be doing that.
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:07.920]   So I don't get those interviews.
[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:09.720]   I will never get an interview with Steve Jobs.
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:14.680]   I think perhaps because, in fact, I wasn't even invited to that event, perhaps because
[01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:18.560]   I have not been an Apple cheerleader in recent times.
[01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:21.200]   And I think that that is an issue, David.
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:22.760]   So I think now it's on the table.
[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:28.560]   So is it better to have, to ask the hard questions and not nail his ask to the wall
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:34.040]   on the follow up, but bring the readers, his answers, or is it best not to interview
[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:35.560]   them at all and get no answers?
[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:39.640]   Listen, and by the way, I want to add, this isn't a David Pogue Steve Jobs thing.
[01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:40.640]   I agree.
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:42.440]   I have interviewed Bill Gates.
[01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:45.120]   I was not asked to submit my questions in advance.
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:48.960]   I have interviewed senators, interviewed governors for CBS Sunday morning.
[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:50.160]   I interview lots of big people.
[01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:52.200]   And I'm always respectful.
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:54.680]   That doesn't mean I'm kissing their ass.
[01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:55.680]   It means you're respectful.
[01:50:55.680 --> 01:50:59.000]   I asked him the tough questions.
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:03.840]   It came out later that the blogs found a hole in the iPod Touch where someone could
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:04.840]   have put a camera.
[01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:06.360]   But that happened after the--
[01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:08.640]   Had you seen that before the interview?
[01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:10.520]   No, that came out two or three days later.
[01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:12.880]   But no, I'm saying if you had, would you have brought it up?
[01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:13.880]   Oh, sure.
[01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:14.880]   OK.
[01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:15.880]   Absolutely.
[01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:16.880]   So that's really the issue.
[01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:24.160]   I'm not saying be disrespectful, but I think that it is an issue when, in effect, you're
[01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:27.880]   giving Apple-- look, you're coming from the New York Times.
[01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:33.680]   You're giving an Apple a platform for what is essentially public relations, a press release.
[01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:36.120]   And so I think that there is an issue there.
[01:51:36.120 --> 01:51:41.280]   I think that because you have the weight of the New York Times behind you, that's why
[01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:47.440]   Bill Gates did not ask you to submit questions, wearing it when he asked me to submit questions.
[01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:52.600]   You have some weight, and you can go in there and perhaps challenge him a little bit more.
[01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:55.520]   And I know that's a difficult thing to do.
[01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:58.240]   But I think it's your job.
[01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:02.880]   Well, I'll accept that.
[01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:08.160]   The thing that I objected to most about John de Vorex tearing me down on Twitter is you're
[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:13.280]   disgraced with journalism since when have I ever built myself as a journalist?
[01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:15.920]   Well, that's the question, David.
[01:52:15.920 --> 01:52:18.840]   If you were a blogger-- I mean, are you a blogger for the New York Times?
[01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:22.440]   I mean, if you have a blog, if you were a blogger, nobody would say this.
[01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:25.280]   It would say-- or an opinion-- let's not say blogger.
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:28.880]   Let's say a columnist, an opinion person.
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:30.200]   Nobody says that David Brooks.
[01:52:30.200 --> 01:52:33.920]   Why is it that you aren't a fan of President Obama, actually?
[01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:34.920]   I guess he is.
[01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:36.440]   But I mean, you're not a columnist.
[01:52:36.440 --> 01:52:38.760]   You're a reporter, or are you not?
[01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:39.760]   No, no.
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:43.840]   You know, by the way, I'm suddenly realizing this is all just making it all worse for myself.
[01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:47.200]   But I just-- I got it that the haters are going to hate David Bozier.
[01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:49.000]   You can't win with David Bozier.
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:50.280]   I am not a reporter.
[01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:52.080]   I have never been to journalism school.
[01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:53.800]   I don't know what it means to bury the lead.
[01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:55.600]   OK, I do know what it means.
[01:52:55.600 --> 01:53:00.360]   I'm not a reporter. I've been an opinion columnist my entire career.
[01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:01.560]   I express opinions.
[01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:03.800]   I try to entertain and inform.
[01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:10.840]   And in this instance-- and I've never, never interviewed jobs in this sort of news report
[01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:12.120]   you way before.
[01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:13.600]   And it was a mistake.
[01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:18.920]   I don't think I'm not an investigative reporter by any means.
[01:53:18.920 --> 01:53:21.480]   And again, this is not a jobs thing.
[01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:22.880]   This is a David Poep thing.
[01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:25.960]   I like my interview subjects to like me.
[01:53:25.960 --> 01:53:30.240]   I like them to feel comfortable because in my experience for CBS Sunday morning, the
[01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:33.000]   interview subjects tend to be more forthcoming.
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:38.040]   They tend to let things roll more when they feel comfortable, as opposed to feeling the
[01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:39.040]   thing that they're being--
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:41.160]   David, that's my style too.
[01:53:41.160 --> 01:53:44.200]   So I'm completely sympathetic because I think one of the reasons we get along, I'm not a
[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:47.200]   confrontational journalist.
[01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:49.920]   So maybe that's a misapprehension about your role at the times.
[01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:54.400]   But certainly you were put in the position of being a news reporter.
[01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:56.200]   What is the times reaction to this?
[01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:57.800]   I read the public editor's piece.
[01:53:57.800 --> 01:54:00.640]   It sounded like they were content with your role.
[01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:05.080]   And from now on, they're going to put a disclaimer in your column.
[01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:08.960]   Is that the end of it?
[01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:09.960]   I don't know.
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:14.600]   You know, as the public editor said, I was already doing the missing manuals when the
[01:54:14.600 --> 01:54:16.640]   New York Times came along.
[01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:19.520]   And from the very beginning, that was my offer.
[01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:21.160]   Look, I have to keep doing the books.
[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:22.840]   That's how I put food on the table.
[01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:26.760]   So anyway, so they went into it with their eyes open.
[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:30.080]   For nine years, it's never been an issue.
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:36.920]   Apart from the snarky bloggers, most readers seem satisfied that I'm being even handed.
[01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:41.720]   And again, if you compare my review-- I called Mobile Me a Mobile Mess.
[01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:45.040]   I said that iMovie '08 was a train wreck.
[01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:48.200]   I mean, I'm not afraid-- and I had books on those subjects.
[01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:52.560]   So I'm not afraid to nail Apple words, too, because why wouldn't I?
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:55.040]   It's my credibility is my bread and butter.
[01:54:55.040 --> 01:55:00.480]   People think I'm going to cave just to increase the sales of my books, which by the way, I
[01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:03.800]   think is a pretty far-fetched note.
[01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:07.120]   David Tholb's doing this to get his 80 cent royalty on it.
[01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:09.000]   Anybody who's reading a book knows that.
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:10.000]   Yeah.
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.720]   So as far as I know, that's it for the Times.
[01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:16.400]   I've offered repeatedly-- I mean, we've discussed this a lot over the years.
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:19.600]   I've offered repeatedly to take those weeks off.
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:21.800]   I only have three missing manuals, right?
[01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:24.640]   So I'm photo-- I'm sorry.
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:27.640]   I phone Mac OS X in Windows.
[01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:29.840]   Those are the three that I'm keeping alive.
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:33.320]   So it comes up three times a year this subject.
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:35.320]   So I've said I could take those weeks off from the Times.
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:37.640]   You could get someone else to write it.
[01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:41.840]   Their feeling is that at this point, readers are sort of expecting my voice and they know
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:42.840]   me.
[01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:46.320]   And I frequently said, why don't we disclose the book in the column?
[01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:51.760]   And for nine years, that's been shot down because it's like, dude, you can't advertise
[01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:52.760]   yourself.
[01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:55.000]   It's like putting a plug in the column.
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:56.160]   So they never did that before.
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:55:57.160]   Now now--
[01:55:57.160 --> 01:55:58.160]   That is the irony.
[01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:00.120]   Is the disclaimer is in a way a plug, isn't it?
[01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:01.120]   That's right.
[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:02.120]   And you know what?
[01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:05.200]   I'm sorry to tell you guys this, but now that the plug is going to appear in each column,
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:07.520]   it's going to raise the book sales.
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:08.520]   Right.
[01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:10.200]   Let me ask you about the video.
[01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:12.080]   The I Love My iPhone video.
[01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:16.120]   A lot of people have said, look, this is a proof positive that David is a fanboy.
[01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:20.120]   He shouldn't be reviewing any Apple products after making a video that says, I love my
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:21.120]   iPhone.
[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:25.880]   Wait, you're talking about the song that goes, I want to touch.
[01:56:25.880 --> 01:56:26.880]   It's precious screen.
[01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:27.880]   That one.
[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:30.760]   I want to wipe the smudges clean.
[01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:33.440]   I want my friends to look and drool.
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:36.320]   I want to say, look, now I'm cool.
[01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:40.600]   I took a stand, paid half a grand that one.
[01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:41.760]   The one that goes--
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:42.760]   Yeah.
[01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:44.800]   --talks about the--
[01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:45.800]   It's got--
[01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:47.040]   So you're saying it's a parody.
[01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:51.240]   It's not a pain to the iPhone.
[01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:53.240]   It is, in fact, mocking it.
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:56.400]   Of course, it was a parody of the hype, dude.
[01:56:56.400 --> 01:56:58.720]   I mean, it's so obvious.
[01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:03.720]   We went to all these guys who've been standing in line for the Apple Store for a week, you
[01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:08.320]   know, 1,000 people and got them to sing the lines.
[01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:14.600]   One whole verse is about no keys, no memory card, can't expand it, can't change the battery.
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:16.040]   A whole verse about that.
[01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:17.040]   But never mind.
[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:18.040]   It's a mess.
[01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:19.760]   I love my iPhone.
[01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:21.680]   That's all anybody remembers of it.
[01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:22.680]   Well, evidently.
[01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:23.680]   But watch the whole--
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:24.680]   All right.
[01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:25.840]   --it's a parody of the whole thing.
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:29.200]   Look, dude, it's my credibility at state.
[01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:33.360]   I'm not going to say-- if I really did kiss Apple's ass, I wouldn't say it.
[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:34.720]   I wouldn't advertise it.
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:35.720]   That's a good point.
[01:57:35.720 --> 01:57:39.880]   That's probably a bad way to go if you had something to gain.
[01:57:39.880 --> 01:57:40.880]   It's just one last thing.
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:42.320]   I know we've hammered this horse till it's dead.
[01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:48.280]   But one last thing is I'm not an Apple fanboy, meaning that I give Apple a pass.
[01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:55.160]   However, I think that Apple is relatively more often likely to do polished work.
[01:57:55.160 --> 01:58:00.040]   What's interesting to me is that nobody nails me for being a Google fanboy or a Blackberry
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:05.840]   fanboy or a Tino fanboy or a Sonos fanboy, all of those companies have gotten a higher
[01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:09.000]   percentage of positive reviews from me than Apple.
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:14.560]   It's because Apple and Microsoft are part of this religious war that people care and
[01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:16.440]   they get especially fired up about this.
[01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:20.560]   But I think it's important not to mix up the two.
[01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:23.360]   The haters want me to cream Apple every time.
[01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:25.040]   That's not going to happen.
[01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:29.200]   I'm going to give good reviews when it's deserved and bad reviews deserved.
[01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:33.320]   Just like a theater critic may generally like sometimes work.
[01:58:33.320 --> 01:58:38.200]   A restaurant critic may generally like chef Pierre Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[01:58:38.200 --> 01:58:38.200]   Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[01:58:38.200 --> 01:59:01.200]   Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:06.200]   Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:13.200]   Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:21.200]   Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:27.200]   Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:35.200]   Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:40.200]   Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[01:59:40.200 --> 01:59:45.200]   Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:50.200]   Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:55.200]   Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[01:59:55.200 --> 01:59:58.200]   Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[01:59:58.200 --> 02:00:01.200]   Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:06.200]   Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:10.200]   Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:14.200]   Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[02:00:14.200 --> 02:00:18.200]   Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[02:00:18.200 --> 02:00:21.200]   Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[02:00:21.200 --> 02:00:24.200]   Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:27.200]   Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:32.200]   Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:37.200]   Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:42.200]   Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[02:00:42.200 --> 02:00:47.200]   Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:50.200]   Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:53.200]   Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:56.200]   Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin, Boudin,
[02:00:56.200 --> 02:00:58.200]   I think that that's fair.
[02:00:58.200 --> 02:00:59.200]   You know what?
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:00.200]   It's what I'm comfortable with, David.
[02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:02.200]   I don't really want to have a relationship with these companies.
[02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:03.200]   Right.
[02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:04.200]   Well, it's extreme.
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:06.200]   I feel like my job is to represent the user,
[02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:08.200]   and if I am too close to the companies,
[02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:10.200]   it makes it hard for me to do my job.
[02:01:10.200 --> 02:01:12.200]   I like these people, and I see that's the problem.
[02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:14.200]   I don't want to like Steve Jobs too much,
[02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:16.200]   or anybody at Apple too much,
[02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:18.200]   because then it would make me hard for them
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:20.200]   for me to be honest.
[02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:24.200]   Well, it's extremely admirable what you're doing.
[02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:27.200]   It's also extremely unusual in this day and age.
[02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:28.200]   Well, I'm not.
[02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:30.200]   I apologize for bringing it up,
[02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:33.200]   because I'm not trying to do my own hornier.
[02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:35.200]   How do we address this as a business?
[02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:41.200]   So, my message is, it's not just me.
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:44.200]   I felt like I was ganged up upon,
[02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:47.200]   and I just want to point out, it's problematic,
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:48.200]   but it's not just me.
[02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:49.200]   No, absolutely not.
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:50.200]   I'd agree with you.
[02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:52.200]   The only solution is, I mean,
[02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:54.200]   this genie is never going back in the bottle,
[02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:56.200]   not with newspapers crashing the way they are.
[02:01:56.200 --> 02:01:58.200]   We all need to earn a living somehow.
[02:01:58.200 --> 02:02:04.200]   So, the experts in this field tend to be in demand
[02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:06.200]   for speaking, for television, for books,
[02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:09.200]   for newspaper, for blogs, for Leo's show.
[02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:14.200]   I mean, they're the same people who are going to recur.
[02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:16.200]   So, it's not going to change.
[02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:20.200]   So, it remains, I think, up to the readership
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:22.200]   to judge if this guy is credible or not,
[02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:25.200]   despite what appear to be conflicts.
[02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:28.200]   I guess in the new age, that's the bottom line anyway,
[02:02:28.200 --> 02:02:30.200]   because while today I can say,
[02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:32.200]   "Well, you write for the New York Times,
[02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:33.200]   so you have a higher standard,"
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:36.200]   the truth is, it's a level playing field,
[02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:38.200]   an increasingly level playing field,
[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:40.200]   and why should anybody have a higher standard?
[02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:42.200]   We should all have a high standard.
[02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:44.200]   So, I guess, you're right, the bottom line is,
[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:46.200]   we're all going to be faced with this.
[02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:48.200]   Every, you know, you can't ask a blogger
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:50.200]   not to get products for review.
[02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:52.200]   They can't afford to buy these products.
[02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:56.200]   I mean, in my case, Leo, I think the simple solution would be,
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:02:59.200]   those three times a year when I have to review a product
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:01.200]   where I also have a book coming out,
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:03.200]   that I let a substitute do it.
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:04.200]   But you know what?
[02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:09.200]   That would not change the haters on Iota.
[02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:11.200]   No, that I know also.
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:15.200]   That would not satisfy Jason and Dvorak, those guys.
[02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:17.200]   David, I really appreciate your willingness to come on and talk.
[02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:19.200]   I apologize for not having you on in the last two weeks,
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:21.200]   but the truth was, I didn't know that this would come up
[02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:24.200]   as a conversation, certainly not to the degree that it did,
[02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:26.200]   or I would have, but I'm really glad you could come on today
[02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:27.200]   and talk about that.
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:29.200]   Well, thanks for letting me speak, my piece,
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:30.200]   and you're right.
[02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:31.200]   It's an interesting question.
[02:03:31.200 --> 02:03:33.200]   It's a troublesome question.
[02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:35.200]   It's only going to get worse.
[02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:37.200]   It's only going to get worse, and already it's been in place
[02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:40.200]   for, you know, 15 years, even before I came along.
[02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:43.200]   I grapple with this because I have to do ads, you know,
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:44.200]   and we can't support it.
[02:03:44.200 --> 02:03:47.200]   I wanted to support ourselves, like Consumer Reports does
[02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:48.200]   with donations, and we just couldn't.
[02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:49.200]   There wasn't enough money in it.
[02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:52.200]   So we have to do ads, and that raises a huge conflict of interest.
[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:53.200]   Oh, right.
[02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:55.200]   I remember I was listening to your show one day,
[02:03:55.200 --> 02:03:57.200]   which is fantastic.
[02:03:57.200 --> 02:03:58.200]   Thank you.
[02:03:58.200 --> 02:04:01.200]   There was a go to my PC ad, and you read the copy,
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:04.200]   but then you threw in, we use it all the time.
[02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:05.200]   Right.
[02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:07.200]   And I was wondering to myself, I know, I know it's true,
[02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:12.200]   but would you mention it every week if they weren't a sponsor?
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:13.200]   No, absolutely not.
[02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:15.200]   Those are ads.
[02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:20.200]   And this is not necessarily effective, but here's the line I've drawn.
[02:04:20.200 --> 02:04:23.200]   We don't do ads for products I don't use.
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:29.200]   Now, in the text sphere, I'm hoping, I pray, that sometimes we'll be
[02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:32.200]   getting advertisers who aren't in the text sphere.
[02:04:32.200 --> 02:04:35.200]   Then it won't matter because it won't be products I cover.
[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:38.200]   I also recuse myself from coverage of those categories.
[02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:43.200]   Fortunately, there's not really much of an issue in terms of Citrix
[02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:46.200]   or Audible or Drobo.
[02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:51.200]   We don't have, you know, one of our hosts was a wonderful guy,
[02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:56.200]   really a dorm, Frederick, on our photography podcast,
[02:04:56.200 --> 02:04:58.200]   and he was on MacBreak Weekly, took a job with Drobo,
[02:04:58.200 --> 02:05:01.200]   immediately had to let him go or say, you can't do the show anymore.
[02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:07.200]   We try to only use journalists, not PR or marketing people on the show.
[02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:11.200]   These are the lines I try to draw, but you write, David, it's very difficult.
[02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:14.200]   Increasingly with our hosts, it's impossible.
[02:05:14.200 --> 02:05:15.200]   So I think you're right.
[02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:17.200]   I think it's ultimately, as with everything else,
[02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:20.200]   the burden is on the reader.
[02:05:20.200 --> 02:05:22.200]   The truth is it's always been on the reader.
[02:05:22.200 --> 02:05:26.200]   It's just now surfacing as something more explicit.
[02:05:26.200 --> 02:05:27.200]   Yeah.
[02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:28.200]   David, thank you.
[02:05:28.200 --> 02:05:32.200]   Well, thanks for letting me have the chance to express my side.
[02:05:32.200 --> 02:05:34.200]   Have a great time in Syracuse.
[02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:35.200]   Thanks a lot.
[02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:36.200]   All right, take care.
[02:05:36.200 --> 02:05:37.200]   That's David Pope.
[02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:38.200]   Bye-bye.
