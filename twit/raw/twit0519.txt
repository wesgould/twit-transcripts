[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.040]   I'm so glad to be back, but I want to thank the folks who filled in for me, Becky Worley.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:17.040]   I did a great job, Mike Elgin, who did a great job and yeah, Jason Calicannis.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.440]   Who did a great job by here?
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.040]   I haven't seen either of any of those shows.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.040]   I'm kind of...
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.440]   I probably shouldn't, but I'm glad to be back.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.960]   Thank you to all three of you for hosting while I've been gone.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.080]   We got a great panel for you starting with Christina Warren from Mashable.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.080]   Hi, Christina.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.280]   Hey, Leo, what's going on?
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.440]   At FilmGirl.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.440]   Yes.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.480]   Always good to see you.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.840]   Also great to see Alex Lindsey.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.360]   We haven't seen a lot of them on Mac Great Weekly.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.440]   I'm really glad to get you in from the Pixel Core.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.120]   See, first I'm gone and then I'm everywhere.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.000]   I want you to be everywhere because you're the greatest.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.680]   Are you in Pittsburgh right now?
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.040]   I'm in Pittsburgh for today.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.360]   He's got the best setup in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.760]   I mean, you look better than I do and I'm in studio.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.440]   I don't know how you do it.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.760]   It's pretty impressive.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.240]   Welcome to yours.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.360]   And with a brand new job, my old buddy, Ralph Needleman is here.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.360]   Hi, Leo.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.720]   Ralph, of course, for many years you were at CNET.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.720]   Yes.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.440]   And then you went to Evernote for a brief flirtation with the dark side.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.440]   Year and a half.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.440]   It was actually pretty fun.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.240]   I feel I'm just moving himself upstairs now, whatever now.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.560]   They have a new guy going to be in charge.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.560]   Do they?
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.560]   I thought so.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.840]   I heard I read that story.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.120]   I know nothing more than what I've read in the story.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.520]   Then went to Yahoo Tech.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.200]   Turned that into the number four tech site on the internet, which I hear is a pretty
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.200]   big thing now.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.200]   The internet.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.200]   Huge.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.200]   It's becoming a thing.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.360]   And now you've taken your talents and you moved on to make make her media.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.360]   We love make magazines.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.360]   Oh, it's so fun.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.400]   Dale Dowherty and the gang and your editor in chief at maker.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.080]   Media, which means not only the magazine, but the books, the maker fairs, which are huge.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.720]   How many maker fairs are there now?
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.480]   There are a couple of big ones, San Francisco and New York.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.240]   And all told 150 around the world.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.240]   That's what's so cool.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.240]   I know.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.240]   They're everywhere.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.240]   Every movement.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.240]   People put them on by themselves and it's just awesome.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.160]   It's a movement, which is really neat.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.000]   Did anything happen while I was gone?
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   At all.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Reddit.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Great site.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   I really am.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.800]   Well, let's not do anything because Leo is.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.560]   I hear that Windows phones going great.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.560]   That's good news.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.560]   It's a fire.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.560]   It's all on fire.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.560]   Well, okay.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.560]   It is.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.560]   But it is.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:39.080]   Actually, let me ask you because I'm in Germany when iOS 8.4 comes out and I am very slow bandwidth.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.680]   But so I worked as hard as I could to get Apple music.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.880]   And then I'm in Austria.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.880]   I finally got it.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.880]   I'm starting to listen.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.880]   I'm going, this is not so good.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.120]   Unfortunately, it's not available in Hungary.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.440]   What do we think about Apple music now?
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.160]   Two weeks in.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.040]   I love Spotify.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.040]   I got it.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.040]   I updated it.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.040]   I was like, okay, whatever.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.840]   Now that I'm not doing product reviews like that, I'm thinking about Spotify.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.720]   I love Spotify too, especially since Spotify broadcasts all of our Twitch programming,
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.720]   which is nice.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.720]   That's a new feature.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.360]   I think Spotify wisely realized that depending on music labels for your business is probably
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.800]   a long term, not a great plan.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.080]   So they've added content from podcasts.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.720]   And I think that's nice in other internet programming, including video.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.640]   But I think that right now I still find Apple music a little confusing.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.240]   Just there's a lot, a lot there.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.040]   People don't even know.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.040]   They think it's like, what is it?
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.400]   Is it iTunes?
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.960]   Is it what is it?
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.600]   Yeah, unfortunately, that's the biggest problem is that it's at least desktop.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.400]   It's built into the iTunes app.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.920]   I feel like what they should do at some point is do what they did with the Photos app and
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.200]   do what they've done with some of the other things and separate it out.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.760]   So if you want to have iTunes as your kind of media management place to get files on
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.320]   your iPhone and do updates and that stuff, that's fine.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.240]   But separate all of the Apple music stuff into its own app.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.760]   The interface, there's a lot there.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.240]   They've got a lot going on.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.880]   But I find the for use section to be fantastic.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:16.880]   I love Spotify.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.360]   I've been a Spotify user since, I think, two years before it officially came to the United
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.360]   States.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.120]   Is there anything Apple music does that Spotify doesn't do?
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.120]   Yes, the recommendations are significantly, significantly better on Apple music I find.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.720]   I find the for use section is really good.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.360]   I think that a lot of the curated playlists they make are a lot better than the curated
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.240]   playlists Spotify makes.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.680]   That said, I do miss being able to search for playlists that other people have created.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.960]   So if I want to see that someone made a playlist of all the songs in Mad Men, I can do that
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:49.960]   on Spotify.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.240]   I can't do that on Apple music.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.960]   But I do find the recommendations I get from Apple music of what to listen to, what new
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.000]   artists are coming out, things that I might like, deep cuts from artists that maybe I
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.880]   haven't listened to in a while.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.960]   I find that to be a lot better.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.240]   I like Beats One.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.480]   I don't mind the radio station.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.480]   I don't love all the day-to-day programming, not that I have to, but I like a lot of the
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.480]   shows that they have.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.000]   They have an Elton John show.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.520]   Every time I listen to Beats One, Alex, you're a former DJ as am I.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.280]   I feel like this is radio from the 70s.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.400]   They have Beats One, echo, echo, echo.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.360]   And the DJs will talk over music like crazy.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.200]   It just seems retro to me.
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.200]   And I wonder-
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.200]   It is very retro.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.200]   I kind of dig that.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.200]   I don't know.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.200]   I mean, I think that's kind of cool.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.560]   I think for a certain generation of people, they're either going to love it or hate it,
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.480]   but there are certain people who are listening to it now who've never listened to traditional
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.360]   radio the way that it used to be around because-
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.360]   That's what this is, isn't it?
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.360]   It was a dramatic so long ago.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.360]   It is.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:47.360]   It's traditional-
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.280]   And Mike Elgin made a point that for the first time ever there is a global radio station
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.120]   that conceivably people from all over- there's a hundred countries- all over the world can
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.280]   be listening and you break a song on Beats One, you're breaking it not just in the US,
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.280]   but everywhere.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.760]   And so it can be very powerful.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:09.240]   And I don't feel like one station is going to serve a very broad heterogeneous audience.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.440]   So I'm supposed to start listening to radio.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.440]   I think it's a real deal again.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.440]   Apple brought it back.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.440]   I think that's for you.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.240]   I mean, I think it was based on that.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.240]   I'm not convinced.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.240]   It's a lot of-
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.640]   One station has been serving at least the US because, I mean, when you look at Clear Channel
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.640]   or many of these other-
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.440]   Yeah, this one station, isn't it?
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.960]   The programming has been very, very- and there's no other handful of consultants that
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.000]   run most of the stations in the United States.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.480]   There's probably four or five real stations that cover most of the major markets and then
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.800]   there's lots of little independence.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.200]   And so that homogeny has, I think, happened for a while.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.560]   I think that it is interesting though that- and I think that becomes very complex when
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:50.200]   you look at Apple possibly paying for creating content and do they break content that they've
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.200]   helped make with the artists down the road.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:59.520]   That would be one thing I would worry about is the Paola thing.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.880]   That if it's one thing if Zane Lowe and the other, Julie Antinuga and the other DJs are
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.080]   playing music, they really love that they picked.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.120]   And another thing if Apple corporate says, "Hey, we really want to push the latest YouTube
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.600]   album, would you mind playing a little more of that?"
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.600]   That would bug me a little bit.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.000]   There's no reason to think they're doing that.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Yeah, I know they're going to do that.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.240]   No, I mean, I asked Trent Reznor about that in the lead-up to Apple music and he made it
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.120]   very clear that the whole reason they were doing it, it was his idea.
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:31.760]   He wanted to basically go back to a time when DJ's really kind of had authority to pick
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.760]   what they wanted.
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:38.000]   And Zane's show on the BBC on Radio One was very similar to what his show is on Apple
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.200]   music.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.200]   And I like that show.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.040]   It's not for everybody, but I like that show.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.280]   And so I think that he's basically a Trento B. He's the heart and soul.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:51.560]   He's the entire, the DNA of Beats One is Zane.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:57.280]   So I would be concerned if we, I guess what I'm saying is I'm not expecting to see that
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.280]   sort of interference.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:03.720]   I would be concerned with that possibility if I would be concerned of Zane left, but let's
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.720]   put it that way.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.440]   If Zane left, then that would be a concerning thing.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.600]   But as long as he's there, I have a feeling like he's there to do his thing.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.720]   And Apple is kind of treating this like a loss leader in some cases.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.200]   I don't think they're looking to make money off of Beats One.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.640]   They're looking as this is kind of a value add to the rest of the service.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.920]   The only reason I bring it up, I feel like it might, it might be a little bit of an insight
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:30.440]   into Jimmy Iovine, Trent Reznor and Apple's attitude towards music.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.840]   I thought that the whole, I thought Apple killed radio.
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.240]   I thought Apple, Apple killed music radio.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.840]   The iPod came out and now we can listen to what we want to listen to.
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.360]   And I thought that that, and I know it was bad for music radio.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.040]   And it's strange that they would be bringing it back.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.280]   It seems like one of the things, one of the things I think is missing though is I think
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.120]   that they could kill radio.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.080]   And what I mean by that is that I think we do like listening to a little bit of context
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.240]   around the music that we're watching or listening to.
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.240]   So I think that there is an opportunity for that.
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.960]   I think that the real hard thing that Apple is trying to do is all these curations.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:08.360]   But I feel like that top down approach to all that curation and that real press to not
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:14.080]   allow the kind of cross pollination among the users in the same way that you have Spotify.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.040]   To make sure that there's no noise, I guess.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:21.280]   I feel like is going to make it a little sterile.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.640]   I think that there's a lot of opportunity to, I think there is opportunity for people to
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.040]   bubble up.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.360]   And I think this is the place that Spotify could actually take advantage of this is really
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.680]   providing a platform.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.000]   Right now no one can do a radio station online because of the expense of all the royalties
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.480]   that are connected to it.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:43.640]   But if you combine the ability to talk a little bit as well as run songs, not actually play
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:49.800]   them and stream them, but utilize playlists that are part of that process, it would allow
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:54.240]   people to start building basically their own radio stations.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.720]   And that I think would definitely be the end of a radio.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:03.320]   Not because some kid in Iowa would do it, but guys like Mike Holleran and could do his
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.320]   own radio station.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.320]   Nice, you really know what they're doing.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.320]   At a 91x.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.160]   You know, and do it out of his house and probably make a lot more money than he's making at
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.160]   the radio station.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.160]   Well, the jury's still out.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.160]   We'll see.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:17.520]   Everybody right now is for free, three months free.
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.280]   The real question will happen at the end of the three months.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.880]   How many people will stick around?
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.040]   It's one of those things where you put in your credit card and then they start billing
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.040]   you, right?
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.040]   So I have to remember.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.040]   You have to remember.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.040]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.680]   You can go in advance.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.800]   Like now you can go in and turn it off in the setting.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:32.800]   Don't say research.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.800]   Don't auto-renew.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:34.800]   So, yeah.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:35.800]   Turn off the auto-renew feature now.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.800]   You'll still get it for three months.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.800]   I've got to remember to do that.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.800]   I forgot.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.160]   I've got to remember to do that.
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.160]   Yeah, right.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.620]   We were telling people before we figured out that check we were saying, you know, you
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:49.180]   started to set a reminder and remind me on X-Day cancel Apple music.
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.320]   But that's what I did with HBO now because I pay for HBO so I could HBO go.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.600]   But I was trying out the HBO now service and it was one of those things where like I literally
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.600]   made a stereo reminder.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:02.940]   I was like, remind me on May 29th or day it was to cancel HBO HBO now.
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.220]   So let's take a little break.
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.220]   I want to come back.
[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.100]   I'm not going to leave Apple because I don't understand it.
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.380]   They released new iPods.
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.220]   It baffles me.
[00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.220]   It baffles me.
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.260]   But Christina, as you got them, you can explain.
[00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.260]   Yeah.
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.940]   The reason why I need a gold iPod touch.
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:17.940]   I can try.
[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.100]   There's got to be a reason Apple did this.
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.300]   This is baffling to me.
[00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.820]   But we'll talk in just a moment.
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:28.780]   Our show today brought to you by Linda.com, the online learning platform with over 3000
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:29.780]   video courses.
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:30.780]   And you know, it's great.
[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:35.780]   You pay once a monthly phase, very affordable and you get access to everything.
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.860]   So you don't have to decide now what you want to learn.
[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.300]   It's the way I think the human brain works.
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.660]   You like to dibble and dabble and dip into something and then maybe say, oh, no, I'm
[00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:48.020]   going to really learn Lightroom and you go boom into it.
[00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:51.820]   A lot of people want to learn how to code or develop apps.
[00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.940]   You don't need to go to expensive college to do that.
[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.020]   You can do that at Linda.com.
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:00.380]   Listen to some of the development core PHP with MySQL essential training.
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.380]   Okay.
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:02.380]   That's old fashioned.
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.420]   How about essential training for developing Android apps?
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:09.900]   There's a new course on building data driven apps with iOS.
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:10.900]   We've talked about code clinic.
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:11.900]   I love the code clinic.
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.900]   It's a multi course series.
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.060]   Linda that comes great experts, great teachers.
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:21.700]   Look at common code challenges and then offer their solutions in a variety of languages.
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:25.220]   C plus plus C sharp Java, PHP Python, Ruby.
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.220]   It's so cool.
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.380]   They've got four new entries.
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:32.860]   JavaScript C are which I've been dying to learn and swift, which is the hot new Apple
[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:38.820]   language Linda L Y N D A dot com, whether it's photography, computer programming, using Microsoft
[00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:43.060]   Word, business skills like preparing a resume, negotiating a better deal.
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.180]   It's all there.
[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.340]   You're learning from the experts.
[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:53.620]   These are great teachers, but first and foremost, they're working in the field.
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.300]   Thousands of courses, you'll learn at your own pace.
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.300]   They're structured.
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.860]   You can watch them from beginning to end or just a little bit of time, depending on your
[00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:00.860]   desires.
[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:04.420]   You can use those course transcripts to find the part you're looking at and skip right
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:05.780]   to that.
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.500]   Take notes as you go refer to them later.
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:12.420]   They're all stored with your account download tutorials and watch them on the go on iOS
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.420]   or Android.
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:14.580]   That's nice.
[00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.860]   Get on that plane and learn a little something before you land.
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:23.820]   L Y N D A dot com slash twit and the number two will get you free 10 day trial.
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:24.820]   So you don't even have to guess.
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.180]   You can see what they've got.
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:31.060]   The run of the place for 10 days, more than 3000 on demand video courses.
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:33.580]   And it's very affordable as you can see.
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:37.260]   Know why and D A dot com slash twit and the number two, but pay nothing for your free
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.100]   10 day trial right now.
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.500]   Linda dot com slash twit and the number two.
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:46.460]   The last thing in the world I thought I'd see is a new iPod.
[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:53.220]   I thought that I mean, really, I mean, I was, I thought, am I, is this news for 1999?
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.180]   You don't, you don't have kids.
[00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:56.180]   That's what you give your kids.
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.180]   So is that who is this for?
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.180]   That's why I'm thinking about that.
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:02.340]   So what I'm impressed is the new iPod touches essentially everything that the iPhone six is
[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:05.740]   including the camera, including the A processor, although it's underclock.
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:06.740]   It's at 1.1.
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:07.740]   It's underclock.
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:08.740]   It's one gigahertz, not 1.4.
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:09.740]   Yeah.
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:13.420]   Smaller screen, no touch ID, no Apple pay, but but basically the same.
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.820]   It's kind of, if you want to give your kid a phone, but you don't want to have to pay
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:16.820]   the data.
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:17.820]   Right.
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:18.820]   Because they're in my fight all the time.
[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:19.820]   Right.
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:20.820]   Yeah.
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:21.820]   Exactly.
[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:22.820]   So that's who this is for?
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:23.820]   Yeah.
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:24.820]   I mean, I think it's that.
[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.980]   And I mean, you can get it in 128 gigabytes, which is actually compelling to the few people
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.020]   who were still like iPod classical.
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.260]   I still have my classic.
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.260]   I'm never you.
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.260]   I do too.
[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:37.540]   But I mean, because 120 gigabytes, okay, that's on 160, but it's solid state storage.
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:38.540]   And it's going to be faster.
[00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.540]   And that's getting you a lot closer.
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:45.700]   Plus, you know, you have access to a web browser, 802 11 AC, you know, Wi-Fi.
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:49.060]   No, I mean, don't we every quarter?
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.300]   Doesn't Apple like say, oh, yeah, nobody bought the iPod this quarter either.
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.300]   Yeah, basically.
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:57.140]   It's like, which is why I was shocked that they released the update.
[00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.820]   When's the last time there was a new iPod?
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.380]   October of 2012.
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:03.380]   She knows that.
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.380]   Of course she does.
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:05.380]   She's Christina Warren.
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:09.460]   And it says so right here in her article, I'm actually like, oh, there you go.
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.340]   Here's what's scarier.
[00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:13.340]   The last time.
[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:16.980]   So the shuffle and the iPod nano were also they were not updated.
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:17.980]   They were given you colors.
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:21.100]   The shuffle has not been touched since 2010.
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:22.100]   Wow.
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:23.100]   Wow.
[00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.100]   That's amazing.
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:25.100]   So is it really?
[00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.420]   I mean, they did update other ones, but it's really about the new touch.
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.420]   Oh, no.
[00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.020]   They updated the colors on the other ones.
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.020]   That's all I did.
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.020]   They literally updated the colors.
[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.020]   They added nothing else.
[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:36.700]   So it's still the same shuffle from 2010, still the same nano from 2012.
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:41.420]   But now you can get them in gold, space gray, silver, product red, blue.
[00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:43.900]   The blue is actually really cool and pink.
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.420]   Is there evidence that people are buying?
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:47.420]   iPod?
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.420]   I don't.
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.780]   I mean, look, I think that enough of them are always buying them for them.
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.420]   Does your son how old your son is nine?
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:54.420]   That's he's the candidate.
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:55.620]   Does he have one?
[00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:56.620]   Not yet.
[00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:57.620]   Would you buy him a new one?
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:59.020]   Or would you get an iPod touch?
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.020]   I mean, I have--
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:01.020]   Or your old phone.
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.620]   Right now he has-- he uses my old phone.
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:03.620]   That's his iPod touch.
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:04.620]   Right.
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:05.620]   Yeah.
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:06.620]   And it's got no cellular on it.
[00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:07.620]   And it's just it's a Wi-Fi device.
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:08.620]   Nothing wrong with that.
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:14.900]   My kids are five and seven and there's nothing better on a plane is either an iPad or an iPod
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:15.900]   touch.
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:19.420]   And so-- and I think that-- and we use them a lot as utilities.
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.940]   So within the company, there's a lot of places I don't necessarily want to pay for a phone
[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.220]   and I don't want to pay for the connections.
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:30.380]   But we use them as little displays for time communication.
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.340]   There's all kinds of utilization.
[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.060]   I mean, we have a lot of these.
[00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:35.060]   But how much is it?
[00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:39.300]   128 gigabyte gold iPod touch is what?
[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:40.300]   400 bucks?
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.300]   Yeah.
[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:42.300]   Well, I don't mean--
[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.300]   I know.
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.020]   I mean, for most-- I think most people actually, other than people who really want to replace
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:51.420]   their 160 gig solution, a 16 or 32 is fine.
[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:55.100]   But as a great little addition that you're adding all of that to, it's a really great
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.100]   little device.
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.100]   All right.
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.100]   I mean, they know their business.
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.700]   Obviously, they've done some research and they've figured that people would buy this.
[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:04.700]   I mean, the only thing I can figure is that they already have the guts to go inside an
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:05.700]   iPhone 6.
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:06.700]   Right.
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:07.700]   Maybe pair things down a little bit.
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:08.700]   You've already got all these shelves.
[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:09.700]   Cheap to make.
[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:10.700]   You know, exactly.
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:11.700]   You've already got the shelves and the screens.
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.580]   Go ahead and pop the upgrade in.
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.180]   This will at least get iOS 9.
[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.780]   There was-- I was actually a little concerned that maybe the old iPod touch would get iOS
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:19.780]   9.
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.620]   So this will at least get it to iOS 9.
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:26.140]   What I'm also thinking, and I don't know how likely this is, but I'd love to hear you
[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.460]   guys' thoughts.
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:34.460]   I don't know if there's potential here in developing markets, developing countries
[00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:39.180]   where people still have poor cell signal and are primarily using their phones again, like
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.300]   most of us do on Wi-Fi.
[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:46.780]   If having a $200, you know, no contract type of device running an AH chip and having,
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:50.700]   you know, a better graphics performance running the latest stuff, that could be a competitor
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.220]   of sorts to, you know, some of the super cheap Android phones.
[00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.220]   That sounds like a bit of a stretch.
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:01.180]   I mean, it makes sense financially in some ways, but with super cheap Android or even,
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:09.180]   you know, Firefox, Mozilla phones, you could get all the same stuff with cellular if you
[00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.180]   want it.
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:11.180]   That's true.
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:12.180]   Yeah.
[00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.180]   Could you-- I mean, it does so.
[00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:17.180]   I mean, I think there's an interesting theory here because Apple does not want to make,
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.220]   and we'll never make probably a cheap iPhone.
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.420]   It's just not something they're interested in.
[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.420]   Maybe that's what this is.
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:25.820]   I mean, you could put Skype on it if you had internet access.
[00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.620]   Well, you have your FaceTime right now.
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:28.620]   Yeah.
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:32.860]   And the thing is, is that you can put FaceTime Skype, go to meeting, hangouts, you know,
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.340]   all of those things are all available on it.
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:39.220]   You don't need cell service if you get Wi-Fi, and as Wi-Fi spreads, I don't know.
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.220]   Maybe that's a nutty.
[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:42.980]   I think that-- I personally think that part of this is a little bit of a hobby on Apple's
[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:43.980]   part.
[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:48.740]   Every update seems to make it easier to make voice calls without your cell service.
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:49.740]   Right.
[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.780]   You know, I mean, it's one of those things that they just keep on kind of creeping along.
[00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.300]   They're not making any announcements and--
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.700]   Well, no, they don't want to get anybody's dander up, you know?
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:56.700]   Plus, the equipment--
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:57.700]   Exactly.
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:58.700]   The equipment touches a perfect safe place to do this.
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.700]   And the hardware that goes into this is fully amortized.
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:01.940]   I mean, they've got the screens.
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.780]   The chips are probably bend versions of the A's.
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:05.780]   Right.
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:06.780]   It didn't pass the test to get into the iPhone.
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:09.060]   That's why they're under clocked, yeah.
[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:13.900]   So it probably costs them very little to put this product together, and they've got to
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:16.980]   keep it updated just if they haven't updated it so long just to keep it current.
[00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.620]   To speak in our chatroom points out, it does have the M8 chip so it could do the fitness
[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:21.620]   tracking.
[00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:22.620]   Yeah.
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:25.340]   So it's a fitness device, perhaps.
[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:28.980]   And it has to have something to do with the release of Apple Music, right?
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.100]   Because it's an Apple Music device.
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.100]   Oh, yeah, no.
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:37.540]   I mean, that was even when I had my, you know, on-background phone call with them about the
[00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:38.540]   device.
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:39.540]   I mean, that was definitely a highlight.
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:40.540]   Yeah.
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:41.540]   It worked with Apple Music.
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:46.340]   What's interesting is that the shuffle and the nano will not work with any of the offline
[00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:49.740]   files you download from Apple Music if you're not an iTunes match person.
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:53.180]   So if you've bought, you know, if you can download tracks to listen to offline with Apple
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:59.140]   Music, those offline tracks have DRM that do not work on iPod Touch or excuse me, the
[00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.220]   iPod Nano or the iPod shuffle.
[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:02.620]   They work on the Touch just fine.
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:04.100]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:05.100]   Yeah.
[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:09.940]   So that's the smarter chip allows you to do that.
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:10.940]   I guess so.
[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:11.940]   I have no idea.
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:15.580]   I mean, it's just, I guess because they haven't updated the other two iPods in so many years,
[00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.340]   it can't handle the new version of DRM they've put on.
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.340]   But yeah, it's weird.
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.500]   I know, I know I use one of them in my car because I don't really want to connect my
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.940]   car to my phone, you know, I'm using my phone for other things.
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:27.940]   I keep my classic in my car.
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:28.940]   So I, yeah.
[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:29.940]   Yeah.
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:33.100]   Although I have to say with Spotify, it's kind of everything you'd ever want.
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.340]   I don't know how XM and Sirius stay in business to be.
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:37.100]   I have XM and my, I have Sirius in my car.
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.100]   I never use it.
[00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:39.700]   And I'll say this for the series.
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.060]   Anybody works in series who's listening, the audio quality.
[00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:43.060]   It's terrible.
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.060]   Blows chunks.
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:45.060]   Man, it's awful.
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.820]   And you want to modify, you feel like, oh my God, the sound, I feel like I'm listening
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:49.820]   to real music.
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:50.820]   Yeah.
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.660]   It's because it's heavily compressed.
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:53.660]   That's why, by the way.
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:57.340]   I have to think that the Sirius and XM, they get a lot of their customers kind of the same
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:58.900]   way that AOL still keeps customers.
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:02.700]   So you buy the car and they give you like the first year, the free six months of the
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.100]   XM or Sirius or whatever.
[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.300]   And you forget to cancel.
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.380]   So we just wind up getting charged again.
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:13.260]   I mean, that's why my mom still into pain for satellite radio that she never really
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:14.260]   uses.
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:15.260]   You'd be crazy.
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:19.220]   Of course, Neil Young this week pulled all his music from Spotify.
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.620]   And all the streaming services.
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.100]   And all of them.
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.100]   Here's what's interesting.
[00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:28.580]   He will, he says, because the audio quality is terrible yet, yet he will still sell them
[00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:29.580]   on iTunes.
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.660]   Which is the same quality, right?
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:32.660]   320 kilobits AC.
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:35.060]   And I apologize to advanced editors.
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.140]   You're going to have to believe me here.
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:37.140]   It's bullish.
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.420]   It's total, total bullish.
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:40.340]   He's saying that it's an audio quality issue.
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:41.540]   It's not an audio quality issue.
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:42.540]   It was an audio quality issue.
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:43.940]   Then you'd also pull it from iTunes.
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:46.700]   It's clearly about money and pushing Pono in some way.
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:47.700]   I don't know.
[00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.660]   That's what makes perfect sense.
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:55.820]   Except for the fact that nobody who tests the Pono versus an iPhone can tell the difference.
[00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:58.620]   No, David Pogue, your former colleague.
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:01.020]   David, the definitive video on that.
[00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:06.100]   We didn't even do a video because we realized we finally, A, Pono would not send us once.
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:07.820]   We had to buy our own.
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:11.180]   B, we were trying to do a video doing the A/B test.
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.340]   We were like, we can't do this.
[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:17.700]   But the Pono player, can I just say that's the worst device I've ever used in yours?
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:18.700]   I love my Pono.
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:19.700]   I love it.
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:20.700]   Seriously?
[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:21.700]   Yeah.
[00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:22.700]   I'll completely argue with both of you on that.
[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:23.700]   There's a huge difference.
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.340]   In fact, and I'm a wait because we had Neil Young on triangulation.
[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:27.340]   He showed off.
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:30.540]   There's going to be an app on the next firmware update that will allow you to listen to the
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:33.220]   same song in a variety of different formats.
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:38.740]   You can listen to the native Pono version and 128 kilobits, 256 kilobits.
[00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.260]   I think that will be the final test.
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.060]   That's really how you have to do it because the levels have to be the same.
[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:44.700]   It has got to be the same.
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:45.700]   It is not.
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.060]   The way Pogue did it is a joke.
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.020]   Oh, okay, man.
[00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:50.020]   That's a joke.
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:53.020]   No, no, that's not, you know, here, listen on an iPhone.
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:54.220]   Okay, now listen on an iPhone.
[00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:55.380]   No, no, it's not how he did it.
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:56.380]   That's not how he did it.
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:25:00.620]   It was a blind test with the same headphones in a switcher with the audio levels normalized.
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:01.620]   Okay.
[00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:02.620]   It's a joke.
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:03.620]   Not a joke.
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:04.620]   I can hear the difference.
[00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:05.620]   Very serious.
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:06.620]   There's a big difference.
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:07.620]   And why would you...
[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:09.100]   I mean, look, you can make the argument.
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:10.660]   I think that's a legitimate argument.
[00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:14.180]   The difference between a CD and a high-res file.
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.300]   There you can make an argument.
[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:20.460]   No one can make the argument that AAC or MP3 heavily compress, lossy compression.
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.060]   Music sounds as good as uncompressed music.
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:23.060]   That's just not the case.
[00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:26.060]   Technically, you can't make that argument when you're listening to most people's headphones.
[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:27.060]   Most people are idiots.
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.780]   They have little white headphones.
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:30.420]   No, that's not the problem.
[00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:33.340]   No, they're using those crappy beats over the ear thing.
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:34.340]   Well, they can't tell.
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:35.980]   And they're spending $100, $200 bucks for those things.
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:37.340]   And you still can't tell the difference.
[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:39.340]   You may be, there is an audio difference.
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:40.340]   And I'm telling you...
[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:44.180]   If the only way I can tell the difference is if I have a mini DAC that I've got plugged
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:47.820]   in and I have $400 headphones and I'm in a pristine listing environment...
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:48.820]   Right.
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:49.820]   Sorry.
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:50.820]   Like, great.
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:51.820]   Oh, you're right.
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:52.820]   If you're sitting in the car, there's no difference.
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:53.820]   That's right.
[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:54.820]   Right.
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:55.820]   So that's my point.
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.220]   But my biggest problem with the PONO, to be totally honest, other than the fact that
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:01.780]   you can't put it in a pocket, the software that it comes with is the worst piece of crap
[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:02.780]   I've ever seen in my life.
[00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:03.780]   It's Android.
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:06.140]   No, the software on the computer to try to get this...
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:07.820]   The computer software is terrible.
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.180]   But you don't need to use that.
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.140]   You don't need to use that.
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.140]   You just...
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.140]   You put...
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.900]   You plug it in on the USB and it's an SD card and you copy the music over.
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.620]   You don't need to use that.
[00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:18.620]   And I'm looking.
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:23.740]   I'm the idiot that bought the little Apple, the heavy metal Apple with a USB key that
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:25.020]   had the Beatles music at 24.
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.020]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:27.020]   I'm that guy.
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:28.020]   So don't...
[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.020]   But that's the Beatles.
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:30.020]   I mean, you're forgiven.
[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.020]   I did that too.
[00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:32.020]   I did that too to get all the flak files.
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.020]   Yeah, that was fun.
[00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.020]   Yeah, I wanted the flak files.
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:35.020]   Well, there's a difference.
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.020]   Isn't there between MP3 and Flak?
[00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.020]   Look, there is.
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:38.060]   I mean, I don't look.
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:40.260]   I would like to think I can hear the difference realistically.
[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.860]   I can't, but here's my truth.
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.860]   And this is where I'm sort of a hypocrite on both ends.
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:46.940]   I primarily listen to music.
[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.260]   You know, 256 AAC compressed, whatever.
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:54.020]   But most of my CDs, most of my other stuff I have ripped in ALAC.
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.020]   Good.
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:56.020]   Sort of an awesome place.
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:57.020]   Nice.
[00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:58.900]   Just in case I need to transcode it to something else.
[00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:04.140]   And when I do rip things for easier listening, I typically use MP3 lame Vio as...
[00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:05.140]   There you go.
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:06.140]   You're the best compressed thing.
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:10.860]   So I drink the Kool-Aid, yet I'm also aware the Kool-Aid is, you know, stupid.
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:14.300]   Well, and I think that functionally, there is a market somewhere.
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:15.300]   Stacey.
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.500]   There's some people that want to have...
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.060]   Yeah, it's Stacey.
[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:22.660]   There are some people out there that actually do have the $1000 headset.
[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:24.700]   And one have one to be able to buy those.
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.300]   You know, because the headphones that they used in the David Pogue one, the problem is
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:29.660]   is that those aren't, don't have the resolution that you'd be able to sell the difference.
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:30.660]   Yes, of course not.
[00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:31.660]   Right.
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:33.820]   So it's like comparing two HD signals on SDTV.
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:34.820]   His point.
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:35.820]   And it's a reasonable point.
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:39.780]   He's a normal person in a normal environment listening to the normal crap that they use
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:40.780]   isn't going to be able to tell the difference.
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:41.780]   But that's true.
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:42.780]   Nobody denies that.
[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:43.780]   So who's going to buy it?
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:47.220]   So who cares about music is going to buy the best quality music.
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:52.900]   And look, and then there's a legitimate argument is a CD as good as it needs to be.
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.460]   And I think that that's a legitimate argument.
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:57.140]   I'm not going to get in the high-resversus CD.
[00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:01.060]   But I don't think there's anybody who's listening carefully with good equipment that
[00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:04.940]   can not tell that it was in AAC or MP3 and FLAC.
[00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:07.260]   There is a clear and obvious difference.
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:09.300]   I think it depends on how the music is being mastered.
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:12.900]   I think the bigger problem is that a lot of times even CDs are being mastered now.
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:13.900]   So that they're louder.
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.140]   That's the other end of this.
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:19.900]   So if it's mastered well on a good CD, I think a good CD is going to sound everybody
[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:21.500]   as good as high-res audio.
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.500]   Well, that's one thing you notice by the way, when you start listening to high-res audio
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:28.820]   is how bad you actually have to be careful and pick good stuff.
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:34.100]   For instance, there is on HD tracks, there's Band on the Run, Paul McCartney, and they
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:38.460]   have the version that was sold to everybody for the last 50 years or how long that stupid
[00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:39.780]   album's been out.
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.540]   And then they have an uncompressed, I'm talking about audio compression.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:43.540]   Right.
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:44.540]   Full range, full dynamic.
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.380]   It's a different album.
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:47.380]   Yeah.
[00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:48.780]   It's incredible.
[00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:49.780]   You hear the instruments.
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:52.980]   But even HD tracks, some of the stuff they will sell.
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:53.980]   I know, I know.
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:55.860]   And resolutions are still not masterable.
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:56.860]   So you'll buy an album.
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:57.860]   I did this where I bought an album.
[00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:58.860]   And I listened to it.
[00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:00.100]   And I went, this still sounds like crap.
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.700]   If I have the vinyl version of the same album, it sounds significantly better because it's
[00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:04.700]   been mastered better.
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:05.700]   That's right.
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:10.820]   The thing that gets me is that Neil Young's music might sound better in high-resolution
[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:13.020]   on massive speakers.
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:14.620]   I like Neil Young's music.
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:17.580]   I want to listen to it on Spotify when I am commuting.
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:18.580]   It pisses me off.
[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:19.580]   No, I agree.
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:20.580]   But it just pulls it off.
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:23.260]   I don't care if it's 3% better than high-res.
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:24.780]   I want it the way I have it now.
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:28.820]   But at least one massive advantage that Apple Music has, Google Music has it as well, which
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:33.060]   is that you add your own collection to the streaming music.
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:38.420]   So if you own all of Neil Young's albums, which I hope you do, you've got it on streaming.
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:39.420]   Spotify won't do that.
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:40.820]   But Apple Music will do that.
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:44.900]   And so will Google All Access Amazon will too, but they don't have the streaming selection.
[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:47.140]   I have a phone, can I can store my music in here as well?
[00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.140]   Yeah.
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:49.140]   And Spotify.
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.140]   Yeah.
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.140]   Sonos will let you do it.
[00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:53.380]   And I think a lot of artists want to try to control how people experience their art.
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:58.020]   I mean, THX was just there because George didn't like the way Star Wars looked.
[00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:59.020]   So we interviewed him.
[00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:03.260]   I highly recommend it because Neil does a very, I think a good defense of Pono on triangulation
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:04.260]   about a month ago.
[00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:08.100]   But one of the things I pointed out is, Neil, your last album, StoryTone, was recorded in
[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:11.900]   one of those sound booths where they do the cheap records that you buy for a buck and
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:12.900]   you take home.
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:13.900]   That was the...
[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:15.980]   So he said, "You are trying to do something.
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:19.660]   Talk about bad quality on purpose, but it's on purpose."
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:23.300]   And he said, "Look, what I want you to hear is what I hear in the studio.
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:28.460]   I want you to hear the sound that I was making as best as possible."
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:30.380]   And I think that's a reasonable thing for an artist.
[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:32.140]   Oh, save me from purists.
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:33.140]   What?
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:34.140]   An artist?
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:35.140]   That's his art.
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:36.140]   That's what he makes.
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:37.140]   It's rock and roll, man.
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.020]   And yes, it's art, but it's rock and roll.
[00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:40.300]   You listen to where you can.
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:41.300]   Well, and I pointed that out.
[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:48.780]   I said, "The Beatles got inspired by very crappy radio reception from pirate radio ships
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.180]   of American blues."
[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.820]   But that got him excited.
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:57.140]   You can have an emotional reaction to music even if it's terrible.
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:58.140]   Terrible reproduction.
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:59.620]   The Beatles still sounds better on mono.
[00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:04.460]   I mean, anybody who listens to the terrible stereo versions of Beatles early albums, what
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:05.460]   are you doing with your life?
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:10.660]   Yeah, that irked me because the green apple that cost so much money was all stereo.
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:11.660]   It's like, "Why don't you do that?"
[00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.180]   Then they released a mono version.
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:14.900]   I have the digital mono set.
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.700]   The CDs released a mono that I then read.
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:18.300]   Yeah, they released a mono version a year later.
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:19.300]   As CDs.
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.900]   Yeah, I don't think they ever did it on the Apple.
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:25.620]   They never did the 24-bit version was never released.
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.540]   No, but I got it on CDs.
[00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:30.380]   And then I did get the vinyl copies in mono too.
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:32.140]   Do you have a record player?
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.140]   I do.
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:34.140]   Wow.
[00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.700]   So can I say something about audio quality and how it can really change the experience?
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.020]   Just a little experience.
[00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:39.620]   So my son's birthday was Friday.
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:42.300]   And we took him to see the San Francisco Symphony.
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:46.020]   They were playing, they had Star Trek, the 2009 Star Trek.
[00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:48.740]   And they had, Symphony was playing the soundtrack.
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.580]   Let me guess, you teared up.
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.100]   Well, it's emotional.
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:58.380]   It's not the world's best movie, but with a full symphony blaring that music.
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:31:59.380]   It was amazing.
[00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:00.380]   Yeah.
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:01.900]   It was the best Star Trek I've ever seen.
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:02.900]   And this is the cause of the music.
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:06.180]   This is the argument and it's ineffable and it's probably not provable and there's certainly
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:11.860]   no science behind it, but that somehow there's more emotion in the full dynamic range of the
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:12.860]   music.
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:14.260]   And of course, there's nothing better than live.
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:15.780]   You want to hear it in a live environment.
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:18.500]   And I tell you what, I tear up.
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:22.220]   When I hear a great symphony playing great music, I feel it.
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:23.220]   Don't you?
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:24.220]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:25.220]   It's emotional.
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:26.220]   It was fantastic.
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:27.220]   All right.
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:30.220]   Let's move on.
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:32.900]   I'm not, let me do an ad read.
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:36.460]   I need to, I need to, I need to breathe for a little bit here.
[00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:40.260]   I wanted to ask, ask Alex, cause he's a former music director and a radio guy.
[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.940]   So I wanted to ask him, what he, have you listened to Beats One at all?
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:45.340]   I've listened to it a little bit.
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:46.340]   I thought it was fine.
[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:47.340]   I mean, it was, it was fine.
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.300]   It was, you know, it's something that I can't, I could listen to for a little while.
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:51.860]   It's better than the radio that I love radio.
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.420]   I grew up, this is all I ever wanted to do is radio, right?
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:55.420]   Yeah.
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:56.420]   And I, and I love doing it.
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:57.740]   I mean, I love to doing it.
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:00.460]   And I loved, and I do like listening to it when it's really good.
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:04.140]   I think it's better than any station that I, that I really can think of right now in the
[00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:05.980]   United States that I've listened to recently.
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:06.980]   Oh, great.
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:10.140]   But, but I don't, but that doesn't mean I still don't want to skip and as soon as I
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:11.540]   want to skip, I go back to Spotify.
[00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:12.540]   Right.
[00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:13.540]   That's the problem.
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:14.540]   You know, I just, that's the problem.
[00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.140]   How do you make one stream that everybody's going to like that everybody's going to want
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:18.820]   to hear the next song on the next song on the next song?
[00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:21.620]   And that's hard to do now that we don't have to.
[00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:23.340]   It was easy when we had to.
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:24.340]   There was no choice.
[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:28.260]   All you could do is push the button on the dodge and go to the next station.
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:31.380]   I still think we're in a very, very early stage of curation.
[00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:34.700]   I think that the automatic curation is not necessarily the right solution.
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:39.540]   I think that the, you know, doing it all by hand is not necessarily the right solution.
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:43.420]   I think there's a lot of places in between that haven't been managed well yet.
[00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:44.420]   Well, good.
[00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:47.540]   Good on Apple for trying something anyway.
[00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:51.540]   If you are ready to get a new gadget, maybe a new iPod touch, perhaps you would like to
[00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:52.900]   get rid of the old gadget.
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.220]   Can I tell you where to go?
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:34:02.740]   Gazelle, the best place to sell your old, even broken iPhone, iPad, Samsung, surface
[00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.340]   tablet, they give you top dollar.
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:05.340]   They make it easy.
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:06.580]   They give you a 30 day guarantee.
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:07.740]   So you're not even locked in.
[00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:11.620]   In fact, if you go right now and get the quote, get all that stuff that's stuck in a drawer
[00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:14.700]   somewhere, you wouldn't throw a $100 bill in a drawer and just leave it there.
[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:16.460]   Well, that's what you're doing.
[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:17.540]   Get it out.
[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:19.580]   Go to Gazelle.com, get a quote.
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:21.500]   Now you got 30 days to do something.
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:22.820]   You don't have to buy anything yet.
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:23.820]   You can just think about it.
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:27.620]   Sit on it, but get that quote because I can tell you one thing those devices are not gaining
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:29.020]   in value.
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.500]   They're going to be worth less than 30 days.
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.020]   So get it now.
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:34.820]   Now once you decide, okay, I'm ready to pull the trigger.
[00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:35.820]   You press the button.
[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:36.820]   You press the box.
[00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:38.380]   They pay the shipping on anything worth more than a buck.
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:40.820]   That's pretty much anything, right?
[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:45.980]   And then their experts will wipe the data if you forget or if it's broken and you can't.
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:48.900]   They'll also, sometimes up your offer.
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:53.540]   I've had this happen twice now where they say, oh, no, no, that's better than you said
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:54.540]   it was.
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:55.540]   So we're going to give you an end.
[00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:57.500]   And one time, gosh, they gave us like 40 bucks more.
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:58.820]   I was really thrilled.
[00:34:58.820 --> 00:34:59.820]   I never heard of it.
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:00.820]   They don't have to do that.
[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:03.500]   I never heard a company doing that, but they want to give you good service.
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:06.980]   They'll send you a check, a PayPal credit, or, and this is a good tip.
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:12.340]   If you're an Amazon user, an Amazon gift card, which they'll bump by 5%, so you get
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.300]   a little extra as well.
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.980]   Now, you may wonder what happens to the best stuff Gazelle gets.
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:18.180]   They sell it.
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:21.660]   They now have a certified pre-owned program.
[00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:27.460]   They'll sell devices in two conditions, certified like new or certified good, like news, like
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:28.460]   new, but certified good.
[00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:31.180]   Yeah, they're going to show a little sign of wear.
[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:36.300]   But if you're replacing a broken phone or tablet, it's a great idea for the kids.
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.340]   Great idea.
[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:41.980]   And every device that Gazelle sells has been put through its rigorous 30 point inspection.
[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:48.300]   They're fully functional and you have 30 days risk free to return it.
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:57.500]   So this is a great way to get a new gadget or an almost new gadget, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E Gazelle.com.
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.940]   Just write it down, keep a note on it.
[00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:03.340]   And whatever you do, stop throwing the old gadgets in the drawer.
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:12.780]   That's like putting cash in the trash, Gazelle.com.
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:15.300]   Wow, Friday, do you see Google stock?
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:16.660]   They did pretty well.
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:19.540]   Holy come, Molly.
[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:21.380]   Have a good quarter and that's what can happen.
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.780]   A very, very good quarter.
[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:26.820]   Not only that, YouTube had the best quarter it's ever had.
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:31.140]   Average YouTube viewing time is now 40 minutes.
[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.140]   I'm not cool.
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:35.700]   It doesn't sound like a lot, but as somebody who's watched ratings from TV and radio for
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:36.700]   years, that's huge.
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:38.900]   Nobody has anything online for 40 minutes.
[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:42.060]   That's the thing about this, this has got to be cumulative over a day staring at your
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:43.060]   little phone.
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:49.060]   60% growth year over year and they now are bigger in the most important demographic, 18
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:51.260]   to 49 than any cable channel.
[00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:55.020]   18 to 49 is everybody.
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.460]   You're looking at me when you say that?
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:57.460]   Except us.
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:05.060]   You know, it's really sad when I went past 54, I thought, now really nobody cares.
[00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:07.420]   You know, nobody cares.
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:10.220]   We used to, in radio, we used to call it 55 to dead.
[00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:13.340]   Like, that's the demographic nobody cares about.
[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:14.860]   I would like to change that by the way.
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:17.740]   I think that's not really appropriate.
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:20.220]   Big revenue for Google.
[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:24.340]   They had one of the things that makes it exciting for investors is not just that they
[00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:26.940]   made a lot more money, but it shows that they've turned it around.
[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.420]   They diversify their income.
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:30.420]   Yeah.
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.220]   Mobile viewing, mobile ads all up.
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:36.700]   There's a lot of concern about mobile ads and whether that can, those can make it.
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:40.100]   Google certainly was had seen dropping click, cost per clicks.
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:41.100]   Oh boy.
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.100]   Things like that.
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:43.660]   Which affects everybody in media.
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:44.660]   Yes.
[00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:45.660]   Everybody.
[00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:46.660]   Yeah.
[00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:48.300]   That explains Gawker.
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:49.300]   Which part?
[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:50.300]   I know.
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:51.300]   Yes, seriously.
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.380]   Let's not even go out.
[00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:56.460]   Is Nick Denton not the most horrible human alive today?
[00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:57.460]   Oh, wait, wait.
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:01.060]   Nick Denton, he pulled, if we're talking about the same thing, I think we're talking about
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:02.060]   with the story.
[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:03.060]   He pulled the story.
[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.060]   He pulled the story.
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:05.060]   And then why?
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:06.740]   Because it was a terrible story.
[00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:07.740]   Because it's law suitable.
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:08.740]   No, because it's a complaint.
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.700]   Well, it's also, it's also, you know, that you're protected.
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:15.260]   Like, when he slanders me, which he does regularly, I can't sue him because I'm a public
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:16.260]   figure.
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:18.100]   Well, I can, but there's a much higher standard.
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:19.460]   You're a much higher statute.
[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:20.460]   This is not a piece of knowledge.
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:23.940]   I would have to show Mal and Tint on his part, like he's trying to get me.
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:29.700]   But in this case, this guy, it's a scurrilous and almost certainly untrue article, very
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:30.700]   poorly sourced.
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.380]   It's not a public figure.
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:33.380]   Right.
[00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:34.380]   He's an editor at a magazine.
[00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:36.180]   He's not a public figure.
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:37.180]   He's not a senator.
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:39.420]   He's not Anthony Wiener.
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:41.220]   He's just some guy.
[00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:42.980]   The story is almost certainly untrue.
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:45.820]   He has great standing for a lawsuit.
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:46.820]   And I think that's the reason.
[00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:50.660]   And by the way, it's too late, even if Nick Denton pulled it, the article came out on
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:53.940]   Thursday, pulled it on Friday, still was out long enough.
[00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:57.860]   And the editors of Gawker are furious at him for doing that, for pulling it.
[00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:59.700]   Yeah, free speech, man.
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:05.300]   Well, they're mad because from people I've talked to there is that it was a, they see
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:08.140]   it as a Chinese wall problem.
[00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:09.740]   So they're seeing it even if-
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:12.540]   Well, if it is advertisers, then they're right.
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:15.300]   Well, that's what it was, from what I understand.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:18.300]   The advertisers should never be allowed in for the influencer, editorial.
[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:20.660]   It was the legal team and then the advertising and then the-
[00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:21.660]   Legal's different.
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:26.340]   Well, legal and ad- and the ad people were like, hey, this is this is bad.
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:31.540]   So I think that, you know, the thing from people I've talked to a Gawker is that they
[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:34.940]   were upset, even the people who disagreed that the post should have been published to
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:38.740]   begin with don't like that it was pulled for the reasons that it was pulled.
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:39.740]   The whole thing is just a mess.
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:42.260]   I just, I'm hoping Hulk Hogan's suing him for $100 million.
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:46.940]   I hope he wins every penny and puts the whole blight out of business.
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:51.260]   But you know what the internet is blighted in every respect.
[00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:52.900]   Every respect it is blighted.
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:54.420]   Except for the in me?
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.940]   Yeah, and me and D.
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:57.940]   Yeah.
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:59.780]   Go- back to Google.
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:03.180]   Actually, should we stick with, you want to do Reddit?
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:05.740]   I'm sure they've talked about Reddit over the past few weeks.
[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:10.100]   I'm watching on a boat thanking God that I am not-
[00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:14.380]   Because I would not, I do not know what to say about this.
[00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:17.740]   On the one hand, there was reprehensible content on Reddit.
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:22.300]   On the other hand, it's a Lex, and there still is, and Alexis O'Hanean and Steve Hoffman,
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:28.100]   the new CEO who's replaced Allen Powell, both said that Reddit is a bastion of free
[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:30.860]   speech despite their later denials.
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:31.860]   They said it.
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:32.860]   Right.
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:34.980]   And so which is it?
[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:36.220]   You can't have it both ways.
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:40.540]   Well, the difference is it was a bastion of free speech before they had $50 million investment
[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:41.540]   from venture capitalists.
[00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:49.780]   It's a bastion of free speech when you're a very lightly staffed subsidiary of Conde Nast.
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:54.860]   It's not a bastion of free speech when you are now a subsidiary of advanced publication
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:59.500]   of advanced media and you have a $50 million investment from Enducian Horowitz.
[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:06.380]   And you need to actually get advertisers to buy ads on the filth that proliferates your
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:07.380]   platform.
[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:08.380]   I don't know.
[00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:13.820]   So Steve Hoffman on Thursday did AMA kind of ironic in which he posted new rules and talked
[00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:19.420]   about new rules for Reddit.
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:24.700]   And I have to say, I've gone through the thought exercise on my whole vacation of what would
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:25.700]   I do?
[00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:28.260]   The first thing you think is, well, it's easy.
[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:32.020]   You just ban hate speech, you ban to find hate speech.
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.020]   Exactly.
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:34.020]   It's not that easy.
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:35.020]   No, it's yeah.
[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:37.100]   I mean, as you were going to get to, obviously, I mean, it's really hard.
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.860]   I mean, there are things that are illegal.
[00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:40.780]   There are things that are damaging one person's hate.
[00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:42.180]   Well, you're legal easy because illegal.
[00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:43.180]   No, it's not.
[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:46.220]   Well, there are some things that are clearly there is there are some things that are clearly
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:48.620]   over the line, but some things are not bullying behavior.
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:49.620]   Right.
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:54.020]   That's open to interpretation in some in there are it's a fuzzy line.
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:55.020]   There are things that are clearly over the line.
[00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:57.940]   There are things that are not there's a big broad middle of the fuzziness.
[00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:02.140]   And you can point out as some have that there is more white supremacist content on Reddit
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:06.940]   than there ever was on Storm Front or any of these white supremacist groups.
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:10.980]   But that's not illegal until it becomes threatening.
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:13.700]   The witness that's free speech is not.
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:17.580]   But the litmus test for Reddit or any other company is not whether it's legal or not.
[00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:18.580]   No, I understand.
[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.780]   Free speech only applies to government.
[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:25.420]   And yeah, no one says that that Reddit or Steve up and can't say right now, we're just
[00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:28.580]   going to arbitrarily kill anything we don't like.
[00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:33.980]   He can of course do that, but he does it at his peril because and this is the problem
[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:38.180]   Twitter has and Facebook has and everybody has the content is not created by Reddit.
[00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:43.140]   The content is created by us Reddit is community content, but it's run by individuals at a
[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:44.420]   company.
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:49.260]   So well what the moderators are not individuals at a company there are correct the public
[00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:50.260]   as well.
[00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:53.580]   And that's but at some point Reddit has its keys.
[00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:57.860]   The people at Reddit have their keys on their things on the buttons.
[00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:04.140]   So is that the question is, is that the right model for Reddit or has Reddit outgrown the
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:09.180]   standard model of here, we're going to run a red site, a website and give moderation
[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:11.900]   capabilities to these various people.
[00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:17.940]   Is it time for that model to change to where the business people or the people running
[00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:22.860]   the site step away and it becomes more of a different kind of public trust where people
[00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:25.900]   can vote up or vote down whether something should be banned.
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:32.460]   That's the point that many of the Redditors make, which is A, you shouldn't you should
[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:36.780]   be allowed to put stuff that we disagree with up on Reddit and we will use the up and down
[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:44.660]   vote to make sure that we you know respond which again and isn't that the best way to
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:50.580]   do it is a utopian fantasy that will actually work because it's easy enough for somebody
[00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:58.300]   to have a campaign and game that system where really horrible stuff could be pushed through
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:01.820]   by a lot of up votes and the down votes wouldn't have a chance in hell.
[00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:06.580]   And what typically happens more often not is that you see some people gaming the system
[00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:08.300]   to push the down votes.
[00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:12.700]   You know to push good content down you know that's where trolls usually exist more at
[00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.300]   least from our experience from doing a lot of things that are similar to what Reddit
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:19.580]   does is that the down the there's a big reason why there's no down arrow in Facebook and
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:23.140]   there's no down arrow and Google plus and there's no down arrow because it's that's
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:25.380]   where things get really tend to be gamed.
[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:28.700]   And so I think that but I think that you know as soon as you decide you want to turn
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:32.940]   into a business you generally have you know like like the streets of San Francisco you
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:36.020]   have to start cleaning up the streets before people are going to put businesses there and
[00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:40.140]   I think that they're they you know they had it all as a free for all and then they decided
[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:44.060]   they want to make money with it and they might have to decide between the two like how much
[00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:48.020]   investment can be made and it's really tricky to do it in the middle.
[00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:51.260]   You know that's the hardest part of a social network is you you create a bunch of rules
[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:55.500]   and now you changing the rules in the middle are you going to gain enough people you know
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:45:00.140]   coming in because it's cleaned up to afford to lose what could be I mean they may have
[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:06.180]   to decide we're going to get rid of 30 40 50 percent of our of our you know community
[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:11.940]   so that we can you know excise that out and even people who weren't necessarily outrageous
[00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:16.100]   but we're but don't believe in cutting off that speech.
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:20.100]   You know are they willing to cut 40 50 percent of their community to gain possibly more
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:22.220]   and I think that's remains to be seen.
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:30.580]   Well okay you guys stop uh stop hedging your bets here what should Reddit do?
[00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:32.180]   I'd say clean it up.
[00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:35.540]   Clean up so is Steve Huffman doing the right thing is he not doing enough should he do
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:36.540]   more?
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:37.980]   I don't think he's doing enough.
[00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:41.140]   Yeah I don't think he's doing enough I think that you need to you need to get rid of the
[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:43.900]   right the white supremacists you need to get I mean we're just not you know we're we're
[00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:45.780]   done with that you know like like he has to get that all.
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:50.660]   It's like our repeat woman is a account it's gone as it should be but but sea town is
[00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:55.020]   a lot to stay like honestly you can't draw the line that arbitrarily if you're going
[00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:59.100]   to clean it up clean it up if you're not don't so I to me if you've either got to defend
[00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:04.100]   it all the way or you've got to actually take um real action to get rid of the filth.
[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:05.980]   So he's not gone far enough.
[00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:06.980]   I don't think so.
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:10.140]   Well it's got to go I think the problem right now is the straddling defense you know and
[00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:14.140]   he needs to be they either need to let go and keep continue to down that path or they
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:17.620]   need to completely go and they have to do it quickly so that you know they can start
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:21.260]   making that rather than this whole back and forth just leaves everybody upset for a long
[00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:23.100]   time.
[00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:27.180]   I don't envy them I mean I know Alexis and Steve both have been on triangulation I have
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:29.500]   a lot of respect for both of them.
[00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:33.260]   I mean and honestly a lot of this stuff isn't their fault you know Steve is coming back in
[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:34.380]   after being away for years.
[00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:38.820]   Alexis was a away for a long time and and came back.
[00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:42.540]   A lot of this kind of you know the community grew I would criticize and I would say you
[00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:46.820]   know when they started to see this was becoming a problem back during the violent acres period
[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:53.300]   so back when you had you know the creep shots and and and the you know jail bait and and
[00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:58.460]   that kind of era that was when I think that the the people had read it and I don't know
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:02.020]   if Steve and Alexis were so really heavily involved then or not I don't think they were.
[00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:03.020]   No I don't think they were.
[00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:06.940]   They should have stepped in and they should have said okay this is now where it's starting
[00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:11.580]   to cross the line and we need to start moving the community away from this sort of thing.
[00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:17.060]   I think that it didn't and so but it you know became even more known for having kind
[00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:20.860]   of you know the reputation where anything goes and kind of celebrated that and grew
[00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:22.340]   in large part because of that.
[00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:26.420]   I think the problem with that is that obviously now it's gotten to the point where it's so
[00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:30.380]   big they're not making money off of it despite its bigness they're trying to make money
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:34.940]   off of it and realizing oh actually this is now a really kind of terrible place in a lot
[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:39.100]   of respects and a lot of really great things happen here but a lot of really terrible
[00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:40.900]   things happen here too.
[00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:45.220]   Is it okay to use Reddit and ignore the bad stuff that's going on and just say well I'm
[00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:47.980]   only going to go to the subreddits that are good.
[00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:48.980]   Is that okay?
[00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:51.900]   It depends I mean I think you can.
[00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:52.900]   Well I mean I think you can.
[00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:58.660]   Well but there some have said there is a moral there you have a moral imperative not
[00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:03.780]   to use Reddit at all because any use of Reddit supports see town and these other things.
[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:04.780]   No.
[00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:07.340]   I don't know if I'd go that far I mean you could say the same thing about use net or
[00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:11.500]   any other kind of you know big network forum things that are that are about regard.
[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:14.700]   I wouldn't go that far I mean if someone wanted to boycott the whole thing because of
[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:17.260]   some of the objectionable stuff obviously that's their right.
[00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:23.220]   But I don't think that it means that just because you like certain subreddits that have
[00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:26.860]   nothing to do with the other stuff and you have your own community ecosystem that you
[00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:33.100]   should somehow feel guilty because other parts of this kind of weird you know octopus of
[00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:35.260]   networks has nasty stuff in it.
[00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:40.140]   I think the bigger problem is that because they didn't step in four years ago a lot of
[00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:45.260]   the stuff that's happening now is happening and I don't know if I almost feel like it's
[00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:48.300]   too late it's like I don't know what Steve can do I don't think he's doing enough but
[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:53.580]   this so I don't know what more he can do other than starting with baby steps because
[00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:59.540]   I do fear for their their sake you know we've seen how quick communities can just disappear
[00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:04.740]   and in even humongous sites can just die in nanoseconds and I think that's probably
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:10.460]   going to happen to Reddit because what it once was is not going to be what it is again
[00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:13.620]   and that doesn't mean that what it could be couldn't be great but they're kind of in
[00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:20.340]   this period of you know change and lots of things happening that the one advantage they
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:24.140]   have the only reason I think that people haven't jumped ship already the way that people did
[00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:31.020]   from dig is that dig had Reddit to support the the overflow of people what is there to
[00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:37.060]   replace Reddit there isn't anything so until there's a replacement for run it they're okay
[00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:42.620]   but little by little you know the people who you know for for right or for a good or for
[00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:46.740]   a little kind of keep the community running and and keep things happening and the the
[00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:50.900]   wheels turning are going to disappear and that's a problem.
[00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:57.620]   Boy you know what's so funny about this is that I don't see any of this stuff on I'm
[00:49:57.620 --> 00:50:03.340]   not a super huge user of Reddit but I there I do read it I get a lot of information from
[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:08.340]   there and all the horrible stuff that's on Reddit I never see I've never seen it I just
[00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:13.300]   I'm not deep enough into it and you you wouldn't there's no way to see it unless you actively
[00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:21.380]   see and if Reddit has to die because of hateful whatever it is crap that most people probably
[00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:25.780]   never ever see that's just a tragedy I mean but I don't think that I think that if we
[00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:29.700]   decide that 90% of the traffic is really not that I think that they don't have a lot to
[00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:33.780]   risk I think they have a lot of really angry folks that that are 10 or 15% of the market
[00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:37.740]   it might be more than that it could be 25 30% but I think people like us like I I'm in
[00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:41.540]   the same boat I see Reddit when I do a search for something and there's a discussion that
[00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:45.540]   pops up I mean I don't really go in there a place is there a place on the internet for
[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:52.340]   somewhere that anything goes what each and yeah actually I guess using that is that the
[00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:56.740]   news groups there's no there because there is no central commercial entity of law the
[00:50:56.740 --> 00:51:01.660]   thing about Reddit that makes it such a lightning rod for this is that it's so easy to get this
[00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:05.420]   horrible stuff that is well you have to do out there and available it's not easier on
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:10.940]   a look yeah well and it happened it started with the fappening what I think the mainstream
[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:15.940]   got aware of this was you want those nude pictures oh you go to Reddit.
[00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:19.300]   Go to Reddit and the thing is is that because the front page of Reddit is driven not just
[00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:23.780]   by things you follow but also by other things from the community oftentimes the front page
[00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:27.940]   you'll end up seeing something maybe you didn't want to see so for instance I mean and that's
[00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:31.860]   where the corrosive aspects of the community do tend to fall into other subreddits so if
[00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:35.020]   you're a new Reddit user and you sign up you know you're automatically subscribed to a
[00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:42.300]   few big subreddits and if you know our images has really gross content or if some of these
[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:48.300]   other popular our news or things are happening big controversy you can be made aware of some
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:52.660]   of the bigger stuff that's happening in the community whether you want to or not I also
[00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:57.780]   think that the you know while although many parts of Reddit are very nice part of the
[00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:00.900]   tenor of the conversation because it has kind of been known as this place for anything
[00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:05.940]   can happen is corrosive I was talking with a friend of mine a guy I work with and he wanted
[00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:10.140]   to look back and see his very first Reddit comment and so he blogged in to see something
[00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:16.460]   from like 2010 and the first response to him was calling him a guy and saying something
[00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:20.340]   terrible to him and so he kind of realized oh from the very beginning something that
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:25.100]   I said that it was completely innocuous it was really this terrible so there's certainly
[00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:28.140]   I think that there's an element where you're allowed to act a certain way on Reddit and
[00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:32.500]   it's acceptable in a lot of the communities whereas it wouldn't be acceptable in a lot
[00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:36.820]   of other online spaces yeah there are of course read an alternatives out there there's one
[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:42.340]   called vote the OAT which is I think a lot of people are fleeing to saying well we want
[00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:47.620]   unlimited free speech yeah that's where a lot of the the fact people hate and the other
[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:52.860]   kind of terrible terrible people have gone I'm really torn I don't think it's is I don't
[00:52:52.860 --> 00:53:00.980]   think it's easy at all I think well I don't know I feel like freest I can see both sides
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:06.980]   of the case let's put it that way we don't allow free speech in our chat room obviously
[00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:10.700]   we have moderators we have rules and we're very clear about those rules we've never said
[00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:14.060]   though that the chat was a bastion of free speech it's your right that that's that's
[00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:17.300]   the problem is but at the same time I understand it's community driven and I want it to be
[00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:22.820]   community run so we let the community run it I don't run it so that's a kind of a
[00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:27.220]   compromise I guess right but you've got you don't have 50 billion people in your chat
[00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:32.500]   room that's what happens right if it's a small number every website every internet
[00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:38.220]   gathering spot every community is great and then there's some number that it twi it flips
[00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:42.060]   the well was like that it's using it's a mixture of things I mean and I think that one of it's
[00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:46.540]   one of the reasons that you know Facebook adheres to or tries to push things like your
[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:52.580]   real name I know when when we had a fledgling social network that we were building we required
[00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:57.020]   a photo that looked like you I kind of want to do that I kind of want to you have to show
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:01.820]   a newspaper and a picture here's well we had it basically when you registered ours was
[00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:07.620]   a paid social networks you know and and use a credit card yeah yeah well you we knew who
[00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:11.820]   you were and you needed to use your name and you know and we actually have instructions
[00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:18.020]   on how to build your your profile picture and so so but it was really it was amazing
[00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:24.140]   how just that one simple you know action cleaned up all the conversation because you know you
[00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:28.980]   you really everyone knew who you were and that takes a lot of that a lot of the stuff
[00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:32.580]   out that that bothers us and then of course everyone reported everyone else and you also
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:35.780]   just created a culture we created a culture that was very much like that's not going to
[00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:39.300]   be appropriate but isn't there a point there's two points there's a point to be made that
[00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:44.060]   really free speech is good because it challenges your preconceived notions and it opened and
[00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:50.500]   if it's a terrible idea if it's racism if it's fat hate then you should know it exists
[00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:53.820]   and you should fight it with all your might and it weren't for free speech you might not
[00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:59.420]   and you know I think there's an argument that I think open and free is a good thing but
[00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:03.420]   there's also the argument that an anonymity is a good thing now I agree with you in fact
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:07.620]   we talked about this on the when I did the Nerdist Chris Hardwick said you know if people
[00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:11.180]   had to identify themselves there'd be no problem because people most of the time will not
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:16.100]   say horrendous things if you know who they are and that's your that's your position I
[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:20.420]   guess Alex but but there's also a case where you need to be anonymous there's reasons there
[00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:25.660]   is and Chris and Chris and Chris Poole would argue that from Fortun for a long time yeah
[00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:31.140]   and to do a good effect but you know where you draw the line is the hard part because
[00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:37.740]   we could like I said everybody could agree on certain cases but one of the things that's
[00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:42.380]   coming up right now in academia is this whole issue of things that offend or trigger people
[00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:49.140]   whole trigger warning issue yeah and at some point at a lot of points people just fundamentally
[00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:54.060]   disagree on what is acceptable and what is not acceptable and both people could be completely
[00:55:54.060 --> 00:56:00.460]   reasonable well meaning people who completely disagree on something being well that's fine
[00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:04.660]   people should be exposed to it it's the world or that is completely utterly unacceptable
[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:09.940]   and must not be allowed to be seen by anybody and and that's kind of not right that's not
[00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:15.700]   what we want right well it's not what we want I understand the university but I but I feel
[00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:20.180]   right and I think that there's generally I think that I think that when you have a business
[00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:23.900]   then a community that you're trying to build it with a certain flavor to it I think that
[00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:28.100]   you know having a lot of control makes a lot of sense I think that in a lot of rules of
[00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:33.900]   engagements of how and we do I mean we're the exactly we have a Lee control right and I
[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:36.660]   think that but I think I don't believe the government should make it illegal and I don't
[00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:40.140]   think and I do think there are a lot there are plenty of places but I think Reddit's
[00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:43.620]   making a business needs to make a business decision and that's you know it's not a they're
[00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:47.020]   not making a political decision about whether a free speech should ever exist but I think
[00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:50.580]   they need to make a business decision about whether they want that kind of free speech
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:54.020]   on their site where they're trying to sell ads next to it I mean we have their future
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:57:00.820]   for Reddit are they done I don't know why it's not a big thing where it's like going
[00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:05.820]   to be this like I think they've been around a lot longer they have a lot more actually
[00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:10.420]   they have it they're the same age as dig yeah this I mean I think that there's a place
[00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:14.420]   for anybody to just go to I mean I think honestly I think that if there was already
[00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:18.300]   an entrance community where people could go then it would be a lot easier to say that
[00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:23.260]   they're done I think because there's not I don't think that they're done that said I
[00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:28.060]   think that you know they have a very limited time period to kind of work this stuff out
[00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:34.460]   yeah I think it's public opinion public opinion issue about whether they're in control and
[00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:38.100]   for their advertisers for their investors I think it's it's mostly you know feeling like
[00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:41.220]   they get they push it out I mean we have to figure what afford to lose half of their they
[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:44.620]   can lose half their time still make money they have a hundred forty million unique so
[00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:48.740]   much we have to figure out what read it is I mean is it a common carrier is it a university
[00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:54.740]   is it somebody's private party right and tell me what read it is and that discussion becomes
[00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:58.820]   much easier I don't want to live in a world where there isn't somewhere where anybody
[00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:03.700]   can say anything I think that's important I know this sounds weird but I think there
[00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:11.900]   is a good argument to be made that I don't think people should be allowed to incent you
[00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:16.060]   know to encourage violence against other people well you just undid what you just said
[00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:20.700]   then well and I think that the reason that we have the but but that's what that's the
[00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:28.180]   first amendment in fact says you know as long as you don't incite to violence or you know
[00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:34.100]   then anything goes that's the first amendment that's really yes it's really vague yeah and
[00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:40.260]   then of course many just Supreme Court cases and others redefining it a little bit but
[00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:45.100]   I don't think that that's a bad standard and I reason I say that is you there's there's
[00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:48.580]   horrible things people can say so we need a supreme court but they need to be able to
[00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:53.820]   say that and I think it's valuable that it said and it's exposed otherwise it goes underground
[00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:57.260]   mm-hmm well and also it builds up pressure when people don't feel like they're heard when
[00:58:57.260 --> 00:59:01.860]   they don't feel like they can say anything you know that those are the people who oftentimes
[00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:05.500]   become violent and so there's a good reason to have you know outlets for people to say
[00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:09.740]   it rather than do it so I think that it is important I you know so I definitely think
[00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:12.540]   there should be places on the internet that allow that and just the question is is whether
[00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:17.700]   read it is that place and I should be clear the first amendment is not as ambiguous it
[00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:21.900]   says the government should a lot of bridge free speech but subsequent court cases have
[00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:25.540]   narrowed it to say you know there are some limits on that you can't shout for fire in
[00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:30.140]   a crowded theater you can't cite to violence things like that I think it's a good conversation
[00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:33.700]   I wanted to have this I know it's a little bit old news although Steve Huffman's rules
[00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:39.260]   just came out so maybe maybe there's some timeliness to it but I was sitting here watching
[00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:42.460]   this as I'm floating down the river there's nothing else to do and I'm thinking boy I
[00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:49.820]   want to talk about this good week to be on a river except for the 95 degrees heat wave
[00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:57.380]   in Europe yes let's take a break come back Google is challenging Apple for beacons it's
[00:59:57.380 --> 01:00:03.020]   kind of interesting they've also hired some folks from home joy we'll talk about what
[01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:07.700]   home joy is all about but I'll let your imagination think about it for a little bit until we do
[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:16.140]   60 billion dollars to the stock in one day on Friday 60 billion 65 billion dollars in
[01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:23.220]   stock worth what's the percentage raise on that 8% yeah yeah I'll give you some idea
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:29.140]   that's amazing I would like to talk to talk about Windows Microsoft you know we're just
[01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:36.620]   11 days off 10 days off from Windows 10 mm-hmm such in a dollar giving a marriage of fully
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:42.220]   an excellent interview talk about that taking a 7 billion plus dollar write off on Windows
[01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:51.620]   phone as well lots more to talk about but meanwhile let's take a break and see I actually
[01:00:51.620 --> 01:01:03.340]   want to see this what happened when I was gone this week on Twitter for it previously
[01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:09.500]   on Twitter Windows weekly Mary Jo Foley got some sit down time with such what was very
[01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:13.020]   interesting about this interview they said you can talk to him about anything you want
[01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:18.220]   you've got 30 minutes one thing that I thought was complete the notion that he decided to
[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:26.380]   make Windows 10 free to help Windows phone is absurd the new screen savers this is the
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:32.220]   making make you use things in everyday life to make a circuit that's cool purpose of it
[01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:38.500]   is to take any everyday object whether it's a bobblehead a banana grandma or a plant or
[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:43.460]   a flower and control any part of your computer using any software and should take no more
[01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:48.540]   than a minute even if you have no experience know how this is a great opportunity to do
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:53.660]   a little science fair stuff if we want to test whether or not this phone soap is going
[01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:57.980]   to be able to get rid of the bacteria on this phone oh you're gonna swab it we're doing
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:04.820]   a bacterial test because it's gonna pull over good thing nothing ever goes wrong this
[01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:09.940]   is your brain this is your brain on Twitter any questions they asked me if they could
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:17.660]   test the bacterial content of my keyboard I said no I don't want to know just best left
[01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:23.140]   unknown what's coming up on the week ahead Mike Elgin has it the story coming up this
[01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:29.060]   week IBM reports earnings tomorrow July 20 also tomorrow PayPal and eBay will officially
[01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:34.620]   become two separate companies then on Tuesday Apple Microsoft Yahoo and Verizon will announce
[01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:39.620]   their earnings Tuesday is also the day when Google+ Photos app for Chrome will no longer
[01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:44.500]   work photos won't be deleted but can be found in Google photos Qualcomm reports earnings
[01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:50.220]   on Wednesday also on Wednesday Xiaomi is expected to unveil a new steel smartphone Huawei is
[01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:55.400]   probably gonna announce their new Honor X smartphone Wednesday as well and then on Thursday
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:03:00.340]   Pandora and Amazon will have their earnings calls and Best Buy is holding a sale on Friday
[01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:05.340]   and Saturday called Black Friday in July that's what's coming up this week back to you Leo
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:10.740]   you guys buy anything on the Prime Day on Wednesday missed it there's all crap I got
[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:16.580]   some headphones how much did you say do you get a beat to do $80 no I got some both headphones
[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:23.100]   that's a lot 150 and there were 150 I got them for 70 oh okay I think that Wednesday
[01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:28.500]   was actually one of the few days that ever that I didn't buy some it's amateur day you
[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:31.820]   don't want to be there in the amateur I was like I don't know I don't know what happened
[01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:34.740]   I don't know how I missed that you know I don't know Mike didn't mention but it's not
[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:39.660]   this week it's a week coming up and I'm wondering if you're gonna go Christina that Motorola is
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:44.900]   having an event in New York on July 28th oh yeah yeah no if I don't go then someone else
[01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:49.700]   from the team I hope you go because I have always had a soft spot my heart and maybe my
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:55.540]   head for the Moto X I love the first generation little less on the second generation and I
[01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:58.980]   presume I love the second generation but I bet a guy like the Moto X I love the Moto
[01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:04.020]   G I have to say that's yeah and I presume they're gonna announce something something new along
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:10.900]   those lines right and maybe a new Moto X the the invitation did have it looked like X
[01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:17.580]   O X but actually if you look at it carefully it's X G X that's like a six oh that's cool
[01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:22.100]   so that implies maybe there's a new G and two new X's I don't know that's what some said
[01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:28.420]   it's a really bad game of tic-tac-toe okay well let us know Christina because I I'm curious
[01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:33.460]   of course we got rumors that there's a new galaxy S six plus edge over what is it something
[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:39.620]   new Motorola's gonna announce the one plus two is coming out one plus two and even an
[01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:46.980]   even a rumor that the note five which normally motor Samsung announces in the fall at EFA
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:54.380]   will be announced this month as well so we'll be a lot of stuff going on our show today
[01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:59.140]   brought to you I should have said that all before the gazelle actually get your quotes
[01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:04.660]   now because there's new phones coming our show today brought to you by fresh books which is
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:12.260]   such a lifesaver for anybody who's doing invoicing small businesses or freelancers I was one of
[01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:17.860]   them I discovered fresh books ten years ago and it saved my life because I was never doing
[01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:22.540]   the invoices as putting it off fresh books makes it easy not only to send an invoice
[01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:27.420]   but you'll get paid faster because it makes it easy for your clients to pay you using
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:32.380]   online payment services of their choice and that's really nice you can use fresh books
[01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:36.940]   to create and send invoices you can also use the fresh books app to capture and manage
[01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:42.420]   expenses you can even take pictures of receipts and time and hours couldn't be easier you use
[01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:46.860]   the app keep track of it assign it to a client and all of that then gets sucked right up
[01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:53.260]   into the invoice at the end of every month you've got it done it's so nice easy to use
[01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:59.500]   in fact they've done some research most fresh books users save around 16 hours a month on
[01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:05.020]   admin tasks it's like two full workdays a month and they get paid an average of five
[01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:10.180]   days faster I think you're gonna like that I can stay I can absolutely verify that of
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:14.620]   course I was getting paid faster because I never invoiced so even that as a start
[01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:18.660]   invoicing every month made a huge difference for me and if you ever need support there
[01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:23.420]   the fresh book support rock stars are ready by the phones they will amaze you with their
[01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:29.220]   helpfulness really great people up there in Toronto I am a fan I used them for a long
[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:33.980]   time and your account will love it come tax time to easy to get started free for 30 days
[01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:38.900]   there's no obligation go to fresh books calm slash twit just do me one favor when they
[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:45.100]   ask you how do you hear about a say twit fresh books calm slash twit a 30 day free trial
[01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:50.300]   awaits and you know I think you're gonna tell me it makes a big difference fresh books
[01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:58.140]   dot com slash we're talking about apple and they announced it was like a year ago I beacon
[01:06:58.140 --> 01:07:03.700]   the using bluetooth le the idea was that your iPhone could announce its presence you'd
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:08.340]   be in a store and it would either trigger a display in the store or maybe you'd get
[01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:14.700]   a coupon on the iPhone this kind of lightweight location system I remember Alex when we started
[01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:20.180]   talking about on Mac break people were very bullish about this nothing has happened well
[01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:24.300]   I think that I think that it depends on the team it depends on what they're doing but
[01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:28.020]   I think this is a good example of the difference between like iBooks and iBeacon and i Apple
[01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:34.060]   Pay is Apple Pay they got it out into a lot of places very very quickly and it actually
[01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:39.260]   seems to have some traction whereas with with these they you know that heavy control that
[01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:44.820]   apple has maybe slowing you know a lot of the development down without investing heavily
[01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:48.540]   in you know rolling it out themselves right they expect everyone just to go run with it
[01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:51.620]   but they didn't but it's too controlling for everyone to just go run with it if they put
[01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:55.300]   a lot of investment into that at the same time they might have been more successful I
[01:07:55.300 --> 01:08:00.500]   do think that the the google approach to this may may succeed much more quickly this is called
[01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:05.700]   Eddie stone and it's open which is great so one problem with iBeacon of course it only
[01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:11.180]   works on apple devices Eddie works on android too you can get different implementations oh
[01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:16.460]   you can yeah you can the problem with i mean beacon technology obviously apple has the
[01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:21.020]   patent or you know the trademark on iBeacon but the beacons themselves do work on it's
[01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:26.580]   problem is that that you know oftentimes the bluetooth stack frankly on android has been
[01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:31.780]   bad for so long it's not widely supported but you will find retailers for instance you
[01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:37.580]   will put iBeacon compatible beacons that also work with android you know in their locations
[01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:44.340]   and what not okay so do you think any stone is significant or is it it is it is it is
[01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:52.820]   it's it's different from i iBeacon iBeacon sends out codes only that the receiving device
[01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:57.580]   has to know what to do with Eddie stone will also send out your elves or even other what
[01:08:57.580 --> 01:09:01.300]   they call frame types or different types of data so it's a it's a way for a small device
[01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:08.300]   with very small low power device to broadcast in a very short range to other devices the
[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:14.340]   location and a small bit of data to make technology really location aware it's it's
[01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:19.660]   pretty important stuff maybe one of the reasons i beacons was d o a two years ago is because
[01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:26.220]   it collided with a sudden awareness of privacy issues right uh the people suddenly i don't
[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:32.540]   want my phone telling a retailer i'm here that's not exactly not what i want to have
[01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:36.980]   happened right i mean and that's sort of the challenge i mean i think that definitely
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:40.620]   this stuff is important i think that the challenge it'll face the same one that iBeacon has is
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:44.980]   how do you get you know lots and lots of people to buy these devices and implement them and
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:49.220]   implement the apps that will support them you know certain retailers have gone really
[01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:53.060]   i've been really bullish on beacons and certainly you've seen implementations in ballparks and
[01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:58.020]   other places but even if this technology is better and even if it's really interesting
[01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:01.700]   i mean you've still got to convince people especially you know places that might have
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:05.020]   already invested in beacons to buy these things and actually implement them and then
[01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:09.260]   build software for them and i think that that's those are you know hurdles that are
[01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:13.420]   not easy to get over no matter how good your technology my suspicion is that he's done
[01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:17.620]   is his d o a is i beacon was not because of the technology not being as good or whatever
[01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:21.620]   just because nobody wants that there are retailers might want it but i don't think
[01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:25.220]   customers want it well when you go into an apple store right now you see iBeacon if you
[01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:29.700]   haven't and i have it says welcome to the apple store reminder you can use your phone
[01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:35.540]   to buy stuff oh great thank you it's actually not want that if you're going to buy something
[01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:40.100]   it's not the end of the world i think there are a lot of interest in what how does it help
[01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:43.660]   me i mean i'm here i'm in the store yes i'm buying something it can choose or something
[01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:47.500]   is and i mean like the ballpark for instance you can use it to kind of locate like this
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:52.420]   is where the the concessions are this is where the beer vendor is or this is something else
[01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:56.100]   okay so a big spot that might be kind of useful yeah i mean you know you can map kind
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:11:00.140]   of in a big chalomile big complex even a flea market like the here in new york you
[01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:03.460]   know in brooklyn we have this in the brooklyn flea it would actually be kind of cool if
[01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:08.660]   they have happens does it does it uh... can you query it how do you so i'm here i got
[01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:13.260]   to the flea markets is welcome to the boston flea market now right i mean if you have
[01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:18.020]   a student presumably you have an app installed you can get other information kind of since
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:22.940]   you here's a coupon codes that launch a uh... now things as a turn left at the at the
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:27.340]   shawls i mean it could conceivably depending on on the implementation you want to use that
[01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:31.820]   that's kind of the problem you've got a bill all the stuff nobody's doing it now right
[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:35.420]   and i think that that that is actually the the navigation is one of the places that it
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:39.100]   could go really really well where there's a lot of places that you get very limited
[01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:43.540]   once you get there you know so the gps can get you to the convention hall but it can't
[01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:47.320]   tell you what room to go into or how to get to that room and i think that that i beacon
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:52.740]   has or or all of these low to low energy bluetooth have the opportunity to provide that and not
[01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:57.100]   only can it tell us what booth where to find our boots or build a path that we can follow
[01:11:57.100 --> 01:12:00.580]   to find these booths and tell us whether we're on the right track but it can also help us
[01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:03.980]   find other people that were that were trying to find you know so i find you know there's
[01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:08.060]   a lot of like where are you in the las vegas convention center for instance you know the
[01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:12.780]   north hall or the central hall is a big word you know that's that's still an hour of wandering
[01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:18.180]   around trying to figure out which which booth is four four six five you know and so um so
[01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:22.300]   being able to tell everyone meet me here and being able on an app do that i think you'd
[01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:28.820]   find a lot of people using it families in malls or in in disneyland uh or and all these other
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:33.620]   things being able to precisely identify where they are they could end up using it a lot
[01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:37.540]   beyond all the commercial things now and i think that what what retailers have to do and
[01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:41.620]   what people trying to commercialize they would look at that first how do i get something that
[01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:44.660]   people want to use all the time and then we'll figure out how to make money with it but we
[01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:48.140]   have to get them actually excited about opening the app and knowing where they are and and
[01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:53.060]   getting something as a real value before we try to sell them something
[01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:56.820]   one of the one of the things to watch out for and both and all these things is that uh
[01:12:56.820 --> 01:13:03.020]   beacon technology no matter who's is a way to get information from a device onto a phone
[01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:09.060]   automatically which means it had risk there is a risk factor involved and it's one of
[01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:12.700]   the things that we're we're looking at right now because our hacker the make hackers are
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:16.740]   used are this is really good you think it's well we're looking at it's really cool you
[01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:20.660]   can do things with it i think that the google's also well positioned because they have google
[01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:25.980]   now so google now could respond to a beacon and already it's kind of set up and i'm using
[01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:30.420]   now and it just kind of makes sense to me that i'm gonna get a card about this that
[01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:35.100]   might be of use or coupon i just feel like people don't uh... there's no sensitive
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:38.540]   now to this to the risk yeah i mean i don't think i don't think the average person is
[01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:46.620]   but i don't know what it does
[01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:50.220]   what it does show though it very clearly is the difference between apple and google google
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:54.660]   doesn't make money on these kinds of technologies so they can make it open source it's on github
[01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:58.540]   they can let anybody do it i'm sure your makers would be much more likely to implement eddie
[01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:03.540]   stone than than uh... i beacon just because it's open but but apple needs to make money
[01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:07.740]   on its products i mean that's how apple makes money apple makes enough money on its hardware
[01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:11.020]   there are other they yeah but they do stuff that's going to support the hardware sell
[01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:14.380]   hardware in the long run google's just gonna do stuff that makes you use the internet more
[01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:16.060]   because then they can
[01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:20.380]   you know i don't know what's spying i don't know what is google's business i don't know
[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:23.180]   advertising is it
[01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:27.900]   yeah still and look at their look at their earnings oh yeah they're doing all right
[01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:29.820]   uh...
[01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:31.540]   boom
[01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:35.340]   this hacking team stories interest i haven't exactly been following
[01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:36.700]   the hacking team
[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:40.220]   have you is anybody want to fill me in on what's going on here
[01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:46.620]   hacking team was a security researching firm that is apparently selling zero-day exploits
[01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:47.980]   pranks
[01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:50.540]   and then got hacked
[01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:54.060]   yelp and the zero-day exploits
[01:14:54.060 --> 01:15:00.220]   got released and uh... man there's a flash exploit there's open ssl problems
[01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:04.460]   steve talked about it i know on the security now a lot maybe we should just leave the discussion
[01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:05.740]   for the pros
[01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:07.980]   probably can i just say though
[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:09.820]   that when i was
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:12.380]   covering products back at cnet
[01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:15.140]   the most uncomfortable conversations i ever had
[01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:18.380]   were the ones with the anti-virus guys when they come into pitch like
[01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:21.900]   selling the viruses out the other side the other door
[01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:22.460]   and
[01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:25.020]   you know you know they want to use them of that did you
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:28.540]   no of course not i'd be you know i would agree is that i think a lot of people
[01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:32.940]   i'm just naturally i'm naturally cynical yeah but i don't think they're doing they don't
[01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:36.860]   need to do that there's plenty of people making viruses they don't need to sell some more
[01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:37.980]   or do they
[01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:42.620]   well i mean you know try to convince you know especially in the era when you've got stuff built
[01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:43.740]   in by
[01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:47.500]   you know microsoft and and apple all these other companies started to have kind of built in
[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:51.660]   antivirus and to malware things you know how we what why shouldn't enterprise or why should
[01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:54.540]   a consumer still buy your product
[01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:58.780]   mmm good point all the and all the antivirus guys are going to kill me now for saying that but
[01:15:58.780 --> 01:16:02.860]   i don't think i like these guys there but by the way they're pretty much out of business right i
[01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:08.060]   mean microsoft is now building a virus antivirus into windows windows 10 will have it as well
[01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:10.300]   wait for the first great
[01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:13.420]   mac uh virus
[01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:17.420]   yeah you know there's a bit but apple has done i think very good things
[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:23.340]   and less obvious things they don't build it in antivirus but they have some really smart technology
[01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:28.140]   that allows them to spot uh malware and to remove it without your knowledge
[01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:33.980]   mmm so i feel like apple is probably being fairly proactive on this right and they control
[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:37.660]   their stores and they control it right i mean that's the big thing is that by default you know
[01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:42.300]   you the gatekeeper thing is turned on so you can't install software that isn't signed and most of the
[01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:47.100]   time is the unsigned stuff is where the mac viruses the mac trojans come from so if you downloaded
[01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:50.700]   you know you've pirated something and it's unsigned you know you've got to actually
[01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:55.820]   actively right click and click open or you've got to actively change your settings um to to run
[01:16:55.820 --> 01:17:00.940]   that file um if it's been signed by a developer in theory of course there are possible people can
[01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:04.300]   still kind of there's always a way around things but you know for something's been signed by a
[01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:08.780]   developer then it's it's the likelihood of it having any sort of malware on it is is very very
[01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:16.700]   limited flash that was one of the bugs that uh the hacking yeah i thought for sure and maybe i
[01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:21.740]   misread it but when i was away that flash was over like it well i have you been on any corporate
[01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:27.660]   internet so no it's not flash lives in busy in the one place where you really don't want flash to
[01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:35.340]   survive in all these old intranet internal company sites that have been hacked together by people
[01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:41.580]   years ago and they still run flash but well and to be honest uh if you're watching this show on our
[01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:46.060]   website you're probably watching it in flash as well but isn't and that's and those and those
[01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:50.700]   technologies aren't there you know the technologies especially to replace streaming video i mean
[01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:55.260]   streaming video on the web is not and i've had some recent experiences with trying to use things
[01:17:55.260 --> 01:18:00.780]   other than flash and uh and it's it's a little frightening you know and so so you do want that
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:05.740]   to go and that and that technology is moving down that path but it's you know not there yet in some
[01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:11.260]   areas and i think but i do think that people do need as you know has been suggested by some
[01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:15.180]   technologists uh a dead a dead date you know that we're going to yeah
[01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:22.380]   Facebook in fact is saying uh let's uh let's dump flash facebook's security
[01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:31.020]   uh chief says it's time to uh say you know we're gonna on this date get rid of flash and that'll be
[01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:35.740]   it Alex Stamos tweeted it's time for adobe to announce the end of the life date for flash and
[01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:40.780]   ask browsers to set kill bits on the same day firefox maybe jump the gun because the latest
[01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:46.540]   version of firefox blocks flash and we'll let's because of the zero day hole because of the hacking
[01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:51.580]   team hole yes but and we'll presumably unblock it at some point unblock it as soon as you know
[01:18:51.580 --> 01:19:00.060]   adobe gets the thing fixed but yeah i mean so firefox has a you know a reputation they have a kind of
[01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:05.180]   a a duty to their customers to not let something through they could potentially harm them and if
[01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:09.500]   we know that there's this big zero-day exploit that has been hacked by the hackers and is now all
[01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:14.220]   over the place and that and million people could start you know to build um tools to take advantage
[01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:19.020]   of that exploit yeah i mean i think that maybe they maybe they're more proactive than maybe they
[01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:23.740]   had to be i don't know but i don't blame them for taking the the method and saying yeah we're
[01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:29.820]   not going to support this until you patch your stuff once and and the question is is do we have
[01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:35.500]   to wait for adobe to to do this or does apple google firefox or mozilla and well that's probably
[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:39.740]   what's gonna happen soft right all to say hey we're gonna all do this on the board it you know
[01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:43.660]   right because no adobe's not going to say oh we're going to kill it on this day why would they do that
[01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:47.660]   no no they i think they kind of would because they would i think in a perfect world adobe's ready
[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:50.460]   to get rid of flash you know they're they're trying to migrate people away from it they're trying to
[01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:54.060]   migrate people into other types of tools they've shifted their business away from flash you know
[01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:59.020]   they went from being so anti even bring it a couple you know five years ago if i would bring up with
[01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:03.820]   adobe you know why can't you guys just embrace html five i would talk to one guy at adobe who
[01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:09.980]   was like i'm with you i agree this sucks but i'm like the only person here who's saying this and you
[01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:14.380]   know five years later you know they don't support it on mobile i think they would like to move people
[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:18.620]   into their html five solutions they would they have you know a suite of streaming video solutions
[01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:22.380]   and servers that can run on different platforms that they would like to sell they have different
[01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:26.940]   tools for software creators and web developers and technologies they would like to use and sell they
[01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:31.740]   don't want to continue supporting you know um you know flash and director stuff forever
[01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:38.860]   well we'll see what happens uh you know it would be a problem for us because we don't stream our own
[01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:44.780]   content we use ustream ustream has had non flash streaming they also have flash streaming we'll
[01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:51.980]   use big gravity which is flash only as i think we do pay for an hls and http streamer because of
[01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:58.300]   our i people who use ios can't obviously use flash um the fact that you could use an iphone and ipad
[01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:05.260]   and never use flash and you could successfully navigate the modern world kind of indicates it's
[01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:12.300]   it's almost not necessary not for video anyway yeah but it would require our providers to adjust
[01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:15.900]   and i presume they would it wouldn't sign up to us it would and they're all working on it i mean
[01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:21.180]   they they're all everyone knows that it's coming what's the is it w i mean vp nine what is this what
[01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:26.540]   is the replacement i mean there's a lot of possibilities dash is is one of the things that
[01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:32.460]   people are you know looking at as you know stache kodak what is dash dash is just another
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:41.820]   kodak yeah flash is a wrapper usually it's around h.264 and pig four right um you uh but if so
[01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:48.060]   there's a video in hml5 there's a video tag bracket video bracket and to my knowledge that we still
[01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:52.620]   has not been defined what's supposed to happen in a browser when it sees that tag well there's
[01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:57.660]   been conflict i mean mozilla primarily hasn't wanted to support a shot two six four because of
[01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:02.940]   the patent and comprehensive with it so they would prefer to support you know aug and and um vp eight
[01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:09.100]   and and so and webin um webin obviously hasn't taken off i mean google doesn't even use it um so
[01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:15.340]   um but but you know mozilla has started to at least um start to move a little bit on a shot two six
[01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:19.980]   four especially on systems where it comes already part of the operating system and and even on their
[01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:25.100]   mobile stuff so yeah i mean the the the codec the specification the video tag is basically it'll
[01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:29.180]   play whatever video is there and then it's up to your browser or your hardware whether or not it
[01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:33.980]   can play back the the codec or not so it just has you know a video tag going to the file and then
[01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:37.500]   it's up to your system whether or not it can play the file but it could significantly play it in any
[01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:44.780]   format the the spec itself or video doesn't care so alex is dash unencumbered or is there are there
[01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:49.980]   patent issues with that dash dash is just the wrapper so what you end up with is a situation where
[01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:55.100]   kind of what was being discussed is is that you have there's a couple different things that
[01:22:55.100 --> 01:23:00.620]   happen so i get i get a video and then i stream that video out to a um to a cdn and that can be
[01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:05.020]   whatever format it is i mean that can be h264 it can be a lot of other things but it you know um
[01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:09.900]   but that can that's sent to them and then it has to be split up and so when you're watching something
[01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:15.100]   online that's all being cut up into a whole bunch of little um adaptive bit rates so we're going to
[01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:20.300]   give you four to nine uh bit rates and we're going to decide oh you're on a phone this is what
[01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:25.580]   you're going to get now that um how that is being stacked up and managed in this kind of a simplified
[01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:29.500]   version of this but how that's all being stacked up depends on these different protocols and how
[01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:35.980]   flash is doing it or dash or um you know or hls and so um how these things get done it's it's not
[01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:40.300]   necessarily changing how it's being compressed but it is changing how it's being managed and then
[01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:44.140]   you have a player on the other side that's then making decisions about how it's how it's getting
[01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:49.260]   that data but it does make a big difference on how it's being requested so for instance um you know
[01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:53.580]   the you know there there is a way that all of these cdn's you know basically what they're doing is
[01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:57.820]   their peering so i get you know i have a what's called an origin server and i'm and i'm getting
[01:23:57.820 --> 01:24:01.660]   that i send that to that server and it sends it out to peers and then they send it out to peers and
[01:24:01.660 --> 01:24:07.260]   they send it out to peers so they're out on the edge you're not getting slammed with uh you know
[01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:10.780]   you're not getting slammed it's just those locations that are getting that it's theoretically local
[01:24:10.780 --> 01:24:16.220]   to them it's not putting a lot of pressure on a single server but how chatty those those those
[01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:21.980]   protocols are um you know it's very can be can vary so um you know one of the things we found so far
[01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:27.020]   is that the protocol that you know dash is different than flash and and it's the way it's making requests
[01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:31.820]   based on things that are going on um can put a lot more pressure on the on the server so what is youtube
[01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:38.860]   use dash what does youtube do no youtube is still using um uh actually i i don't don't know
[01:24:38.860 --> 01:24:43.900]   there's just a lot of different things they're still using vp you know vp8 i believe is in part of
[01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:48.300]   it you know they're using you know there's a variety of you know html5 because they don't support flash
[01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:53.420]   right no they do but they still they've still they've switched the the d yeah it still has a flash
[01:24:53.420 --> 01:24:57.500]   ball that but they did finally switch to html5 is the default and i think that they primarily
[01:24:57.500 --> 01:25:02.940]   use h.264 they do have vp8 and and you know webin but i think they primarily use h.264
[01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:09.020]   but uh just because you know so many mobile devices use that instead um but they did i can't
[01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:13.660]   remember when it it's been within the last year they they made html5 the actual default and then
[01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:17.340]   there was the flash fallbacks if you're on a really old system that doesn't support it there
[01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:21.500]   will be you know flash support part of this reason this is confusing is because there's wrappers
[01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:27.100]   which are things like flash or mkv or quick time movies there's codex which are inside the wrappers
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:31.740]   and they those two don't necessarily indicate which you're going which you're going to be and uh it's
[01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:36.620]   all very uh it's all very confusing youtube currently uses i'm just looking here on their
[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:44.540]   engineering blog vp9 for the high def and 4k video that they stream um this is this is the
[01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:51.980]   codex i think that they want to become the default codex on the internet they kind of admitted that
[01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:59.660]   vp8 is is still encumbered it is not uh it's not a completely open technology i think they hope that
[01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:07.660]   vp9 will be um vp9 is very impressive you know i mean the quality the quality of vp9 is is uh is
[01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:12.460]   is very very impressive and and like any good solution for the future it's bandwidth adaptive
[01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:15.980]   so if you have low bandwidth you could still get a stream and get something that's okay
[01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:23.980]   um but if you have enough bandwidth you can get 4k as well so uh chrome uses vp9
[01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:30.700]   android devices supported some game consoles supported and uh i i would guess this is kind of
[01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:37.660]   the future but boy you just you just don't know this is an interesting um uh right
[01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:42.060]   pay image they have on the engineering blog where you compare and i don't know those of you who
[01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:49.740]   were watching on a on h.264 may not notice this but if you look at vp9 same stream same bit rate
[01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:57.660]   that's a 600 kilobit connection uh there's a huge difference in the clarity uh between h.264
[01:26:57.660 --> 01:27:03.260]   which is really kind of blocky and right are affected and vp9 and then there's also h.265
[01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:10.780]   which you know is it's similar to h uh to vp9 is that hv's yeah so confusing yeah i mean no i mean
[01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:14.220]   the biggest problem i think honestly with a lot of the codec stuff is getting the hardware support
[01:27:14.220 --> 01:27:18.940]   so like even though chrome and android my support vp9 doesn't have hardware encoded
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:39.420]   d-
[01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:45.100]   all the stuff that you know macromedia started 20 years ago well right now though if you if you're
[01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:49.740]   running a computer and you don't have chrome you don't have a vp9 codec so that's kind of the
[01:27:49.740 --> 01:27:54.620]   issue is you've got to get the codec so now right in flash got to a point where it was everywhere
[01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:59.420]   right um to some and then and then the iphone came and then it's not everywhere but it's still on
[01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:03.820]   the desktop it's everywhere and so most of the time for instance when we're streaming you know the
[01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:09.980]   the end product is going to be a you know flash and and hls you know those are the two that you know
[01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:15.180]   that's you know still the standard um of how that of how that gets done and of course everyone
[01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:19.660]   wants to move on they all know that but isn't it for microsoft ultimately that's going to decide
[01:28:19.660 --> 01:28:24.540]   this because they are the dominant operating system and whatever comes with windows
[01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:30.780]   is going to be what everybody uses or is that not the case anymore i don't think so i mean i
[01:28:30.780 --> 01:28:35.020]   think that i mean if you look at it wasn't microsoft that killed flash it was apple yeah mobile
[01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:40.220]   you know it's a dominant ukisren right yeah rafers right mobile is the dominant now so
[01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:44.540]   microsoft says the windows 10 will come with uh mkv that's a wrapper matrashka
[01:28:44.540 --> 01:28:50.860]   as well as all the others and we'll support uh hvc which is that h.265
[01:28:50.860 --> 01:28:55.740]   um but microsoft doesn't care about encumbered or unencumbered they're willing to use patented
[01:28:55.740 --> 01:28:59.180]   technologies oh absolutely they'll pay for it they have no problem paying for it the same with apple
[01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:03.260]   apple pay the licensing fee and google will pay for it too just so they can include it in the browser
[01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:07.180]   they might not include in chromium but they'll include it in chrome um you know mozzila's been
[01:29:07.180 --> 01:29:15.580]   only one kind of against it became the default wrapper all right let's take let's take a break i
[01:29:15.580 --> 01:29:21.180]   want to talk about windows 10 i want to talk about pluto but first i want to talk about go to
[01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:24.700]   meeting if you have to meet with clients and colleagues you know nowadays they're not all in
[01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:30.780]   the same room and no client i i'm gonna tell you the truth wants you to fly to them take them to
[01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:36.380]   lunch have a meeting that's a waste of a day they love it when you say hey let's have a meeting and
[01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:40.860]   let's use go to meeting why because go to meetings is good as face to face but it takes less time
[01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:45.740]   less money let's hassle for them let's hassle for you you can meet from any computer any tablet any

[01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:50.460]   I got a call yesterday from a guy who said I am so sick of this annoying ad for windows 10 that's
[01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:55.020]   popping up in my taskbar how do I get rid of that and you actually it's kind of a complicated
[01:30:55.020 --> 01:31:00.380]   thing there's a hot fix you have to uninstall. Microsoft has put an ad on everybody's got a
[01:31:00.380 --> 01:31:05.900]   windows 7 or windows 8 machine saying sign up for windows 10 now really yeah you haven't seen it
[01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:13.020]   you use a Mac. Well no but I actually run a VPN an auto VPN a VM a virtual machine yeah I don't
[01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:18.860]   know if it'll pop on a V on my I'm back at home. I don't know if I'm time so so and also fascinating
[01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:22.700]   interview with such in Adele you've got a remarried Joe Foley story but he talks really good.
[01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:31.180]   Yeah. The decision to give away windows 10 and all of that about time but isn't okay I agree
[01:31:31.180 --> 01:31:37.100]   as a user I love it but isn't that how Microsoft makes a living. Yeah it's a challenge because
[01:31:37.100 --> 01:31:42.780]   Microsoft's business model is to sell software apples is more or less to sell hardware
[01:31:43.420 --> 01:31:47.820]   Google's is to sell advertising so it puts Microsoft in kind of a difficult spot but
[01:31:47.820 --> 01:31:53.500]   you kind of have to if you want people to upgrade and you can't sell an operating system for what
[01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:58.620]   they've been selling their operating system for in the past. Yeah. Although we have always said
[01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:04.460]   that really windows users never upgrade they buy a new computer. So that's the problem is that
[01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:09.980]   is that who needs a new computer you know with one windows 8.1 or windows 8 came out right so
[01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:15.500]   that's you know three years that computer probably still decent. You're probably still okay with it.
[01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:20.620]   That's why so many people are using XP. Exactly because the because the technology hasn't
[01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:24.460]   increased to the point where we're needing to kind of hit these flat toes. Replacing your phone
[01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:27.820]   every year that's one thing because that's not your primary computer thing it's like what
[01:32:27.820 --> 01:32:32.060]   Break the St. Earlier you know like you know mobile is now kind of the central center of our universe
[01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:37.820]   our laptops and desktops not so much so I think that you know if you bought something in the last
[01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:40.940]   three years say you bought something a year and a half ago you know you bought a computer that
[01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:46.540]   came with windows 8 on it or maybe by that time it was windows 8.1. You're probably not going to
[01:32:46.540 --> 01:32:50.700]   need to buy another computer for another year and a half two three years. So it's going to be really
[01:32:50.700 --> 01:32:55.580]   hard for Microsoft I think unless they give it away for free for the year to convince people to
[01:32:55.580 --> 01:33:01.020]   upgrade and then if you don't upgrade then you can't get them into the more virtuous cycle of maybe
[01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:05.900]   paying for office as a service and getting latest updates and all the other stuff. So I mean they've
[01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:11.180]   got to do something. I love watching and I think they've got the right guy in charge but I love
[01:33:11.180 --> 01:33:18.540]   watching Satya try to turn this giant tanker and literally as they're in really mixing metaphors
[01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:25.020]   as they're in flight change their entire business model from selling software to selling services
[01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:31.100]   and it's a challenge and I have to say when it was Steve Ballmer I didn't think he was solving
[01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:36.700]   the problem and I think I do feel like Nadella has done the things the painful things you needed to
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:42.300]   do. Nadella is the right person to do it. The question is can't be done. And they've got plenty
[01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:46.140]   of revenue coming in. They've got a long time. You know it's not like they're pulling you know and
[01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:49.260]   they've got a year to figure this out. Well now's the time to fix it isn't it? But this is the direction
[01:33:49.260 --> 01:33:56.700]   that this is a direction that enterprise technology companies go from product or software ultimately
[01:33:56.700 --> 01:34:02.700]   into services digital IBM and it's actually to be my perspective I mean it might be it's the right
[01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:08.780]   thing for the right thing for them to do IBM and digital the bastions of computing we still talk
[01:34:08.780 --> 01:34:13.420]   about them all the time right. Well it's what I have kind of sunset it's writing off into the
[01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:18.700]   sunset. That's kind of my point that is kind of sad it's kind of sad to see Microsoft become a
[01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:24.140]   services company which is a corporate a big corporate play. I mean they've always been there.
[01:34:24.140 --> 01:34:30.060]   Yeah and it's you know what you have to honor them. I mean we just we would put in perspective though
[01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:34.860]   IBM is still worth 170 billion dollars. Yeah you know so it's not so it's not it's not as exciting
[01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:40.620]   but it's not like a business. I mean when Windows 95 came out you know I was I won't age myself
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:44.620]   I was really young and you know there were like lines you know open at midnight it was like a
[01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:48.940]   humongous and rolling stones were part of it. They're not going to be lined so people to
[01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:53.740]   just download or get excited about Windows 10 it's not the same thing. No in fact Windows 7 came out
[01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:59.900]   we had a Windows 7 party. They sent out balloons and we had cards we did it on the air we had a
[01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:03.980]   launch party for Windows then was going to have a launch party for Windows 10. It's just going to
[01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:08.700]   silently creep under your computer one day you wake up and it'll be there. And thank goodness.
[01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:12.380]   But they need I mean they was horrible. Microsoft really needs it because you're
[01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:20.380]   seems right. I mean people if they have Windows 8 they're going to be stuck with Windows 8 until
[01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:24.620]   they get a new computer and when it's time to get a new computer and they and if they have Windows 8
[01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:28.700]   they're going to be unhappy. Yeah you know probably so they're going to be looking at alternate
[01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:33.100]   platform. That's the fear. Let me get a Mac let me get a Chromebook. My dad got a Chromebook.
[01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:38.540]   Chromebooks are great. Well it ended up not working out well for him it ended up kind of dying
[01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:43.020]   whatever so we ended up getting another laptop. I still can't make him go Mac. My mom is smart.
[01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:48.300]   She went Mac. My dad not so much but he the what drove him to the Chromebook the first time was
[01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:56.460]   Windows 8. So you know we'll see. Yeah well you know you have to honor Microsoft because the
[01:35:56.460 --> 01:36:00.780]   personal computer revolution would not have happened without a stable reliable predictable
[01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:06.860]   platform called Windows and people could develop to it. And as as Nadella said in his interview which
[01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:15.020]   was kind of a dig and kind of and also very true Microsoft Windows by being open by having
[01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:22.220]   i.e. be open or Windows being open made Chrome possible which made Google possible. Yeah well
[01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:25.900]   and made the cloud possible made the future possible and see you later Microsoft because the
[01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:30.380]   future doesn't wait. Right. Oh hey thank you. It's like when Ray Kurzweil said oh you have to
[01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:35.100]   worry about artificial intelligence and robots they'll think we're our their parents they'll honor us
[01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:40.300]   like parents. That always works. Yeah there's a thousand places where Microsoft was ahead of
[01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:43.900]   everybody else and then just didn't do anything with it. I mean if you look at touch screens I mean
[01:36:43.900 --> 01:36:48.380]   they were playing with touch screens 15 years ago if you look at photosynt you know they've let go
[01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:51.580]   you know they kind of let that team go and now they really wish them I'm sure that they had a
[01:36:51.580 --> 01:36:55.820]   really good VR development tool. You know it says there's all these things that they you know that
[01:36:55.820 --> 01:37:01.820]   they noodled with and produced incredible results and then just flirted you know just flirted it.
[01:37:01.820 --> 01:37:06.860]   There's a long history of that though Xerox Park invented gooies but never did it and that's
[01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:11.900]   that's kind of a tradition. And I think that it speaks to technology in general that in order to
[01:37:11.900 --> 01:37:17.420]   make these big leaps it takes fresh blood a fresh look and that's just how it's going to be and
[01:37:17.420 --> 01:37:24.060]   unfortunately the business cycle and technology is sped up in 10 years you're old. Drones good
[01:37:24.060 --> 01:37:30.300]   news and bad news. Can you talk about the fire story? Yeah here's the bad news. Southern California
[01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:37.500]   fast-moving wild fire destroying a dozen vehicles sending motorists scampering to safety but the
[01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:45.500]   firefighting planes couldn't get there for 26 minutes because there were drones. Obvious drones
[01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:51.100]   flying over. Looky-lewing. Looky-lewing. Where's the good news here? So they could so they had to
[01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:55.740]   turn their airplanes on helicopters. The flame retard material they were going to dump on burning
[01:37:55.740 --> 01:38:01.580]   cars away because they didn't want it to run into a drone. It was the fourth time it's happened this
[01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:05.900]   week. Oh my god. This is not good for drones. Well I think that I think what we're going to see is
[01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:11.820]   I mean just in the same way that a lot of these drones now are shipping with altitude limiters
[01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:14.460]   and so on and so forth that are coming in. I mean we're just going to see the progression of
[01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:17.820]   this is where there's going to be kill switches and so these helicopters are going to have the
[01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:22.620]   ability to push a button and to any commercial drone it'll just tell it to drop. They'll fall
[01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:31.500]   out of the sky. Yep and this is really necessary and really bad at the same time. Yeah and not all
[01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:37.900]   drones will be equipped with them. No they won't. No the homemade ones won't. Well they will be.
[01:38:37.900 --> 01:38:45.340]   Because almost all homemade drones use commercial or off-the-shelf flight controllers and the
[01:38:45.340 --> 01:38:51.340]   software in those the firmware in those can be programmed it's already that way that certain
[01:38:51.340 --> 01:38:57.820]   flight controllers won't go near airports in the no-fly zones etc and making one of those from
[01:38:57.820 --> 01:39:03.420]   scratch is really hard. Yeah but yeah we're glad to teach you on know-how with Father Robert Ballis
[01:39:03.420 --> 01:39:10.220]   there each and every week we're here on Twitter. What concerns me about this is not that a firefighting
[01:39:10.220 --> 01:39:14.940]   aircraft can knock a drone out of the sky which nobody would agree is a bad thing but that somebody
[01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:20.620]   else can knock a drone out of the sky. Right. When it's say it's looking at a human right
[01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:27.020]   issue or a protest or a legal police action that's the problem and that's why drones which are this
[01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:34.060]   incredible technology for disseminating information and seeing what's happening and fighting oppression
[01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:39.660]   can actually be disabled by the bad guys. Maybe there's some hope here because a crew member in
[01:39:39.660 --> 01:39:43.900]   the one of the fighting planes saw firefighting planes saw the drones reported it back they shut
[01:39:43.900 --> 01:39:48.380]   down because they don't want to fly if a drone gets sucked into the jets or hits a leave in a
[01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:54.540]   little drone could bring it a helicopter or a plane down. But ground crews tracked down the drone
[01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:58.700]   operators and shut them down so within a half an hour they were able to get the drones down.
[01:39:58.700 --> 01:40:05.020]   Now whether that was a crucial half an hour in this wildfire as I don't know how they've managed
[01:40:05.020 --> 01:40:09.500]   to find them except for looking for little guys doing this. Well apparently there's it's an area
[01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:13.500]   where there's a lot of hobbyist drones. I thought initially it might be it was paparazzi drones you
[01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:19.900]   know how long before Channel 7 News in Los Angeles has its own drone they got a helicopter. Seriously.
[01:40:19.900 --> 01:40:23.660]   Oh no they definitely want them I mean it it's funny they're not supposed to have them for commercial
[01:40:23.660 --> 01:40:29.100]   purposes but yet the New York Times has had a number of videos that have very clearly been shot
[01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:33.820]   with drones that they've paid for that have gone against that the commercial you know drone usage
[01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:38.220]   thing to get fantastic video shots so yeah I mean it's only a matter of time. That's the bad news but
[01:40:38.220 --> 01:40:44.460]   I told you there was some good news the the they call it the Kitty Hawk moment the first time a drone
[01:40:44.460 --> 01:40:51.180]   made a delivery and it was a very critical delivery medicine to a rural Virginia clinic a
[01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:57.580]   clinic that often has to tell its patients we're going to have your medicine in a week or so because
[01:40:57.580 --> 01:41:05.340]   it's very distant takes a long time over winding roads to deliver so the drone took the medicine
[01:41:05.340 --> 01:41:11.580]   for the final miles as the crow flies from the airport to the clinic it's the first
[01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:21.020]   official delivery via drone. This is exciting in rural in rural you know Pennsylvania or wherever
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:27.020]   this is in Appalachia it's more exciting in the emerging world in Africa and other places where
[01:41:27.020 --> 01:41:33.100]   getting this getting this kind of delivery system working could really save a lot of lives you know
[01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:38.060]   so it's it's very interesting. We have a story in Unmake right now about a project to
[01:41:38.060 --> 01:41:44.460]   some some guys in Stanford are running to use UAVs will fix wing not rotorcraft
[01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:50.700]   unmanned to deliver humanitarian supplies to Syria. Awesome. And it's really interesting what
[01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:57.020]   they're doing there. The drones are taking different paths each time they're automated and if they
[01:41:57.020 --> 01:42:01.580]   land if they go below certain altitude if they're forced down before they get to their destination
[01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:07.900]   the electronics fry so the bad guys can't use them. Wow. Yeah. Hopefully not starting a grass fire.
[01:42:07.900 --> 01:42:15.180]   Yeah so good news and bad news Pluto that's nothing but good news. Talk about it. I just
[01:42:15.180 --> 01:42:21.500]   say it's a planet. It's still a planet. It's a planet to me baby. Damn it. That's me too. You got
[01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:27.340]   to love it. Nine and a half years ago we launched a satellite slingshot it around Jupiter. Love it.
[01:42:27.340 --> 01:42:37.020]   Amazing and it's now sending back. What's that sound? Pluto. Is that me? Is that Pluto?
[01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:45.820]   That's Alex. Alex. Yes. I thought that this was actually audio from Pluto. I'm sorry. I was
[01:42:45.820 --> 01:42:52.940]   getting excited. Hello. What's interesting is we had a planetary scientist from the New Horizons
[01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:58.700]   project on the screen the new screensavers yesterday. What's interesting is these already
[01:42:58.700 --> 01:43:03.740]   beautiful pictures are not the most high res pictures we're going to see. In fact it's only
[01:43:03.740 --> 01:43:09.580]   one 50th of all the pictures that New Horizons took but because it only has a 600-bod modem.
[01:43:09.580 --> 01:43:19.420]   Oh my god. It's going to take like months before all the data is sent back. I think they're using
[01:43:19.420 --> 01:43:28.300]   Comcast. No it's a long way to go and they can't you know I mean you can't wait you can't have a
[01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:32.860]   giant transmitter on there and it's got a nuclear generator on the thing. Well it's a little
[01:43:32.860 --> 01:43:39.500]   nuclear. The thing I didn't realize is but our guest Kelsey Singer I think was her name
[01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:43.820]   told us it's about the size of a baby grand. It's about the size of this table. It's not big.
[01:43:43.820 --> 01:43:48.460]   You got a little that's not the generator. That's the whole new horizon. Yeah it's not that big.
[01:43:48.460 --> 01:43:55.180]   It's going on to the Kuiper belt but they have some amazing stuff and I just you know it's
[01:43:55.180 --> 01:44:01.420]   interesting for a long time I think the thinking was unless you do manned flight space is not going
[01:44:01.420 --> 01:44:05.660]   to get the people's attention it's not going to be exciting that's what we have to send
[01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:10.300]   people to the moon and Mars. I think the last year has shown some amazing
[01:44:10.300 --> 01:44:18.220]   unmanned stuff that just they're getting the comet. This new horizon stuff you don't it's just
[01:44:18.220 --> 01:44:24.780]   exciting as heck. I love it and Pluto has a heart. It's a frozen heart but it's kind of hard.
[01:44:24.780 --> 01:44:29.580]   I think you get a lot of excitement putting a rover you know a remote rover on the moon
[01:44:29.580 --> 01:44:33.980]   you know and bouncing around and I think that you know it's an order of magnitude less expensive
[01:44:33.980 --> 01:44:39.740]   and less dangerous to put to do that than the people on it. Yeah more and more pictures will
[01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:46.060]   be coming. We haven't seen the best pictures yet so get excited. There's more. I think there's a
[01:44:46.060 --> 01:44:50.780]   year of it right. I mean there's like a year and nine months on a long time. There's the heart.
[01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:55.340]   We're going to be seen. We're going to be so stuck up Pluto but no we're not. This is just
[01:44:55.340 --> 01:45:01.580]   amazing. It was just fantastic. It's just great. It's so exciting and it's a celebration of
[01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:07.980]   I'm just. Do you see the photo of Alan Stern the guy who like this thing was this whole project
[01:45:07.980 --> 01:45:12.380]   and the look on his face you just had this look of utter jubilee. His mouth was wide open.
[01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:21.740]   It was so fantastic. It was so good. He was seeing nine years later pictures of Pluto.
[01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:26.060]   And they got almost there and then it lost contact. I mean there was that moment.
[01:45:26.060 --> 01:45:32.300]   You know that they were like no. No. No. No. You've got to be kidding me. Like you know
[01:45:32.300 --> 01:45:36.780]   four days before it does the thing they had lost they lost communication you know so.
[01:45:36.780 --> 01:45:42.300]   Just just just the greatest news ever and congratulations to the New Horizons
[01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:48.380]   science team and the John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and well done.
[01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:52.620]   Well done. Hey thanks guys. This was fun. This is a great way to come back.
[01:45:52.620 --> 01:45:58.300]   Thanks. We had a fabulous studio audience. They were quiet as mice the whole time.
[01:45:58.300 --> 01:46:03.660]   But they're literally about you know 50 people here which is nice. It's really nice to have you.
[01:46:03.660 --> 01:46:08.860]   Thank you Christina Warren for coming all the way out here via Skype. It's always great to see
[01:46:08.860 --> 01:46:16.220]   you at Mashable.com. And we see you we still see every is it Fridays on TNT. Every Friday.
[01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:21.420]   Yeah I host TNT with Mike on Friday. Nice. That's awesome. We'll catch you then.
[01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:26.380]   Thanks also to Alex Lindsey for joining us from Pittsburgh. What do you got? What are you up to
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:32.540]   these days? I don't see much. I'm bouncing around. You can't tell us can you?
[01:46:32.540 --> 01:46:39.100]   Well you know we do a lot of streams. So I'm streaming. I was in I was down at a golf course
[01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:44.140]   and and but we've been in a couple golf courses over the last week and not a golfing going on and
[01:46:44.140 --> 01:46:49.980]   streaming in Scotland. We've got a team in Scotland. No kidding. I wasn't I wasn't there.
[01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:57.980]   Yeah it we provide the ability to watch the the open when you're there. So
[01:46:57.980 --> 01:47:02.700]   well we just do the streaming for it. We don't do all the hardware but but the it's a very
[01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:06.060]   technologically complicated thing because you want 30,000 people to be able to pick up their phone
[01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:12.780]   and actually not have skipping video. And so this is the man. What do you use for that H.264?
[01:47:13.740 --> 01:47:22.300]   Yes. So yeah it's it's the you know we do the easy part which is you know transcoding you know
[01:47:22.300 --> 01:47:25.420]   encoding transcoding so on and so forth. The hard part is really done by a company called
[01:47:25.420 --> 01:47:33.260]   Straight Up that has two I think 260 access points you know that have to you know even out all of
[01:47:33.260 --> 01:47:36.860]   the all of the flow and make sure that the app is getting you know that you're you can actually
[01:47:36.860 --> 01:47:43.100]   get Wi-Fi. So but yeah it's it's a pretty interesting thing to do. As far as you know you can sit at the
[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:46.620]   18th hole and watch the rest of the event you know because once you get to the 18th hole you don't
[01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:50.780]   want to give up your seat. But otherwise you know it's doing some streaming in Seattle doing
[01:47:50.780 --> 01:47:55.340]   some streaming in DC and well next time you're out here come come join us on Mac break weekly.
[01:47:55.340 --> 01:47:59.740]   I'd love to see you. Yes that's great too. We like that especially your Skype.
[01:48:01.740 --> 01:48:11.340]   Is it 8K? What are you doing there? It's just a nice camera but outside of that it's just
[01:48:11.340 --> 01:48:16.860]   some lights and you know a Skype I do have the Skype the TX box which I think.
[01:48:16.860 --> 01:48:22.460]   But do you are using Skype TX? Yeah yeah yeah I definitely I maybe that's the secret
[01:48:22.460 --> 01:48:27.740]   is a secret there's a secret box. Yeah Skype bought a company called was a cat and mouse.
[01:48:27.740 --> 01:48:32.940]   Cat and mouse that made a special hardware it made a special PC that would run Skype.
[01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:38.620]   It was a big PC it wasn't like a little mouse. I remember that it's like 10 grand or something.
[01:48:38.620 --> 01:48:45.500]   Yeah and then so Skype bought cat and mouse and I think they and they call it the call it Skype
[01:48:45.500 --> 01:48:50.300]   TX and I guess a new tech which makes our tricaster our switcher is making a dedicated box. Is that
[01:48:50.300 --> 01:48:56.300]   what you're using for the Skype? I use the new tech one yeah yeah and it is it's it really makes
[01:48:56.300 --> 01:49:02.940]   Skype a lot of fun. So it's very very easy to work with and I think a lot of the complaints
[01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:06.940]   that I had we're trying to you know of course your desktop version of Skype doesn't really handle.
[01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:10.700]   This is still personal connections anymore. It's the same codec it's kind of the same Skype but
[01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:14.940]   it gives you more controls on it and stuff like that. Yeah and it's just very simple to get SDI
[01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:20.620]   you know HDSTI in which is very very difficult and and for some of the studios that we've built
[01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:25.820]   we're now adding them like little you know like they get one and then they go oh we want two guests
[01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:30.220]   now I want four guests. Yeah no we're going to get four but they're expensive they're like five or
[01:49:30.220 --> 01:49:35.260]   six grand I can't remember four thousand four thousand a pop 20 grand deal. You're using it all
[01:49:35.260 --> 01:49:39.740]   the time you use it every day if anyone should get no we're going to we're going to actually
[01:49:39.740 --> 01:49:43.340]   we talked to new tech and we're going to absolutely we're getting them yeah yeah they're great anyway
[01:49:43.340 --> 01:49:49.100]   so that's that I think they're nice. Thanks also to race Rafe Niedelman congratulations on the new gig
[01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:54.460]   as editor in chief of maker media that is exciting yep anything coming up you want to share with us.
[01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:58.860]   Well first of all people should know about the website make scene that's makie. Love it.
[01:49:58.860 --> 01:50:04.140]   ziany.com that's where everything happens every day. The issue that's coming out this
[01:50:04.140 --> 01:50:07.900]   just beginning to come out right now is awesome. Former co-worker of mine from
[01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:12.860]   CNET Donald Bell has the cover story we made a BB8 with the floating head. Love it! Yep.
[01:50:12.860 --> 01:50:18.620]   Did you use a sphero or did you do something else? There we've actually run I think so far
[01:50:18.620 --> 01:50:25.980]   five BB8 projects from everything from the sphero based hack with the floating head to BB8 cupcakes
[01:50:25.980 --> 01:50:32.620]   and a bunch of other things. Well we're all pretty excited about the new the new Star Wars
[01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:37.580]   but the BB8 robot is really the thing that gets me and then the next and then we've got we're
[01:50:37.580 --> 01:50:43.500]   working we're finishing up right now and and sending it out soon the space issue. Ooh that's the one
[01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:50.620]   that comes after the BB8 issue. Can you make your own Pluto? Maybe? For you anything. I'd like a Pluto.
[01:50:50.620 --> 01:50:57.340]   And I want Charon as well or Charon. I say Charon people think I want somebody named Charon.
[01:50:57.340 --> 01:51:04.620]   I want the moon of Pluto. Charon. Charon. Yeah. Yeah. All right everybody I thank you so much for being
[01:51:04.620 --> 01:51:09.900]   here. Nice to kind of get back in the seat and you know it's just like riding a bicycle. I feel
