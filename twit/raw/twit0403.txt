[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Starting with from Bloomberg Business Week Mr. Mark Millian.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   You're still with Bloomberg.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   You still with Bloomberg?
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   You just have to check.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   It's been a little over a year actually.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   First got to know you when you were one of the youngest guys at the LA Times.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   You started there as an intern right?
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   And then went to CNN and now you're at Bloomberg.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Now Bloomberg.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   It's good to have you.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Have you seen the ages?
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Welcome.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Good to see you too.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Also here from the UK from Oxford.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Mr. Will Harris.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Hey Will.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Hey, how's it going guys?
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   You're still doing Channel Flip.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Still doing the Channel Flip.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   And you got a new channel I see with some unknown comic.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Some guy you've never really heard of.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   He's kind of obscure.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   He's a UK person.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I think he's going to be huge I think because I watched it and I just wish he'd do more because he seems to be more.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Because he seems to be a very funny fellow.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Seems to be.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I think maybe he's one to watch.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   He's an up and comer as they say.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   So we have a new YouTube channel with Richard Vase and it's youtube.com/ricagevase as you might
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   guess.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Or Plump Lard.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Plump Lard.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Plump Lard.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   So what's really interesting is not only is it Ricky Gervais doing some great stuff on
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   YouTube.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   But it's Ricky Gervais as David Brent the character he created for the UK office.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   So David Brent was like the original Michael Scott.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Oh, worse.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Worse.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Marmy as hell.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   He was like the king of it.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   And he was also kind of an idiot but not really in a kind of self knowledgeable way.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   And so Ricky said he would never do David Brent once he finished the office in the UK.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   But you know, we managed to convince him to bring it back and he's got this kind of crazy.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   It's like 10 years on from the office.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   What's David Brent doing now?
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   He's still doing the repping.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   He's so horrible.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   He's a company and he's trying to like he's like, you know, black rappers and he's kind
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   of crazy ethnic artists.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   He keeps trying to put himself in the music videos.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Oh, I love him.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.400]   You know, cringe worthy and awkward.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.400]   I love him.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.400]   Oh my gosh.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.600]   I'm so glad you got him back.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.600]   So that's good.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.400]   You're doing pretty well there, Will Harris.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.120]   You're you've become a promoter like from the past.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.400]   You're the next Richard Branson.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.320]   I'm Ella.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.560]   And then he frees me up next.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.560]   I want to see you.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.480]   I want to see that would be good.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.720]   The Will Harris airline with where all the bathrooms are locked.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.880]   Also with is Mr. John C. Devorak wearing a lovely big big dog shirt.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:07.800]   You know, it's weird though because usually you don't make Hawaiian shirts at a flannel.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.800]   That's kind of an.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.800]   Yeah, I know.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.800]   It's a little hot.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.800]   It's flannel.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.800]   That's actually ran.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.440]   Oh, that's ran that feels like flannel.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.600]   I don't know how they made it this way, but it's like thick Chinese style.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.240]   I love it.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.520]   Anyway, the week is here.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.000]   You wrote John a great antidote.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.240]   Robert Scoble's been wearing Google Glass for two weeks.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:33.480]   He's polluted every social media stream I subscribe to with bad pictures through glass,
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.440]   all tagged with through glass.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.840]   And he's given his review.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.800]   He basically says it comes down to price.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.840]   You on the other hand, pose a very interesting question.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.920]   Is Google Glass a world class hoax?
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.920]   Yeah, hoax.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.920]   Why is it?
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.920]   Why do you say that?
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.920]   Well, you read the column.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.480]   It's a PC magazine last Friday.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.480]   Check it out.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.640]   Read it because I got all the details in there.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.000]   Well, yeah, but for people who are watching this show.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.520]   Sergey Brin is a practical joker.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.520]   We know that.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.520]   Right?
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.520]   He's the one with the glasses all the time.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.520]   Here's what triggered the whole thing.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.560]   A couple of things.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.760]   One was your groucing last show about Scoble getting glasses while he didn't have the same
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.720]   number waiting list number you had.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.720]   Right.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.720]   And I started thinking about that.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:18.040]   And then during the week when Eric Schmidt kind of backed off from even talking about it.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.720]   Eric said it's not going to be up till next year.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.400]   Yeah, he was backing away from the whole thing.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.000]   He didn't want to discuss it in any detail.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.440]   I started saying he can't maintain the joke.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.880]   The joke he's cracking under the strain.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:28.880]   Yes.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.880]   He is.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:30.880]   Come on.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.880]   That way.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.880]   And here's the other thing.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.040]   Here's what in that triggered one more thought which was that I saw a presentation by Eric.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.080]   I think it was at the University of Washington where he was and it was on C-SPAN.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.320]   I wasn't at it.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.120]   And he was showing his power points and he at some point he says, I have to be really
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:52.600]   careful with these power points because the guys meaning Sergey and Paige get a hold of
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.360]   this thing and they put embarrassing slides up.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.560]   So when he's given his power point, all of a sudden a goat see or something.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.560]   Oh God.
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.280]   Which you know just grosses everybody out.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.000]   And so I'm thinking wait a minute.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.960]   This whole thing looks like a scam.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:05.960]   And here's one.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:11.120]   And so then I added the two other elements which was that again, Scoble who can be trusted
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.280]   to always like everything.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.880]   Scoble caught Sergey if you remember about a year and a half ago roaming around somewhere
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.880]   with the glasses on.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.040]   He took a couple pictures as though it was candid.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.360]   And he says, oh look at this.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.960]   Sergey's got the glasses on.
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.680]   And then like I guess about three or four months ago, Sergey supposedly is in the New
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.680]   York subway.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.680]   Yeah that was bogus.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.200]   A billionaire that can get in the subway.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.240]   You know he should have two limos.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.240]   He's on the subway.
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.640]   He actually has two private jets.
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.320]   Yeah, two 67s.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.120]   And so he meanwhile and they also have some some other stuff.
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.120]   Submarine.
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.120]   Hovercraft.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.200]   So they had so here he is in the subway and the guy who took his picture coincidentally
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.200]   is a wearable computer guy.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.920]   This is, that was a little bogus.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.120]   This is looking like a setup just a, I think it's out of control.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.240]   Well there's no question they're making them because people are wearing them.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.440]   You're going to take the joke.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.520]   Let's go for it.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.520]   Take it right to the ear collection.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.280]   Your contention is they have no intent of selling these.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.680]   They may or may not sell them.
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.000]   But whatever the case is, this is not not going anywhere.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.080]   Robert Scoble says, I will never live a day of my life from now on.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.320]   So see now this sounds like bogus.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.320]   Without Google glass.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.320]   See this is all part of it.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.720]   This is a practical joke line.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:26.160]   Because that's bull.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.640]   But people, real people have them right now.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.640]   Yes.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.640]   Just the scope was a real people.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.640]   Who?
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.640]   Who's got them?
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:33.640]   Actually I don't know any real people who have them.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.640]   Well come on.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.640]   Well who's got them?
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.280]   Some developers have them but it's mostly Google people right now.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.280]   Google people.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.280]   They're starting to open up.
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.280]   A few journalists have them.
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.040]   But what's interesting is I am, I did last year we bought glass.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.040]   Yeah you got them.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.240]   And I have the reservation but I have not heard word one about.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.200]   It was your check cashed.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:57.320]   No because they don't charge you until they say something.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:02.200]   I have lots of issues with glass but I'm increasingly of the opinion that it's not just Google that's
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.320]   going to do this, that there are a lot of companies.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.080]   In fact we've seen a number of companies say yeah we're working on something similar.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.720]   Wearable computing is the next big thing.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.640]   You've got to admit that John.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.800]   Maybe it's a watch, maybe it's glass, maybe it's a headspace.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.800]   Well the phone is pretty wearable.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.960]   I mean I care that my pocket is kind of wearable.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.600]   Tim Stevens of Engadget has Google Glasses.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.840]   Is he pulling a joke on that?
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.840]   I don't know.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.840]   I don't think what do you do with the glasses?
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.600]   You wear them and take pictures.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.840]   Apparently that's all they do.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.720]   They take crappy pictures.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.960]   They are kind of crappy.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.200]   I mean they're not bad.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.880]   I find it amazing that the teardown on this thing looked like it was like 200 bucks worth
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.080]   of parts.
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.840]   And they're selling these for like $1,500.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.840]   $1,500.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.000]   And Robert makes the point and I think this is true.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.960]   We even asked this last week on Twitter, well how much would you pay if this were a product?
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:53.920]   And most people agreed that somewhere between 200 and 300 bucks is the most they would pay
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:54.920]   for this.
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.720]   Which is good because if it cost them 200 bucks to make that's about right.
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.680]   Well a regular pair of glass frames nowadays decent ones.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.680]   Yeah a couple hundred.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.680]   Maybe four.
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.880]   Well you go to Oliver Peoples.
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.360]   You get like the fancy glasses.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.120]   But if you're going to pay 300, by the way I think there's a kind of, have you seen these
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.040]   glasses that actually change the focal length and everything in real time?
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.600]   Yeah they never got those out.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.600]   Yeah I wonder why.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.600]   They never worry.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.680]   I talked to somebody who is an expert in the glass business.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.840]   You know there's only really, there's one company that kind of.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.840]   Laxotica.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.800]   Yeah Laxotica controls most of this stuff and I think artificially jerks the prices up.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:30.800]   Oh yeah.
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:31.800]   Yeah it's good.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.800]   Yeah pretty much monopoly.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.720]   They own you know a lot of the chains like.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.800]   They own Oakley and they do glass for Louis Vuitton and all the big brands.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.800]   They're pretty much have it all.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:44.320]   In fact I think that this was the story I heard is they couldn't get that because these
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:49.240]   guys who developed these self focusing glasses had either had a hard time making them.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.200]   We saw them at CES two years ago.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.200]   Right.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.560]   Or more likely couldn't crack the monopoly.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.640]   Well whatever the case that Google's got the same issue I'm sure and we'll see what
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.640]   happens.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.200]   Well I mean they're not going to have the same issue are they?
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.840]   Because they're not actual glasses and as far as I'm aware you can't actually wear Google
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.080]   glass with glass.
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.440]   This is part of the problem because you and I wear glasses.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.440]   This is a bit of a problem.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.440]   Most people wear glasses or they have contacts.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.440]   Well anyway people go to that column is PCMag.com it's last Friday.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.120]   I've got all the documents.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.440]   This is a blatant ploy to get people to pay reviews.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.440]   Come on.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.280]   I mean I really believe that.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.160]   Yeah I'm totally sincere.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.720]   You can't write a column like this.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.200]   You can not nail it if you're not if you don't have the conviction.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.200]   The courage you're convicting.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.320]   I don't see any evidence that there's not a hoax.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.320]   And it's always surrogate.
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.320]   Surgate surrogate.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.320]   I mean he's the hoax.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.920]   You know it's Larry doesn't talk about it at all.
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.840]   No he never talks about it and you don't see him wearing it.
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.440]   The CEO of Google is like it's like they don't exist.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.000]   Yeah they're saying okay surrogate do your thing whatever will see what happens but it
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.720]   could be bad.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:58.720]   Well we've talked before many times about the issues with Google glass.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.080]   It's interesting as the general public learns about it.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.240]   I get a lot of calls on the radio show we were talking about privacy.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.360]   What happens if you wear Google glass into a men's room.
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.720]   Robert Scoble by his own admission at least 20 times walked into a men's room wearing
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.080]   a camera on his head.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:16.680]   Yeah that would be Robert Scoble.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.760]   I mean do we have any etiquette for this do you take them off.
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.040]   He also says he wears them in the shower.
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.040]   He tweeted that today.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.000]   Yeah well there's something Robert.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.160]   He is no no he is he is part of the scam.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.160]   He's not part of the scam.
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.160]   He doesn't have to be.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.880]   It's easy to get Robert to say I like something.
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.880]   I think he's the stooge is what you're saying.
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.080]   Yes that's a good word for it.
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.600]   I love Robert Roberts and everybody likes Robert.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.600]   I have nothing wrong.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.640]   I never said anything bad about anybody I'll give him credit for that.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.360]   But he's also never said anything bad about a product.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.240]   He says this is the most interesting new product since the iPhone and I don't say that lightly.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:53.840]   What is it don't say it lightly what does that mean.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.160]   But look at the pictures he takes with it.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.160]   This was one part of my problem.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.160]   Look at this thing is that a cat.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:08.480]   Well it's on your eyebrow so you don't you know it's like I don't know I just to me I
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.320]   don't know if people are going to walk around with that thing on their head.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.400]   And now Curry has a lot of these pictures posted on Glassholes.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.120]   So my.
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.120]   So my.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.840]   I don't know I'd walk around with that thing on my head but if it was just like a smaller
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.800]   thing attached to a normal pair of glasses.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:32.560]   You know I think wearable I think wearable computing is a completely legitimate category.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.000]   I think you know we all understand how the smartphone revolutionized the world.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   The idea and this this seemed like impossible 10 years ago that you would have internet
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.120]   access everywhere you go at any time if you wanted to look up a fact.
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.120]   I'm not.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.840]   If you're sitting in a movie theater and you say what movie was that guy in.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.600]   Well that's in your hands instantly.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.920]   That's a revolution.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:14:01.240]   At least 10 years ago if not longer they a lot of people that were that were in the business
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.320]   of not predicting but the.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:09.680]   We all thought this would all say what happened so why why are you now saying it's a huge surprise.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.000]   Just because how many things have they said would have you know flying cars to talking
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.040]   computers we've thought a lot of things would happen this one really did and not only that
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.120]   and this is probably more to the point.
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:23.320]   It really did change things considerably I think I agree with the change this like there's
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.760]   nothing's going to be the same with in terms of that and so the that doesn't mean you need
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:31.720]   something you know in front of your eyeball you look like a Borg walking around like complete
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.720]   crazed maniac.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:36.480]   It's not enough you know the two number of things have changed you know you never saw
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:41.160]   them in the past I've always thought about this one is people standing around holding
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:45.880]   an object way in front of them taking pictures or you mean the iPad well the iPad or the
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:50.200]   phone any new cameras right you know you don't have a few nobody's ever doing this
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.320]   anymore they're always doing this and the other thing is people standing around at airports
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.600]   train station everybody's house leaning somewhere with this with this looking like this the
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.200]   phone to their ear right which you've never seen you know you would have seen 20 years
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:07.720]   ago I kind of wonder if we aren't really kind of all becoming badly addicted to this because
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:12.880]   I have I see a lot of people who cannot go five minutes without kind of pulling and I'm
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:17.400]   one of them it's like the crack barrier it's really addictive and pulling out the phone
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.880]   and just I see people walking down you go out in Petaluma watch people walk down the street
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:25.840]   50% fully 50% will be looking at a phone even if they're walking with somebody right it's
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:30.680]   universal is that good it is really crazy is that like sometimes you know I don't I'm
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:35.360]   not sure it is but sometimes you stand you know in an airport or stand you know a train
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:41.360]   station or something and if you just stop for a second and just look around like the number
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:46.600]   of people talking to each other is you know less than 10% the number of people looking at
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:52.440]   something right or like tapping something is you know maybe 60% and the number of people
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:58.120]   just kind of gazing blankly with something in their ears is like the other 40% like it's
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:03.280]   it is crazy it's this it's this complete step change and it's such a change that it makes
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:08.440]   me think that it's not inconceivable that in another 10 years time everybody would be sort
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:13.320]   of looking up into the right hand corner of their vision you know what something completely
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:18.600]   surreal being projected onto them you know it's not that much of a leap really is it
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:24.440]   well I think it is in social situations when you know if I hang out with people and they
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:28.520]   have their phone in front of their faces that those are people I don't want to hang out
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:33.240]   with you're you're a younger person you grew up with this technology in your life from you
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:39.240]   know early uh it's just a baby yeah almost it's your baby what happens when you're
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.840]   gentle when you go out with people of your age and your generation it looks like everybody
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.920]   takes out their phone and puts it on the table is that the case pretty common yeah how many
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:51.720]   and then half of them are checking into four squares they're sitting down right or some
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:57.240]   variation or some was kind of maybe or face or somewhere um is then the etiquette to that's
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:02.520]   it leave it alone it depends I mean if you know you you'll have it on the table so you can check
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:06.920]   your messages and there are some some people will you know check it periodically it's hot
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:11.400]   and you it's hard look it's in your pocket it's buzzing isn't it almost impossible not to pull it
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:17.560]   out um to an extent but you know we've I think my generation has probably started to build up
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:22.680]   the tolerance to you know glancing down and then ignoring it for the most part I think there are
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:27.400]   a lot of people who can you know my age that can still engage in meaningful conversation without
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:32.680]   having something in front of their face maybe you're better at than people in our generation who
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:38.280]   are still kind of enamored to the technology and go wow this is great yeah I mean you know they
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:43.080]   they call I think maybe people a little bit younger than me or supposed to be digital yeah digital
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:49.080]   natives um the millennial generation you know has grown up with this and it's ingrained into
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:54.600]   themselves where uh and a lot of them have more sophisticated techniques for internet privacy
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:59.240]   than we do yeah um they'll you know or close down their facebook accounts when they log off the
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:03.240]   literally literally take that off of facebook so that when they log back on you know their profile
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:07.720]   won't be visible when they're not actively chasing the site so they've learned this but then or
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:11.880]   then the others who just don't care and it's like every boo everything's out seems to be most of
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:17.720]   them look at uh apple's clearly influenced by what's going on this is the newest iPhone 5 ad that just
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:21.960]   uh just came out a couple of days ago let's play this here
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:30.440]   we're running around with our phones taking pictures at all times this is this is a response that if
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:34.760]   you ask me to google glass these are the things that we're in the google glass ads in a way right
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:42.680]   for those listening it's just really people with their iPhones taking a lot of pictures
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:47.320]   lots a lot of pictures picture picture picture picture
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:54.040]   and again you know the quality is is it's actually better than you think it should be it's good but
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:58.840]   i'm just saying but it's kind of experiencing life through the way that om d whatever you have and
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:05.640]   no no no i love my camera but i do use my phone to take a lot of pictures i do too but more because
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:12.280]   it's connected and because i can it's more instantaneous i don't have to go home process oh it's easy it's
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:16.680]   easy when you've got it like it's the one thing like you press the button you take the picture it's
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.520]   that's it's right it's right taking with the iPhone you know the idea of pulling it off your
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:24.360]   camera and then putting it into your computer and then doing it from your desktop it's like oh
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:29.240]   the copy you know it's so much work the copy which we dismissed but it says more phones and this is
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:33.720]   true i were taking with the iPhone then all cameras combined this has become the new camera
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:39.560]   yeah but i would dispose of the other camera the thing that i draw from that that i draw from
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:44.280]   that says different from what them ad is trying to say is and we are experiencing life through the
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.720]   lens of this camera but the person at the concert who's not listening to the concert
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:53.320]   once you see the video of the guy at the baseball game who's taking the video of the baseball game
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:58.840]   on the ipad so this is amazing i don't know if you can pull it up chat but there's a video of a
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:03.960]   guy and he's got his ipad out like this and he's filming the whole baseball game what's he gonna do
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:09.800]   with it really not he's clearly not paying attention and the batter turns around and he swings this
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:15.320]   hit and the baseball just comes and smashes the ipad in front of this guy's face i can't see it
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:24.680]   fine you know everybody applauds boom oh that's awesome nice shot kid and he's still he's still
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:29.320]   as in front of us a little league game that's funny yeah foul ball just goes right bam into
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:34.440]   that and he puts it right back up doesn't he yeah well i protected him it did actually yeah
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:39.240]   to do the shields good good idea uh oh
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:46.440]   i think one of the important points about glass i think the point that eric smith was trying to
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:52.600]   make in his speech is that we'll have to develop social norms to use it i want i saw a tweet from
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:21:01.400]   uh joe hubert who designed the original facebook app who said um you know glass isn't necessarily
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:06.360]   the evolution of the smartphone maybe it's the evolution of the bluetooth headset and i could
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:13.000]   see you know it being useful in certain scenarios maybe hopefully not driving but you know when you're
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.920]   out running or doing something where you don't have your hands easily available i can see that
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:24.040]   being useful but nightseeing would be fun but wearing it in you know when you're sitting down
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:29.400]   to dinner i think is a little crazy i disagree i do not think it's the extension of bluetooth i
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:35.160]   think it's a new way of thinking about computing it really is wearable computing and the more i think
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:40.920]   about it the more i feel like this was this was the promise remember the guy the mit guy who worked
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:47.880]   yeah his otheic camera he's no he was wearing a computer all the time many years ago and he was
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:54.760]   an early pioneer in uh in wearable computing and it's a different experience uh if the computer is
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:22:01.720]   a heads up display is part of your sensarium at all times i like that word like that word
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:07.480]   uh and i i think that it's it's going to be a revolution equivalent to this smartphone
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:11.800]   revolution is the next step in the smartphone revolution scientific american had an article
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:16.600]   this week in which they talk about all the other companies that are working on this kind of thing
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:21.640]   garter says there about a dozen companies with wearable products in the works many
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:28.440]   almost ready so if it's a hoax it's a it's there he is steve man yeah he's had some interesting
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:32.440]   things about yeah i want to walk around looking like that well he that was the thing about steve
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:37.400]   that was amazing is he was totally willing to look like a dork i mean in the early days he had
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:44.280]   carried around a tower pc on his back yeah yeah this is the kind of this this is your hero apparently
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:52.040]   he is look at this this is he is my hero because he was doing the research that i think in many ways
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:56.600]   kind of informed us as to what this could end up being it's really augmented reality we're talking
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.840]   of his raising the suburbs they'd be beating him up
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:04.520]   he might have been saying this screwed up his vision having well he pointed out he did he wrote
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:08.840]   an article saying last you know you can one thing you had to watch out for is the brain adapts to
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:14.600]   what it's seeing uh remember the and he mentions this famous experiment where uh uh a guy wore
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:20.040]   upside down lenses within a day or two his eyes adjusted to the fact that he was in fact seeing
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:24.840]   upside down and saw right side up once again because we in fact do see upside down so our brain
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:30.440]   adjusts and uh and he said you know your brain sooner than you think will adapt to glass and you
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:34.680]   may have all sorts of side effects that you don't anticipate when you take it off he said he often
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:38.840]   would get disoriented without his glasses on well let's see what happens with scoble
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:49.160]   how would you tell could you tell whoa i'm dizzy yeah well okay um according to gartner as many
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:53.240]   you know gartner we consider the source because they say crazy things all the time but uh not that
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:58.680]   there could be as many as 10 million smart glasses sold worldwide by 2016 the key is going to be
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:03.320]   software actually this is from ims research they define smart glasses as wearable computers
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:08.440]   with a head mounted display but it's the same as uh mobile without apps you got nothing
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:14.120]   it's such rubbish i'm just going to start a research company that's like WH research says
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:22.760]   20 million smart phone enables you know glass devices go for it find it it's oh it by 2020
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:28.120]   you've got no idea what that is i mean if you hit it you're gold there's a company in uh Rochester
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:33.880]   to york called vusix that makes uh the m100 smart glasses shipping now to developers can run any
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:40.200]   android app developers according to the ceo are building augmented reality apps for the m100 in
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:48.200]   fitness navigation and gaming um these these kind of look like google glass and they predate it and
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:53.960]   they and they're almost out they may be so is this a hoax they may be no i think there some people
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:59.640]   are doing this seriously i'm just saying the way it's being put the way google's going about it
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:05.240]   looks like a hoax right it's got all the elements it's got a checklist they do the fake publicity
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:10.600]   effect i remember the show recently where uh surrogate goes on says anyone holding and playing
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:17.800]   with it with an iphone or a mask is emasculating you should be wearing these very silly silly glasses
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:24.920]   yeah that's not emasculating at all i i am excited about the idea of wearable technology what i
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:29.240]   do think that it is a very big challenge is how you how what is the user interface how's it gonna
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:33.560]   work our glasses the right way is a watch the right way maybe there's some other way to it
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:37.720]   the phone is so popular the smartphone is already pet by the way i think this last week is when it
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:43.320]   passed the feature phone is right total sales that's right uh that is a fine device it works great
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:48.440]   what more do you want well i think in a way oh wait a minute my phone just went off
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:56.520]   i think in a way the the ubiquity of the smartphone is the is it's like john the baptist
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:03.480]   it's paving the way john the baptist paving the way for the future of wearable computing it's the
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:09.160]   it's the camel's nose under the tent i would credit that with brianley john the baptist i believe
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:14.280]   john the baptist was considered to be paving the way maybe i believe that was the point of john
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:18.200]   the baptist let me just check my phone we're gonna take a break check that phone check it check it
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:25.400]   check that uh by the way seco making smart glasses with their partner scope ar they've created the
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:31.000]   bt 100 ar software for use in industrial training for the first time what the breakthrough is for
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.600]   the first time ever we've got the power thanks to moor's law to do augmented reality and something
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:41.800]   small enough to wear and that's what the breakthrough is in in i think i talked to the ceo of oakley about
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:47.240]   a year ago they're doing our thing yeah they're also working on uh sort of a research project
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:53.720]   and they'll be stylish oh yeah uh be looking good wearing these glasses one of the questions about
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:59.880]   google glass chick magnet in the code somebody's looked through the code and found that there are
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:06.280]   gestures that would allow you for instance to blink to take a picture and get slapped probably
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:12.200]   yeah that just looks creepy and you can't wink in real life that's just not a thing and then she
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:19.400]   says take a picture it'll last longer and you say i am wink wink uh the two finger browser zoom
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:25.880]   how about the one finger browser zoom well they've got the head nod in there right
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:30.920]   doesn't it do the head nod yeah you're supposed to bopped your head around like a maniac you know so
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:39.800]   you look like a complete idiot and that's another give away yeah glass take a pic like perfect for
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:45.880]   going to a concert like glass take a picture zoom in zoom in zoom in zoom out uh and glass has
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:53.160]   already been jailbroken but yes of course of course didn't take them long so that it allows you to do
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:58.680]   what after it's been jailbroken put any piece of software you want to uh huh sure i want facial
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:02.760]   recognition because i'm getting old and i can't remember people's names anyway now i'll be able to
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:10.360]   go up to me hosey how are you good to see you how's the kids jenny and marjie yeah i see your birthdays
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:14.440]   coming i mean that would be one use for these things i think that's a great thing i think you're
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:23.240]   getting that data from the glasses i grab them oh there it is you big phony who am i what am i doing
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:28.280]   here hey we got a new sponsor i'm really excited about uh this uh company uh friend of mine dana
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:35.400]   i consider started uh square space has started it's called some all and and you you hit you knocked
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:42.520]   you got it will hear us you said is that a excel nerd joke kind of is the idea yes it kind of is
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:50.280]   the idea is we have a lot of data out there and uh from youtube to twitter to google to paypal
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:56.440]   the amazon for us it's all of our downloads our views wouldn't be amazing if there were a way to
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:01.320]   combine this and get insights from this data by clik this is primarily i think this was primarily
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:08.040]   views for a business um for us it would be amazing to be able to combine views with social media
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:17.320]   campaigns with posts i see what our e-commerce is doing compared to websites some all combines
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:22.840]   it all into a very smart dashboard that can extract information this has been around for a
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:28.280]   long time for big companies in a technology called business intelligence companies like sas make
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:32.600]   these amazing dashboards and companies can really see what's happening with the company and look
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:40.280]   ahead to see what's going to happen this now is available to everybody free from sumall.com there's
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:46.360]   no fee it's i think they'll probably think about a freemium model at some point but for the moment
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:53.160]   if you go to pricing at sumall.com they say free that's the price doesn't cost you a thing
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:59.720]   uh this is an amazing 25,000 companies are using sumall by the way they do have a pricing plan
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:05.640]   but it's free for now or it's choose your plan later because we don't they're not charging
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:10.600]   amazing what they're doing that's a little hard to describe so here's what i would suggest visit
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:18.440]   sumall.com uh and play with it it date look at this is the era of big data to figure out what's
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:22.120]   going on these are all the services you can connect now and they're adding more uh by the way this
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:26.040]   is not scraping these services they have partnerships with all these services so they're getting the
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:32.040]   numbers directly from the service through the api updated in real time so you can watch real-time
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:37.880]   graphs of how things are going in your business get an idea of where they're going get prognostication
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:43.400]   amazon so currently they have deals with amazon paypal ebay authorized on at google analytics google
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:50.360]   adwords shopify bing facebook twitter and youtube more coming every single day it's just a fascinating
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:55.400]   business to me i just think the amazing thing about this is you know for even for doing like channel
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:31:00.520]   flip all our data is in so many different places like you have to get a one place to get data about
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:05.000]   your twitter account and one place to get a google analytics one place to get youtube analytics
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.640]   the ability to combine all of that and then do kind of cross-analysis across all of them
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:14.120]   like that's ridiculously powerful is the sort of thing that really you had to pay like tens of
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:18.440]   gazillions of dollars for in the past so this is this is really staggering it's bi for the rest
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:23.720]   of us it's amazing tens of gazillions it's that much at least pack fives using it to track
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:29.560]   their uh that's really cool i said what darren's doing with this is they're tracking uh they're
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:33.880]   e-commerce is really big for them so they track the relationship between what they do on shows with
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:38.920]   the e-commerce on the site fascinating i mean these insights are priceless they can change

[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:54.600]   scoble in the shower that is just a scary picture the funny thing is he's wearing the last
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:32:00.760]   street chat thing put it on screen yeah don't see it the buzz i know better buzzfeed headline is
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:04.280]   this photo of a man showering with google glass will haunt you for the rest of your life
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:10.680]   oh my god i see it the funny thing is it's not taken with glass unless somebody else in his family

[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:21.800]   right it's a mirror robert actually does it's not i hate to say it's not the first time i've seen
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:25.400]   a picture of robert in the shower really what websites do you go
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:30.760]   there it is oh my god that can't be unseen i think you could that's the new goatee
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:37.080]   that's bad that's not the new goatee yeah no it's not it's not that bad
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:45.800]   uh it's a little weird that is a very white guy i love robert i have to say he's you know no shame
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:52.040]   and and that's what makes him fascinating and fun world wide developers conference apple
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:58.760]   is having it it's coming in june june 10th through 14th tickets went on sale april 25th at 10 a.m
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:07.400]   they were sold out at 10 o 2 two minutes so this is the new thing by the way the new metric that
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:12.120]   all the companies microsoft google apple use for how popular they are with developers will are
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:16.760]   developer coverage sold out in 22 minutes i sold that so this is the new world record well they do
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:21.560]   that of course they can pull it off because they give away at least as much as you're paying to go
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:28.200]   to the thing i think google's google does apple does not apple does not have to give you nothing
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:35.560]   crap no well then why would anyone go because you want to learn well and and i think this is not
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:39.800]   a surprise first of all there's only a few thousand tickets it's it's art it's artificially
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:46.840]   constrained but also think about how much money people make writing apps for iphone ipad it's a
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:51.720]   it is a land grab i mean there's a gold rush it's going crazy right now yeah they get they get one
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:58.600]   on one lessons there and they get to go to lectures and they also usually get access to an sdk that
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:04.440]   other developers ah there you go well that's valuable in 2010 wwdc sold out in eight days
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:15.640]   2011 12 hours by uh under two hours in 2012 2013 two minutes and by the way 2014 already sold out
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:21.720]   it's all right there is exactly it in let in under 30 seconds less than i don't know
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:28.760]   i think it just goes to prove that regardless of you know the ridiculous negative um
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:34.760]   quote reporting unquote around apple's performance at the moment developers are still
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:40.600]   super excited about ios the super excited about the platform users are still spending more per
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:45.480]   you know more dollars per user on that platform than any other mobile platform around that's why
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:49.960]   um and i think you know everybody is you know there's a great headline i saw today which was
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:55.560]   you know apple's next big product isn't hardware it's ios 7 right i think everyone is just super
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:59.720]   psyched to see what johnny i was going to do with them with the new revision and that's what they'll
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:06.520]   be revealing in june and and we think flat right no more skeu morphism no more rounded corners no more
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:13.400]   gradients i did lord we hope so i have you know i uh i i personally have done this in my android
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:18.840]   platform i uh i stopped using the beautiful widgets which had gradients around corners and
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:25.400]   now i'm using hd widgets which are flat flat flat see it and it's pleasant it's refreshing
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:31.560]   yeah t like windows windows eight windows eight started windows eight started but you know the
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:35.640]   reason they called it metro is because they copied the subway sides where was it the subway
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:39.960]   signs from germany or somewhere that's why we're in french that's for sure i don't know what
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:48.120]   french are baroque not baro makes whole art deco or sure or actually uh new vaux new vaux so they
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:52.760]   didn't get sued over it like apple got no they get apparently there's some company metro that was
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:56.680]   called metro dot somewhere and they oh yeah they changed the name they
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:01.800]   threatened to sue them and so then microsoft's just stop using it remember apple got sued by the
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:08.440]   swiss train company i can unlock for stealing the uh the clock right in ios right there it is
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:14.440]   metro pout in a few poofies this is the uh i think it's a german uh like store chain
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:19.800]   and uh that's why they had to stop it this thing they even come on see if you can find the on off
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.800]   switch ladies and gentlemen let's start the timer chat
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:32.040]   it's not that art john there's a button but there's just a button that's the volume
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:38.040]   that's where samson puts its buttons yeah samson puts his buttons on the right and uh and a lot of
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:43.000]   older android stuff this button's on the top maybe john will figure that out button on the top
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:49.080]   that little button oh the button oh there's big giant they look like the ir receive

[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:28.040]   iPhone 4 antenna gate uh and you know i never had an iPhone 4 you had to go to apple site and
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:32.840]   too too late don't try to do it now to get that big fifteen dollar check uh you had to go to apple
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:40.040]   site and say yes i have problems with my antenna on my iPhone 4 no i can't fix it and no i will not
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:46.680]   accept a bumper uh and then apple what you should have told us there's a couple shows ago i know i
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:52.360]   didn't know you literally had to declare i have experienced antenna reception issues i'm unable to
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:57.240]   return my iPhone 4 without anchoring costs i'm unwilling to use a case or free bumper for my
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:05.800]   iPhone 4 and i have completed unwilling unwilling i have just summarized that with um what is it
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:12.760]   like that destinies child song it's like no i don't want no bumper no no my calls i'm fine
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:19.640]   really boy hope we don't get that again just because of that we're gonna get pulled off youtube you
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:25.880]   realize that yeah that's true you just pitch perfect it's perfect um power id by the way the
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:31.640]   power button is an ir transmitter on that two day points out in the chat room you can use that as a
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:36.280]   universal remote it's actually a great remote so it looks like it's like uh it's like a harmony
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:40.440]   one or something because if you can program it to do tasks and the whole thing logitech's killing
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:45.240]   the harmony division yeah isn't that weird well i'm making money on it i thought i don't think
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:48.760]   they've decided i think they've got to think of a spin on it let's write because of these phones
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:53.640]   you think logitech's not making money on the remotes yeah they want to get out of that business
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:39:00.600]   wow it's kind of a shame i thought the harmony family wanted to buy it back mr mrs harmony
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:06.280]   that they also started e-harmony right yeah right no i think the people who founded it wanted to
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:10.440]   buy it back i wonder what the what the story is on that it does seem like that's a good business
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:17.480]   the harmony one is the definitive remote the problem is uh it's too complicated people i don't
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:21.960]   know what the solution is maybe it's the smartphone the galaxy s4 will also have a uh you have a lot
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:28.360]   of stuff that you'd keep downloading i love applications i'm ap crazy you look john's looking

[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:45.000]   know when it's gonna get here because they're back ordered now because of uh component shortages
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:52.600]   tim cook raised almost three hundred thousand dollars for charity
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.760]   for uh the chance to have a coffee with him
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:40:01.560]   why don't you just call him up and make an appointment with the secretary

[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:41.240]   if you want to bid you have until may 14th current high bid 600 thousand dollars that's a lot more i
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:46.120]   like to know who's making these bids well can you see maybe a lot more interesting oh you can see
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:51.480]   you can who what's a guy's name uh let's see the current high bid is from povly.com who bid against
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:55.800]   himself wouldn't have been funny for spilled gates that's this guy's a moron wait a minute the
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:41:00.920]   winning bid now it says winning is s mosen but it's not i don't think it's over it's support for the
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:07.560]   rfk center for justice and mosen you're kidding you know who he is never enough uh doctor bluetooth
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:15.720]   dot com cash-oggy clear crate dot com marky mark bid 555 that mark walburg you think you would doubt
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:21.000]   it not be me and my gosh gupta what's weird is like it looks like they're bidding against
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.600]   themselves there must be other people in there yeah there's some fish well maybe there well
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:32.280]   some of these guys probably don't know how to bid i think it's 450 i'll bid for 75 i'll bid 500
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:39.720]   who's got charity bidder 10 uh password box that this he also just you also just said that um so
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:44.760]   as well as doing this tim cook just said but apple's giving what eight million dollars to china earth
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:49.720]   quick really i think that's great and i think it's really interesting because you know jobs was
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:55.720]   really famous for um not doing anything charity wise at all right when he came back to apple he
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:42:01.560]   like cut all the employee charitable contributions didn't do anything the charity job job didn't
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:06.920]   right um and one of the first things that tim cook did when he came on a ceo it was like real
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:12.440]   state company matching for charities and start doing all this stuff off his own back and it's kind
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:19.000]   of like a um a real mark if i guess the way that he sees corporate responsibility in a way that jobs
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:25.560]   didn't quite and that's why apple is over is it apple money or is it his money
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:30.840]   well this is an apple money that he's eight million in uh divide in products i think oh it's
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:38.680]   own earnings products too oh apple three yes we're gonna give y'all iphone that is not great
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:44.280]   now somebody's in that hole toss up an iphone so it says aside from the cash donation
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:49.800]   we to help with the affected people tied over the difficulties were committed to providing
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:54.760]   new apple devices to schools and that is the disaster area and apple employees in the locali
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:43:00.120]   are on standby to help at any time this is because apple has had some pr problems in china
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:06.440]   yes um i've i've been talking to a lot of people and doing a lot of research on this um in particular
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:11.480]   china is you know their big growth story right now i mean this is something that they point to
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:16.920]   and every earnings call and and every tim cook in every public speech is very concerned about china
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:21.160]   because it's an up-and-coming market right a lot of people are getting connected to the internet
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:25.000]   for the first time getting the future we have more people connected to the internet than we do
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:33.320]   as we speak that's true yeah then then of all the u.s. population actually it's it's something like
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:37.560]   over a billion people can over half a million or half a billion connected i think it's half a
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:44.840]   billion um we recently launched uh about a week ago a a new section on our website called global tech
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:51.560]   bloomberg.com/globaltech and one of the big topics we've covered in addition to foxcon is is apple
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:44:00.040]   going into china has been a huge story for them um and there's you know a lot of questions about
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:06.600]   whether this is something that can save the stock um they've been pointing to it quite a bit apple
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:13.080]   stock has had some troubles recently um but in lieu of you know launching some new products
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:18.280]   it's china has been the has been the story did you write that headline i did yeah you like that
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:24.680]   that's the best goddamn headline i ever said hp smelt it time for the tech industry to deal with it
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:34.920]   and of course they're talking about smelting yeah the hp melting that may be the best tech headline i
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:41.240]   i never read thank you um hp was the first information technology company to disclose
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:46.600]   its full list of smelters that are used in its supply chain is smelting a big source of pollution
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:54.600]   smelting is a big source of pollution yes and also sort of almost the root of a lot of the
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:59.880]   labor violations that happen when they're developing your smartphone not the not the ore mines but the
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:06.680]   smelters well the hp's point of view is that if you start putting pressure on the smelters uh they get
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:11.800]   the ore they will start to be more responsible about where which miners they work with also a lot
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:18.120]   of smelters own mines so um it's an important step for companies to start section this is a good idea
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:24.040]   i like the tagline the 56 57 million square miles at art silicon valley yeah covering 57
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:28.360]   million square miles outside silicon valley because there's you know so many blogs and so
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:33.960]   many sites out there covering right what's going on here which granted is important and we do it too
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:39.880]   but there's a whole other world of stardom i mean just like look at london's tech scene is way
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:45.400]   under covered and we've we've uh you know got our reporters there amy tomsen is one of them who's
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:50.200]   starting to do some great reporting there so we want to just you know we really live in a bubble
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:55.080]   here in silicon valley it's yeah but this is all that matters this is all that counts hi john
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:59.960]   a lot of people love to learn about our bubble but this is this thing there's a lot more out there
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:07.160]   it says you're a boot it says right here no i think that means that my skin is like leathery
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:13.640]   like tanned like blue leather you couldn't be one of these oh yeah is that google goggles yeah yeah
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:18.840]   i never played with it not perfect that was the technology that gets all the logos it will
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:22.600]   almost certainly be built into google wow yeah that's the idea they want to map everything and so
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:26.520]   they and has yeah he doesn't have to pay any money face recognition technology but google
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:32.840]   borrowed me it's the cia it's all a plot he's not doing a lot in much with this adam korea he's
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:37.160]   really smok plot involved you talk about the no agenda show dot com yes i'm talking about no
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:42.520]   agenda show dot com all right apples quarterly results are out it was a it was one of those cases
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:48.200]   where the world was preparing for a gloom and doom um but was it gloom and doom and what is the
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:55.000]   future for apple and is tim cook being fired no one we just like ball we're getting fired it's
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.320]   it's it's somebody started a rumor a twitter rumor we'll talk about in the second you're watching
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:03.160]   this week in tech with john cdivorak channel divorak dot com and of course no agenda show
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:08.440]   dot com it really wouldn't be a show without plugging a new agenda show i agree with that
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:14.440]   we're talking about this week no agenda show i'll just media falling apart it's useless it is
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:18.840]   useless yeah so we think yes we talked a little bit about that uh the little event that took place in
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:23.640]   washington but our next day no the douche back fest that was called the uh foreign courts
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:27.960]   they're doing oh yeah they're going we're conan spoke yeah yeah a couple good lines i like the i
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:33.720]   like the uh film that uh they had with spielberg saying i've done lincoln now daniel day louis is
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:38.440]   obama that was actually pretty decent it was funny but the earlier one done by the head of the fox
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:42.760]   guy that long-winded one that was about house of cards you see that i didn't see that i was at the

[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:12.040]   one of those people that buys dvds and watches things obsessively over and over again i don't want to
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:16.040]   see a show once i've seen it and i would not have watched it but lisa hadn't seen it so we started
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:20.120]   and it's actually it's better the second time because you know what's going on and there's all

[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:31.000]   and we of course they did it right after mac break weekly some say they're waiting for the stock
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:36.120]   market to close i think they're waiting for mac break weekly band but i what we talked about mac
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:42.920]   break weekly is we do counseling because it seemed like everybody stop everybody in the world that
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:47.160]   was my phone tinkling uh everybody in the world was saying this is going to be it this is when
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:52.920]   everybody the the world's because it's over apples over um but of course you forget apple is very
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:53:03.160]   smart they they load the dice by lowering expectations so once again they beat the uh analysts predictions
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:07.640]   analysts thought that apple would have forty one billion dollars in revenue they had forty three
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:11.000]   and i think they sandbag the analysts i think they tell them stuff to make them think it's
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   going to be worse and then they come out with the bigger it's an old trick yeah well and it apple
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:19.640]   does it every time and it fools them every time earnings and ten dollars in the football it is
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:27.240]   isn't it not again at all it is again and nine and a half billion dollars of profit
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:32.600]   uh now this was the thing people were worried about first year to your drop in profit in over
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:40.440]   ten years 18% drop in profit is is this significant uh is it just a you know kind of partly uh reflection
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:46.520]   of the maturity of the market apple did sell 37.4 million iPhones 19 and a half million iPads that
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:51.720]   seems like a good number four million max during the quarter five point six million iPods iPods
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:54:00.680]   slowing way down of course iPhone sales flat from a year ago iPAD sales up from a year ago up a lot
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:06.200]   from 11.8 million to 19 and a half million and max sales flat i've as i mentioned iPOD sales
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:11.800]   a down the big issue for the stock market besides the drop in profits for the first time or
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:18.440]   dropping profit growth for the first time was the drop in margin yeah that's what hurt the stock
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:24.200]   you know they they had 47 percent margin last year at this time 37 percent this year
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:30.120]   is that something to worry about they're giving investors another 55 billion dollars
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:36.360]   or a total of 50 they up the dividend they up the dividend yeah and that makes investors
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:41.320]   happy in fact apple stock has gone up since this uh you know day over do you know offset you're
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:45.800]   doing a big buyback to that's a big deal yeah i think they did a really really clever thing by
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:50.680]   saying you know everybody was saying going into this the big issue it's going to be apples margins
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:54.840]   going down and it's going to be the fact you know the stock is going to tank because its profits
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:59.880]   are going to be down year on year for the first time and i think apple really successfully completely
[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:04.280]   changed the narrative they just said okay we know all this is going to happen we know our margins
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:09.400]   are 10 percent what can we do uh they announced the biggest stock buyback in history and gave
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:14.440]   an extra 55 billion to investors and suddenly all the financial headlines are apple does bigger
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:18.680]   stock buyback in history and gives 55 billion to investors everybody forgets like the fact
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:22.600]   they've got 10 percent of their margins and the stock goes up well also there'd be less shares
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:26.280]   outstanding so it's going to naturally go up but i think there's going to be a triple play here i
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:32.280]   think they're going to announce a huge stock split which always drives the stock up so here's the
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:37.160]   and we're not stock analysts and we're not giving you stock advice but here if you look at the graph
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:42.360]   this line here which is really a sudden drop in stock value and then a sudden spike in stock
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:46.760]   value that's when they announce the results it's gone back down but then climbed ever since and
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:51.960]   it's a pretty steady growth over the five days after the announcement it's not bad
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:56.760]   looks like that it looks like the big short is just ahead of us oh yeah
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:04.840]   now you i'm sure because you do that uh podcast uh you still do that fire d h unplugged
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:11.320]   dot com d h unplugged with david horewitz no no not david horewitz is the right wing commentator
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:18.520]   with andrew horewitz his brother uh no he's not related um but and andrew is a pretty smart guy and
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:22.520]   uh but he's a money man and you know you talk a lot about shorting and how the shorts often
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:29.320]   try to influence news to bring the price down yeah well they together get us going on here
[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:34.680]   the bulls influence news to bring the price up i mean it's just not a uncommon situation
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:39.160]   no i don't think that's what's going on i think the stock's genuinely going up yeah but apple's
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:47.400]   using every trick in the book you saw uh um henry blodget say the bull case for apple why apple stock
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:51.640]   is not as doomed as some think he's obviously at least in the short term he was right and then
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:57.240]   the forbs peter colin rang and forb saying apple is more doomed than you think
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:57:02.120]   it's always going to be both sides of this argument in the press and people read both of
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:07.160]   them and they try to make a decision the interesting thing is that both sides were in forbs they had
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:12.520]   articles going back and forth calling the other was logic and forbs no no there there's a good
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:17.480]   first one by uh forbs wants this to go on right because the more you need to know the more you're
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:23.720]   going to read uh forbs um so but but i thought colin's points were very interesting so he
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:28.760]   lists the reasons why says that that's an apple hater where he wouldn't have it all
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:36.200]   mac up there with a screen like that oh yeah just the fact that he he has this 1984 macintosh yeah
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:43.240]   as the image right i would tell you something yes it's it's biased but but all right well then
[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:49.400]   destroy these points the stock overpriced its peter e is nine what's wrong with that compared
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:55.080]   to that's an amazon or yeah nine is a good peter e yeah in fact it means it's not the peter e
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:58:00.360]   generally reflects the annual growth which is nine percent that's low apple could do better than
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:04.360]   that it says if you believe that a stock is cheap when it's peter e is less than it's earning growth
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:09.880]   and apple is very expensive because earnings are shrinking at a very fast rate i don't understand
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:14.440]   that stuff that's disingenuous apple is nothing new in the yeah microsoft look at that
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:19.320]   six apple is nothing new in the pipeline right 16 times right right we don't know that that's
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:25.560]   yeah nobody knows that well what could they have this new that would so there's a lot of apple tv
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:29.080]   well i think there's a lot of talk right now that we watch on five go ahead will
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:33.560]   well i was going to say you know everyone keeps saying you know apple's in this quiet period or
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:37.800]   apple hasn't got any new products but if you look at you know the last two big products has had
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:44.680]   it did the iPhone in january 2007 the the iPad in april 2010 like that's three in a little bit years
[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:51.640]   so we're not actually due another big apple project for like another two or three to six months
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:55.480]   right so i don't get this whole you know apple apple can't come up with another
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:59.880]   kalab product well they do one about every three years are they do see one this year
[00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:07.080]   so i keep seeing a huge amount of conversation about the iPhone 5 having fingerprint read a 5s
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:11.720]   or whatever they call it the next iPhone having fingerprint reading and a bunch of information
[00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:18.280]   seeming to tie the fingerprint reading to apples passport wallet and some saying apple's going to
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:24.360]   make a big play for identity this year that suddenly if you don't have an iPhone you can't validate
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:28.440]   your identity you're out of luck and sorry you use an android can't buy anything here
[00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:34.040]   that's what american express and master card did back and forth for a while really well you know
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:37.480]   you can't you can't go to the olympics you can't buy anything at the olympics and then you have to
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:44.760]   have an american express they only take visa right that would make sense i mean they bought
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:50.680]   authentic last year fingerprint fingerprint technology company i think they were the biggest
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:56.680]   in that space so that would be a logical move for them i could see it being actually
[00:59:56.680 --> 01:00:01.160]   pretty cool in terms of security you know there's a lot of talk now about uh two-step
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:06.600]   authentication i think you know having fingerprint technology tied to that somehow you know you have
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:11.480]   an app for facebook that ties into fingerprinting so you have a secure login could be really
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:15.720]   interesting you know before you know somebody else brought this up with me and i had to point
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:22.040]   out i'm going to point it out again we had this uh this sort of authentication fad i believe about
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:27.000]   ten years ago to the point where i have a laptop at home i don't use it much but it's got the little
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.760]   fingerprint thing on the laptop yeah ladovo was doing that yeah well toshiba was it we use these
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:38.040]   that bloomberg wow whoa can i show people this or is this top secret i go for it so um it's called
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:43.000]   the b unit you have to carry this is is how you get into places yeah so you get into the terminal
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.120]   you know fingerprint instead of uh oh in the terminal not merely into the offer terminal
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:52.840]   into so the terminal software that i'm running right here to get a last need to post articles right
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:57.640]   get email so is this this is a fingerprint scanner yeah you're thumbprint is that how you do your
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:03.480]   thumbprint so so if i turned off your thumb and carried around in my pocket try putting
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:08.040]   your phone on so it's saying okay you want to write an article for bloomberg business week
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:12.680]   put your finger bring right here bad verify and go ahead and put yours there
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:22.200]   id valed id valed unbelievable the technology is amazing no wait a minute i have tried a lot of
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:26.280]   kind of consumer grade finger purr readers and they're not that good this is pretty quick and
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:29.640]   and and is apparently accurate well these have been have you had a trouble with this
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:37.560]   uh sometimes like if i've just come out of the shower or wash my hands my thumbs are you know
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:41.400]   it i guess the water kind of rubs off so yeah exactly i'm gonna wipe it like this so they say you
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:48.040]   can you can kind of like breathe on your on your thumb right and i remember some authentic here some
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:52.840]   fingerprint authenticators people were faking them out with playdough and other uh you know fake
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:58.680]   fingers sounds like a mission impossible even watching too many movies oh i swear to god i read
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:03.960]   that somewhere um mike elgin said the eye and i phone will stand for identity this is a breakthrough
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:08.520]   feature he was writing in the cult of mac and i like mike a lot do you think that this is
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:14.280]   you know it's an interesting point if you put fingerprint in and you put nfc in
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:20.680]   so and then you use my apples uh wallet uh technology and put your credit cards in there
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:27.560]   suddenly that makes the iphone a pretty useful tool and it beats in many ways unless android
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:32.040]   phones start putting chips in the advantage apple here is as is that the android top
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:37.080]   of my phone just came out is it died there's no power to it i think so i'm sorry well you don't
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:40.360]   need that that's just a computer don't you have your smartphone with you
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:46.200]   yet your google glass i was on the chat room i was communicating with the public at large
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:53.560]   berg do we have power for uh yeah um this is the first i'd heard about this but you're because of
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:03:01.480]   authentic i think uh the purchase it makes it makes sense um elgin says it would be the beginning
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:05.880]   of a multi-device identity method that would allow you to access any of your i cloud content
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:13.560]   settings and any enabled device just like that bloomberg terminal key you have to have that to
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:17.720]   access the bloomberg terminal and to get in there and to get your email and all that imagine that
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:23.000]   same thing but it's on an iphone i think that's actually pretty compelling yeah i mean i tell you
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.600]   break the iphone yeah what if you lose your phone i'm not sure i agree with that is it that compelling
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:33.480]   i mean apple doesn't really want you accessing all your apple stuff that lives in iklad or ever
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:38.280]   from wherever you want they want you accessing it from your like your iphone in your ipad that
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:42.680]   you always have with you so i'm not sure that they would really want to encourage you to
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:47.000]   be able to go and get all the stuff from everywhere they want it just in the devices that they're
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.320]   selling that they're making the money on right well this answers the question does apple have
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:55.400]   anything new in the pipeline they may well i don't think they have apple glasses they might have an
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:59.640]   iphone apple watch yeah we reported that they're working on that yeah you're pretty sure that
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:04.680]   oh yeah i mean i've had this pebble it just died by the way so it went about a week died no it
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:08.520]   went about a week with one charge i was seeing how long ago you have to charge it yeah but that's
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:13.960]   not a big deal if it goes a week you just put it on here huh you have to wind your watch right i
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:21.160]   have self-winding oh state of the art um and and this did a lot of the things that a smart watch
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:27.960]   might do it it buzzes you when you get a text or an email uh google talk uh i can control music
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:33.160]   playback with this but it's not hideously useful i mean it's not like wow that's so great because
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:37.240]   i know what the hit is hideously useful there's a phrase i've never heard
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:43.880]   what does that mean hideously useful well it's uh superlative your fit your superlative here
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:50.360]   useful okay hideously i don't know if you've never heard that hideously make that up she's hideously
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:59.320]   beautiful that makes sense it makes no sense size asking why is will heres's youtube address
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:04.120]   ricki's your vase because he is ricki's your vase many people don't know that yeah a little
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:11.960]   uh makeup yeah would you would you use they missed the beginning huh they missed the beginning
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:18.200]   do you think yes they did of course he just tuned in people do that all of that yeah so what do you
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:23.160]   think uh will would you uh i mean this pebbles cool somebody said in the chatroom is going to be in my
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:27.800]   drawer and then within a week and he's probably right he's probably right yeah so you know what
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:33.160]   i have the complete kind of opposite reaction and it was interesting um you know hearing Mark saying
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:37.960]   earlier about like like the social etiquette now being in different situations i'm on like a real
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:44.120]   crackdown to not spend my whole life looking at my phone or not spend my whole life like the second
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:48.920]   someone texts me or the second i get a little big on my phone not being like oh god what is it i
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:54.200]   have to check it right away i have i'm trying to like discipline myself to like check my email
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:06:02.120]   like once an hour right and turn off push notifications and try and like live a little bit more in the
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:07.880]   moment that's kind of my sort of um resolution at the moment and so the idea of like a watch that's
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:13.400]   just gonna like bring me all the time not like i have a really nice watch i don't want some you know
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:18.280]   pardon the language but some crappy kind of plastic time with him well look at this is in this state
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:23.640]   of the art it's got a rubber band this is always a really nice you know what this was like you can
[01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:31.160]   do this can you do this with your watch can you do that it's just like a rubber band and then
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:36.840]   and i'm dealing with like the slap band it's it's a grave kickstarter edition hey pretty sweet
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:41.960]   and it's only you know a little thicker than the normal it's ugly and i'm not gonna wear it after
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:47.720]   about a week no no it's gorgeous it's not like it's not attractive it's hideously attractive
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:54.840]   hideous attractive exactly um so will has your uh your social experiment has that improved your
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:07:05.720]   quality of life massively massively really yeah i use full of yeah no i really try and so i have
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:10.520]   like a new rule which is in if we have meetings at work like nobody can check their phone during
[01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:17.720]   a meeting um because it's like yeah or what are you gonna fire me uh them you're firing
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:22.600]   you're gonna check that the meeting kick them out of this like go if you you know buy a scrambler
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:28.440]   get out of it in the room yeah so we do that so everybody's more focused on what they're doing
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:33.960]   and i don't spend all my time like replying to emails that comes in is really inefficient
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:39.320]   because um you know in the time that you're writing an email like three other people have
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:44.360]   replied to the thread neither contributed or solved it or something else and so it's like just do it
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:49.240]   every hour you can blitz it the other thing that i did was get mailbox for the i-phone
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:54.600]   yeah i like mailbox yeah and i stopped i stopped using email on my desktop and now all the email i do
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:08:00.360]   is just mailbox on the iphone once an hour and then you don't get distracted by it when you're
[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:08.600]   actually working on a computer i um i think that we all do these kinds of things for time to
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:13.240]   time because we all feel overwhelmed by email is a good example by email yeah that just doesn't work
[01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:18.920]   but then i've got another mega pro tip for you which you might enjoy later okay which is um i think
[01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:24.280]   i'm pretty sure i saw kevin rose put this on twitter which was that people don't mind really short or
[01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:29.080]   slightly rude or one word replies if they come from your phone like if they say sent from my phone
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:33.800]   so i just tell everybody that i know just put on the bottom of your email client on your desktop
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:38.360]   sent from my iphone and then you can just send one word or bible link just make it your signature
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:45.160]   yeah it's my signature yeah and just answer everything o-m-g sent from my iphone
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:53.560]   everything or or um i do this a lot right complete and utter nonsense and then make sure it says
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:59.880]   dictated from my iphone it's an old news and joke theory it works great that would work yeah they
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:06.920]   just assume you said something in theory yeah blame sherry yeah there uh i i i i car responded i think
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:10.600]   kevin was the first to do this by correspond with a number of people who have a signature
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:16.440]   that mentions a site which is not coming up from me right now two sentences um where it explains
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:23.160]   my email policy they usually say in their signature my my email policy is here and what it is is
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:29.640]   basically i will not respond with fewer than with more than here's three sentences um email takes
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:34.120]   too long to respond resulting in a tenuous inbox eberflog solution treat all email responses like
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:42.280]   text messages and so my personal policy is three sentences or nothing and you you send that out
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:47.000]   i think it's rude you know it reminds me of reminds me you can make it five sentences if you want
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.720]   more it what reminds me of is you send somebody an email you know you got there and they say
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:56.520]   sorry out of the office reply auto reply and then they give you all this bullcrap and when they
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:10:00.920]   just sent you a note so you send it back to them and they they're not really out of the office because
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:06.200]   they do answer so they turned on vacation and left it on or they don't want they're just being
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:10.120]   selective they're looking at everything but they're yeah you know i can deal with this later
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:15.240]   i don't like it just don't answer i think there's no adequate solution i think email is broken but
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:21.560]   we don't have any place always it's been broken for a long time yeah so uh it's challenging let's
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:26.840]   put it that way oh i'm just saying omg just put omg and everything and sent for my iphone yeah
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:32.920]   perfect yeah you're done omg i guess you misunderstood what i was talking about perhaps you didn't
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:40.600]   understand what that meant uh show today brought to you by gazelle.com if you've got a phone and maybe
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:46.040]   like will Harrison you don't want to use it anymore you can get cash for it that phone's worth cash or
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:52.120]   maybe much more likely you're all excited about the galaxy s4 the HTC one at allumia 928 that there's
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:58.200]   a new phone on the horizon or maybe a new ipad on the horizon or iphone 5 on the horizon 5s
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:03.480]   maybe now would be a good time to get a little quote on your old phone i'll tell you why you want
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:10.280]   to do this at gazelle.com because that quote's good for 30 days so you don't have to act on it right
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:14.440]   away you're just getting the best price right now because none of this stuff is gaining in
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:19.000]   vlogging in the price lock in the price look at this for a limited time get an extra 10 dollars
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:24.920]   for your iphone 4s they know people are trading up getting ready to trade up for the iphone 5s
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:32.520]   presumably uh new ipads on the way to we hear so let's say you have i know what i have my old
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:37.560]   third generation ipad it's already a generation old if a new one comes out i'm definitely gonna
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:44.200]   buy this thing let's just let's just see what this 32 gigabit byte atnt in good condition ipad is
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:54.440]   worth 250 bucks 250 smackers 250 shamoleans that's hideously amazing i want i'm going there's higher
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:12:00.360]   low no that's great are you kidding for that thing it's great dog well at least i yeah no it's old
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:07.080]   it's old and that's not if it's ever used it no why should sell it now i think that's a great idea
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:12.200]   now here's the deal i'm gonna say yes i'm selling it i'm gonna gazelle's gonna send me a box with
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:15.720]   shipping label on it i'd they pay the shipping on anything worth a bus throw it in but as long

[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:24.520]   to this broke the watch right you can't break it it's made of rubber it's here
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:29.960]   look at this all these phones actually they don't take pebble watches for the moment anyway i think
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:34.680]   if there's a brisk market in pebble watches it's very plasticky yeah well it's you know it's
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:39.640]   it's the idea that counts it's a kickstarter campaign that's it was the one the most successful

[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:27.480]   the spreadsheet let me in yeah let me in uh john cdiv our axe also here and uh we are talking about
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:34.200]   the latest google fiber verma there's a telephone company in vermont that's offering 35 dollar
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:39.960]   a month gigan internet service what good for them it's about time i want i think that's the point
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:45.560]   of google fiber though isn't it to put the screws we're hoping to these uh isleggers because we have
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:51.080]   the worst i mean not the worst but you know they're among the developed nations among the worst
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:55.960]   you're sixteenth i believe sixteenth in internet service yeah sucks it's terrible and it's it should
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:15:00.840]   all have fiber it's no big deal it's easy there's plenty of dark fiber underground
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:04.680]   yeah they just need to string it but people will pay a hundred bucks a month and say this for a long
[01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:10.200]   time i pay a hundred bucks a month it's cheap well you say they're free they are free it's the
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:14.920]   infrastructure that's not but you know you you have to amortize it you amort's gonna cost you money a
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:18.600]   little bit not much gonna cost you some how about a two hundred dollar android notebook that's what
[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:24.520]   paul ottilini at intel i think i have a two hundred dollar android notebook seven that's 200 bucks
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:29.320]   one hundred bucks one hundred and a tablet oh notebook now i don't know why intels in the business
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:33.480]   of promoting these since the ones that we use are all arm based they're not intel chips but i guess
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:39.400]   intel feels that it will be making the chips for a new generation of android notebooks i have to say
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:43.400]   i think android is a pretty good operating system i think it could be a notebook operating system
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:49.000]   with a little bit of work right what i'm doing here though with netbooks like haven't we just had a
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:54.120]   whole thing yeah two hundred dollar notebooks that were kind of crappy that nobody really like yeah
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:16:00.120]   the thousand dollar altar books are nice thousand bucks this is something i do think that we have the
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:05.960]   unfortunate thanks to netbooks conception that computers should be just a few hundred dollars
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:11.480]   yeah it's bull crap it's not true now you can't get the computer you want for it used to be
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:17.080]   twenty five hundred bucks it's not that anymore anyway what is the price what is the right price
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:24.120]   for computers is a thousand will um i think you know for a basic computer i think five hundred
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:30.920]   bucks is a is a good level um i think a thousand is kind of a you know luxury computer now like
[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:34.760]   yeah you should be really nice book yeah and then a tablet should be like a couple hundred bucks
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:40.680]   no please well they know that's how much the next is seven is yeah but it's next is seven
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:46.920]   well the iPad isn't far off that how much is the iPad in the state the mini is three ninety-nine
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:51.400]   and the the full size is five four ninety-nine five hundred bucks oh okay that's a bit more but
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:56.120]   you see you can see in like a year wait a minute how much you paying in the uk what you got hundred
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:17:03.160]   dollar ipads but no it's apparent the same but it just feels cheaper do you you hey will will
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:10.680]   do you use an iPad is that one of your weapons iPad mini yeah iPad the mini i love the mini yes
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:15.720]   the iPad mini is ultimate bar pizza because you can i love it just like hold it in one hand so you
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:21.000]   can do the taps with the other hand is perfect i'm hoping that well i put a program called talk
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:26.360]   atone on there fablet make it a fablet and it's a phone yeah it uses my google voice number when
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:32.200]   somebody calls me on google voice the ipad mini range giant phone do we have it in their studio
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:36.200]   something i love it i don't but it really is great now i know usually hold it to my ear i'll
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:40.280]   use the speaker it's got a good speaker i can use speaker phone sounds fine wait wait wait
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:44.120]   no it sounds really good it really works quite well yeah because if the speaker in that format is
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:47.400]   obviously high fidelity you know what by the way and you were playing with my phone but you
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:52.520]   probably miss this this has stereo speakers right on the front of the phone actually that the quality
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:58.360]   of the audio on the HTC one is very good i'm i'm really yeah i love it and this could you and i'm
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:05.240]   gonna i skipped with my mom on this it was great you skype with your mom yeah huh hi mommy i love you

[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:25.960]   hell yeah i'm sure it would i don't blame you i tell her oh he's a dick you don't like it
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:33.720]   because a douche bag douche bag you don't like him yeah hey stop flirting with my mom
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:42.440]   intel has confirmed that finally has well will be out they're going to announce it it's the fourth
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:49.400]   generation uh intel core processor it will the ad said it'll be out in what is that three quintillion
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:58.840]   337 quadrillion 200 trillion nanoseconds uh that calculates out to june third at compute
[01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:05.320]   text the Taiwanese uh competence uh convention june third and fourth which means that we will
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:11.320]   shortly after see haswell computers haswell does a few things it's an improved graphics
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:14.920]   performance but primarily improved battery performance they even have a super low power
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:19.960]   has well at least they changed the name to haswell from what it was was well no has been
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:28.840]   okay sorry they've massively improved the battery life so now it'll be like half as good as arm
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:34.440]   right right they need they're nowhere near arm i'm sure but uh i do think these the new windows
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:40.680]   eight tablets based on this the new uh maybe apples based on this will be better you know next
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:47.320]   uh next week anything on nugget 11th and 8 6 8 7 from now on definitely no for their desktops
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:51.320]   not not their eye over the desktops desktop oh are they going to refresh the desktops one of
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:56.040]   these days one of these days new uh i would expect given the announcement that you'd probably see
[01:19:56.040 --> 01:20:02.120]   new apple laptops in july they'll be my guess they're pretty quick off the mark with these they
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:06.360]   like to be the first in fact in many cases to use a new chip technology i'll tell you what we'll
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:09.960]   talk about it next week when ryan shrub from pc perspective and our show this week in computer
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:15.640]   hardware joins us on twit they they seem much less interested in the laptop i mean when they
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:20.600]   push out a new laptop now they just sort of update the sore apple yeah i don't even care about
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:25.560]   microtransferences it's pretty obvious isn't it they just don't guess disgusting to me well there
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:30.760]   were a computer company but that could that's so passe as we're in the post pc era don't you know
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:37.160]   yeah i've never been able to edit a video on rifone yet yeah actually it's really it's really an
[01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:41.000]   apple's interest they're right because we're moving from a world in which apple had you know
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:49.400]   what less than ten percent uh sort of market share of computers because apple is like 50
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:54.440]   percent and up of computers only because computers are no longer computers are no longer
[01:20:54.440 --> 01:21:01.560]   laptops and desktops they're mobile phones and and and things yeah so it's much better for them to
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:06.120]   be pushing in this direction i think overall it's not a good growth story for them but it
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:11.000]   it it they are actually you know doing one of the best of any of the computer makers out there and
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:17.000]   the margins on computers are better than on a lot of other devices for apple for del for
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.160]   out yeah for apple most of these other companies the margins are so non-existent they can't make
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:25.960]   money yeah except for companies that have success with ultra books hp did right okay with one of
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:31.000]   its ultra books so there's some margin in there oh yeah yeah interesting i love this is an acer
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.600]   ultra book i i love it um windows eight you know i've noticed something interesting about you
[01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:41.080]   in this thing because you've been evolving with it and you have not touched the screen once during
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:46.280]   the entire show all right that's all i'm doing a little bit much of choice but i'll tell you one
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:49.560]   thing that has evolved on this when you poke this thing and it's not just me but michael's
[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:53.880]   opt i think is going to acknowledge is mary jofoli on windows weekly and uh all about microsoft.com
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:22:00.200]   revealed her sources say that windows blew the next generation windows 8.1 will not only have a
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:06.520]   boot to desktop option eliminating the metro screen but we'll have a start button now the verge
[01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:11.080]   but they won't have the start the verge says here's a verge title windows 8.1 set to bring back
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:16.360]   the start button may i make just a minor correction there never has been a start button before
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:23.080]   the start menu is not coming back yeah that's what we want when you type when you tap that button
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:29.480]   where the start menu should be it brings you to the metro starting screen well that's dumb
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:35.240]   are they are they doing what people ask for not because what people wanted is like the windows 7
[01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:40.680]   they want a menu this is real i think people i think michael's up blew it by saying we're
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:45.640]   bringing back the start button yay but it's not a start button it's not a start menu it's merely a
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:50.040]   button just a button that brings you to the metro interface when you tap it not when you're
[01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:54.200]   the point now when you just want to get out of metro they don't know but he wants metro right
[01:22:54.760 --> 01:23:00.360]   yeah so uh it's gonna this gonna boot to desktop is good they need the start menu not the start button
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:04.360]   and i think that they're misleading people including apparently the verge is a little confused that start
[01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:08.840]   but the only place there's ever been a start button was a developer preview of windows 8 and i don't
[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:13.400]   think when microsoft says we're bringing back the start button they say you all love the developer
[01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:17.960]   preview so much that we're bringing back the start button it's not a start button you're right it's
[01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:23.160]   not a start now you have what do you have on your well so i finally gave up this is a windows 8 machine
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:29.080]   and i got so sick of the freaking start screen that i this is a five dollar utility called start
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:33.800]   8 that gives you exactly what you want which is a start menu i use classic shell classic shell
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:39.160]   does the same thing i i like this you still you still have access to this yeah you can still do
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:44.120]   all of this but i don't think people want to do all of that frankly no i think that i think they want
[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:49.480]   that so that basically have windows 7 with the advantages of windows whatever windows 8 under
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:55.800]   the hood right so how much time do you spend in the metro environment i don't i think i was using
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:24:01.320]   i'd never go to it the other program i'm using is uh it's called uh modern the modern mix it's
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:06.200]   also from starduck and then when i so for instance twitter is a metro app which is normally full
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:10.600]   screen you got to take over the whole computer when i run it here it runs it in a while yeah this is
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:15.240]   the one thing i don't think classic shell does instead of that no no classic shell does not do that
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:19.080]   and so i highly recommend for ten bucks you can make this look just like windows 7
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:26.360]   which is exactly what microsoft does not want to say right they don't want it people doing it they
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:32.520]   actually want us to to trudge your head into this stupid uh imaginary world they've created
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:38.280]   and suffer i think they hate computers but there's they hate us they're standing down a little bit
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:41.640]   though they're saying okay but to desktop well and by the way this is a rumor has not been confirmed
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:46.200]   but microsoft although mary joe has such good sources i think it's probably accurate and others have
[01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:53.240]   confirmed this paul tharat said so uh to um it is a capitulation a little at least in summer card
[01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:59.560]   right yeah i wonder you know whether they will change direction further i mean
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:05.240]   steven sennofsky was the head of windows who was largely running this initiative to to transition
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:11.720]   over to metro and to to really downplay the old interface now that he's gone though they pushed
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:18.600]   him out yeah um so you know it remains to be seen whether it that was a result of
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:23.800]   the board you know not really believing in that vision anyway well my understanding about
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:28.600]   sennofsky sennofsky being ousted is that they couldn't get the window the newest version of
[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:33.400]   office to work properly on on eight that's kind of bad as it's always my understanding
[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:40.280]   and then they they kept promising yeah i know tomorrow paul tharat told me again another host
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:44.520]   uh on windows weekly these guys are very well connected he said he had heard from the windows
[01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:51.800]   team that this was forced upon them from upstairs that they did that the windows team really wanted
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:58.600]   to keep well my understanding is that it's the woman who became your work yeah who was that uh
[01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:03.000]   the office section she's the one who did the ribbon interface which is another disaster
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.680]   and she's the one that's behind all this that was that's another understanding i have
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:10.120]   oh this is the crappiest operating system ever i can't now my all my
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:16.120]   i can't this is you saw me type and nothing happened this is just well maybe it's not a
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:21.800]   screen without another screen i was suffering within an explorer all day this thing i can't wait
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:27.400]   to get rid of it um i'm sorry and i know look i love windows seven i think i'm just gonna put
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:33.960]   windows seven on this thing i think i think you're in a right okay watch i'm trying to go back to
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:39.720]   our google drive oh it works of course as soon as you look thank you john can't you get chrome for
[01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:45.240]   i'm good at that i can run i can run uh chrome on the desktop the chrome with chrome as it's not
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:52.680]   using it doesn't look as good as nice as a clear type um anyway so is microsoft capitulating is it
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:56.120]   and is if it's true if it's coming from the top down this is the marketing department saying
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:27:00.760]   we can't get businesses to buy windows eight you got to do something you got at least give us back
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:04.680]   exact that would be exactly how it works yeah somebody's moaning and groaning they're killing
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:08.920]   us you're killing us here we can't sell this thing then that's what i can't get is that they're
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:13.720]   not doing it it's like everyone's complaining saying hey we need to make it more like windows
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:18.680]   seven we need to bring back the menu and they're like oh okay but then not doing it they're not
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:23.400]   bringing back the menu it's like they're even botching the thing they're doing to try and fix the botch
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:29.800]   they don't want to do it they have some vision of the future that we are unaware of that they're
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:35.000]   trying to lead us to are they goop like the sheep that we are are they goofy are they goofy are they
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:41.000]   wrong oh yeah yeah no here's here's where i say that the windows interface which really was invented
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:47.000]   by the zerok star i'm so not the windows interface but the desktop metaphor was invented in 1981
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.000]   yeah and then the the lease and mac and tarshan all the rest came along and then
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.280]   microsoft was reinvigorated in 1995 when they adopted it to a to an extreme and made a big hit
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:28:00.920]   out of windows 95 it's now been so established it's like having four wheels on a car on a steering
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:03.800]   wheel on the left hand side or the right hand side depending on what side of the road should
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:08.040]   drive on as opposed to a steering wheel in the middle which would be more practical in both
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:11.320]   England and the united states because you could all be driving the same kind of cars up in different
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:17.560]   lanes it doesn't make any sense that you're going to start changing these these models of use that
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:24.520]   are now so well established for like 30 years essentially uh... from 81 let's say to something
[01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:31.560]   crazy it doesn't just make zero sense to me and that's that's my argument i'm with you know i
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:35.160]   i'm kind of with you we've been saying that all along on windows 8 and i think that there is
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:39.240]   a little bit of an admission from microsoft little crack in the armor that maybe it isn't going all
[01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:43.320]   that well of course we saw the the results they didn't break down windows sales but it's pretty
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:47.480]   clear that they did not have a very good quarter some may say well it's just the end of pc
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:52.840]   season general but i think you couldn't blame a little bit but i think the problem is if they
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:57.960]   weren't doing it you know the tech press would be criticizing them for doing exactly right that
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:02.360]   it's like if they hadn't come out with with uh... modern ui metro right if they hadn't come out
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:06.280]   with service if they hadn't done all the stuff that is out of it the heart of the curve
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:11.480]   like this of this nature is touching tablet and what is microsoft you know see bollmer is the worst
[01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:16.360]   leader ever he's not getting microsoft in you know okay i'll grant you that and they go really
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:21.240]   aggressively for it and i think i mean they have gone obviously really aggressively for it
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:27.000]   um and i think uh you know if they weren't doing that we'd be criticizing them for the opposite thing
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:31.880]   so i think i don't think microsoft is you know everyone is ratting on them at the moment for
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:37.640]   this problem with you know with winded blue bringing back all this stuff with surface or with windows
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:42.520]   profits being down but i also think it's really worth noting that you know last was it last quarter
[01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:49.560]   was the worst ever quarter of pc sales for like ten years down for me and windows revenue was flat
[01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:54.120]   yeah so they basically out beat the rest of them no no no you got to read it more carefully it was
[01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:59.560]   flat only because of an accounting uh uh uh flim flam they took they took some charges it would have
[01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:07.000]   been down okay so i still think you know you're supposed to say sorry i'm wrong i'll tell you there
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:12.440]   was that there's a third way so so there's a third way will you said okay they could have not
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:16.360]   changed they could have done windows seven everybody said they're out of it they're old they don't get it
[01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:20.840]   they could have then so they did windows eight and they went all what's the third way maybe make a
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:28.680]   good version of windows and sell that you know i'm saying okay admittedly they innovated but they
[01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:34.760]   didn't innovate well what if they had innovated well people a choice right even just give people
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:40.840]   a choice to say you can boot to desktop that you could pretty much um get over all the problems
[01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:44.680]   that people are having the right kind of it would be a boot to desktop you i think you're kind of a
[01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:49.080]   little bit onto something that why don't doesn't or why don't they have the option for people to
[01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:54.280]   actually when you install it would you like this would you like that do you want this do you want
[01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:59.560]   that checklist maybe a screen yeah i want the menu i want to start menu i want this i want that
[01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:05.240]   and then it it then it installs a customized version for you i'll tell you why they didn't do that
[01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:08.840]   because they're looking at apple and they said look how well apple has done by telling the customer
[01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:13.480]   what it wants look how brilliant apple has been steve jobs never did any market research
[01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:18.440]   and we're going to do that and i think this is a really evil trend that you're seeing more and
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:23.800]   more across the tech industry where these companies decide for us how it should be they don't want to
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:28.280]   give us choice they don't you don't know what you want we'll do this for you and what they get is
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:33.160]   crap and people are reviving revolting against it they don't want it yeah the problem is that
[01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:37.800]   students in off-skis not gonna burn you i haven't got the same taste of steve jobs right well exactly
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:42.760]   i don't know if jobs could have continued to pull it off to be honest apple has become very
[01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:48.280]   authoritarian and patreon well they've always been that way even with the original act with the
[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:52.760]   way you had the code for in our way or the highway you couldn't use them a mac with the key with the
[01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:58.600]   menu commands with the keyboard at first you had to use a mouse yeah you know one button hey you
[01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:05.400]   never will need more than one button and it took apple two decades to get over that because of steve
[01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:10.600]   right he liked the idea of one and i think what happened is that the the cult of steve the original
[01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:13.960]   mac by the way only had didn't even have a keyboard just had one button right in the middle
[01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:19.080]   big button you had to hit it a lot of times that's the idea i think the cult of steve has kind of
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:24.040]   permeated through the uh the thinking in the technology and people are now say it worked for
[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:27.720]   steve we should be authoritarian we shouldn't we shouldn't listen to our customers because i
[01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:34.920]   could tell you even before windows eight came out people were gone no no people were not happy about
[01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:41.160]   it it's i mean i think it was perfectly in line with the windows curse right isn't it every other
[01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:46.920]   reality other is a flock yeah we'll see this is right i you know i don't believe that stuff it's
[01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:51.400]   it's a it's a cycle yeah but i don't believe that stuff well it's a fact that happened a couple of
[01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:56.040]   times so it's happened more than a couple of times i traced it back to uh windows okay
[01:32:56.040 --> 01:33:02.360]   nine three three point oh good or bad let's see if it works well start from 95 maybe so that's
[01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:09.320]   a no no no no no no i mean there's 95 good i actually i actually bad windows 98 se good they had the
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:14.680]   windows ami yeah windows xp good xp good vista
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:21.720]   vista bad i was good little fuzzy it's a little fuzzy little fuzzy what is that he was that
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:27.720]   well windows 98 was good no it takes all the problem if you're gonna pick this work it goes
[01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:36.520]   like this windows 95 good windows 97 which was announced and never shipped bad windows 98 good
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:41.560]   so it's easy you can do it skip esi you have to be you have to finagle it a little bit you can pull
[01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:46.440]   it off believe me i wrote a column in pc megabyte all of them listed it's just a little finagling
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:50.360]   involved i'll show they brought to you by our friends at citrix makers who go to meeting

[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:42.520]   by the i even never used that phrase hideously attractive don't you it doesn't make sense it's
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:48.200]   a non-set order yeah i think you are making it up i think it's a britishism no that's because
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:52.280]   well he knows is they do that they do that they do that the kind of the kind of the kind of
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:57.160]   seriously seriously attractive have you ever well have you ever said hideously attractive
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:05.240]   hideously attractive see is it sort of like a play on wicked awesome i think that answers the
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:11.560]   question like wicked no is not well wicked awesome wicked awesome actually makes some sense
[01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:16.200]   hideously attractive is a complete non-sequiturs no but in the world it's an oxymoron you said and
[01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:21.480]   now you're trying to defend it which i find fascinating it's an oxymoron
[01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:28.840]   sispa's dead maybe dak bowl so the house passed the senate killed it as expected the
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:35.480]   president said he wouldn't sign it but apparently our senator from california diane feinstein's
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:43.400]   resurrecting it yeah she's a winner thank you die fine all right i'm gonna make an argument
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:50.280]   that sispa's a good thing okay so the and i know this is a counter to everybody in the tech industry
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:56.120]   except for google um facebook microsoft and the rest of the most of those guys uh but do they know
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:37:03.400]   so the idea of sispa which stands for what does it stand for the computer internet safety and privacy
[01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:09.960]   act is that right something like that the idea was that uh information that google and others know
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:17.240]   about you uh could be shared in a free flowing back and forth way with federal officials to protect
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:21.400]   us against terrorism yeah it's corporatism where you corporations and governments all work in the
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:30.840]   same in the same um model tech finance and telecom firms combined to lobby the senate with six hundred
[01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:36.840]   fifty million dollars to support the bill privacy groups didn't like it a lot of money there so
[01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:40.600]   don't you think six hundred fifty million but you know that we got the best senate money could buy
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:46.200]   um and uh who said that will rogers oh they're definitely drinking well
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:52.920]   uh i think though that the idea the notion that i mean let's think about boston
[01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:59.080]   um that the notion of infirm there isn't you know the information if you could
[01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:02.920]   in analyze it right and use it properly is there to protect us okay
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:07.320]   and uh kwan how does it infringe on your privacy after all
[01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:14.200]   does it really it does if i'm trying to protect negotiations on a merger and acquisition but they
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:18.440]   don't care about that oh boy that's what i think that's the only reason they go after this data
[01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:24.840]   so that's i think that's insider trading they already have that i mean there was a great
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:29.160]   segment on the daily show you last week about how you know the the senate banking committee gets
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:34.200]   access to all the inside details of what's happening in the financial services industry and isn't
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:39.720]   prevented from trading on it right so i think it's already happening the government is already
[01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:46.440]   monitoring all this stuff and i think we've had so many um although this is you know a little bit
[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:51.240]   different there's a lot of concerns in america about the sort of you know the the privacy state and
[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:56.600]   the and the government watching everything you know private industries already doing this right
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:39:01.320]   google is already reading all your email yes so what it was what's the harm every
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:06.200]   school what's the harm if they have a little line in the python script this is and by the way if
[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:11.480]   he mentions blowing up the white house send that off to the fbi what's wrong with that what's
[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:17.400]   together right doing a comic book then then the fbl look at it's not that well maybe they will
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:21.480]   maybe they will have okay so having just said that i'm now going to go back in completely the
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:26.200]   opposite direction and say that that kind of automated scanning can be a nightmare because we
[01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:31.240]   had a case over here last year or the year before it was twitter guys the twitter they were gonna
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:38.600]   dig up the element row it was the guy who said um uh the airport in the office and let's
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:43.480]   re-open it i'm blowing this place sky high right you know and he got convicted for the
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:48.680]   music classic it was like a terrorism threat you're thinking but then i'm not sure that's a privacy
[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:54.840]   fail so much is just a sense of humor fail yeah now by the way i just humorous people i just said
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:59.240]   the phrase blow up the white house so actually yeah you'll probably be honest watch the list for
[01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:03.080]   the next six months i'm probably now on a watch list yeah especially cispa passage try traveling
[01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:09.240]   to chicago now also in testimony before congress a security expert from a company called mandyin said
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:15.160]   in 20 years of doing this kevin mandy who is the head of cyber security for mandyin said in 20 years
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:19.320]   of doing this i have never seen a package of threat intelligence that's actionable
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:26.920]   that it is even if you know all this it's not useful it's like uh it's just it and he says if
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:36.600]   you anonymize it is completely useless i don't know tough dig i i think i think the terrorists are
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:40.600]   winning and we've got to find a better way to fight them they're winning what i don't know
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:47.480]   i'm just trying to try stir up use bitcoin over the onion router to be really subversive i'm just
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:50.440]   trying to stir up some you're not doing a very good job i'm doing a terrible job
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:55.720]   we need we need somebody really good in here to argue for cispa i can't really bring myself to do
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:41:01.480]   it to be honest with him bring in uh sorgay brin he can argue for cispa and also wear those
[01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:05.160]   that glass of the google glass yeah that i mean google supports it why don't you invite him on the
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:08.840]   show i think google does it because he wants they want to get off the hook like well the government
[01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:14.840]   made us do it's a law so we're going to do this but the government already you know demands a lot of
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:20.840]   information which is no two yeah rarely yeah they follow through on some close to 90 percent of
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:25.400]   u_s but yeah they have to do a lot of us but google would rather sell the information rather
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:31.640]   than give it away fbi tried to use spyware to infiltrate a suspects computer a federal judge
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:36.600]   said you can't do that they were going to install a trojan on a computer in an unknown location to
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:41.720]   track down as fraud it's been committing fraud it's funny because about 15 years ago the fbi put a
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:48.040]   keylogger on some mobsters uh computers only get a password to find his uh is a second book and was
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:55.160]   that accepted as uh nobody said anything judge steven smith of houston said it's an extremely
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:42:01.160]   intrusive tactic because the fb isn't known the location or identity of the suspect and could not
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:06.280]   guarantee the software would not end up targeting innocence what if the target computers in a
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:10.760]   public library and in a cafe apparently they they don't even know where this computer is they just
[01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:17.160]   wanted to put it on somebody's computer that's not so good i'm glad he stopped him big success for
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:22.760]   netflix they've made a lot of money uh in the stock market the house of cards apparently
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:28.120]   success but more importantly their subscribers now crossing the 30 million threshold making them
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:34.520]   actually bigger than hbo good for them stock market rewarded them big gain streaming subscribers i
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:39.480]   agree and it's because they started creating their own content right well it's one of the things
[01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:45.320]   they also have a good cheap service that streams well and you can get a lot of stuff but it hasn't
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:48.840]   always been the wrap that you can't get the stuff you want on streaming it's so you it's all in the
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:53.960]   disc if you get you know i've been looking at all the different boxes so i've got the wd live i've
[01:42:53.960 --> 01:43:01.080]   got the box from uh uh uh apple has one roku has where i got the ro i got the new roku three nice
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:06.440]   yeah it's all hdmi though there's no other connections to that thing well what kind of tv do you have
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:10.840]   well no it's besides the old rca console in the base well i like to get clipped sometimes and
[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:16.200]   it's hard to get hdmi to go through a situation where you get the output that i'm looking for
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:21.480]   oh you're trying to capture the video for use on uh that no agenda show dot com
[01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:27.320]   uh yeah that gets in the prior any piracy prevents you from doing that yeah it's a problem yeah
[01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:31.880]   so anyway meanwhile this is crashing moment meanwhile these uh
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:37.480]   this is chrome i switched to chrome on your uh uh responding if you have enough of these boxes
[01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:40.440]   you can do quite a bit the one i like the most though for people out there want to get one of these
[01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:47.080]   boxes if you have sling boxes all over the world is the wd live because it's got a sling player in it
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:52.120]   oh and so i can bring up a the australian sling box and watch australian tv and i've
[01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:55.560]   you have rejected did you leave one there when you were in australia how do you have one there
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:44:00.840]   it's a person that has a way the passwords yes i just had in here a guy from nbc nightly news
[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:04.200]   he's a reporter for nbc nightly news he does the same thing he's got because he's watching local
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:07.880]   news all over the country right i do got slings he's lent slings to all of his friends
[01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:11.640]   but this is an underground a sling exchange is an interesting thing that
[01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:15.160]   you know the the netflix the netflix are doing incredibly well
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:20.760]   um but they are so localized um the amount of content that you can get on netflix in the
[01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:26.760]   uk is is almost non-existent like it's it's barely worth subscribing to i think with all these
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:32.200]   surfaces the the netflix is and the hulu's and all these kind of things um really very few of them
[01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:39.880]   have any sort of catalogue outside of the u.s um and what do you what do you guys watch what do you
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:45.640]   what do you guys use every everybody that i know rents on itunes because itunes is the only thing
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:51.720]   that has the latest movies and the latest tv shows available for download day and date like itunes is
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:45:00.520]   the only one i bet that's probably true all around the most of the world huh well yeah so i subscribed
[01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:05.960]   to netflix last month just to get house of cards it's like i subscribed i watched house of cards and
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:10.200]   now i unsubscribed because there's nothing else on that you know it's interesting netflix themselves
[01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:14.520]   said that only eight thousand people took advantage of that loophole where you could subscribe free for
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:20.600]   whatever a month two weeks to wash house of because they know they watched every episode of house
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:25.160]   of cards and then that was it they know it and they said eight thousand people did that and it's
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:31.240]   great i like it and i like netflix as a service oh why should you pay no and it's fantastic but
[01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:35.800]   there's just nothing on it i don't think they really care but i thought i'm sure they were relieved a
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:41.960]   little bit to see that it was a mere eight thousand people that did that yeah read Hastings the ceo of
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:46.600]   netflix uh was at all things d and my browser has crashed so i can't read you the quotes
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:54.520]   so i've now tried in an explorer desktop in an explorer metro chrome desktop read hey read
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:59.160]   read i should read it read can i read booting reboot all right what did read say you tell me
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:04.040]   he said i love read i think he's i think he's smart i know a lot of people think he made a big
[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:09.160]   mistake last summer when he separated streaming and discs i think he's a smart guy i think it this
[01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:13.880]   you know roku came from them right yeah yeah the roku guy was a netflix guy i think he i think he said
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:19.160]   all things the the biggest problem that they face as a business is uh people's windows eight
[01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:23.480]   notebooks crashing when they're trying to watch netflix read you're so right
[01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:32.680]   now the reboot's going to be quite fast because windows 8d yeah yeah and this is done yeah boom you
[01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:37.800]   you're good to go yeah so everything should be good now right well i didn't say that
[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:45.240]   i was i was trying to be politically correct you see these max mac mac mac mac so i thought
[01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:49.560]   i'm gonna be i'm gonna be good i'm gonna have a windows laptop yeah i think that was a good idea
[01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:55.560]   big mistake no okay you know what i can do though i could put linux on this ah now you're talking
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:47:03.320]   that's gonna be so much better yeah i don't do it somebody say to the day that um and because
[01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:09.080]   android is now like the most popular mobile operating system and android is based on linux so this
[01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:14.200]   is like the the the fulfilling of the prophecy that linux will become the most clear out i said
[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:21.080]   most people have no idea they're using linux they have no idea i think that's hysterical
[01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:25.400]   uh it's not just their every website 90 what is it 80 percent of all websites somewhere there's
[01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:31.560]   someone with a penguin modded into a robot as a mascot you know all right let's uh
[01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:37.480]   uh okay this is it on this lap i love this laptop but i hate it just it's not reliable
[01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:41.880]   all right so the bet on content for netflix is obviously paid off but that's
[01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:47.320]   the same creating content now we understand they're going to do firefly are they that's what the
[01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:52.440]   real world that's true wouldn't you love that it's a bad people in the in the audience who are
[01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:57.800]   jumping up and down in their brains it's going to be moved ahead though in time so so the dead
[01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:02.440]   characters from the movie can come back no not gonna yeah well that no reboot they're gonna
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:07.320]   just i want to breach your back whoa right your spoiler no the preacher's dead everyone seen the
[01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:12.760]   movie just so just we didn't said he wouldn't do it though so are you gonna do why wouldn't
[01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:18.920]   no no no i didn't hear that so what i said yeah after that's over though a bunch of avengers
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:24.760]   movies he's not gonna do it on the fly come on joss come on firefly avengers come on
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:33.000]   and he likes doing tv he's probably going to star wars after avengers right well jj is doing is jj
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:37.400]   doing the next star wars yeah i mean you do like the next next oh no there's those two guys aren't
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:44.760]   gonna do that to each other nathan philian says hmm according to this article on his twitter hmm
[01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:50.280]   hmm hmm i think nathan's just looking for work but wait a minute he has that's a that a job that
[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:55.720]   tv show he's doing castle castle yeah why can't they put them at the flyflound kickstarter
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:49:01.800]   they put veronica mars how much of veronica mars raison kickstart right ten million veronica
[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:07.000]   marz two million from zap raps we got some guys in the studio here have a new kickstarter project
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:14.440]   they want to make glowing plants oh by genetics or a genetic guy um him yes of course yeah so uh so
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:21.560]   the crazy genetic guy from israel yeah yeah i i think he has a he has a genome compiling website
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:26.920]   you know compiler website and then another guy who's here has a site where it's like a 3d printer
[01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:35.320]   but instead of printing uh you know lego pieces it prints jeans oh like levis yeah huh and then and
[01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:40.520]   then so and then there's two other guys anthony and his friend who are in here and they're gonna
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:46.440]   so what they want to do is they want to inject this gene from a glowing bacteria
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:51.720]   into a house plant yeah and then you'll have a glowing house you don't need a light light
[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:54.760]   you don't need lights anymore your plants are just gonna let you just have the whole thing
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:59.400]   cover with them natural lighting though electricity that apparently it's been done before
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:04.520]   and by the way if you bid fifty five dollars for this you get a free pot
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:13.320]   you or forty dollars you get the plant seeds to grow your own plant and unlike monsanto they're
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:17.400]   not locking it down so you can just you know you can give it to your friends so if i get one i
[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:22.840]   can give it to you okay is that cool yeah for sixty five dollars you get a recycled light bulb
[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:29.880]   vase and the plant for eighty dollars you get a vase made from a low light bulb plus glowing plant
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:38.760]   seeds i think the seeds glow the seeds grow to glow but they don't glow themselves
[01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:44.200]   oh that's surprising it's uh they're going to they're going to so the so the the history of glowing
[01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:50.440]   plants actually goes back to 1986 when researchers made the first glowing plant but it required the
[01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:59.480]   addition of lusafaren that sounds lusifrin lusifrin that sounds you mean is that the root of that
[01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:08.520]   lusifer yeah is the bringer of light and satan i don't see john this you gotta you got to do a
[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:12.840]   show on these guys you're worried about the fbi they want to make glowing plants i'm not worried
[01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:20.360]   about the fbi so then the devil live itself always a bring him back the seeds the seeds from hell
[01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:31.080]   so it's so are you going to use lusafaren lusifrin yeah that's the hide the origin of the root word
[01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:41.720]   lusafaren be elves above and they're gonna call the you're killing him here you're going to make
[01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:50.760]   the plant what are you going to name the plant the yeah lusifirizes the enzyme that does it
[01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:55.080]   all right well we have the god particle right so if we have the god particle we should have the
[01:51:55.080 --> 01:52:01.560]   seitan plant seitan you call it the satan plant those is a time so you won't know
[01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:07.000]   anyway actually i'm being silly because i think this is actually very cool and it'd be nice if
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:11.320]   you do it that we was going to be what size is the plant is a big plant small plant it's a look
[01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:16.040]   go back a chance it's that size it looks like a little it looks like a swiss charred
[01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:24.200]   how about a oh okay so here's a deal a ficus so here's a doing ficus you can do this we can all do
[01:52:24.200 --> 01:52:30.600]   this together they've raised 124 000 they've made their 65 000 goal easily they've got 39 days to go
[01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:35.240]   they say if you get all they need is 400 000 they can make a glowing rose
[01:52:35.240 --> 01:52:41.480]   i want a glowing i want some of the lights the the dining room i want a glowing ficus
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:44.760]   i want a big ficus plant in the corner that's going to do that
[01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:48.360]   we can try to transform it but they're not sure if it's all
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:54.520]   they're working on it they they google kickstarter and that glowing plants glowing rose i guess would
[01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:59.400]   be a great gift here and of course if you whoever you give it is good i imagine you put them in
[01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:03.400]   your front yard in your front yard it's like oh no people are they're they're gonna start burning
[01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:07.560]   the house down which which which yeah this is
[01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:18.040]   all right glowing plant.com and we're going to show you the video Chad can you bring this
[01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:21.080]   by oh this is the website that will get you the kickstarter project

[01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:35.880]   but really can you see Calvin Coolidge doing this no Calvin Coolidge would never do this
[01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:44.360]   the R i met him once you know Calvin Coolidge the uh can you JfK having a a tumble log with animated
[01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:49.400]   gifs how come you pronounce a gift when it should be pronounced gif okay gif okay
[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:56.600]   hmm what i know i get to work is what i'm thinking yes i agree exactly get to work there's other
[01:54:56.600 --> 01:55:01.240]   things to do with the taxpayers money uh well it's not it's free it's a free website but i just
[01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:07.480]   seem to come on where's the dignity of the office maybe they're doing it i think it's the DNC doing it
[01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:13.160]   oh there's the problem right there our money so get ready because the feds want to make a
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:18.360]   little bit of a law about distracted driving it's about time the national is it well let me tell
[01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:24.360]   you what the national highway traffic safety administration is proposing they say it's a deadly
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:30.760]   epidemic but last time i checked three thousand people die each year uh while texting it's a lot
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:37.560]   it's too many but uh okay distracted driving they say accounted for 10% of all traffic deaths in 2011
[01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:41.080]   three thousand three hundred thirty one people slight increase from 2010
[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:48.520]   um so the recommendations say glass well i have a feeling Google has to be prevented
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:53.880]   they they want to have rules that will make it so that the driver cannot take his eyes off the
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:59.800]   rotor hands off the wheel for more than 10 seconds each time and a total of 12 seconds to
[01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:04.920]   complete a task that is bizarre i don't even understand that somebody did a study it's a study
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:17.000]   turn the ac on in two seconds uh yeah but no it depends on the car yeah so it sounds like they're
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:23.080]   they want to eliminate all uh texting but that's fine right you shouldn't text while you're driving
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:28.120]   no my concern is they want to also eliminate all phone calls but i don't see that in here
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:33.800]   so really the idea is get away with that they couldn't do that yeah it'll be as long as you have
[01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:39.000]   like a hands-free thing in the car that you can access with buttons on the steering wheel they want
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:45.720]   the automakers to to prevent any text entry any internet browsing you probably shouldn't be browsing
[01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:51.800]   well no i wouldn't think so uh disable video functionality no skype no facetime no watching
[01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:58.920]   lady gaga uh prevent text-based information from being displayed including web pages social media
[01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:05.640]   content emails and text messages most of the thing that go ahead i think it's a great a um
[01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:12.040]   you guys had uh justin robert young on the show last week and he has a great psa on the uh on
[01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:19.480]   the new night attack album which is don't drink and text and drive and i think that's very good advice
[01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:26.120]   good advice from jessin robert young who's probably done all three at the same time but this is
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:32.920]   interesting no 3d or photorealistic images in your nav it's two distracts two oh pretty oh pretty ah
[01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:44.680]   um hmm that seems odd by 3d they mean like holograms no that means when they go like this yeah that's
[01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:49.400]   3d that's three you know they've taken two more studies coming up in the next two years to address
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:54.040]   mobile phones and other portable devices along with a study on voice activated controls that's
[01:57:54.040 --> 01:57:58.840]   what for c we're chasing the audience and okay let me let me let's just stop they're upset now i
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:04.040]   didn't know they're leaving like they're leaving they're all leaving yeah it's weird um should call
[01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:08.040]   them out as they leave yeah if i had their names if they were sitting in alphabetical order like i
[01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:14.040]   asked them to i know who they were i need a seating chart like your teacher had yeah or like to
[01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:20.120]   him mr millian why are you leaving why are you getting up why are you getting up insta paper sold
[01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:28.680]   a dig owner beta works i shouldn't have put a comma after dig uh that's cool grammar's hard
[01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:34.520]   grammar's hard cameras hard amazon beats profit expectations amazon now how many just how many
[01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:40.760]   employees do you think amazon has don't look at how many uh how many thousand just how many how many
[01:58:40.760 --> 01:58:46.040]   you think what it's a game it's a warehouse i think i think maybe i'm just gonna totally guess maybe
[01:58:46.040 --> 01:58:51.320]   like just not stave in 90 000 you read the article 90 000 you got it bing bing bing
[01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:56.440]   90 000 doing what well i think that's why the warehouse they get the nail on that oh i could be
[01:58:56.440 --> 01:59:02.200]   yeah we're housing first quarter profits 82 million dollars that's a decline though 37
[01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:08.760]   from the same year over year uh but did exceed wall street expectations i think you're making a
[01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:15.400]   profit 82 million is not a lot on billions in sales but it's not you know no they're their profits
[01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:19.560]   are virtually non-existent and is it because they reinvest or because it's just a tough business
[01:59:19.560 --> 01:59:26.120]   to live on the cash flow uh they're basis just isn't concerned with profit and he's
[01:59:26.120 --> 01:59:31.640]   yet gotten this ruse where wall street will continue to to bump up the price of his stock the pd
[01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:36.520]   is profit earnings based on future expectations so the idea is once amazon takes over the world
[01:59:36.520 --> 01:59:42.360]   then they'll be able to make all the profit they want right their p e is uh so apples was what nine
[01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:50.920]   nine amazon's p e is 83 84 that's the price of the stock price of earnings yeah which is a little
[01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:54.920]   high that's more than facebook that's crazy yeah i think it's a record it's up there no it's not
[01:59:54.920 --> 02:00:02.040]   netflix is is 312 312 there you go there's there's a close there's a little high
[02:00:02.040 --> 02:00:09.240]   wow it just shows you the stuff you know the stock market's making this stuff up facebook's is
[02:00:09.240 --> 02:00:17.400]   1300 what is it yeah linkedin is is close to a thousand oh man and then people get say oh apples
[02:00:17.400 --> 02:00:21.080]   and trouble and they get actually the facebook one is ludicrous because there's no way they have
[02:00:21.080 --> 02:00:26.520]   growth potential that would match that p e right well if they turn out to be the next google
[02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:34.360]   could they're not gonna be google's at 23 right now it's reasonable ladies and gentlemen you can catch
