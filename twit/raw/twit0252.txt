[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.560]   It's time for Twit.
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.120]   This week at Tech, the show that covers the latest tech
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.680]   news, joining us in studio right now from NSFW, Scam School,
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.560]   and BB Live, you still do brampers with live?
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.280]   You know, we do BB Live show from time to time.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.760]   It's very intermittent whenever I've got something that's not
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.760]   really a proper show.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.560]   Just want to connect with the audience.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.160]   I'll hop on BBLiveShow.com.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.760]   And the only Twit commentator who both breathes fire
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.800]   and sleeps on nails, Mr. Brian Grushwood,
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.400]   and shwit.com.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.560]   You had to say both of those because I
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.640]   got you eating fire the very first time I came.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.280]   Fabulous.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.640]   Fabulous.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.080]   The video's out there on YouTube.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.320]   And ladies and gentlemen, he's back
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.040]   after a complete travesty last week, which John did not
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.040]   participate in.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.920]   He has accepted my big, my pleads, my pleading and begging.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.800]   He's coming back.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.880]   John see Devorek from Channel Devorek.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.000]   What did you say that was a terrible show last week?
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.400]   Is it you so?
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.000]   I was kidding.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   I was just kidding.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.920]   I hit today's opposite day.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.040]   This is a joke.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.400]   Hey, John.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.720]   Hey, kid.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.280]   Hey, kid.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.880]   How you doing?
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.400]   I haven't seen you in ages.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.240]   Well, here I is.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.760]   Not for last week.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.920]   I'm going to come up today, but I
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.520]   felt it was going to be boiling up there.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.880]   It is.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.840]   It's '93 something.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.640]   '93 something.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.040]   I was shocked because I guess I was driving through the fog
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.480]   at first.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.560]   It was a beautiful 73 degrees.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.080]   And then 20 miles later, it was '93 or something.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.200]   You hit the marine layer.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.200]   Yeah, we got the marine layer here.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.600]   It's only a 70 something.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.600]   It may be.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.160]   You should come up.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.280]   Don't you like warm weather?
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.800]   No, I do.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.360]   In fact, I like.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.960]   But it was 100 degrees.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.520]   It seems to be a bit much.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.240]   We had a premature early heat wave here.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.880]   So we have a lot of tech news to talk about.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.800]   And we will certainly get to that in a few hours.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.800]   First, vuvuzela.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.600]   First go.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.480]   First the vuvuzela.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.000]   We can't do this show without--
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.320]   This is our tribute to the World Cup right here.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.800]   OK, have you guys been watching the World Cup?
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.800]   Did you watch it in the game?
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.360]   I only watched the US versus England.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.400]   And that was really neat because all of the internet
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.200]   took a break to pretend to care about soccer.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.280]   It was adorable.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.720]   Yeah, it was fantastic.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.240]   You spending all that time watching that fantastic game
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.000]   one to one.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.280]   Oh, I couldn't bear the excitement.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.520]   This is really the problem soccer has in the US.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.720]   Is it just--
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.720]   it's incomprehensible to Americans.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.840]   It's a stall.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.880]   Although with youth soccer, I would think that Americans at least
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.640]   know the rules now, but it's still dull.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.640]   It is no less dull.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.240]   Why is it that the world finds soccer so exciting?
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.840]   I used to think that's why.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.840]   I used to think the exact same thing with hockey
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.720]   because hockey also has low scoring games
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.400]   until I went and saw a hockey game live.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.360]   And I was like, well, this is like--
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.320]   Oh, yeah, no hockey live is astonishing.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.720]   Maybe we just should see more of live soccer.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.600]   I think the promise is the field is massive.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.600]   So everything's spread out.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.160]   I've seen live soccer.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.640]   I saw Olympic--
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.440]   when the Olympics were in LA, I saw the live soccer game.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.360]   I've seen the live soccer game in the big stadium
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.560]   in Rio de Janeiro, 350,000 capacity.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.360]   Any blue bazillas?
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.600]   Wow.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.600]   It's a--
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.280]   That's a big stadium.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.920]   The only thing interesting about Brazilian soccer in Brazil
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.680]   is that the game is kind of interesting about the last five
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.840]   minutes when they actually start to play.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.520]   Right.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.120]   And you don't see this so much-- at least I haven't seen
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.880]   this so much in the World Cup.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.920]   I like the faking where the guy just touches you and he goes--
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.280]   [SCREAMING]
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.760]   And he falls on the ground and rides.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.160]   They're trying to draw a red card on them or something.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.560]   Yeah, but they have it hasn't--
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.360]   I guess in the World Cup you don't really do that.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.360]   It's kind of not--
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.960]   I would imagine if you're ever going to pull it out.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.560]   The British do it.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.920]   That's what the British are known for.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.600]   They're famous for the flopping.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.480]   It's their acting.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.520]   It's the Shakespearean instinct.
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.320]   Deep inside them.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.760]   Alas, poor Yoric.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.800]   [SCREAMING]
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.080]   So the thing that stands out for Americans--
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.400]   and I guess it's controversial-- is this buzzing
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.320]   that you hear the entire time.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.280]   Oh, it just-- it's like I want to start confessing state secrets.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.040]   I'm so unable to handle this nonstop.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.520]   It's called, they say, a vu-vuzela.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.040]   Sometimes--
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.560]   I didn't call that.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.360]   I know.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.860]   It's--
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.320]   It's also called what's the other name of it?
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.160]   Lepitata.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.640]   Yeah.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.480]   It either sounds like a body part or a disease.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.600]   You're-- you're pick.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.040]   Vu-vuzela does sound like a little bit like--
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.440]   A body part.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.280]   --a lady's parts.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.800]   Yes.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.300]   Hey.
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.800]   That's it.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.400]   You vu-vuzela is hanging out.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.880]   It just sounds that way.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:38.400]   I don't know.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.120]   Maybe it's me.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.620]   It is.
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.120]   It's like--
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.120]   --the lepata sounds like--
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.160]   --the lepata sounds like a condition
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.240]   that you might get if you take something
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.360]   and you get the lepata.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.360]   May cause--
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.040]   AI had some wild days of my youth,
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.480]   now I got a little bit of the lepata.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.440]   Sausage fingers or a lepata?
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.120]   So to make a segue.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.200]   That's the sound.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.440]   That's a single the sound of--
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.720]   I think that's a ship out here.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.480]   --that's one vu-vuzela.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.360]   Now, there is-- the good news is for you folks who
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.000]   have an iPhone.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.960]   There is a vu-vuzela.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.200]   Many, actually, the vu-vuzela.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.560]   iPhone.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.200]   What's there really?
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.040]   A number of--
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.480]   More than one.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.560]   And this is virtual vu-vuzela.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.600]   There is a free version.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.000]   I got the pro version.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.560]   You got the pro version.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.560]   Because you don't mess around when it comes to your vu-vuzela.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.520]   With the pro version, you could pick your country.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.360]   So I'm going to pick Cameroon, because I'm always
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.520]   been a fan of Cameroon.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.840]   And then when you play the vu-vuzela,
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.600]   see the horn has the Cameroon colors.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.720]   See, you would think they would have
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.840]   like different tones for different countries.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.560]   No, no.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   This is my bogus.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.760]   You know what this is?
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.760]   This is like bogus.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.240]   What do you mean, bogus?
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.880]   What do they do?
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.560]   They get the Cameroonians to show up in some stadium
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.200]   and then record.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.240]   This is nonsense.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.080]   No, it's not Cameroonian vu-vuzela.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.640]   And I think it's just the same vu-vuzela.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.120]   They just have the national--
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.920]   By the way, for anyone still listening to broadcast,
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.000]   you've passed the test.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.520]   And now you get tech news.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.040]   All right.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.160]   And here it is, ladies and gentlemen, the tech news.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.960]   So Steve Jobs takes the stage on Monday, which now--
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.520]   I don't know why, but for some reason,
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.200]   seems forever ago.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.800]   Yeah, you're not kidding.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.120]   Does it seem like it was this week
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.080]   that they announced the new iPhone?
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.400]   I think part of it, you could blame Tom Merritt,
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.280]   because it was as though--
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.000]   because I too didn't, that's where I got the coverage--
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.760]   was live here in--
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.840]   We covered it live here, yep.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.360]   Right.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.480]   And it's like I really felt like I was there.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.680]   And I guess it was only one day after last Sunday.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.880]   But you've had a while for it to kind of process and sink.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.880]   And you don't seem that jazzed about the iPhone 4.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.720]   Now, you're just completely bought into the Nexus 1, right?
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.240]   No, you know, well, I have to say,
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.360]   I'll probably get an iPhone 4.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.440]   I don't know if I'll choose it.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.400]   But the Nexus 1 has started to become a little unresponsive
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.040]   to my fingering.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.280]   And that worries me a little bit.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.880]   I think it's for those zellas on the board.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.720]   Well, I made the prediction.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.720]   I made the prediction on Sunday night
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.160]   that whatever it is you were hoping for on the iPhone 4,
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.280]   expect just a little bit less.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.400]   And during the announcement, all my friends
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.080]   were sending me tweets.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.480]   They were razzing me like, what else do you want, lasers?
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.480]   What do you think?
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:02.760]   It's like--
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.160]   It's everything you want and less.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.800]   And that's what I expected.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.920]   And I'd like to think that I nailed this one,
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.880]   because it did have everything that we expected
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.840]   from the Gawker preview.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.120]   Well, we kind of knew, because they had the hardware.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.360]   But I was genuinely surprised that there wasn't a 64 gigabyte
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.280]   option available.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.800]   Because at 32 gigabytes, I'm always running out of room
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.760]   on my current phone.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.560]   And I don't know that I want to spend $300 just to continue
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.440]   to have that problem.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.600]   I'd love to make that go away.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.240]   In fact, you can almost say that the story of the iPhone
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:28.960]   is what it didn't have.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.040]   You're absolutely right.
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.000]   And that's always the easy way to go with any of the--
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.500]   All right.
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.520]   Let's talk about what it did have.
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.560]   It has a new screen.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:36.920]   They call it the retina display,
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:42.880]   although the folks from the head of science
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.240]   at DisplayMate and others, physicists have pointed out
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.640]   that, in fact, it is not a retinal display.
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.760]   I think that depends also on how far apart--
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.880]   how far from your eyes you're holding it.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.680]   No, precisely.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.680]   Precisely.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.960]   So Raymond Sonara-- so here's the claim.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.520]   Apple's claim.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.160]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.400]   Can you explain what a retinal display is supposed to be?
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.960]   And why this isn't one.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.760]   Apple's claim is that the resolution, the dots per inch,
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.000]   or pixels per inch of the new iPhone, which is admittedly
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.280]   very high, 326 pixels per inch, is so high that it's, quote,
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.960]   "higher resolution than the human eye."
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.320]   Is able to perceive.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.800]   So, well, yeah.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.080]   If it's higher resolution than the eye,
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.840]   can see, then you wouldn't see dots.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.920]   Now, I am posting a link in the chat room.
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.360]   For anybody in the chat room, that
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.560]   is a very good photo that Robert Scobel took of a unit
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.720]   in his hand that really does show how good this is--
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.560]   It's amazing.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.040]   --is looking.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.800]   It is very, very good.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.960]   It looks like paper.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.520]   It looks like you're holding--
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.760]   however, Raymond Sonara, who is a display mate--
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.720]   and these guys have done this for years.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.520]   You know him, John.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.080]   They really are the kind of the kings of display technology.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.240]   He's a president.
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.520]   He says-- and by the way, he's also a PhD in physics.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.440]   He says that the truth is-- and of course, just as you say,
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.560]   Brian, it's how far you are away.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.640]   The angular measurement of the retina
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:13.280]   is 6 arc minutes per pixel.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:13.720]   See, there you go.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:22.080]   So if you wanted to hold an iPhone 4G 20 inches away,
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.800]   it would have to have 716 pixels per inch.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.680]   In other words, the 326 pixels per inch
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.880]   is only good if you've got it at arm's length.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.000]   Or you have less than 20, 20 vision.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:37.720]   Well, yeah.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.080]   If you have less than perfect 20--
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.840]   But as you say, the people who've seen it--
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.400]   I haven't seen it.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.400]   The people who've seen it say it's very crisp, very clear.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.680]   My concern is it just means that type can be smaller.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.360]   I mean, look how small the type is in Robert Scobel.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.240]   Yeah, that is a good point, Leo.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:53.680]   So I mean, who--
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.760]   It's annoying some of these type--
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.960]   to 2.3 point font.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.240]   I guess I could zoom in and then it'd be more legible.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.480]   But I'm not--
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.160]   Now, this is also from where I'm sitting,
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.240]   I experienced both this launch and the iPad launch
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.720]   remotely, watching the way other people reacted to it.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.480]   And this is very, very similar to it in many regards.
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.800]   One, with the iPad, everyone who was there and touched it--
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.800]   Love loved it.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.720]   Everyone who wasn't there didn't understand it.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.800]   And it looks like this is very much the same.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.800]   Everybody who has seen the display in person says, look,
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.640]   Apple's prone to exaggerate on a lot of things.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.520]   They're not doing that on the--
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.880]   Well, that's why I'm reserving judgment.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.960]   Because I think, yeah, you know, and we'll see it all soon.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.560]   In two weeks, we're going to see it the 25th.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.240]   But can I also say that the mere fact that we're even
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.960]   having this conversation is evidence to me
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.400]   that Steve Jobs is the PT Barnum of our generation.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.400]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.520]   The mere fact that he's able to frame it in this over-the-top
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.200]   language, which is like--
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.800]   I would love-- like, how different is this display from what
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.080]   you got on the Evo?
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.160]   Is it significantly better?
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.400]   Yes, it's much higher resolution.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.480]   Oh, it is much higher resolution.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.360]   So, you know, look, this is laser printer resolution.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.400]   That's pretty good.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.240]   I mean, you're looking at the quality of a piece of paper.
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.720]   I don't see it.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.880]   That laser printer.
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:04.920]   I can't see these dots.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.480]   And this is 300 dots per inch.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.080]   So--
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.840]   I can-- look, we'll have to see it.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.720]   OK, so the display--
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.280]   It has that-- it has another thing
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.880]   that I think is completely stupid, which is FaceTime.
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.760]   And again, PT Barnum Jobs, or PT Jobs, as we call him--
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.720]   PTJ, for sure.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.200]   Doesn't that sound like HR puff and stuff?
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.240]   Sounds like a cartoon PT Jobs and stuff.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.000]   Anyway, he acted as if Skype never existed.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.200]   Like, you've never seen a video phone call.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.600]   This is that moment that I said, whatever you're hoping for,
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.400]   expect less.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.840]   I was absolutely hoping that it would be Skype out of the box
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.520]   that we could-- that we could--
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.240]   my family could be on the home computer.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.680]   You have to be on Wi-Fi?
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.000]   You have to be on Wi-Fi.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.600]   But having said that, this is the feature
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.600]   that I have looked for in every single release.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.160]   So you would use it?
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.080]   At the very first iPhone.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.480]   Absolutely 100%.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:51.800]   Really?
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.120]   And I liked-- you know, it's like,
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.720]   I've got a six-year-old and a two-year-old at home.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.280]   This is-- and the only part that--
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.640]   and of course, the ads show this touching moment of baby
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.120]   taking first steps and the deaf couple talking
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.640]   through sign language and all these things.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.640]   But the one part that had me screaming
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.200]   was it shows the guy in a hotel, say, looking at his kids,
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.640]   and I'm like, lies!
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.920]   No hotel has Wi-Fi that good.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.160]   All hotels have terrible--
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.480]   It's going to be much more like the actual demo on the stage
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.560]   that Steve Jobs did with the roast video.
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.960]   Oh, which we didn't even get to that part yet.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.040]   How about the meltdown?
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.160]   He was not too happy.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.960]   You know, I found a page six item in the San Francisco
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.080]   weekly afterward.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.080]   Three hobo's were killed randomly shortly after.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.760]   You-- someone must die!
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:35.680]   The keynote.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.240]   Someone must die!
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.040]   So apparently, nobody at Apple figured out
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.440]   that all the journalists present would
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.840]   be using their own Wi-Fi access points, AKA MIFI.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.040]   And it wasn't the lack of bandwidth.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.440]   It was the number of access points.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.320]   It was the interference.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.320]   It was just you couldn't get a clear signal
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.280]   for one side of the other.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.680]   They would have learned a little bit, because Google
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:55.960]   had a similar problem with Bluetooth
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.760]   when they were trying to do their Google TV demo.
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.600]   You would have thought that somebody at Apple would say,
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.360]   "Yeah, I wonder what you think would--
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.480]   should we be worried about this Wi-Fi working?"
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.640]   Well, and it's tough because how do you simulate that kind of thing?
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.200]   How do you don't know until you get there?
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.400]   It's like, in order to see what kind of interference you'd have,
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.080]   you have to have already--
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.320]   I guess they could have maybe tested during the iPad
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.680]   launch since that was clearly exactly the same scenario
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.200]   as they dealt with in this one.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.160]   Now, here's an interesting supposition.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.000]   This comes from Ars Technica, their infinite loop column.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.160]   They're so brilliant.
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:33.400]   They say that the WWDC keynote Wi-Fi woes
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:37.800]   may have been due to iPhone 4 drivers.
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.920]   Really?
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.680]   Job said from the stage, an Apple engineer later confirmed
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:47.680]   with InfoWorld that over 500 Wi-Fi networks were in the room.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.960]   And of course, no journalists, especially those live blogging,
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.440]   was going to turn off his Wi-Fi.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:51.940]   I'm sorry.
[00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.920]   There's just no way that was going to happen.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:59.880]   But there is 5,000 people at 500 networks.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.960]   However, after examining the video from the event,
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.440]   says Ars, and discussing it with two veteran Wi-Fi gurus,
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:11.200]   it seems almost certain that the Wi-Fi was only a part of the problem.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:17.320]   A flaw in the pre-release IOS was clearly another element.
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.920]   Apple's public relations concern confirmed receipt of a request
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.960]   for comment, but none was forthcoming.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.040]   So this is great.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.200]   Infinite loop, Glenn Fleischman, takes a look at the video
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.160]   in slow motion.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.720]   This is worthy of the--
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:35.440]   You can see the hopes dashing on Steve Jobs' face.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.880]   Here's the replay in slow motion.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.680]   06 seconds in, the iPhone 3GS has mostly loaded the New York
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.960]   Times, but the iPhone 4 displays just a title bar.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.120]   Whoops.
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.800]   That's not really a good demo.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.600]   A Wi-Fi icon in the iPhone's 4 status bar is visible at the top.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.040]   Yes, you can see that.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.960]   17 seconds in, Jobs brings the backup set of devices,
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.440]   and the backup iPhone is on 3G.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.840]   You can see the 3G indicated clearly.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.000]   The iPhone 4 can't acquire a 3G connection.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.600]   The audience laughs.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.240]   A wag suggests Jobs try Verizon.
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.240]   That was the moment.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.360]   That was the moment.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.000]   47 seconds in.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.760]   I'm inspired because Jim Cutler, I've voiced over guys in the studio.
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.560]   I think I'm turning into him.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.320]   47 seconds in.
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:27.440]   The demo screen fades subtly back to the original pair of devices
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.440]   in which the Wi-Fi icon is shown on iPhone 4,
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.480]   but it still has not retrieved the page.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.840]   Before the episode's over, I want
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.920]   Jim to give a dramatic reading of something.
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:37.760]   Jim is great.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.520]   I will get him a phone book.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.520]   You know, I have to say, are people that bored?
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.200]   Apparently.
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.840]   So here's the thing about FaceTime.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.840]   Yes, it's gimmicky and it sounds over the top,
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.960]   and use that rhetoric that is going to change the way you
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.200]   communicate and everything.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:57.280]   But this is what we've all wanted since the Dictracy wristwatch.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.600]   This ability to get face-to-face communication with other people.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.560]   And yes, it's very, very handicapped right now.
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.920]   And I'm super annoyed by it.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.320]   I hate that it's Wi-Fi to Wi-Fi because if I'm in a place--
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:07.960]   Well, it's useless.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:08.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:08.960]   That's useless.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:09.360]   Yes.
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.120]   I agree.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:10.560]   I agree.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.440]   Because if I have Wi-Fi, I'm going to use Skype.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.040]   Sorry.
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:13.480]   Right.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.680]   By the way, and let me put this out to the universe
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.280]   because someone out there can make a mint.
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:21.720]   Every time I go into a new hotel, the very first page I load
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.040]   is speedtest.net.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:23.640]   Really?
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.320]   And it occurs to me that all I would--
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.640]   You have a lot of data because you stay in a lot of hotels.
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.280]   Oh my gosh.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:28.800]   You're not kidding.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.320]   You know this.
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:30.600]   There's got to be other people like me.
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:34.120]   But imagine if they added a feature that you clicked one button
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.280]   and it did geolocation and it knew which hotel you're at,
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:42.160]   and it had an aggregation of all the hotels, true bandwidth,
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.160]   throughput, not whatever they're advertising.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.440]   First of all, every time you call a hotel in advance,
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.880]   you say, do you have high speed internet?
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:48.400]   They say, yes.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.400]   You're like, well, how fast is it?
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.560]   You need to create a website.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:51.920]   It's wireless.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.680]   Brian, you need to create a website where
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.200]   travel is--
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.600]   Yeah, I'm going on this one, Brian.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.560]   You know, the thing is you not only need a website for that,
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.240]   but you need a website that discusses
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.240]   what people charge in various hotels.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.520]   We need a generalized database that
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.280]   shows all the hotels in the country what they charge.
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.440]   And if you have bad rooms that should be reported,
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.960]   you know, the summer just can't get a good connection.
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.080]   I'll go so far as to say, I would pay a subscription fee
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.160]   to be part of a secret club of people
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.600]   who reported who consistently had good bandwidth.
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:19.200]   Well, they do that.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.560]   See, Finder does it for airlines.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.720]   It's not going to imagine that somebody would do this Wi-Fi.
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.000]   Well, please get on it because I'm ready to make that happen.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.560]   It's right away.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.600]   I play the vuhuzela in your honor, Mike.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.800]   But thank you.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:33.320]   The other thing that is promising about FaceTime
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.440]   is the fact that they said it would be an open API.
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:35.920]   Is that right?
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.760]   Which means all kinds of software can't be--
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.480]   So they showed the stack of software.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.760]   It's H.264.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.800]   It's not a standard like H.323 that is a standard for video
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:47.400]   conferencing.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.600]   It's H.264.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.920]   But it does support--
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.000]   somebody who is in our chat room who knew what all of this
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.480]   was about, the VoIP expert, said it does, in fact,
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.440]   support all of those stacks of software.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.760]   And Skype has said, yes, we'd like to support it.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.160]   It's unknown how much Apple has revealed about how it works.
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.840]   Well, that's so typical for these keynotes, where it's like,
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.720]   you want it, and it's coming just like tethering last year
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.240]   from AT&T, which brings up the other big bummer of this week.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.520]   I guess it happened before the actual announcement.
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.800]   No Verizon.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.480]   But no Verizon.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.480]   I predicted last week on this very show,
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.280]   I theorized that because of the AT&T change
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.800]   and it's pricing and the bandwidth tiering,
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.720]   because AT&T doubled its early termination fee, I thought.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.400]   And all of this activated June 7th,
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.200]   I thought for sure, that means AT&T
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.400]   is kind of beginning to wrap up its exclusivity.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.960]   And Verizon or somebody's going to come in.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.760]   In fact, Joshua Tobolsky from Engadu was on the show last week,
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.360]   said that why stop there?
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.120]   Why not make it on every carrier?
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.880]   But no.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.360]   How about this for an idea as a thought?
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:50.240]   You, I think you mentioned on one of the shows that
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:53.360]   Apple's got the 27th booked at someplace.
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.720]   Yeah, supposedly at Moscone.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.400]   And but the 24th is when the phone comes out, right?
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.560]   Right.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.960]   So how about this for as part of a deal
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.760]   that Apple did with AT&T and Verizon?
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.360]   They get three days.
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.200]   Oh, wow.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.160]   They bring the phone, they say nothing.
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.880]   They bring the phone, everybody gets in line again,
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.120]   and they go wrap around the block to grab this phone
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:14.960]   as soon as it comes out.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.120]   Three days later, they make the Verizon announcement.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.200]   This is some no agenda talk right here.
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.280]   I like it.
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:25.440]   I'm some heavy duty case series that we still have not given up.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.160]   The notion that AT&T is the one and only place
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.320]   you can get an iPhone is just not going to go.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.000]   So one of the things that really disappointed me
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.520]   was AT&T announced they were doing away
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.440]   with the unlimited use.
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.480]   And they said that you could be grandfathered in.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.320]   I suppose it's--
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.640]   If you bought by June 7th, you had to buy by June 7th.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.160]   Right.
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.040]   But I wonder if there's any way, like I'm somebody,
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.160]   I have the unlimited plan right now, of course.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.800]   But when I go to buy the iPhone 4,
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.480]   I'm almost certain that they say, well,
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.080]   if you want the subsidized price,
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.600]   you need to pick a new plan.
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.600]   And so--
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:54.440]   They will.
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.080]   That's the quote, generous deal that AT&T is offering
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.520]   that if you're due for an update,
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.240]   which happens after one year apparently,
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.800]   if you're due for an update on AT&T anytime in 2010,
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.200]   you can get it for the update price.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.200]   Well, I tell you, there's--
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.200]   But it extends your contract for another year.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.680]   Yeah, there's a big gap because I bought it the day it came out.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.120]   And my wife bought hers like three weeks later.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.120]   She's not eligible--
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.120]   What?
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.520]   Until February 2011.
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.680]   So it's like, is it as way--
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.880]   But then again, I've been with AT&T for 11 years now.
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.480]   So it's-- you know, I don't know if I qualified
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.640]   for some other thing on the inside.
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.800]   Well, that explains your hair.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.360]   Every week I look at my hair.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.640]   So why?
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.680]   John, you must know.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.080]   You must at least have a theory.
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.600]   Why-- clearly, it's not an Apple's best interest to stay at AT&T
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.120]   at this point.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.160]   Why are they still exclusive to AT&T?
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.560]   Well, it's obvious that there is a good under the table
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:44.520]   deal for Apple.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.040]   They're making tons of money on a kickback or something.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.840]   I mean, that's the only thing I can think of.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:54.760]   At this point, it must be 100% of every penny AT&T
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.680]   makes us go on Apple.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.040]   I mean, everybody hates AT&T.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.720]   Apple, if they sold, they could double the sales
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.920]   by going to Verizon.
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:03.920]   Well, that would be--
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.800]   a cool thing to do when their stock starts to fail.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.040]   Maybe they'll do it then.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:08.880]   Let me say two things.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.520]   But I still push into 27th thing.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.680]   You think that maybe that's--
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.760]   AT&T, first of all, and it is a little bit skewed
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.640]   because genuinely the service is terrible in San Francisco.
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.880]   And for the life of me, I don't know why AT&T just
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.480]   doesn't throw a few $100,000 at the problem
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.000]   so you can make a dent on it.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.440]   Because of rights of weight.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.120]   Especially in this town like San Francisco.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:28.520]   Right.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.280]   Well, I tell you, I stay down by the airport and no lie.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.720]   I get 1.3 megabits down.
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.720]   The service is very good.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.920]   PC Magazine.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.160]   Last week, PC Magazine published a study in which
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:41.160]   is that AT&T had the fastest network almost everywhere
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.360]   except for the Pacific Northeast.
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.720]   And that's the point where I believe it or not.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.880]   Who would you guess, Tim?
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.280]   Jim is the best because Jim Cutler and Don
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:51.080]   live in the Pacific Northeast.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.480]   It's T-Mobile.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.120]   Who would have thought?
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:57.760]   I would have thought Verizon because that used to be 9x.
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.440]   Jim says T-Mobile may be getting it next,
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.360]   and that's exactly right.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.040]   Steve Wu.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:03.540]   I'm sorry.
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.760]   Shah Wu.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.560]   An analyst with Kaufman Brothers is saying the iPhone
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:12.520]   could come to T-Mobile as early as this fall.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.800]   He says the iPhone will be available on multiple carriers
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.160]   in the US by next year.
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.520]   And the first carrier to get the iPhone after AT&T exclusivity
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:24.080]   ends is likely to be T-Mobile, which is not
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.000]   going to make anybody happy.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.320]   Well, remember also that whatever network, any other network,
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.760]   whether it's Verizon, whether it's anyone,
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.200]   if they had the iPhone exclusivity, they couldn't handle it.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.200]   There are so many iPhone users.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.880]   Well, that's why you put on every freaking network.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.560]   Right, exactly.
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.320]   But that's just it.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.480]   If you spread it around, maybe you'd be all right.
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.720]   But two things disappointed me about the change,
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.680]   about the AT&T Unlimited Plan.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.640]   The first was the reaction everyone had,
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.120]   where they checked their data usage and said, oh, well,
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.720]   I didn't cross two gigabytes, so I'm sure it's fine.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.840]   And it's like, that's right now thinking.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.520]   And now you have this product that's
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.800]   going to shoot high definition video.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.800]   You're going to deal with much larger files.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.280]   You're going to have a lot more opportunity
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.920]   with all different programs.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.200]   Two gigabytes is not going to be a lot in another year.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.920]   I'm going to tell you in a second why you're absolutely right.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.360]   But before we do that--
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:15.000]   Life is so easy in a square space.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.400]   We're going to play the poo-poo-sella.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.560]   I'm going to play the poo-poo-sella.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.120]   Actually, I want to talk about Squarespace.com.
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.720]   Squarespace, of course, is that great place
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.480]   for you to make a great website.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:30.040]   If you go to squarespace.com/twit right now,
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:34.000]   you could set up your Squarespace site for free for two weeks.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.400]   You don't even need a credit card.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.760]   Just go to squarespace.com/twit.
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:39.800]   Now, why would you do that?
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:43.320]   It's the secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:46.080]   Hosting, yes, starting at $8 a month,
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:49.720]   but it also includes incredible Squarespace software
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:53.600]   that makes it so easy to design a unique and beautiful site
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.680]   and gives you features like built-in social integration
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:01.920]   with Facebook, Twitter, Quick Pandora, all of them, Flickr.
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.920]   You've got the great iPhone app, which is simply
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.640]   the best blogging app out there.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.160]   You can import and export your blog from moveable type,
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.760]   WordPress type pad, or blogger, incredible stats, photo
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:19.160]   galleries, intuitive editing, and very, very elegant customization.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.440]   You don't even need to know CSS.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.840]   Of course, if you know CSS, there's the sky's the limit.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.320]   You could put any arbitrary CSS or JavaScript in there.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:29.160]   But even if you don't, you can drag and drop their design
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:30.720]   and really make it gorgeous.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:34.280]   Go to the Squarespace site and look at the examples for an ID.
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.120]   What are you looking at me?
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:36.760]   Well, no, I'm looking at you because you
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.680]   know the CEO of Squarespace, Dane, right?
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.320]   Dane Atkinson, he came to me with this brilliant idea.
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.920]   We were never able to figure out a way to make it quite easy,
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.920]   but it's so easy to take your existing HTML from your current
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:48.800]   website and put it in the other.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.320]   He had the, we'll say, theoretical idea that on a lark,
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:56.120]   it might be funny to copy somebody else's HTML.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:00.360]   Like for example, a famous celebrity blogger or, you know,
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:01.040]   some kind of--
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:01.880]   That'd be funny.
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:02.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.320]   And make your own store.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.320]   And make your own store.
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.400]   Yeah, so you think you're going to Perez Hilton.com,
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.760]   and all of a sudden there's a story about you walking
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.560]   into the Apple store.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.200]   And because Squarespace is so easy,
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.120]   you open an account instantly.
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.000]   You don't even need a credit card.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.520]   You're online within seconds.
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.960]   Copy and paste, and you freak your friends out with it.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.200]   And then once you see how easy it is,
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.280]   then you will use the code TWIT.
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:27.600]   squarespace.com/twit, $8 a month, but do take a look.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.480]   And do the freebie, because you'll
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.880]   be very impressed by what you can do.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:36.400]   Everything from $8 for the basic account, $50 a month
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:40.000]   gives you a community account with lots of bandwidth,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.560]   lots of different editors.
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.720]   This is one of the nice things you can do with Squarespace
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.160]   multiple editors.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.960]   All sorts of interesting features.
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.520]   The virtual private storage surveys
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.160]   rather make it incredible.
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.880]   You'd never have to worry about getting
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:27:00.040]   slashed out at our dug squarespace.com/twit.
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:03.400]   We thank them so much for their support of this weekend tag.
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:09.600]   I didn't hear that at first.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.760]   I didn't know what it was saying.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:11.960]   I was like, what is that jingle?
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:15.120]   It's so easy in a square space.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:15.520]   I love it.
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.280]   Did they give that to you, or did you bring that to them?
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.080]   We made that up.
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:18.720]   That's awesome.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.600]   In fact, they haven't even said we could do it.
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.480]   In fact, I'm pretty sure after hearing this episode,
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.480]   I'm never going to watch that again.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.520]   Please stop playing that jingle.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.040]   So here's the interesting deal.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.360]   Hulu-- we've heard these rumors for a while,
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:34.880]   but Hulu is about to start doing an iPad and an Xbox version.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.000]   Now, you'll pay.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.680]   Oh, dude, I would so pay for Xbox.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:38.440]   How much would you pay?
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.120]   Well, I don't know.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.000]   I almost bought-- there's a service called PlayOn that sits
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.880]   on your desktop, and that allows you to use your desktop
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:45.960]   to access Hulu remotely.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.760]   And I used the trial, and I loved it.
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:50.200]   And I remember thinking I would almost buy this,
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.640]   but the fact that it was tied to my desktop
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.280]   seemed complicated enough that I was worried like, oh, well,
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.320]   if my desktop's off, I got to go turn it on or whatever.
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.000]   So if it's direct-- I mean, I think I'm going to go--
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.160]   I'm going to name that price, Leo.
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.400]   $20 a year.
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.240]   Oh, a year?
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:04.680]   Yeah.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.160]   I think they're thinking $10 a month.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.760]   OK, that's not going to happen.
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:09.720]   No, OK, here's the deal.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.440]   Here's the deal.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.640]   By the way, Hulu is very profitable.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.520]   It's actually a website that's already free to access.
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.840]   $100 million in advertising revenue last year at Whole New
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:17.040]   Duck.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:17.640]   Congratulations.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.000]   So it's doing OK.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.320]   According to this story, which ran in Reuters,
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.520]   they'll continue to offer newer episodes of shows like Glee,
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:30.120]   or I guess won't be new episodes of Lost Ever again.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:33.680]   Or what's the one always sunny in Philadelphia?
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:34.160]   Love that show.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.000]   Hulu is the reason that I got into that show.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:36.320]   That's right.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.840]   I would not have known about that show if it weren't
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:38.040]   for the whole one.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.480]   But your friend comes over and he's obsessed.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.720]   He's like, oh, you got to watch it.
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.680]   You got to watch eight episodes, right?
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.320]   So the new shows will be free, which makes sense,
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.560]   because that's how you get people watching the show, right?
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:48.360]   But they'll charge viewers a monthly fantasy, older episodes,
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.760]   and other content.
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.560]   I don't even know if I hate that.
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.600]   That's kind of OK, because at that point,
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.880]   if you're going into the archives and you just
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.560]   want to go back and experience the back catalog,
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.640]   I'd pay a premium for that.
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.560]   But mainly, Hulu is a weird case,
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.920]   because for all of us in new media,
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:08.960]   we kind of hate them because they represent old media content.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.080]   But we also want them to be crazy successful,
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.960]   because that means that there's healthy room for growth
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.560]   in the online space.
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:17.280]   Xbox.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.200]   And maybe they'll announce this at E3.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.280]   This might be one of the announcements.
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.760]   Microsoft's got some big announcements coming.
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.600]   And they claim, doesn't matter if I don't want to jump ahead.
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.120]   But Microsoft said they have a bigger announcement than--
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:26.760]   And a tall?
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:27.240]   Yeah.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.720]   Maybe that's it.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.480]   Which, by the way, you're getting up at what time
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.760]   to go see the tall tomorrow?
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:33.440]   We're doing it.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.480]   We're going to do-- Brian and I are going down to LA right
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.560]   after the show today, because we're
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.480]   going to cover E3 for a couple of days.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.960]   So day one, Monday, tomorrow is a Microsoft day.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.720]   That's the Microsoft Press Conference.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:47.040]   We'll broadcast that live at 10 AM.
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.880]   Tom Merritt and Sarah Lane will be here in studio,
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.960]   commentating as we did with the Worldwide Developers
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.160]   Conference on last Monday.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.760]   And I guess during that time, we're using their feed.
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:55.880]   So we won't be on camera.
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:56.720]   It'll be the regular feed.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.680]   But it'll be exactly what we did with the Google thing,
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.360]   which was--
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.640]   It'll be like Mystery Science 3,000 to 3,000.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:05.160]   They'll be commenting as Microsoft talks about it.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.640]   And then you and I are going to be down there.
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.400]   But we have to get up very early.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:08.960]   Yes.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:11.800]   Becky Worley, who works for Good Morning America,
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:15.040]   got an exclusive with Microsoft to be the first to show
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.160]   Natale on GMA.
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:17.640]   Wow.
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.800]   And to reveal the name and pricing and all the information
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.800]   that we're waiting to hear about Natale.
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:26.320]   She's going to do that at 4.30 AM.
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.440]   Oh my god.
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.000]   Well, see, that's because she's in California.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.160]   It's 7.30 East Coast time, and there's a morning show.
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.000]   Now I guess that's right.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.120]   But she very kindly interceded on our behalf,
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.920]   because basically we were standing there with something
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.800]   in our hands that we didn't want to hold.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:40.360]   Yeah.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:41.640]   And just had nothing.
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:45.480]   And she said, can Leo and Brian come and--
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.040]   Now I am.
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.000]   I'm not going to be--
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   I will be up that early, but I won't be there with you.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.640]   Because the only flight I could get that allowed--
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.080]   You son.
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.440]   Allow me to do it this after I get time.
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.960]   Here's my vuvuzela.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.000]   I'm going to be on a plane, and then I hit the card.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:30:59.600]   Don't be surprised.
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:00.920]   I'm going to get the right choice.
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:05.080]   If at some point, about 3 AM tomorrow and night--
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.000]   And I'm like, hello?
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:06.320]   Hello?
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.280]   Who is this?
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:07.720]   Who is this?
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.560]   State your name, sir.
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:11.240]   You hear something coming through the phone.
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:11.960]   I can't believe it.
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.840]   You're not going to be there at that early?
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:15.800]   It's-- there we go.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.200]   I have a call for a Brian Brush one.
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.920]   Don't be surprised if--
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:24.840]   I'll be watching you.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.280]   I'll be listening to you on my Twitter app.
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:26.760]   So it's me?
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:27.800]   Yeah, it's for that.
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:28.560]   But then I get there.
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.440]   I arrive at 7 o'clock, and then I do.
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.720]   All right, fine.
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:35.480]   So I will be all alone with the Project Natal.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.280]   We will have it right after ABC does.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:38.760]   We'll have that five.
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.720]   We're going to stream it.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.360]   5 30 AM Pacific, but that's 8 30 Eastern.
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.440]   Yeah, that's not bad.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.440]   That's not bad.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.880]   That's an afternoon UTC.
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.320]   So you'll be--
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.040]   Boy, that's when you're really stretching.
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:53.000]   You're like, we're the one at the World Cup.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.560]   It'll be in the afternoon sometime.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:55.360]   Right.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:55.720]   Yeah.
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:59.440]   So in the UK, you'll be able to watch this at 12 30--
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.520]   That's right.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.480]   So we will do that.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.920]   And then we'll come back.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.080]   We'll cover the press conference.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:05.880]   We'll have that video.
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.160]   We'll have whatever else they announce.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:07.520]   You're right.
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:08.160]   They may have some bigger--
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.080]   I didn't know-- I made it clear that we may or may not
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.160]   make it on time.
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:16.920]   But the folks from MTV games, I promise them I wouldn't say
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:17.360]   what game.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:20.040]   But if you read anything about video games in the news,
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.320]   you probably have an idea what video game we have the chance
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.920]   to get hands on with on a stage with colored lights.
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:25.280]   You're kidding.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.160]   When's that?
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.120]   We'll be rocking out, you might say.
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.120]   [CHEERING]
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.880]   12 30 on Tuesdays when I put his name on.
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:32.440]   OK.
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:33.280]   Awesome.
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:36.000]   So the next day, we're going to stream life from the show
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:36.280]   floor.
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.160]   That will be part of it.
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:37.680]   Awesome.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:39.200]   Starting noon, noon to 2.30.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.400]   And that's thanks by the way.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.240]   And this I would have never thought.
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.120]   I would ever be saying that's thanks to G4.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.040]   No kidding.
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:50.520]   Well, when we-- I know Jim Cutler's going, what?
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:51.020]   Yeah.
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:52.840]   All of a sudden, Jim Cutler totally hulks out.
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:53.840]   He turns green and starts--
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.200]   G4.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.360]   Well, I know we all got fired.
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.320]   But that was a long time ago.
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.040]   And it was different--
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:01.560]   Smash.
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:04.160]   No, G4.
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:08.520]   No, I buzzed and tweeted that we couldn't cover it,
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.720]   because this is weird.
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.400]   And maybe John, you've heard of this,
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.400]   but I've never heard of it.
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.600]   This trade show and these press conferences
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.920]   all have done exclusives with other media outlets.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.560]   So for instance, we can't be at the Microsoft event
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:25.640]   because Spike or MTV has an exclusive.
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:30.120]   And we thought we couldn't stream from the E-floor show
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:33.760]   floor because G4 has a streaming live exclusive.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.520]   So we can't cover this.
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.160]   But they reached out to you on this, right?
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:37.840]   So I buzzed.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.080]   I said, I'm devastated.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.360]   We wanted a GUI three coverage,
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:43.720]   but we've been told we can't go in because of G4's exclusive.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:46.080]   And they called us and we'll get you in.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.760]   So thanks to the G4 and the auspices of G4,
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:49.880]   we're going to be broadcasting live.
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.720]   Hopefully it's a case where G4 realizes
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.720]   that there are different jobs for different media.
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.040]   You're not competing.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.240]   Well, exactly.
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.760]   It's like the type of people who want the coverage that's
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.480]   up to the minute walking around.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.080]   They're following characters on the show floor
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:06.240]   are not necessarily the same type of people who are tuning in
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.080]   after three o'clock.
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.640]   So I look like Olivia Mundy.
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:09.960]   Yeah, a little bit.
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.400]   Where the wig?
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:12.000]   Speedo.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.280]   You know, this whole deal sounds like a crock
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.280]   of crap as far as I'm concerned.
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:19.920]   Generally speaking, if you're going to have a press conference,
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.000]   you don't start throwing the exclusives out to people.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:22.920]   Right.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.280]   Press conference.
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.120]   I couldn't figure out John.
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:26.080]   I thought maybe--
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.800]   It's got to be part of either the--
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.120]   the only thing I can think of--
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.000]   but this is a-- I'm just dreaming this up.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.720]   I have no idea what's going on.
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:33.220]   Right.
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:36.440]   But it's possible that they got a better deal at the show.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.200]   They give them a discount if the show had--
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.560]   there may be some underhanded dealings
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.720]   where there's some money changing hands to allow this.
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:46.400]   Because insofar as publicity is concerned,
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.480]   there's no advantage to giving anybody an exclusive.
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:50.560]   Why would Microsoft--
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:53.280]   It's a full disadvantage A and B, journalists
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:57.720]   traditionally get very annoyed by this because they get burned
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.840]   by this and they will blackball you.
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:00.680]   Right.
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:01.040]   And--
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.320]   I almost walked away to be honest.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.520]   They said, well, all right, you don't want coverage.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:07.360]   I guess you're happy with G4 and Spike.
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.760]   But if you don't want coverage, I'm not going to give you coverage.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.840]   Because this-- I mean, it's called a press conference.
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.920]   It's not called a Spike conference.
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:13.800]   And it's press only.
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.160]   I mean, it's a media only--
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:17.640]   Yeah, so you can go in, but you just can't stream it.
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.480]   So anyway, we got to resolve.
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.840]   We're going to be there.
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.320]   And thank you, G4.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.880]   What we'll do is we'll go to 230.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.320]   Their coverage begins at 230.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.920]   Or actually, maybe it's going to be 2.
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.480]   And they're going to be covering it live.
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:30.440]   So it's actually kind of fun.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.400]   Probably see Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb.
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.440]   And it'll be kind of fun.
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.360]   Is this anything besides Microsoft pulling this down?
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.160]   You said Microsoft was--
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.360]   No, all of them.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.000]   Yeah, say it's the--
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.880]   Everybody's doing a deal.
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:41.600]   This is how they do it.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:42.480]   Apparently, how they do it.
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.960]   I think, yeah, Microsoft ESA, which runs E3,
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.520]   had an exclusive with G4.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:48.960]   I think it's-- I don't know.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.560]   It may be the same with Sony and Nintendo.
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:55.000]   But my thought was it's so hard to get coverage.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.040]   Like, nobody wants to cover it.
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:59.200]   So they just-- the exclusive was, please cover us.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.200]   Yeah.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.200]   We'll give you an exclusive.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.200]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.200]   That's what I thought.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.200]   That doesn't make sense to me.
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.200]   Like, who's going to-- well, anyway.
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.200]   Well, I'll tell you this much.
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:08.560]   Like, for the last two years, ever since they restructured E3
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.480]   and they made it less of a public spectacle,
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:13.480]   I have set up my computer, watched all of the live streaming
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.240]   things, read all of the live blogs,
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:17.000]   and enjoyed the news as it came in.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.320]   And this is very exciting for me to actually be there in person.
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.680]   I'm stoked.
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.920]   And now, tell us about Natale.
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.320]   What are-- you say there's going to be some big announcements.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.640]   Well, Microsoft claims they have an announcement bigger
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.640]   than Natale.
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:30.640]   And--
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:31.640]   What is the-- and Natale may not be so big.
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:32.640]   Let's be honest.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:33.640]   Well, it's the thing, right?
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:36.560]   Natale is where you go like, you wave around and play the game
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:39.600]   and you're going like this, which, by the way, if I'm not mistaken,
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:44.280]   I had on my PS2 with the I-cam like 10 years ago, right?
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.080]   That's the thing is they-- it's like they watched--
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.360]   they watched the success of the Nintendo Wii
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.480]   and they're like, wait a minute.
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:51.720]   People don't like regular controls.
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.880]   They're like, "Hurky, jerky in the body all around."
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:54.400]   I don't know.
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.080]   No controls.
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:55.600]   No controls.
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:56.520]   You just pass out.
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:57.360]   You're just screaming.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:57.920]   Whatever you want.
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.920]   Ballers go flying everywhere and you get points.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.080]   They have money in the bank.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:01.880]   You know, it's interesting.
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.360]   Sony is going to announce basically a Wii
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.480]   mode for the PlayStation 3.
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.280]   Yeah, and Sony, what's interesting
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:09.320]   is to see the way everybody jockeys for position.
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.160]   Yeah, right.
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:12.680]   And the way Sony's thing is they're like, hey, man,
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.240]   you can't be precise with no--
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:15.640]   you really want to hold nothing.
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:16.520]   At least hold something.
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:18.600]   It'll be super precise and you'll look awesome.
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.400]   I like game controllers.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:20.960]   I need great.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.240]   I mean, that's the way I am, too.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.360]   I don't understand this.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.760]   Now, the parts that I really do like about Natale
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:26.640]   what I've heard about before.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.640]   And of course, all of this will probably be out of date
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.680]   by the time most people listen to the podcast.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:33.000]   But I love the facial recognition,
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.880]   the idea that you walk into the room and it says, hello, Brian.
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.800]   What game would you like to play?
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:38.600]   That's the voice I imagine.
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:39.400]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.280]   So it'll know it's you.
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.760]   Right, and more importantly, it recognizes your kids.
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.880]   If your kids are in the room, it'll say, yeah,
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.120]   this is a rated M title.
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:46.720]   No.
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:47.320]   We don't want John to watch it.
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.800]   It's going to be Nanny X-Box.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.400]   Well, and I tell you, it's one of those things
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.480]   that we all hate until we have--
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.080]   I don't think you want to play that, Brian.
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:54.320]   Until we have seven-year-olds.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.800]   They were like, well, I'm sure I'm glad I can turn this off.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.240]   You don't want to play modern Warcraft 2.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:02.760]   You want to do some more racing.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.360]   You want to play space hearts.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.360]   Yes.
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:09.360]   How about a nice game of Lego Star Wars?
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:09.920]   Come on, Brian.
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:13.600]   Our kids are having the argument from 2001,
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:16.720]   like open the rock band 3, Hal.
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:17.720]   I'm sorry, Dave.
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.880]   I'm predicting this thing's going to be a bust.
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:20.440]   Well, we'll see.
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:21.760]   We may-- we're going to be down there,
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.000]   and we'll see what happens.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:23.800]   I think--
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.600]   Don't talk about the overall, the market for the--
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:26.000]   I agree.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.240]   I think it's-- I don't get Natal.
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:30.120]   I'm highly skeptical of Natal as I've seen it demonstrated
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:33.400]   before, but Natal has that iPad, iPhone effect.
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:36.440]   Everybody who's seen it live came away drooling,
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.400]   like there's something magical about it.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.000]   So I don't know.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.360]   But you saw that dorky video Veronica's joke around.
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.080]   I mean, it does not look good.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:45.480]   I mean, and if something that Veronica does
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.720]   does not look good, that's not good.
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:49.280]   It's pretty much no matter what she does.
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:49.920]   That looks good.
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:50.720]   She makes everything look good.
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.720]   She makes everything look good.
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:53.720]   And make everything sound like it.
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:54.720]   She can't save the time that I can.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.080]   No one can.
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:59.480]   So as people turn to the internet to catch movies, TV shows,
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:06.280]   and other content, E-marketer says that by 2014,
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:10.840]   77% of all internet users will watch videos online.
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.680]   I can't believe it's still-- that it's--
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:13.840]   that it would be that low.
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.320]   It seems like it should be higher now.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:18.240]   I mean, I guess the way it's phrased is at all.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:20.800]   Like, they will watch any video online.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:21.800]   I can't believe this.
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:25.440]   Currently, it's only 66.7%.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:26.200]   For years--
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:26.720]   This is both.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.480]   And only 11% growth?
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:31.760]   No, it's going to be 100% of video will be online in the year
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:32.440]   2014.
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:33.040]   You heard Leo.
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:33.840]   It'll be 100%--
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:34.040]   100%--
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:34.480]   100%--
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:35.000]   --minutes.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:35.640]   Yeah.
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.760]   In the year 25, 25, if man--
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.040]   If indeed, man, still alive.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:40.960]   --still alive.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:45.040]   If woman can survive, they'll be watching their video
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:47.520]   on the internet.
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:52.400]   Video growth overall is slowing, it says, or will slow.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.400]   Now, that--
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:53.800]   I don't know.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:57.520]   It seems like that would be a symptom of maturing.
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.520]   Would it not?
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.920]   Yeah, but I guess 77% means almost everybody, right?
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.400]   I mean, virtually everything that comes out on television now
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:07.160]   is instantly available in some kind of online format.
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:11.000]   Whether it be Hulu, whether it be, I guess, on demand,
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.680]   YouTube.
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:15.640]   Violent video games are harmless.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:16.960]   John, you've said this for years.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:21.040]   Now, according to the review of General Psychology,
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:27.080]   Texas A&M researchers examined 118 teens
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:29.040]   and found that violent video games actually
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.360]   are quite safe for most youths to play.
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:35.680]   The only youths who shouldn't play violent video games
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.520]   are those who tend to be--
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:38.320]   Violence.
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:39.920]   Violence.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.400]   Psychopaths.
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:45.360]   Highly neurotic, less agreeable, and less conscientious.
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:47.120]   If that makes sense.
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:51.400]   If you're not sick already, it's not going to make you sick.
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:54.160]   In fact, this is kind of interesting.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.680]   As video games have become more popular,
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:59.680]   children in the US and Europe are having fewer behavioral problems,
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.720]   are less violent.
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.200]   Now, this might be false causality.
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.440]   I mean, we don't know why.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.480]   And score better on standardized tests.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.360]   Violent video games, at least we know this,
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:12.800]   have not created a generation of crazed, whacked out youth
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.600]   trying to kill zombies with a--
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:15.280]   This is a very--
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.640]   Very predictable formula that happens year after year.
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:21.640]   Every decade, there's a new form of entertainment
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.640]   that puzzles the older generation.
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.720]   In my generation, it was Dungeons and Dragons.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.640]   Dungeons and Dragons are going to make you crazy.
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.200]   You're going to wear cast spells.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.280]   By the way, Brian, that did make people crazy.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.000]   It made adults crazy.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:34.960]   You're kidding me insane.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:35.920]   You're kids.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:38.520]   It made adults lonely is what it made.
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:41.080]   The sitting in their parents basement is at all.
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:43.200]   And what happens is, is the generation gets older
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.120]   and they realize that the world isn't going to end.
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:47.720]   And then they're like, oh, well, well, wait for the next thing.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:48.760]   Next, it'll be Twitter.
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:52.600]   We should, and Don Reisinger is reporting this on CNET
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:53.720]   in his column, The Digital Home.
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:58.640]   He does say, well, that's one study, a recent study from Iowa,
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.440]   which was actually a survey of 130 different studies
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:04.960]   on violent video games, says, in fact, youths or youths
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:07.600]   are negatively affected by violent video games.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:11.200]   Quote, "We can now say with utmost confidence
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.920]   that regardless of research method that
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:16.360]   is experimental, correlational, or longitudinal,
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:18.720]   and regardless of the culture's tested in the study east
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:20.680]   versus west, you get the same effect.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:22.720]   Exposure to violent video games increases
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:24.480]   the likelihood of aggressive behavior
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.000]   in both short and long-term context."
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.560]   Now, I wonder how much of that is self-correcting,
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:33.200]   because the type of people who have violent tendencies
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.440]   or whatever seem like the type of people who are going
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:38.400]   to want to express them in a video game environment, which
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:41.000]   I would say is healthier than expressing them in real life.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.040]   Are you shuffling cards, John?
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:43.080]   What are you up to there, my des?
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:43.960]   I'm shuffling cards.
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:46.920]   I'm working on this deal.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.600]   But like, meanwhile, the type of people
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.160]   who don't have violent tendencies,
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:53.120]   there are video games that are too violent.
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:54.800]   Like, my daughter is six years old,
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.720]   and there's this awesome, awesome game
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:00.520]   on the Adult Swim website called Robot Unicorn Attack.
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:01.280]   Yes.
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.960]   And it's too violent for my six-year-old daughter.
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:05.760]   Robot Unicorn Attack!
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.680]   It's a robot unicorn that just jumps.
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:08.840]   That's all the game is.
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:12.360]   But when you jump wrong, it blows up.
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.080]   And that's too violent for my daughter.
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:14.840]   So it's like, I don't think--
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:17.080]   But Vuvuzela Attack.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:19.560]   Vuvuzela Attack!
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.880]   I think you guys are high.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:25.720]   Robot Unicorn Vuvuzela.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.280]   Oh, baby, that's scary.
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:28.280]   That's a long screen.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.080]   That's a scary ass game.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.640]   Now, somebody in the chat was pointing out
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:33.440]   that that Iowa study is by Craig Anderson.
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:35.440]   And I have to say, this underscores the fact
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:38.160]   that it also depends who's doing this,
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.880]   and what acts they have to grind.
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:40.400]   Correct.
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:43.720]   Because this guy thinks all media is bad.
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:44.480]   Who is the guy?
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.240]   There was a guy that recently got disbarred,
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:49.400]   because he called it simulated murder.
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:52.040]   The chat room will have the answer for us instantly.
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:54.400]   But I was listening to the PC Gamer podcast,
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.280]   and they could barely contain their joy,
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.280]   as they reported that.
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:57.720]   That is Jax Thompson.
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:02.000]   That Jack Thompson, the guy who is on this outrageous
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.320]   with no evidence to support him,
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:05.920]   Bender saying that video games were simulated murder.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:06.920]   Yeah, the bug up is that.
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:07.720]   Yeah, he was really good.
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:08.760]   Oh my goodness.
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:09.760]   All right, we're going to come back--
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:10.760]   We've got it all at once.
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:12.800]   Well, before you go off to that commercial,
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.720]   let me add something to this conversation.
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.560]   Slightly.
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:20.640]   You know, video games, or I mean most simulations
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.800]   done by the Army, or if you're going to learn to fly 747,
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.280]   for example, you go into a simulator,
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:28.120]   which is nothing more than a glamorized video game.
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:31.400]   And the Army Tank Corps uses these sorts of games
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:33.040]   to improve their skills.
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:34.760]   So you can actually--
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:36.920]   I mean, the video game may not turn you violent,
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:40.840]   but if you are-- the simulations are real.
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:42.400]   I mean, you actually do learn things.
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:45.560]   I've always said that my sons would like to play Grand Theft Auto
[00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:46.480]   when it goes to the car.
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:48.400]   But if they ever did, they'd be good at it.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:49.160]   Absolutely.
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:50.640]   And that has two sides.
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:53.000]   First of all, for example, we went and played paintball
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:53.560]   for the first time.
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.760]   I had never had paintball ever.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.560]   But the moment the game started,
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:59.080]   there were things I just inherently knew.
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:44:59.600]   You knew.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:00.480]   Because of my counter-drive.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.200]   I get the BFG 9000.
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:02.640]   Well, no.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:05.080]   But like always strafe, always come at them from the side.
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:05.840]   And more importantly--
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:06.520]   No, it's true.
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:10.040]   I was playing a laser tag a couple of weeks ago.
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:13.840]   And I camped on the spawn point.
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:15.280]   And that really works.
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.560]   Well, and I tell you, there is a time
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:18.520]   that I honestly think video games save my life.
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:20.040]   No, it doesn't work in Mogadishu.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.880]   I was in an ice skid.
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:22.520]   There--
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:24.320]   Austin doesn't get cold weather very often.
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.240]   And when it does, nobody knows how to drive on it.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.560]   And so sure enough, I started a skid.
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:29.840]   And it was totally automatic.
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:31.560]   Without thinking about it, I've been playing a lot of need
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:32.480]   for speed at the time.
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.320]   And I rolled the skid properly.
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.360]   Jim looks like, yes, you had the exact same thing.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.360]   He's in the same thing driving up here.
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:38.880]   I was going--
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:39.880]   He's not on Mike's.
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:40.400]   Pull on Mike.
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.960]   Somebody said, well, somebody in the chat room chimed in,
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:44.120]   games don't make you a killer.
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:47.200]   They make you a better killer.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.240]   The same thing happened to me.
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.760]   I was coming up here too fast.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:53.600]   And I said to my wife, I learned from the game Blur
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.520]   not to hit the brakes in the turn.
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:56.360]   Hit the brakes when you go.
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:56.880]   After the turn.
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:57.360]   That's right.
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:57.840]   That's right.
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:58.360]   That's right.
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.160]   So there you go.
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.760]   You accelerate into the turn, you break out of it.
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:04.680]   So we may be more violent, but we're safer drivers.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:09.080]   You noticed, though, that things are more violent today
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:10.720]   on the roads because of video games.
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:11.240]   Because--
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:12.440]   You think road rage is more common?
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:15.440]   No, 10 years ago, did you ever see people throwing bananas
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:16.680]   out onto the road?
[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:17.180]   It's true.
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:18.040]   Have you guys been around that?
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:20.360]   Are you giving me a scene because of Mario Kart?
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.680]   Is that just saying they're expecting it to--
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:23.520]   And turtle shells?
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:24.020]   Never.
[00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:24.960]   Would you see that?
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:27.160]   You would never see that.
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:27.960]   All right.
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.920]   We're going to celebrate some anniversaries in just a bit.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:32.840]   I should mention, give them credit, Jim Cutler is in the studio.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:36.320]   Jim was, for many years, a voice of tech TV.
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:37.880]   He did a lot of our promo stuff.
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:41.760]   He's still the voice of many, many television and radio
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:42.280]   stations.
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:43.080]   It's nice to see you.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:43.560]   Thank you.
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:44.600]   It's a pleasure to be here.
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:46.160]   I say that net cast you love.
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:50.000]   And I hear more people say, hey, I hear you're on Twitch.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.480]   He's done the beginning of every show.
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:53.320]   He's a guy with net cast you love.
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:56.160]   And then it's actually a friend who says, from people you trust,
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:57.080]   I should get Don to do that.
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.040]   Can I get you to record an intro for NSFW?
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:46:59.540]   Sure.
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:02.000]   Like, net cast you hate from people you don't trust.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.240]   Well, when people with cool hair--
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.040]   Jim recorded some really funny ones
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.840]   that we've only used a few times.
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:07.720]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:09.000]   There was one about Sarah Lane.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.840]   Net cast you love from people you trust.
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:14.600]   No, it was when Sarah had broken up with Kevin.
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:17.680]   And I said, it was an intro for when Kevin was going to be on.
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:20.640]   And I said, hey, Kevin, Sarah is my sister.
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:21.480]   Or something like that.
[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:22.480]   Kevin Rose.
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:24.400]   I have a few of those still somewhere
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:27.360]   that I haven't used them all the gag ones that Jim cut.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:28.520]   But maybe you could cut some more.
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:29.280]   Jim's the greatest.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:30.040]   Jim Cutler.
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.520]   Jimcutler.com?
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:32.020]   Yes, Andy.
[00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:32.640]   Give you a plug.
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:33.400]   Thank you.
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:34.200]   We shall return.
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:36.040]   And just as I should make Jim and I the Kamo show,
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:36.840]   because he's a professor.
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:38.080]   Is this an audible?
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:39.600]   You want to do an audible spot?
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:40.760]   I'd like to participate.
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:41.760]   Are you an audible listener?
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.400]   I got into audible because of you.
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:44.080]   Are you kidding?
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:46.440]   I back up with carbonite.
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:47.920]   All right?
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.360]   I'm into audible books.
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:50.960]   He does it all.
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:51.840]   I love audible.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:52.400]   He does it all.
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:53.600]   By the way, John has put up--
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:54.320]   I like this.
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:57.960]   One of those old Indian head test patterns.
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:58.880]   Where'd you get that, John?
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:47:59.360]   That's awesome.
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:00.840]   That looks like a physical piece of paper
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:01.360]   he put in front of--
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:02.360]   Oh, it definitely is.
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:02.720]   Yeah.
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:05.640]   It is look at moves.
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:07.640]   Yeah, that is a copy of "Sendy Team."
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:08.600]   Logan, how are you doing that?
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:10.680]   You know, I have one with my head in it.
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:11.720]   In an Indian.
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:13.520]   Somebody sent me one.
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:14.040]   Yeah.
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:14.480]   That's awesome.
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:16.640]   So let's mention audible audible.com.
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:18.440]   Long time sponsor of the show.
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:19.520]   They do great stuff.
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:21.320]   It's a-- you should do an audiobook.
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.040]   Have you ever thought about doing an audiobook?
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:24.880]   I have-- I would love to do an audiobook.
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:25.880]   I don't know if there's much money in it.
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:26.520]   I did one.
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:27.640]   It's a lot-- yeah, I did a short one.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:28.400]   It's a lot of work.
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:32.080]   I got into audio-- oh, I did do an audiobook.
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.360]   You did, in Boston?
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:35.320]   I got into audible because of you.
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:38.880]   And I should do the spot like Jason Calicatos does.
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:39.360]   I should say--
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:40.440]   A lot of all of that.
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:40.440]   I know.
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:44.720]   You should say me and Robert Redford were hanging out
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:47.680]   with Madonna listening to an audiobook.
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:48.360]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:48.360]   I'm a kid.
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:49.360]   I'm a kid.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:49.860]   I'm a kid.
[00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:51.040]   It's kind of Jason right there.
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:55.760]   But I got into audiobooks with John's suggestion.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:58.880]   John said, get an economic hit, man.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:48:59.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:48:59.940]   What?
[00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:00.680]   Confessions of an economic hit.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:01.600]   Great book.
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:03.840]   From there, I went on to another tweet suggestion,
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.480]   which was the book about the divers.
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:06.840]   Oh, Shadow Divers.
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:08.200]   Awesome.
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:10.640]   If you're thinking about an Audible account,
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:13.360]   just start with those two.
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:14.680]   It will blow you away.
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:15.200]   I agree.
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.480]   We are great books.
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.760]   Audible is terrific because-- actually,
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:20.600]   I need a better account because I go through a book
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:21.280]   very quickly.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.200]   I guess you can get two--
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:25.000]   There's a gold account, which is one book a month.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.960]   And then we have a deal for the Platinum account, which
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:28.000]   is two a month.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:28.880]   You need more than two?
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:30.160]   No, I only have one.
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.120]   Oh, you should get the Platinum.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:32.120]   So you go to Audible.
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:33.200]   This is such a setup.
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:34.200]   I can't believe you did it.
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:37.160]   This is go to Audible.com/Twit2.
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:38.920]   And by the way, because Jim's a voiceover guy,
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:44.000]   we're not showing his face just his hands and the microphone.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.040]   Go to Audible.com/Twit2.
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:50.400]   And when you sign up for the Platinum account, you get two books.
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:51.720]   Now, I say free.
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:53.600]   And I should explain what that means.
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:58.040]   It means your first two books they don't charge you for,
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:03.840]   they will charge you the next month unless you quit.
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:05.000]   And you can cancel at any time.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   And those books will always be yours to keep.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.240]   So it's free in that respect.
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:09.600]   I have done that a couple of times.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:10.680]   I've deleted a book.
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:11.840]   And then you go back to the site.
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:12.240]   Oh, it's always there.
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:13.640]   And your books are always there.
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:15.560]   Unlike iTunes, you can get your book all the time.
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:18.040]   Here's that book you recommended, Shadow Divers,
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:19.840]   to Americans who risked everything to solve one
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.320]   of the last mysteries of World War II.
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:27.760]   It's about a true story of deep sea divers who discover a U-boat.
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:31.720]   And it is really an amazing story.
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:36.320]   I'm going to search for, I did for a while ago for Audible,
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:39.920]   my top 20 books.
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.120]   And I should put this link in the show notes.
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.440]   It's Leo LePort's top 20.
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:45.400]   You could probably just Google Leo LePort's top 20
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:46.720]   in Audible.com.
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:49.840]   And that Shadow Divers is one of them that I highly--
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:51.800]   these are books that are great books,
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:53.040]   but also great performances.
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:54.880]   And that's one of the things about Audible.
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:55.400]   Oh, right there.
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.520]   Born Standing Up.
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:57.680]   I read that one last year.
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:58.720]   And he reads it.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:50:59.320]   And he reads it.
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:01.640]   So it's his voice, which is awesome.
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:06.200]   David McCullough doing John Adams, unbelievable.
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:07.000]   Life of Pi.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.640]   John Martell did an amazing job of bringing that book to life.
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:12.400]   It was a great book, beautiful, beautiful book.
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:15.400]   And John Martell does a wonderful job reading it.
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:18.880]   Neil Gaiman, there's a reason a number of his books.
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:21.040]   But actually, the recommendation I make for Neverware
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:22.440]   was not read by Neil Gaiman.
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:24.360]   But I don't think he read that one.
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:26.520]   Yeah, a lot of people think that read by the authors,
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:27.520]   not always good.
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:28.480]   I disagree.
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:30.720]   In general, I want somebody who's a professional at making
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:31.680]   books sound awesome.
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:35.440]   Unless the author is John Hodgman reading
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:38.080]   the areas of my expertise.
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:39.200]   Now, there's an author who--
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:40.160]   Believe me.
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:42.160]   This is the last thing I wanted to do.
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:45.040]   And I suspect the last thing you wanted as well.
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:47.800]   But I think we both knew it was inevitable.
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:50.280]   Certainly, my publisher felt that it was frequently
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:53.920]   pointing to my contract and its damned inevitability clause,
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:55.640]   which I should never have agreed to.
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:57.920]   John Hodgman reading the areas of my expertise.
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:59.320]   Don't get fooled by the abridged here.
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:02.400]   It's only abridged in the strictest sense of the word
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:05.360]   is actually more material in the audiobook.
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:07.880]   Audible.com/twit2--
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:09.120]   I'll be honest with you, the hard thing
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:12.200]   is going to be to choose just two books.
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:13.240]   There's so many great ones.
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:15.240]   But it's just the beginning of a lifelong relationship
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:15.760]   with them.
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:18.400]   Sorry, dude. You're going to be doing it a long time.
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:19.920]   Here's one that I really liked.
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:22.400]   I don't know if people know the C.S. Lewis, who
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:23.920]   wrote The Lion, The Witch, and the Wordrobe,
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:26.640]   was also famous Christian philosopher.
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:29.000]   And he wrote a book called The Screwtape Letters, which
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.960]   was the devil writing to a demon talking
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:33.440]   about how to hoodwink mankind.
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:36.080]   Now, whether you believe or not, it
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:39.840]   is one of the best, most funny books ever written.
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:42.840]   And then actually, I've got the wrong one on here.
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:46.600]   And the one I like is narrated by John Kleece.
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:47.400]   So John Kleece--
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:48.480]   Could that be any better?
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:50.400]   --as the devil?
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.680]   So apparently, there's a number of versions of this,
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:55.680]   because this is Ralph Cauchum reading it.
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:57.880]   Maybe they no longer have the John Kleece version.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:59.200]   Boy, that was incredible.
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:00.200]   Can I recommend one, too?
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:00.960]   Sure.
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:03.640]   There's a wonderful author named Paulo Coelho.
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:04.920]   Oh, I love this.
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:05.720]   I have it, too.
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:09.240]   The Alchemist, one of my favorite books.
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:09.680]   Absolutely.
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:12.640]   Briefly, Apple offered that book for free.
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:14.000]   Really?
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:14.800]   But you know what?
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.000]   It's going to be yours free again.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:16.640]   One more time.
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:21.080]   Just go to audible.com/twit to The Alchemist by Paul Coelho.
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:24.800]   That's an interesting story, because that book was not selling.
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:28.440]   And Coelho really wanted his publisher to give it away,
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:29.120]   and they wouldn't.
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:31.520]   So he went to Russia.
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:35.400]   And he's Brazilian and gave it away in Russia
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:39.920]   and got word of mouth going around in Russia
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:42.680]   and created a whole bunch of interest in this book.
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:46.880]   And literally propelled the book to bestseller status.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:50.720]   It's a fascinating story, and really a beautiful book,
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:52.720]   by Little Shepherd, Billy.
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:54.000]   It's about following your dreams.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:54.920]   That's what it is.
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:55.840]   And since you and I both--
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:56.640]   Dream followers.
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:58.000]   Where has that gotten us?
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:58.560]   Oh, wait.
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:00.120]   Are there any dream followers in this room?
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:00.720]   Yeah, all right.
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:02.440]   That's the other thing I love, is the type of people
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:03.400]   who show up on this program.
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:05.280]   All tend to be people who go against the grain.
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:08.320]   By the way, Jeff Jarvis called Paul Coelho the Googliest
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:12.480]   Author in what would Google do?
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:14.960]   He's the Googliest Author.
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.920]   A fan posted a Russian translation
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:18.200]   of one of his novels online.
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:23.320]   Sales of his book went from 3,000 to 1 million
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:25.240]   in three years with no additional promotion.
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:26.920]   It's that good of a book.
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:31.000]   And so he started putting his books on Pirate Bay.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.120]   Is that a great story?
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:32.840]   He's a cool guy.
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:35.720]   It just says, come on.
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:36.160]   Download it.
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:36.640]   I dare you.
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:37.240]   I dare you.
[00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:38.000]   And go.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:38.720]   But now they sell.
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:41.160]   And this is what Cory Dr. Rose always said.
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:44.120]   You don't have to hold on so tight.
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:47.280]   People will reward your work if it's good work.
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:52.280]   Audible.com/twit2, we thank them for rewarding our work.
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:54.920]   Steve Balmer has been at Microsoft for third--
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:56.080]   Oh, John.
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:58.160]   You could take down the--
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:54:58.600]   He's gone.
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:54:59.600]   He's in the end.
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:01.240]   He's gone.
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:03.040]   He's gone.
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:04.440]   Oh, somebody's saying there's a--
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:04.960]   I'm back.
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:07.400]   --hardcover of the Alchemist with art by Mobius.
[00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:08.360]   Now that would be awesome.
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:09.120]   Oh, wow.
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:10.280]   Would that not be awesome?
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:11.920]   Oh.
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:14.360]   Incredible.
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:18.320]   I wonder if I can find my test pattern.
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:19.480]   I have an Indian head test.
[00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:20.200]   I know I'm not.
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:20.960]   It's just a copycat.
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:22.440]   I'm what's on the screen right now.
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:23.560]   I had it first.
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:26.560]   Leo, when John was doing Silicon Spin,
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:28.720]   I wrote a letter to Tech TV.
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:30.040]   I guess it was ED TV at the time.
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:31.240]   Get that ass off the--
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:32.680]   No, no.
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:33.880]   And by the way, everyone's--
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:34.840]   I kept plenty of them.
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:36.920]   Every once in a while you have some hipster on here.
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:37.840]   And I forget who it is.
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:39.800]   But they keep calling him Devorak.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:41.000]   Hey, Devorak.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.160]   It's Mr. Devorak.
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:43.280]   Mr. Devorak.
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:44.880]   He's been around since Mark Twain.
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:45.360]   Thank you, John.
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:46.200]   Thank you, Joe.
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:47.200]   Thank you, Joe.
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:48.200]   And Mr. Devorak.
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:48.560]   You're here.
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:49.560]   Go me Mr..
[00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:54.160]   So I wrote a letter to ZD TV saying, hey, leave John alone.
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:56.240]   You're obviously making him do the same ad lib
[00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:57.680]   at the beginning of Silicon Spin.
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:55:59.760]   He'd say, all right, we got these coffee mugs.
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:00.520]   And he'd hold up.
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:02.320]   And soon it's going to be on eBay.
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:04.680]   And it was the same ad lib literally every day.
[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:05.480]   And I know what that is.
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:07.680]   That's a producer saying, come on, you got to be loose, John.
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:08.640]   You got to do the sad lib.
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:09.640]   Somehow, I doubt.
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:11.000]   I wrote this angry letter.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:15.200]   And then a week later, I get a call to be the voice of tech TV.
[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:16.160]   Oh, that's funny.
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:17.440]   Oh, man, I hope nobody--
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:19.200]   You can't-- who learns my finders' feet.
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:21.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:22.080]   Is that--
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:26.120]   You found Jim Cutler in a world where coffee cups
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:28.040]   is sold on eBay.
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:29.000]   Steve Bomber has been--
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.680]   I find this hard to believe in Microsoft.
[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:35.480]   30 years ago, June 11th was his anniversary.
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:38.120]   He was hired on as its first business manager.
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:40.600]   You want to guess what his salary was
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:42.560]   as the 24th employee at Microsoft?
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:44.560]   $22,000.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:45.480]   No, it was a little more than that.
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:46.800]   $50,000.
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:48.240]   $50,000.
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:49.760]   He was the title for Microsoft.
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:51.160]   Yeah, probably.
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:53.560]   He has served as the head of operating systems development
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:55.000]   operations and sales and support.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:58.280]   Of course, he's the CEO today.
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:02.120]   He's Steve Bomber, good for Microsoft, John C. D'Mourek.
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:05.400]   Well, I wrote an entire column on this for MarketWatch.
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:05.760]   What is it for us?
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:08.080]   I think two weeks ago.
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:10.160]   It's on MarketWatch.com.
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:11.760]   You might want to read it.
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:14.600]   And my thinking is that if you take a look at the--
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:16.320]   in fact, Horowitz and I talked about this too.
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:18.360]   If you take a look at the graph that's been going around,
[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:19.640]   look at this compared to Apple.
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:21.480]   You don't compare anything to Apple.
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:23.480]   Apple goes up and down and up and down.
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:25.680]   And the fact is that the company was in the toilet
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:26.760]   when Steve Jobs came around.
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:29.640]   So now they're trying to make a Balmer look like an idiot,
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:32.600]   because all of a sudden, Apple looks so good.
[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:34.040]   Microsoft has actually been flat.
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:36.880]   But if you look at anybody else's stock from the year 2000,
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:39.360]   because Microsoft ramped to 2000,
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:42.720]   essentially the stock went flat compared to Yahoo's stock,
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:45.400]   which took the big dip that everybody else took when
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:46.960]   the .com collapse occurred.
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:48.280]   It never happened to Microsoft.
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:50.560]   They stabilized at a very high level.
[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:51.640]   And they kind of stayed there.
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:54.200]   Yeah, the stock hasn't done anything since the year 2000.
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:55.880]   But it's beside the point, the company
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:56.840]   makes a lot of money.
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:59.880]   And I don't see anybody else running the company except Balmer.
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:01.560]   And I think they criticize him because he's
[00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:02.960]   pretty much of a screwball.
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:05.200]   And he's like, you know, he doesn't do anything--
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:06.720]   He's a character, that's for sure.
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:08.000]   He doesn't collect cars.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.120]   He doesn't do yacht racing.
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:11.200]   He doesn't do all the stuff that Larry Ellison does.
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:13.040]   That's kind of interesting.
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:15.440]   And so he's kind of a dull guy by comparison.
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:18.320]   But the fact of the matter is who would replace him?
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:19.120]   Nobody.
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:20.080]   Yeah.
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:21.720]   Who would want to?
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:24.520]   Well, that too.
[00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:26.360]   Maybe he'll run for governor of California.
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:27.520]   Why the hell not?
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:29.200]   Well, Washington, he could definitely
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:30.600]   do better than the person that's up there.
[00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:34.840]   But the point is, is that Balmer is always being slammed.
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:38.440]   And I think it's because he's relatively uninteresting.
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:40.080]   And he also does this crazy--
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:42.280]   did the monkey dance and all the rest of it, which is made--
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:43.880]   Developers, developers, developers.
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:44.600]   But he's a--
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:45.760]   I think he's a--
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:48.680]   Unless they come up with a genius that can do something wild,
[00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:50.920]   I think the company is fine.
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:54.480]   But the stock doesn't done anything and it never will again.
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:58.480]   Is it because it's a hard act to follow Bill Gates?
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:58:59.920]   How can you follow Bill Gates?
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:03.400]   Well, Bill Gates was working with Balmer all those years.
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:06.000]   And they've had other CEOs come and go.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.600]   And Gates is a charismatic character.
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:09.680]   And Balmer's not.
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:10.480]   That's the difference.
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:11.000]   Right.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.160]   Right.
[00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:16.600]   Well, Microsoft-- I think one of the reasons they succeeded
[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:21.080]   in this decade is because they were in the sweet spot
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:23.080]   of technology, which is selling and operating system.
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:25.000]   We spent, of course, being dominating--
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:25.500]   Dominating--
[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:27.280]   --computer, internet, OS, and--
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:27.960]   And software.
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:29.920]   But we're moving to the cloud.
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:33.400]   And I don't know if Microsoft can make that move very effectively.
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:35.800]   And I don't know if Microsoft has much of a future
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:38.080]   in a cloud-dominated world.
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:41.080]   Well, you know, I'm not buying into this cloud, is everything.
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:42.520]   I mean, a couple of collapses.
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:43.680]   People losing stuff.
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:45.520]   I mean, the problem I have with the cloud
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:48.040]   is not that it isn't a good idea for certain things,
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:50.040]   like maybe backups.
[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:52.320]   But the fact of the matter is you're on some system,
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:56.280]   let's say, Google or some other program that--
[00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:58.280]   Google, for example, wants you to make sure
[00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.880]   that you use the same exact email address for everything
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:01.360]   you do there.
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:02.480]   So you start doing that.
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:03.440]   You start getting in the cloud.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:05.960]   You're totally involved with the Google Cloud, let's say.
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.360]   And then for some reason or other,
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:10.080]   because of your account being compromised or something else,
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.880]   that maybe you're a Gmail account,
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:13.600]   you start sending out spam.
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:15.400]   Google says, oh, this guy, let's cut him off.
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:16.880]   You get cut off from the cloud.
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.800]   You cut off.
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:19.640]   And who do you call?
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.240]   What customer service exists at Google?
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:24.800]   You can have all your stuff pretty much tied up for months
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:25.320]   on end.
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:25.800]   I don't trust--
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:27.200]   I was really, really shocked.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:31.520]   My assistant, OMG Chad, wanted a particular account on YouTube.
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.000]   And that was OMG Chad.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.280]   The guy had never used it.
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:37.480]   And he is in the process of trademarking the name.
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:40.240]   So we tried to call, because the instructions on the website
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:42.160]   were very Byzantine, very difficult to figure out
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:43.360]   what we were supposed to do.
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:47.240]   I was shocked at how almost belligerently unhelpful.
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:48.360]   You could tell that there's--
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:49.760]   I've worked in a call center before.
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.560]   And you could tell when there's a culture that's
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.720]   been created, that pretty much says,
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:55.560]   yay, give them the run around until they hang up.
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:57.080]   And this was clearly the case.
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.600]   It was just like they stated over and over again,
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:00.800]   read the paper, read the paper.
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.640]   I'm like, I'm reading the exact article you're
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:03.320]   pointing to.
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:04.800]   It does not answer my question.
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.400]   And you don't get anywhere until you say,
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:07.760]   can I speak to a supervisor?
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:08.400]   And they say, why?
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:09.800]   They're going to tell you the same thing.
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:10.920]   I'm going to tell you.
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:12.640]   And it wasn't until I said, I'm sorry,
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:15.080]   are you refusing to escalate my call to a supervisor?
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:17.480]   That they actually listened and did something about it.
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:20.320]   I was shocked at how unhelpful real people were
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:22.480]   when I called Google.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:23.880]   Google's not known for support.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.960]   In fact, I don't even know the support.
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.960]   You had to do research in order to find something.
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:30.320]   You're going to go into the cloud to all these promised services.
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.680]   They better have support.
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:34.520]   They should find the old group that
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.800]   used to do word perfect support.
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:40.600]   That was notorious for being unbelievably great.
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:43.040]   I mean, word perfect was their product that I ever liked.
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:43.960]   But it was like people--
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:46.920]   But people liked it just because of support, yeah.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:50.200]   So you're not alone.
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:54.600]   The Pew Center of Research people, folks
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:56.280]   for the internet and American Life Project,
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:59.440]   said in a survey by 2020, internet users
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:03.320]   say they will keep their data mostly in the cloud.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:06.880]   However, when asked, chief scientist Craig
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:10.240]   Partridge at BBN, which who invented the internet, by the way,
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:13.240]   said, I think the big issue will be information privacy.
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:15.760]   How you really control access to your valuable data
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.440]   if it's in the cloud.
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:18.760]   We've seen this with Facebook.
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:22.720]   Once they got the data, they kind of do what they want with it.
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:25.000]   How do you retrieve your prize novel or your business
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.440]   records if the cloud fails?
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:29.560]   I'm much less worried about the cloud failing
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:32.000]   than I am worried about my account being compromised.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:32.880]   How about this one?
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:33.480]   Six weeks.
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:36.200]   I've had two people send me desperate emails
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:38.160]   that they were stuck in England
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:40.040]   and needed me to wire them some money.
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:40.600]   Uh-huh.
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.600]   Call them all the time.
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:42.000]   Yep.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   And it's like, once I happens to your cloud account,
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:44.840]   I mean, they're going to--
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:45.520]   You're screwed.
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:47.320]   Yep.
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:48.720]   How about this one?
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:50.440]   We will have a huge blowout.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:53.600]   This is Ray Wang, partner at the altimeter group.
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:56.440]   We'll have a huge blowout with terrorism in the cloud.
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.200]   And people will go back to the PC.
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:59.200]   People will lose confidence.
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.200]   Terrorists will blow up the cloud.
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.120]   Cyber attacks cripple major systems.
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:03.280]   The cloud will be there, but we'll
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:06.000]   be stuck in hybrid mode for at least the next 40 years
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.880]   as people live with some level of fear.
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:12.560]   Is there a way on Google Docs for me
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:14.560]   to back up a hard copy of everything?
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:16.960]   Like with one click, just one giant file
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:19.120]   that I could keep on a physical drive in the event
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:20.400]   that everything becomes compromised?
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.640]   You should go to the Data Liberation Front.
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:23.480]   Oh, really?
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:23.840]   Yeah.
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:28.160]   This is a Google project, dataliberation.org.
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:31.040]   Google realized that this was a real concern, I think,
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:34.120]   for people that they were storing their stuff.
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:38.560]   And so Google created this-- almost this kind of pirate
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:41.960]   side organization whose mission statement is,
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:44.000]   users should be able to control the data they store
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.040]   in any of Google's products.
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:48.640]   Our team's goal is to make it easier to move data in and out.
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:51.560]   And so they're exactly doing what you want, which
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:55.440]   is creating a way for people to get the data out.
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:56.800]   Now I use backupify.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.960]   A bunch of people in the chatroom are saying backupify.
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:03:59.460]   Yeah.
[01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:00.120]   So that'll work for that?
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:01.640]   Yeah, backupify is pretty amazing.
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:02.880]   But I think what you're going to see
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.560]   is Google themselves realizing that they're never
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.680]   going to get people adopting the cloud unless they answer
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.000]   these specific issues.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.160]   Well, and chatroom is pointing out,
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:12.480]   you can always save the files locally from the cloud.
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:14.880]   But I do not want to go through and save individual files.
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:17.360]   If you go to Google Docs, there's a button that will save
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:18.200]   everything that's--
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:18.700]   Good.
[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:19.200]   Good.
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:19.700]   Good.
[01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:20.440]   Backupify does it automatically.
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:21.160]   They'll say, that's manual.
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.720]   I think you should do it automatically.
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:25.840]   So backupify will backup your Gmail,
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:28.600]   will backup your Flickr, your-- one of the things
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:31.120]   that made it easy for me to delete my Facebook account was
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.560]   I've been using backupify.
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:33.720]   So every picture and everything-- I
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:35.680]   didn't have to worry if I had duplicates I did.
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:39.520]   But just in case, Google Docs, Google Calendar, Gmail,
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:41.360]   Facebook, Twitter all backed up.
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:42.920]   This is a great service.
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:45.800]   They were giving it away for free when I started doing it.
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:48.000]   Talking about duplicates.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:48.500]   Yeah.
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:51.160]   Is there a program out there, a good one that can just
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:54.040]   plow through your hard disk, look at check sums and dates
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:55.560]   and everything and find all--
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:58.240]   I mean, I have so many duplicates of various files
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:01.880]   and especially columns, because I'm always fearful that I'm
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:02.400]   going to--
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:03.040]   I have this--
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:05.640]   I keep a thumb drive, actually.
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:08.360]   It was all my work in it with this two gigabyte thumb
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.040]   drive to keep in the car.
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:10.560]   And--
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:11.060]   Oh, bad.
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:12.160]   There you go.
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:12.800]   That's it.
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:14.600]   Just keep your data in the car.
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:16.160]   It goes like the good thing to do,
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:17.680]   because if the house burns through the ground,
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.320]   you're going to have your backups go with it, right?
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:22.800]   That's why I keep spare clothes and water in the car.
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:25.520]   Well, I actually keep my spare clothes in water.
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:26.240]   There you go.
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:27.680]   They'll never burn.
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.480]   Boy, anyway, so the point is--
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:31.920]   There's the poor mileage program.
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:34.600]   Good program that goes through your-- plows
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.680]   through your terabyte hard drive
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:40.080]   and gives you a list of the backups
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:42.360]   or the ones you have too many copies of five copies.
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:43.840]   You don't need it.
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:45.040]   That is all there is.
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.760]   I think that's going to be a--
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:49.760]   I don't know, dduper.com.
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.040]   That's the point to just make that up.
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:52.040]   Is there a 0D duper?
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:54.680]   Oh, there's a thousand D-dupers.
[01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:55.560]   Well, I tell you what--
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:58.560]   There's even super D-dupers.
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:00.920]   There's super D-duper, pooper scoop.
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:02.280]   I'll look into it.
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:04.520]   Maybe I'll ask my Twitter followers to make those--
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.920]   Duplicate cleaner are not taking it seriously.
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:08.640]   No, I'm giving you real stuff.
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:09.680]   This is all from the chatroom.
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:12.520]   Duplicate cleaner.
[01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:13.600]   I know there's D-duper.
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.760]   I've used that.
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:17.520]   Clone remover.
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:23.120]   But the chatroom seems to agree that duplicate cleaner
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:24.320]   is their favorite.
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:26.880]   No, I tell you, there's a lot of super D-duper.
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:28.600]   I just make it fun of you.
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.120]   They're making fun of me.
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:33.600]   There's duplicate cleaner from Digital Volcano, John.
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:37.360]   I think there's a tremendous market for software
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:39.640]   that interprets all these duplicates.
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:40.960]   Like, whatever happened to it, I heard
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:43.160]   there was an initiative that Microsoft was working on
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:46.080]   a couple of years ago where it would look at all of your
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:48.920]   pictures, figure out, hey, all these were taken at around
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:52.080]   the same time, compositionally, they all look really similar.
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:53.800]   This is clearly a trip you went on,
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:56.480]   and it put it in a file and organized them together.
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:57.800]   Yeah, what ever happened to that stuff?
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:58.800]   I don't know.
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:00.440]   More work for Microsoft.
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:02.840]   I got a bunch of duplicate files,
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:04.840]   and I have no idea what came when.
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:08.480]   You know, it seems like it's interesting because we've
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:11.240]   been given the tools to pump out a lot of data,
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.240]   and it really is easy to create a ton of stuff,
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.440]   and we're just not given the tools yet to manage it.
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.160]   It's the same thing with information on the internet.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:20.240]   I mean, I think that this is the next stage of internet
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:23.520]   will be how to make sense of it.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:24.120]   Right.
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.400]   We need aggregators.
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:26.080]   We need software--
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.600]   Sure, there's aggregators, interpreters.
[01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:32.000]   Just as Google is the finder app that allows us to find
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.960]   anything on the internet, we need the metagootle
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:37.160]   that will allow us to organize and understand--
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:39.240]   Well, and I talked about this on the radio show today,
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.480]   because I think that Google's already seeing that their days
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:44.200]   are numbered as a search engine, because nowadays,
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:46.560]   this search is not what you want.
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:48.480]   Search is too blunt of an instrument.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:51.760]   You want somebody to tell you what's the hot new thing,
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:54.720]   what's the great video, what's the place to go, how would you
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:58.000]   use Google to find the best clone dedupper?
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000]   What I want is to go to Google.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:00.480]   Right.
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:03.800]   What I want is to go to Google and find an annoying, giant,
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:07.040]   high-res random picture in the background.
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.240]   If only they would do that.
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:09.240]   If only they'd--
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:10.200]   You're about 12 hours--
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:12.200]   You mean like Bing?
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:14.440]   I can't figure out if it's because they were worried Bing
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:17.320]   would sue the Microsoft tweeted, the funniest tweet.
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:18.080]   Oh, dude.
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:19.960]   Yes, that was my favorite moment of the whole thing.
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:22.480]   It was Microsoft Europe that put out the exact tweet.
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:23.600]   And I know you're calling it up right now.
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.480]   But for those who missed it, for about--
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:29.440]   I guess it was around midnight on Friday night, I logged in,
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:32.800]   and I was shocked to see what looked like a terrible crappy
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:35.360]   rip-off of Bing's nice image background.
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:40.400]   I know how that got by Marissa Meyer, who's the keeper of the UI.
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:44.160]   Turned on-- this is Google who put out a press release
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:46.960]   about how they were able to shave one word off of--
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:47.460]   Right.
[01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:49.480]   --and save millions as possible.
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:52.920]   And then they do the most obvious hack rip-off of Bing
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:57.880]   by throwing tacky, annoying, busy images in the background.
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:59.040]   This is the quote right here.
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:08:59.680]   This is the one.
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:00.600]   This is on Twitter.
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:02.280]   My MS Europe.
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:04.040]   We've lost a background image.
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:06.280]   If found, please return to Bing.com.
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:08.400]   See, this is how you should respond.
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:11.160]   Instead of that nasty sniping that Apple and Google
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:12.720]   are doing where they're--
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:13.480]   just tweet.
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:14.680]   Make a funny tweet.
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:17.840]   Well, I tell you, apparently enough people all disliked it.
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:18.720]   And apparently there was a bug.
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:19.480]   I didn't even see it.
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:20.440]   I never got to see it.
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:21.160]   Oh, dude.
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:21.720]   Yeah.
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:24.880]   And there's apparently a bug that when you try to enable
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:26.520]   just going back to the white background,
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:28.200]   it wouldn't work properly.
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:30.160]   And people were so upset.
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:33.200]   And especially for a company that has built its brand
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:34.640]   around meaning one thing--
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:37.960]   precise, fast searches with no BS.
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:38.960]   It's like you go.
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:40.760]   It's very simple, very crisp, very fast,
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:42.840]   and you get exactly what you want to do something that's
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:43.760]   so out of character.
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:47.880]   And so obviously, an attempt to borrow inspiration
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:48.720]   from the competition.
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:49.520]   Yeah, I like Bing.
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:50.840]   I like the--
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:51.760]   but this is Bing.
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:52.360]   It's already done.
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:54.000]   Does anybody think it was a joke?
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.500]   Because Google's always pulling crazy.
[01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:57.000]   It's done.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:57.720]   Not in this case.
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:59.080]   And one of the articles are done.
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:09:59.720]   Oh, you know, look, by the way,
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:01.200]   looks what's popular on Bing right now.
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:08.280]   World Cup results, Vander Sloot, Tony Awards, and Vuvuzela.
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:09.720]   We have a title for the show.
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:11.080]   By the way, I think it's Vuvuzela.
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:13.680]   I've been saying it wrong all this time.
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:16.880]   You got to remember that Bing has a person carefully
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.680]   curate what images they put on there.
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:19.520]   And they're all trained.
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:20.000]   They're all trained.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.480]   Do as the Romans do now.
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:23.080]   It's confederations cup time.
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:25.480]   And if you're in South Africa, whether you like it or not,
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:27.660]   you got to do the Vuvuzela.
[01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:28.700]   The confit cup is booed.
[01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:29.200]   Yeah, booed.
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:31.460]   There's a section of soccer lovers into the stadium.
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:33.220]   But not everyone has been entirely
[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:36.180]   happy with the icon of essay soccer culture.
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:38.860]   And please do not blow the Vuvuzela.
[01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:42.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:44.420]   That's like an internet moment right now.
[01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:46.620]   You're like, please stop retweeting that link.
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:50.020]   Please, close your mind, fight, and do not blow.
[01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:53.260]   I would think next to WWDC, next Steve Jobs keynote,
[01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:55.300]   we should all bring Vuvuzela.
[01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:57.760]   I can't imagine anything going wrong with that.
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:01.160]   Please do not blow the Vuvuzela.
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:04.240]   By the way, they didn't stop for the Vuvuzela.
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:07.440]   And neither did the live bloggers for WWDC.
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:08.600]   So crazy idea.
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:13.800]   I think there's no explanation about why Google would even
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:14.960]   consider doing this.
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:17.800]   It just doesn't make-- it's so uncharacteristic.
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:19.480]   I'd love to know what happened.
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:24.200]   They wanted to showcase the fact that you could,
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:26.360]   at a background image, if you want.
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:30.320]   But the thing is, again, Bing has a person deciding
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.840]   on a balanced image that fits the layout.
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:36.560]   How could it be that they are somehow threatened by Bing?
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.120]   It certainly looked that way.
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:38.560]   And I don't--
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:39.360]   Was it a hack?
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:39.800]   It could be.
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:40.920]   Whatever somebody hacked them and they
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:42.640]   didn't want to admit it, or if it was a joke.
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:43.440]   No, they clearly said--
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:46.040]   I don't know why everybody wants to bypass this concept.
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:46.240]   It was--
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:47.600]   It was only up for two hours.
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:49.040]   Well, no, it was up for 12 hours.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.040]   But would you, John, you know what?
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:50.640]   I would have frustrated me.
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.320]   You know why I went on bypass this.
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:55.880]   Because if it were true, it would be terrifying.
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:57.800]   Well, if it was a hack, it was one that
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:00.400]   evolved sending out a press release on behalf of Google,
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.120]   saying, we've added a brand new feature.
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:02.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.520]   That is actually a pretty good idea for a hack,
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:06.560]   for a hoax.
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.320]   Send out a press release.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:11.280]   Do the hoax.
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:11.440]   Maybe--
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:14.760]   Why would they add this as a feature anyway?
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:16.320]   Again, competition with Bing.
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:17.320]   People like it on the Bing.
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:17.520]   Maybe it's--
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:18.020]   I don't know.
[01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:18.520]   Maybe it's--
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:19.020]   I don't know.
[01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:19.760]   What is this?
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:21.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:27.160]   It's like the market, but after a raid, it was great.
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:30.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:30.600]   I don't know.
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:31.240]   OK, we're going.
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:33.280]   You got to keep that bookmarked every time--
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:34.880]   every time conversation gets boring.
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:35.680]   You just played that.
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:38.160]   You're the most annoying sound in the world.
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:39.120]   Anyway, yeah.
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:40.600]   So Google will not be putting--
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:42.240]   I guess they've changed their minds.
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:42.520]   Will not be--
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:44.800]   So let's get back to this other issue, which came up,
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.080]   which I think is important.
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.240]   Because I bring it up a lot.
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.680]   And I'm going to keep bringing it up, which
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:50.360]   is the death of these search engines,
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:53.080]   if they can't deal with SEO.
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:56.480]   The fact-- and in my example is you try to find--
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:58.960]   I mean, besides trying to find the D-duper,
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:01.640]   I've always tried-- I tried to find the world's best weed
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:05.600]   whacker, the little thing with the string that spins around.
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.280]   And you can't do it, because all these--
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:08.560]   everyone's selling these things.
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:11.520]   And so they have SEO guys come in, and they pump it up.
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:15.880]   Nobody can do a comparison, because if it's on Google,
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:17.880]   if you look it up, you'll find it's on page 80.
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:19.040]   You'll never get there.
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:22.200]   There's not like CNET has--
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:24.200]   or I guess I don't know what website you would go to.
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:25.160]   You're going to get comparison.
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:26.760]   There's probably 100 of these weed whackers.
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:29.080]   And yeah, every site will have a-- maybe there's
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:31.280]   a few legitimate sites that will compare five of them.
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:32.360]   It's useless.
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:34.320]   And then if you try-- I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:36.120]   I know there's a matrix out there somewhere
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:37.880]   that where somebody's compared all 100 of them.
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.000]   I'll never find it.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.120]   That's what Google's supposed to do for me.
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:43.240]   But most of these sites are like, well,
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:44.960]   then CNET included in all these guys.
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:46.400]   They sell these things.
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:47.320]   It's all commercial.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:48.680]   I can't find the data.
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:50.480]   And Google has done nothing about this.
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:54.560]   They fight it off as best they can with anti-SEO concepts.
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:56.880]   What did the SEO guys were beating the crap out of them?
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:59.200]   Well, but I think it goes even farther than SEO.
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:01.040]   I think it really goes to the nature of how
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:03.000]   we get information on the internet.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.960]   I think a search engine is a blunt instrument
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:08.120]   for finding information that was good in the early days.
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:11.120]   But now, because of real time, because of curation
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:13.640]   and aggregation, basically, I don't think it's just SEO.
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:17.600]   There's just too much crap on the internet and a simple search
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.560]   as good as Google can get PageRank.
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:21.240]   I don't think a simple search is going to be enough.
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:23.000]   That's why you need human editors.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000]   That's why I think Google's added Twitter to its search results.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.560]   If you search for World Cup on Google,
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:33.400]   you will get not only some traditional Google search
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:38.360]   results, but you'll get live real time Twitter stream.
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:39.760]   That's part of the reason.
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:42.440]   I've started doing searches and actually putting quotes
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:44.800]   around actually asking the question because--
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:45.400]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:46.680]   I don't necessarily think it'll--
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:47.160]   Works.
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:49.400]   Leave me to the answer directly.
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:52.080]   But surely, somebody else has asked this question
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:52.920]   in a public forum.
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:55.480]   And a lot of times, you get the Yahoo answers, which comes up.
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:57.480]   And sometimes you get good answers.
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:58.200]   Sometimes you don't.
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:14:59.720]   And John, we've gone through this before.
[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:02.840]   Remember, there were link farms, like a real problem
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:04.000]   on Twitter a few years ago.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.680]   That's all you'd ever get as a link farm.
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:06.480]   For Google, yeah.
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:07.560]   Yeah, I mean, Google not Twitter.
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:07.760]   Yeah.
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:09.120]   And so I think that that's part of--
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:11.160]   Yeah, the Parker sites used to come up all the time.
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:11.680]   All parts.
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:12.520]   And they found to beat them back.
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:16.320]   But these commercial sites that are all over the place,
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:18.560]   I mean, try to find anybody out there,
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:20.560]   go to Google and type in.
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:24.920]   I went, find the best cell phone mobile phone plan.
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:27.120]   Just put that in your search and see what you get.
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:29.800]   You get thousands and thousands of hits for people
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:31.720]   that are with bogus sites.
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:34.360]   Phoney below, and it's selling mobile phone services.
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:36.240]   And it's just like it's impossible.
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:37.040]   And what else--
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:38.040]   Well, and that's what I can find.
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:39.200]   Leel report.
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:40.480]   And that's about all I can find on Google.
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:41.240]   It's good for--
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:41.800]   Exactly.
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:45.400]   It's good for data objects, but not for more abstract concepts.
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:48.040]   And by the way, that's the point of Bing.
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:49.920]   Bing was exactly that.
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:52.200]   Or at least that's how Microsoft sold it with the idea.
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:53.800]   It's just Google warmed over.
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:56.760]   But it isn't because it's so hard to do algorithmically.
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:59.040]   Really, the way to do it is with humans.
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:01.480]   And that's to me why Twitter, the success of Twitter,
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:03.120]   truthfully, the success of Facebook.
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:04.640]   And wonder what the critical mass is.
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:06.600]   There's some basic number of followers
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:09.520]   that I bet if you have it when you shout out a random question,
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:12.080]   the odds become in your favor that somebody will happen
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:13.040]   to know the result.
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:14.440]   Now, I try not to abuse it.
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:17.440]   But oh my god, if I want a direct answer about something,
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:21.280]   you ask it over Twitter and you get highly curated,
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:25.520]   valuable responses out of the crowd, the wisdom of the crowds.
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:26.040]   Yeah.
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:27.120]   Or you just get a move of--
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:27.920]   Forget the cloud.
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:29.000]   I'm all about the crowd.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:29.920]   Crowd.
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:31.560]   I'm with you.
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:31.960]   I'm with you.
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:33.360]   And I think that that's where we're going to see.
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:34.280]   That's the next stage.
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:36.880]   And I imagine that Google is running scared a little bit
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:44.160]   because their dominance is threatened by humans, oddly enough.
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:45.000]   The algorithmic side--
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.800]   The irony to this whole thing is that's the way Yahoo started.
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:48.720]   Right.
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:50.160]   And then they gave up on it.
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:51.640]   Algorithmic search has this limit.
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:53.640]   And the place if they had stuck to their guns
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:55.920]   and not brought in a symbol or ever--
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:58.680]   Are they not doing the Yahoo answers anymore?
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:16:59.640]   No, not the answers.
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:00.240]   The original Yahoo--
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:01.080]   You mean all the directions--
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:01.920]   Oh, they're directly--
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:02.400]   They're directly--
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:03.720]   --having people physically make the directory.
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:04.840]   Yeah, of course, of course.
[01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:06.920]   Although, I don't know if that works either.
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:08.120]   But that's, I think, probably what
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:10.880]   Mahalo's all about, Yahoo answers.
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:13.920]   I think that's probably the idea is human-powered search,
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:14.520]   right?
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:18.960]   But even if Google were to add something very simple,
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:23.040]   like a dig-like effect where every time you got a search that
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:26.400]   gave you obvious SEO, you could just tag it.
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:28.440]   And if enough people would weigh it down,
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.160]   you would bring in that human element.
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:32.760]   But I don't know enough about their wizardry
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:35.080]   to know if that would work with their plan or not.
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:37.000]   Was it a site we interviewed them on net at night
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.640]   called Artvark that was the same idea?
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:42.120]   It was kind of a recommendation search
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:45.720]   where you would-- and Google bought them, by the way.
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:52.880]   You would ask questions, and then your social graph
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:54.600]   would answer the questions.
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:56.640]   And what happened is Google said, oh, good.
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:58.000]   And bought them.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.160]   By the way, Patrick Norton has been sending me direct messages
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:01.920]   saying he wanted in.
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:02.420]   Yeah.
[01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:02.760]   We'll get him on.
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:04.040]   He wanted to know if we were still on.
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:06.120]   He says he's been trying to call.
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:07.320]   I'm sorry, Patrick.
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:09.440]   I don't know what it says about me, but he said, yeah.
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:11.120]   I knew you'd still be on Twitter.
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:12.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:14.520]   All right.
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:16.160]   Press this button here.
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:17.200]   Press that button there.
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:20.720]   He should show up magically.
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:22.080]   So a couple more stories.
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:26.240]   Did you see the Twitter account, the fake British Petroleum
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:26.960]   Twitter account?
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:28.360]   You've been following it for a while.
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:29.120]   That's hysterical.
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:29.920]   Wizards.
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:31.080]   Brilliant.
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:33.200]   BP wants Twitter to put a disclaimer on there.
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:34.440]   They can't get him to shut it down.
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:36.840]   I'm sure they've tried.
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:38.000]   There he is, Patrick Norton.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.280]   Hey, Patrick.
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:40.440]   Hey.
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:41.280]   Thank you for coming.
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:42.360]   Your email is so late.
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:42.720]   I was--
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:44.080]   No, it's my fault.
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.960]   I should have emailed you sooner.
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:47.040]   I was looking at my emails.
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:48.360]   I'm packing a boat up.
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:50.560]   And I'm like, oh, I have a chance to be on Twitter.
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:53.240]   Oh, I wish you hadn't done that.
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:55.000]   You could come on anytime.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.920]   I didn't ruin your day.
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:18:58.000]   Oh, no, no, no.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.360]   I just really happy I finally broke down.
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:05.160]   And what's the little box that you stick on your dashboard
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.320]   that goes beep when you go under the bridge tunnel?
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:08.880]   Oh, you have a fast track.
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:10.400]   Finally broke down and got a fast track.
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:11.880]   You didn't have one before?
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.880]   Well, the man could track me with a fast track.
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:15.840]   Oh, you're very privacy conscious.
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:16.560]   I didn't know that.
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:18.400]   That's awesome.
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:19.320]   No, it's amazing.
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:21.880]   Actually, I lost a lot of time.
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:24.360]   The baseball game let out and everything around 3rd
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:26.880]   Street was full of Giants fans.
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:30.480]   Were they playing the vuvuzela?
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:32.840]   I don't know what they-- there was some singing going on
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:34.840]   from the stage.
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:37.560]   I actually can do it now, but it's be flat.
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:40.560]   [SINGING]
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:41.040]   There it is.
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:41.640]   You saw this.
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:43.320]   This is an image somebody put in the chat room.
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.560]   What game is that, Brian?
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:45.880]   Look up on the monitor over there.
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:47.920]   Oh, that's the Ocarina time.
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:49.040]   That looks like Link there.
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:50.000]   Do you do in the--
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:50.840]   You played--
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:53.640]   [SINGING]
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:55.000]   That's a Legend of Zelda game, right?
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:55.720]   Legend of Zelda.
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:56.160]   See?
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:56.480]   See?
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:57.120]   You know these.
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:58.880]   See, this is going to pass my first test.
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:19:59.800]   I'm in for the E3.
[01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:00.960]   You can now go to E3 with it.
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:01.800]   By the way, you're right.
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:04.000]   BP Global PR, the Twitter account,
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.760]   was asked to put a disclaimer to make it clear
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:08.040]   that this was not actually BP.
[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.880]   So they put, quote, "We are not associated with Beyond
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:12.960]   Petroleum, the company that has been destroying the Gulf
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:14.640]   of Mexico for 52 days.
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:18.800]   The new disclaimer now reads Beyond Petroleum."
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.760]   Yeah, well, that's what the ads all say.
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:22.680]   I don't know if they actually changed their names
[01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:24.080]   from British Petroleum to beyond.
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:25.120]   So what is the fake account?
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:25.720]   BP.
[01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:31.440]   BP Global PR, the actual one is BP_America.
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:33.720]   We're not killing animals in the Gulf.
[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:35.400]   We're creating fossils in the Gulf.
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:36.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:38.160]   I have a little perspective.
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:39.600]   To create new fossil fuels.
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:40.120]   See?
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:43.720]   And I love it every one of them has the hashtag BP_Cares.
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:51.680]   Just dumped 40,000 barrels of free $25 BP_Cares t-shirts
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.320]   into the Gulf.
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:56.480]   Now, the interesting thing is that the fine for British
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:58.840]   Petroleum, somewhere around $60 million,
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:02.200]   the fine for limewire for stealing music over a billion
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:03.440]   dollars.
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:06.040]   Well, the difference is, in BP's defense,
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:09.600]   the government has capped liability for this.
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:11.560]   That's part of the-- whenever you get government involved
[01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:12.080]   with this.
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:14.960]   The government claims have lost business.
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:18.160]   They have a cap on the amount of lost business they can pay.
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:20.560]   There is no cap on what they can pay or potentially--
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:21.520]   To fix things.
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:22.040]   Interesting.
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:22.560]   Yeah.
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:22.560]   Yeah.
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:23.080]   Yeah.
[01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:24.080]   There's a difference.
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:27.920]   They're only required to subsidize lost business
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:31.800]   due to the oil leak.
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:34.680]   But the RIAA wants a billion dollars from limewire.
[01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:37.000]   And I'm sure limewire is just sitting on a billion dollars.
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.160]   Could just write a check, make that happen.
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:39.680]   Yeah.
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:41.160]   Well, you could say limewires.
[01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:43.600]   Lawyers aren't nearly as good as the ones--
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:44.200]   RSA say--
[01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:45.160]   The higher-beamed lawyers.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:47.120]   --relationship to the government isn't nearly as good
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:49.720]   as, say, the entire oil industry's relationship to the government.
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:50.880]   By the way, isn't there--
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:53.560]   doesn't talk about the RIAA--
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:54.440]   Hillary Rosen?
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:56.120]   Doesn't she work for BP now?
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:56.640]   No.
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:58.280]   Yeah, that's what I heard.
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:21:59.240]   I'm chatroom will correct me--
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:00.960]   Former president of the RIAA.
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:03.200]   Yeah, I'm certainly the spokesperson for the RIAA.
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:06.120]   It then went to work for-- I think for Obama.
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:07.720]   And is now working for BP.
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:08.680]   Well, that's interesting.
[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:09.680]   She is.
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:11.080]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:13.760]   I am almost certain I could be--
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:15.120]   Mary Google can help us.
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:16.440]   Oh, no, wait.
[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:17.440]   Yeah, it says Hillary Rosen.
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:19.760]   First the RIAA, now BP.
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:21.920]   Hyperbot.
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:22.600]   Wow.
[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:23.600]   Yeah.
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:26.880]   She works for a strategy group in DC.
[01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:27.600]   Rchart.com--
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:29.240]   She's at Brunswick group.
[01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:29.680]   Yeah.
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:32.720]   Now, I think she left Brunswick and started her own firm.
[01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:35.440]   And then ended up in a place called Rchart.com.
[01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:37.640]   For an encore, Ms. Rosen, in her capacity
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:40.120]   as a managing partner for the London PR firm,
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:42.760]   the Brunswick Group, has been hired by BP
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:45.320]   to put a pretty face on the oil spill in the Gulf.
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:47.200]   Yeah, well, they couldn't find a better person for that.
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:49.160]   Let me tell you.
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:50.560]   Wow.
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:53.800]   Geez, Louise.
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:57.160]   She was responsible for the dismantling of Napster,
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:59.040]   for the passage of the DMCA.
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:01.440]   She initiated the Grokster lawsuit.
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:05.360]   She got the Performance Right Act passed.
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:08.160]   The rest of the article sums it up by saying,
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:10.840]   whether you want to listen to music or live on a planet not
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:13.680]   poisoned by corporate greed, Hillary Rosen
[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:15.720]   is there to say, you can't.
[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:16.680]   Wow.
[01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:19.800]   You know, she's like that tobacco industry spokesman.
[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:20.760]   And thank you for smoking.
[01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:23.240]   I mean, there's some people just--
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:24.440]   they don't care.
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:26.080]   We're going to take a break, come back with more.
[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:27.800]   Thank you for joining us, Patrick Norton,
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:28.880]   the host of Techzilla.
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:31.200]   Techzilla.com is here.
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:32.480]   I had to be here.
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:34.240]   So nice to see you and talk to you.
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:35.800]   We'll find out what the latest is with Patrick.
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:38.240]   He's also the host of our newest-- one of our new shows
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:41.400]   on the Twitter, this week in Computer Hardware.
[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:41.960]   Yes.
[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:45.320]   Mr. Ryan Shratt, and I show up from time to time.
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:45.800]   Yeah.
[01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:46.960]   It's fun when you show up.
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:48.520]   It's a great show.
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:51.360]   In fact, I used to do it with Ryan.
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:52.280]   I used to do it with Ryan.
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:54.000]   And when I stopped, it was great,
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.400]   because when I did the screensavers,
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:59.000]   I was really up on hardware.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.800]   You covered it, and so I was able to keep up on it.
[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:03.760]   And then I stopped following it.
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:05.800]   And so it was really nice to do Twitch,
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:08.760]   because there's a lot of changes going on.
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:09.440]   It's a good way to do that.
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:11.240]   Have to work really hard to keep up with Ryan,
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:12.240]   because Ryan's on top of everything.
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:13.280]   Oh, he's the guy.
[01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:15.320]   There's John C. de Vorex.
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:18.080]   Must be time for a commercial.
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:20.200]   You know, who's in studio with us, Patrick,
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:23.160]   is the old voice of Tech TV, Jim Cutler.
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:23.640]   Really?
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:24.680]   Yeah.
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:25.520]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:26.560]   Say hi to Patrick.
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:29.400]   Dude, you and I wrote an article together a long time ago.
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:29.960]   Did you know that?
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:30.840]   Long time ago.
[01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:32.560]   Oh, you remember that?
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:33.960]   Like nine years ago, I think.
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:34.840]   I was like nine years ago.
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:37.400]   And I kept thinking, Patrick Norton,
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:40.240]   what's the antivirus guy doing with us?
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:41.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:42.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:45.320]   And then we did Tech TV, and then I found the magazine,
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:47.760]   and I said, holy cow.
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:49.920]   Patrick Norton in the house.
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:51.680]   Hey, we're going to continue on in just a second
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:54.280]   with this week in Tech and our hosts.
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:55.560]   But I've got to tell you about backup,
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:57.240]   and I've got to tell you about something for business,
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:24:57.960]   from Carbonite.
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:59.320]   You've heard me talk about Carbonite,
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:01.840]   the off-site backup that does such a great job.
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:03.880]   It's automatic, runs in the background,
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:05.440]   every time you're connected to the internet,
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:08.480]   without slowing you down or your computer.
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:11.840]   It's a must-have for everybody who's got data.
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:13.200]   You will lose a hard drive.
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:14.080]   You will lose a computer.
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:15.000]   You will lose your backups.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.800]   At some point, having an off-site backup is critical.
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:20.000]   Even more so in business, just do a thought experiment
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:20.240]   with me.
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:21.160]   Close your eyes for a minute.
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:23.760]   Imagine what would happen if you--
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:25.280]   maybe there's a fire at your business,
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:26.960]   and you lost your data and you lost your backups.
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:27.640]   You lost everything.
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:29.200]   How would you recover that data?
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:30.480]   How would you get back to business?
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:31.320]   How long would it take?
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:34.440]   How much money would you lose?
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:37.400]   A great backup is critical, and you've
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.400]   got to do it off-site so that if the worst happens,
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:41.160]   you still can get that data back.
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:43.320]   That's why I recommend Carbonite Pro.
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:44.520]   Go to carbonitepro.com.
[01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:47.040]   You could try it free for 30 days,
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:49.520]   backup every seat in the house, all your employees,
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:51.400]   computers, centralized dashboards
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:52.320]   so you know how it's doing.
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:53.040]   And affordable?
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:53.640]   Absolutely.
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:54.960]   If you go to carbonitepro.com, you
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:56.640]   could see how affordable.
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:59.120]   18 computers is an example.
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:03.240]   5 gigabytes on each computer, just $50 a month.
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:07.280]   8 computers with 5 gigabytes per computer, just $25 a month.
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:10.640]   It's simply the most affordable way
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:13.720]   to back up your office.
[01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:15.480]   Now you could try it free for 30 days.
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:18.000]   And I have to say, I did the 30-day trial just to see how it was.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:18.760]   Really great.
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:21.000]   Really helpful to give you a lot of information,
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.200]   sent you emails saying, here's, you know, how's it going?
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:24.240]   What can we do?
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:27.200]   Carbonitepro.com, try it free for 30 days.
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:31.080]   Carbonitepro.com, brand new from Carbonite.
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:34.920]   We thank you for their support of this week in tech.
[01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:39.200]   Twitter says, it's been crashing a lot this week.
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:44.120]   And they call them site availability issues.
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:48.520]   Networking problem, they said it was some networking gear
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:51.200]   bit us in the butt.
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:52.800]   Problems were going on throughout the week.
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:53.440]   It's interesting.
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:56.440]   I mean, Twitter's been much better of late.
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:58.600]   I don't know if-- I didn't really notice any problem this week.
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:01.640]   But apparently, teams are responding to this incident.
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:11.320]   There are no details on what network hardware.
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:13.600]   But I have to say, Twitter's been pretty good of late.
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:14.280]   And I think--
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:16.160]   Now it crashed on me a couple times a week.
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:16.660]   Didn't it?
[01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:17.800]   What do you use to tweet?
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:21.280]   I use the website.
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:21.760]   Real?
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:22.640]   How lame is that?
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:25.040]   That's so sad.
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:27.520]   Well, you know what we say to people who say that.
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:32.120]   Say, we say, blow me.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:33.160]   Oh, I was waiting for it.
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:34.800]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:35.320]   Try again.
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:37.080]   I didn't hold it down long enough.
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:39.560]   You're a sick man.
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:40.120]   Blow me.
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:46.640]   Wow.
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:47.880]   That's very-- that's a musical.
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:53.240]   By the way, that's blow me.co.ca.
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:59.960]   If you'd like to participate in the blowout, do you guys use
[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:00.440]   WikiLeaks?
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:01.520]   Are you familiar with WikiLeaks?
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:02.080]   I think WikiLeaks.
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:03.640]   I'm familiar with it by reputation only.
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:04.920]   I don't usually hit on over there.
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:07.280]   Huge asset to the United States,
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:10.920]   founded by an Australian who, by the way, does not
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:16.520]   publish his name because he publishes some really steamy stuff.
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:18.440]   John, do you ever use WikiLeaks?
[01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:18.680]   I mean--
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:20.920]   Yeah, I think it's a front for the CIA.
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:23.440]   What?
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:25.280]   What?
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:25.760]   They don't know--
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:27.800]   I mean, that guy that got busted just recently,
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:30.560]   he's talked about how he gave him more-- you know, that video.
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:33.440]   He gave him other videos and then also a bunch of other things.
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:35.480]   And WikiLeaks never ran any of that stuff,
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:36.600]   and they're not going to.
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:40.640]   Well, according to the Daily Beast at ABC News,
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:42.200]   Pentagon investigators are trying
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:46.400]   to determine the whereabouts of Julian Asangay, the US--
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:49.560]   Wasn't the guy recently on some TV show?
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:51.800]   How hard can he be to find?
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:54.720]   They're worried he's going to publish a huge cache
[01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:58.320]   of classified state department cables.
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:28:59.960]   Oh, there's the giveaway.
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:02.200]   We talk about this on no agenda today, by the way.
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:02.960]   Cables?
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:03.520]   What is it?
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:05.320]   What state department cables?
[01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:06.160]   It's Randall.
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:06.680]   What is it?
[01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:09.200]   It's a vera-borne telegram, son.
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:09.680]   Stop.
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:11.240]   He didn't say it was from this century, John.
[01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:12.520]   Hitler is attacking.
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:13.560]   Stop.
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:14.080]   Stop.
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:14.600]   Date line.
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:14.800]   What is it?
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:15.140]   10.
[01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:16.120]   Stop.
[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:20.400]   Important cables leaked over the low at the intertubes.
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:23.240]   Leaked by a 22-year-old army intelligence specialist
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:26.920]   Bradley Manning of Potomac, Maryland, who is now in custody.
[01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:28.480]   And the feds are worried because they
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:31.240]   say these cables are prepared by diplomats,
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:33.360]   the state department officials throughout the Middle East
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:37.040]   regarding the workings of Arab governments and their leaders.
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:39.080]   Sounds like it could be pretty embarrassing.
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:40.760]   Well, we heard from other sources
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:44.320]   that the cables are mostly about Vatican, the Vatican,
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:46.000]   and pedophiles.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.280]   Ooh, that would be even more embarrassing.
[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:48.960]   Yes.
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:50.960]   Yeah, and shocking.
[01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:51.160]   What?
[01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:52.600]   Yes, we're stunned.
[01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:53.600]   What?
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:55.600]   There's gambling going on?
[01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:57.120]   It wins us.
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:58.120]   Yeah.
[01:29:58.120 --> 01:29:59.200]   That's like your winning, sir.
[01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:05.840]   Well, when they come from me, I hope you'll do more than that.
[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:08.720]   I thought it was that you guys today were talking, John,
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:10.280]   about the dangers of sitting.
[01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:14.440]   This report direct from the No Agenda Newsroom.
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:17.280]   There is evidence that sitting alters metabolism.
[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:20.240]   It changes the way the body metabolizes fat and sugars
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:21.120]   in the body.
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:23.160]   It increases the risk of diabetes,
[01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:25.560]   causes higher blood pressure, increases
[01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:28.360]   the risk of developing dangerous abdominal fat,
[01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:28.720]   increases--
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:30.560]   She sounds like she's having a hard time
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:32.000]   keeping from laughing as she says it.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.480]   She sounds like she's about to laugh.
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:37.600]   Cancer and a matriole cancer causes a decrease in bone density.
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:40.280]   So it increases the risk of osteoporosis.
[01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:43.840]   It's harmful to vascular health, affects brain function,
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:47.640]   and overall, research is showing that more time spent sitting
[01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:51.120]   is related to an increase in deaths from all causes.
[01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:51.840]   Holy cow.
[01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:53.240]   You could not sound happier.
[01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:53.840]   How did she do it?
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:55.200]   There was that very grim news.
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:56.600]   You know what the real problem is, Pete?
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:31:00.280]   No, this actually is legit, but it's not new.
[01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:01.720]   This has been around for a while.
[01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:03.320]   Yeah, people have been sitting for years.
[01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:04.480]   It's just an breathing.
[01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:05.480]   Keeps you alive.
[01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:07.840]   You know, sometimes you feel like sitting.
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:09.800]   The real problem is that if you're standing,
[01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:11.880]   you can't play the vuvuzela.
[01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:12.440]   Oh, don't do it.
[01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:12.920]   Don't do it.
[01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:13.720]   Don't do it.
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:14.640]   That's the real--
[01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:15.800]   Oh, thank goodness.
[01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:16.160]   Thank goodness.
[01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:17.840]   My vuvuzela is broken.
[01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:19.400]   That's we just drew the Monopoly card,
[01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:20.920]   technical error in your favor.
[01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:22.400]   No vuvuzela.
[01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:22.840]   Really?
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:23.920]   Seriously?
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:28.200]   It's-- oh, man.
[01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:28.880]   All right.
[01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:30.480]   So what is the story with that, John?
[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:32.640]   It's just some random piece of crap that--
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:35.520]   No, we related it to some information
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:38.880]   that appeared on the White House.gov site,
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:40.240]   some of the things we'll bomb us trying to do.
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:41.880]   It's all connected, isn't it?
[01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:42.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:44.360]   It's sitting Obama.
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:45.360]   BP.
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:47.840]   I think we've cracked the code right here.
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:49.320]   It's all connected.
[01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:51.320]   It's all connected.
[01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:53.920]   Does wave anybody still talking about Google Wave?
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:55.160]   One year in--
[01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:58.320]   was announced at Google I/O a year and two weeks ago.
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:31:59.880]   Oh my god, it was a year and two weeks ago?
[01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:00.880]   A year and two weeks ago?
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:03.040]   Wave coming-- you know, I've used Wave once,
[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:06.120]   and I found it novel to watch somebody else typing on it.
[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:06.480]   Novel.
[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:08.000]   And had never used it again.
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:08.960]   I was like, hey, look at you.
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:09.880]   You're making an update.
[01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:10.680]   It was novel.
[01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:11.840]   Real time.
[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:15.600]   It was novel like the Wii Moat, and about as impactful.
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:16.760]   What are you talking about?
[01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:18.320]   Well, how many Nintendo weeks--
[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:21.360]   I think all of this is a-- is a fad, I think.
[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:24.800]   You, Brian, I just want to say you're about to go to E3.
[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:26.840]   You might not want to talk too much crap about the Wii Mo.
[01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:27.240]   I know.
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:27.640]   I know.
[01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:28.840]   I'll just say it.
[01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:30.480]   I will stay-- I will stay very directly.
[01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:31.400]   I'm highly skeptical.
[01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:33.560]   I hope I get proven very, very wrong.
[01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:36.920]   I hope I walk out totally invasion of this body snatchers
[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:40.800]   where I'm like, you know, not all who needs controllers.
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:41.800]   Yeah.
[01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:43.680]   No, I thought you said vuvuzela.
[01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:44.200]   No.
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:46.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:48.560]   According-- this is a story for you, John C. Devorek.
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:50.560]   According to the American Association
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:53.680]   for the Advancement of Retired People--
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:54.280]   Yeah?
[01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:54.780]   Yeah.
[01:32:54.780 --> 01:33:00.760]   25% of older Americans are using social media.
[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:01.840]   Well, I would think--
[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:02.360]   Wait a minute.
[01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:03.240]   --they're a good thing for them.
[01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:04.640]   This is people 50 and older.
[01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:06.040]   I guess I'm in that group too.
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:07.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:08.680]   Well, you use social media.
[01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:10.440]   I use social media.
[01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:11.280]   Half of those--
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:13.080]   You can't get away from it.
[01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:16.840]   There's a great flow chart in Esquire this month
[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:19.440]   that basically helps you decide whether or not
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:22.480]   you're too old to be using social media with a bunch
[01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:25.480]   of particularly brilliant Donald Rumsfeld references
[01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:26.200]   inside of it.
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:29.040]   Basically, like, are you too old to use Facebook?
[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:31.080]   Well, I think I am.
[01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:32.120]   I think I am.
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:32.600]   Let me see if I--
[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:33.280]   You have to use Facebook.
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:34.320]   You have children.
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:36.280]   How do you track children without being on Facebook?
[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:37.280]   No, absolutely.
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:38.200]   Can't be done.
[01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:39.280]   I actually quit Facebook.
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:40.040]   Don't use it.
[01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:41.120]   Don't know anything about it.
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:42.920]   Face what?
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:44.320]   Yeah, you did this with Twitter too.
[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:44.960]   And you came--
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:46.240]   You came groveling back.
[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:49.480]   Well, I'll admit, I realize that if--
[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:51.520]   how can I cover Facebook without a Facebook account?
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:54.160]   So I have created a new Facebook account.
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:55.880]   Not that I'm going to use it, but I just--
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:57.200]   because for one thing, I want to see,
[01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:00.000]   what are the default privacy settings today
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.680]   if you create a new Facebook account?
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:02.600]   So that account's--
[01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:03.400]   What were they?
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:03.900]   --in there?
[01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:05.240]   Define privacy.
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:06.120]   Yeah.
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:07.240]   Privacy what?
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:07.880]   How?
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:09.280]   Yeah.
[01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:12.440]   Yeah, they're OK.
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:13.120]   They're OK.
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:16.840]   I think the biggest thing-- and I wish that when--
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:18.720]   Walt Mossberg and Cara Swisher last week
[01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:22.200]   at the De-conference interviewed the sweaty Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:23.360]   Swetti Mark?
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:24.720]   Is that the name he's going by these days?
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:25.720]   Swetti Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:27.280]   Mr. Swetti.
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:29.920]   He was really sweaty.
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:31.400]   I wish they'd asked him a little--
[01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:33.560]   I think you would be too leo if you had those two
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:34.280]   sitting across the--
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:34.760]   No kidding.
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:35.720]   I mean, they were tough on him.
[01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:37.440]   And they finally released the full video.
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:39.000]   So I was able to watch the full video.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.600]   I thought he was more responsive than he was giving credit for.
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:43.960]   But they pressed him, but they never
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:44.760]   to get an answer for him.
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:46.200]   On the biggest thing that bugged me, which
[01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:48.920]   is that as soon as they'd made this last policy change,
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:51.560]   if you had interests, what are your interests?
[01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:54.200]   And it actually joined you to everything
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:56.720]   you had your interests as.
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:59.040]   And somebody was in the studio last week
[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:02.800]   and said that he had put in his interests something like,
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:06.400]   I'm not interested, comma, and neither should you.
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:08.200]   And he was joined-- made up?
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:11.320]   They made up a group called I'm Not Interested and a group
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:12.800]   called And Neither Should You.
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:13.360]   Brilliant.
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:15.760]   And joined him to it.
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:18.000]   So it just shows you how stupid.
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:18.960]   But it's a public group.
[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:21.120]   So if you put-- you know, my interest is in--
[01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:24.440]   I don't know-- baby butchery.
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:25.400]   They'd make up a--
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:25.920]   Put it in.
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:26.760]   They'd make up a public--
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:28.000]   And they'd set one up.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.480]   They'd make up a public group called Baby Butchery.
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:31.520]   And you'd be the sole member.
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:33.520]   And that'd be pretty embarrassing.
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:35.520]   Hundreds of mildly obscene things
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:38.120]   are being created in fake baseball accounts.
[01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:40.040]   Right now, because of you, Leah.
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:41.040]   Exactly.
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:44.200]   Yes, everybody in the chat room is now cranking out these things.
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:46.240]   Yeah, I love babies.
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:48.040]   It's also-- I mean, it's also part of--
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:49.480]   Don't put baby lover.
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:51.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:53.280]   You're right.
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:55.560]   But it's also part of Facebook trying
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:57.800]   to keep on top of search engine optimization
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:35:58.880]   to own categories.
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:01.120]   And most importantly, to allow its advertisers
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:03.320]   to directly mark people in certain areas.
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:06.040]   Because if they create a group and 100,000 people join it,
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:10.840]   then suddenly they are the place to advertise for nothing,
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:16.000]   or weasels, or 195 millimeter profile tires,
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.400]   or whatever it is.
[01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:20.360]   And Facebook's always been about do it,
[01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:22.040]   and then ask forgiveness later if you
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:25.720]   manage to piss off the user group.
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:27.720]   And the truth is, they haven't even really pissed off
[01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:28.280]   the user group.
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:29.440]   I think it got to the point where they're
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:31.920]   starting to get worried about the eventual stock price,
[01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:33.960]   based on the ass kicking they were getting in the press.
[01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:35.400]   It wasn't about real users.
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:36.240]   It was about the press.
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:38.080]   And that's what they said.
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:40.520]   I take you now to Bluff City, Tennessee.
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:41.640]   Date line, 2010.
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:43.200]   Bluff City, Tennessee.
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:45.560]   Just over the cables comes the following from the only port.
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:49.720]   Brian McCraery, 33, receives a speeding ticket.
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:52.240]   But after receiving the $90 speeding ticket
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:55.720]   for cruising through what he called a police speed trap,
[01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:58.920]   he tried to go to the Bluff City Police Department's website.
[01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:00.800]   He wanted to reschedule his hearing.
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:02.640]   He said, see here, sir.
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:05.800]   When he noticed something unusual,
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:07.960]   the site's content had been replaced with a notice,
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:11.400]   saying the domain name was on the verge of expiring.
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:13.240]   He saw an opportunity.
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:14.960]   He waited a few weeks until the name had lapsed,
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:17.280]   and he bought it.
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:19.040]   He really thought the city would renew it.
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:21.560]   I was surprised to find it was still out there.
[01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:22.080]   Surprise.
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:24.920]   He was overjoyed to find out.
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:27.480]   And so he bought the site, whatever
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:30.960]   it is, Bluff City Police Department.com.
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:34.720]   And he posted stories about speed cameras,
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:38.160]   features comments from other camera critics.
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:42.440]   It's basically-- he's got 1,000 unique visit visitors.
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:43.800]   It's phenomenally says, I hope this
[01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:45.880]   will attract the attention of the local representatives
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:47.200]   to get the cameras removed.
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:50.600]   Well, he said that once the story hit the news wires.
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:52.200]   $95,000.
[01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:52.760]   Yeah.
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:54.600]   Bluff City Police Chief David Nelson
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:57.600]   said he didn't even know they'd lost the domain name.
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:00.040]   We have a website.
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:04.320]   Until somebody told him.
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:06.080]   Yeah, I'm sure they can get their website back
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:08.920]   if they give him his money back for the speeding ticket
[01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:10.280]   and then take it off as a record.
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:10.960]   No problem.
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:13.000]   The chief of police says, I feel like he's
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.240]   throwing it out of revenge because you got a ticket.
[01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:17.600]   Chee?
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:19.240]   Chief Wiggum is in the house.
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:27.320]   By the way, you know the web domain was hosted by GoDaddy.
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:29.360]   I got a call from Brian Parsons.
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:31.480]   I haven't returned it yet.
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:32.440]   You know what's his name?
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:33.320]   Parsons, Bob Parsons.
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:34.800]   Bob Parsons, yeah.
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:36.200]   I should play it.
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:37.720]   I'll tell you what, I'll give it to you, John.
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:39.200]   You could play it on no agenda.
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:41.520]   All right, email it to me.
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:42.840]   What is the privacy?
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:44.320]   If somebody leaves a voicemail message,
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:45.400]   does that become public?
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:47.000]   I mean, I could play it.
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.560]   Well, there's no expectation that it's not being recorded.
[01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:50.120]   I would think.
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:50.640]   Clearly.
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:51.280]   Yeah.
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:53.560]   When it says, please leave a message at this recording.
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:54.520]   Clearly.
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:55.880]   I would imagine you have very little--
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:59.200]   Yeah, Chief Wiggum said, I had no idea to run out.
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:01.280]   I'm sure.
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:03.760]   I'm sure I will probably be able to get it back, Chief.
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:07.120]   That's some good domain registration, Lou.
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:09.560]   GoDaddy says, once a name expires,
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:11.560]   it's fair game for anyone who wants to snap it up.
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:13.920]   Which they make it sound like that's an unusual policy.
[01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:19.280]   But when a domain name expires, nobody owns it at that moment.
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:20.920]   And it is clear that there's a whole--
[01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:22.280]   I think they give you-- is there some lag?
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:23.320]   There's a grace period.
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:25.120]   There's a-- and maybe that was the grace period.
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:26.160]   Yeah.
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:28.960]   Well, and they said what they do is they send an email warning.
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:30.400]   If they don't get any response or interest
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:32.000]   from the email warning, then they actually
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.520]   put that message up on the website,
[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:35.240]   because they figure maybe you've changed your address.
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:37.080]   And let me tell you, I almost--
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:40.720]   I registered Schwood.com with network solutions,
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:42.040]   is that who the original ones were?
[01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:42.240]   Yeah.
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:43.040]   Back in the day.
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:44.960]   And I registered for five years.
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:47.320]   And of course, I had gone through like five different email
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:48.640]   addresses since then.
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:49.920]   And they still had an old one.
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:52.400]   I almost lost my primary domain.
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:54.880]   And it was just dumb luck that I went to check the settings.
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:57.040]   And I happened to figure out that they were sending stuff
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:58.040]   to the wrong email.
[01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:00.600]   According to ABC, who talked to General Counsel for GoDaddy,
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:02.320]   Christine Jones, the police chief
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:04.760]   didn't understand how the domain name worked.
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:06.960]   And his tech guy was out sick.
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:07.800]   And it lapsed.
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:08.320]   Oh.
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:08.840]   Oh.
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:09.600]   Somebody else got it.
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:12.120]   So we hope the tech guy is feeling better.
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:15.920]   And we hope that Chief Wigam gets his domain name back.
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:20.320]   And we hope that the guy's ticket is refunded.
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:20.920]   Yeah.
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:22.200]   Because that'll happen.
[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:23.160]   At all.
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:24.240]   Right.
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:26.320]   Chief Wigam said before the camera was installed,
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:29.520]   there were nine to 13 accidents in that area every month.
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:33.280]   So I guess they really didn't use the camera there.
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:34.000]   Folks, we are--
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000]   They're finding out that most of these speed cameras,
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.400]   especially in services who are causing more accidents.
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:39.760]   Because people speed up to avoid them.
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:41.200]   Oh, dude, I definitely have almost caused an accident.
[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:42.200]   Slam on the brakes.
[01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:44.120]   Like, oh.
[01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:45.720]   Because I think to myself--
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:47.840]   and it's like, I usually have my show gear
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:49.000]   in the back of the truck.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.880]   And I hear it all climbing around behind me.
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:52.120]   Oh, that's bad.
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:54.360]   Maybe if you drove the speed limit, this way.
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:55.360]   But that's just it.
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:57.280]   I live on a road that has stoplights
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:59.280]   and has a 65 mile an hour speed limit.
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:00.720]   So it's like I'm doing 65.
[01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:01.560]   And you see yellow--
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:02.160]   It's a stoplight.
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:02.840]   That's not good.
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:04.280]   They should-- the two should not combine.
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:06.880]   There's a couple in Napa Valley on the road of '29,
[01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:08.840]   I think, that are like 55 mile an hour.
[01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:09.800]   Yeah, no, you're right.
[01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:11.520]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:12.320]   Hey, we're out of time.
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:14.360]   I thank you so much, Brian Brushwood, for being here.
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:16.960]   Brian's going to head down to LA with us to cover E3.
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:19.120]   Our coverage starts tomorrow morning at 5 AM.
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:20.520]   5.30 AM.
[01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:22.560]   What fun?
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:23.640]   What were we thinking?
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:27.680]   We're going to have exclusive footage of Project Mattal.
[01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:30.240]   We'll be the first after ABC to broadcast that.
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:31.640]   You can watch it live here, but you
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:33.920]   can also watch it after the fact because our coverage
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:37.240]   of Microsoft's press conference begins at 10 AM Pacific.
[01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:38.400]   That's 1 PM--
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:41.600]   Love Tom Merritt and Sarah Lane giving live commentary.
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:44.600]   Brian and I will be at E3 in LA then covering it.
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:47.040]   And on Tuesday, we're going to take to the show floor.
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:48.720]   And you have something set up for us.
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:50.520]   I'm already trying to set up as many as I can.
[01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:51.520]   I'm really excited about it.
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:53.000]   It's going to be fun.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:56.480]   And maybe you can teach me how to play the Legend of Zelda.
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:41:57.720]   Or play the vuvuzela.
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:41:58.520]   Or the vuvuzela.
[01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:00.440]   Shwood.com is the website.
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:04.800]   And of course, Brian's shows NSFW is on the Twit Network.
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:06.360]   You're going to do a special one right after this show.
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:08.640]   Yep, early tonight, right after East meets West.
[01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:09.360]   So that'd be fun.
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:10.960]   But normally you're on Tuesday nights.
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:11.640]   Tuesday nights.
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:12.480]   Tuesday nights, yeah.
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:14.840]   And of course, scam school at scamschool.tv.
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:16.920]   On revision three, speaking of revision three,
[01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:19.720]   Patrick Norton hosts the fantastic Tekzilla.
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:24.480]   It is the logical heir apparent to the screen savers.
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:25.720]   It's an awfully nice thing to say.
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:26.640]   Oh, I think it's true.
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:27.320]   I think it's true.
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:31.520]   You and Veronica are the Caiton Leo of this decade.
[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:32.880]   Aww.
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:34.000]   This century.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:34.880]   Of the century.
[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:36.440]   You're on the century, even.
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:37.440]   Sorry.
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:38.680]   We're on both centuries.
[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:39.280]   Tekzilla.tv.
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:40.720]   That was so long ago.
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:42.640]   And catch Patrick on this week in computer hardware
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:45.000]   on our Twit Network every Thursday at 6 PM.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.480]   Pacific 9 PM Eastern.
[01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:52.960]   Right here, John C. Devorek is at channeldevorek.com.
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:55.040]   That's where you can find the listing of all the things he
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:56.760]   does, including no agenda.
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:58.400]   The Tech Grouch.
[01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:00.680]   Actually, the Tech Grouch and the Tech Hippie aren't on there
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:03.160]   because that's not really me if you haven't noticed.
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:05.840]   Oh, just somebody sounds strangely like you.
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:08.240]   The new Tech Hippie is pretty funny.
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:09.520]   The Tech Hippie is very funny.
[01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:10.920]   Can you do an impression of the Tech Hippie?
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:11.800]   I've never heard him.
[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:12.880]   I can't really.
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:14.560]   It's like I tried it a couple of times,
[01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:16.280]   but it hurts my throat.
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:18.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:21.640]   You got to have the shirt to really--
[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:22.400]   I could play a little.
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:24.640]   You want to mean to play a little Tech Hippie?
[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:26.080]   Just play a little Tech Hippie for you.
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:27.120]   I think there's an ad.
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:27.640]   Easy tome.
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:28.480]   Let's skip the Reebok ad.
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:29.680]   Skip the Reebok ad.
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:30.880]   Oh, you can't skip that.
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:32.480]   And the bunks look great, too.
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:32.980]   OK.
[01:43:32.980 --> 01:43:34.080]   It's just a rest of the bad ad.
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:34.880]   Hey, look up.
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:36.080]   What the hell?
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:36.880]   What the hell?
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:38.880]   This content is totally in this F.L.B.
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:39.480]   What are you doing?
[01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:39.680]   What are you doing?
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:40.680]   Zoomed in on her butt.
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:41.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:43.080]   8% of the whole--
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:44.080]   That's what I call it.
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:44.080]   Yeah.
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:44.580]   What?
[01:43:44.580 --> 01:43:45.580]   What are you doing?
[01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:48.180]   And again, what kind of ad is-- what is that?
[01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:49.180]   What is that?
[01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:50.180]   I am shocked.
[01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:50.680]   Shocked.
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:52.180]   That such content is on the internet.
[01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:54.380]   There's gambling going on.
[01:43:54.380 --> 01:43:56.580]   Oh, my God.
[01:43:56.580 --> 01:43:58.180]   What was that ad for?
[01:43:58.180 --> 01:43:59.380]   It's a once-in-a-year-old.
[01:43:59.380 --> 01:44:00.980]   I'm going to go check it out.
[01:44:00.980 --> 01:44:01.380]   Oh, my God.
[01:44:01.380 --> 01:44:03.880]   Do you think out the trend of every time I come on,
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:06.280]   this week at Tech is far more in his F.W.
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:07.480]   than the actual show in his F.W.
[01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:07.980]   I know.
[01:44:07.980 --> 01:44:10.380]   We got to change the name because it's not--
[01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:11.380]   Yeah, we'll just make an S.W.
[01:44:11.380 --> 01:44:12.380]   An N.W.
[01:44:12.380 --> 01:44:13.380]   S.W.
[01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:14.380]   I understand this.
[01:44:14.380 --> 01:44:15.380]   What is this?
[01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:19.380]   Man, they got 2 million people but the iPad.
[01:44:19.380 --> 01:44:22.380]   What are you guys crazy?
[01:44:22.380 --> 01:44:24.380]   Why have I got two cigarettes?
[01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:26.380]   That tells me this entire--
[01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:29.680]   Hey, John, by the way, don't we have a bet on how many iPads
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:30.180]   will be sold?
[01:44:30.180 --> 01:44:31.580]   I think John, you said there--
[01:44:31.580 --> 01:44:35.180]   I said 5 million to be sold in the first year we got to--
[01:44:35.180 --> 01:44:35.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:37.080]   This is totally shopping for the bottle.
[01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:39.880]   I'm wondering if we should make it like a bottle for every million
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:40.880]   they go past 5 or 4.
[01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:41.780]   No, I think that's--
[01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:43.180]   The bets over.
[01:44:43.180 --> 01:44:46.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:44:46.180 --> 01:44:49.680]   Hey, you know, it's because of things like this vuvuzelle.
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:50.680]   Don't do it, don't do it.
[01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:51.680]   Don't do it without this.
[01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:52.680]   You can't help it.
[01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:55.180]   Yeah, there'd be no iPad sales.
[01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:57.180]   JohnCeDevorak, channeledevorak.com.
[01:44:57.180 --> 01:44:57.680]   Thank you, John.
[01:44:57.680 --> 01:44:59.180]   Always great to have you on.
[01:44:59.180 --> 01:45:00.180]   All right, see you next week.
[01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:00.680]   See you soon.
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:02.180]   Thank you all for being here, folks.
[01:45:02.180 --> 01:45:06.180]   We will continue on with East Meats West to Tom Merritt
[01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:08.180]   and then right after a special NSFW.
[01:45:08.180 --> 01:45:09.680]   Don't forget, what time do we begin tomorrow?
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:10.680]   5.30?
[01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:11.680]   5 AM.

[01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:16.680]   I'll be back here with a live streaming coverage of Project Natal.
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:17.680]   This better be good.
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:19.680]   All you kids going to bed in Europe?
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:20.680]   First thing when you wake up.
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:22.680]   This better damn well be good.
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:23.680]   It is just this.
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:26.680]   It's going to be angry, surly Leo reporting.
[01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:27.680]   What is this?
[01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:28.680]   What is this?
