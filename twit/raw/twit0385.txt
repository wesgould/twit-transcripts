[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Welcome to Twit, a very special edition of Twit, our holiday episode, which almost didn't happen.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   We've got a great panel of people who are not going to talk about tech news this week,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   but instead the spirit of the holidays joining us. I want to go clockwise, but I don't know
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   who the guy is in the upper right hand corner. John Roderick is a surprise fill-in guest.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   He's joining us from Roderick on the line, the great podcast. And of course, he's banned the
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Decemberists, which I'm going to go.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Oh, Gary, it's poor Roderick.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Sitting next to him, John Hodgman, who apparently is doing his impression of Gary
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Sunnis in the fifth element. I'm just waiting for blood to dribble down his forehead.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Gary Oldman. Gary Oldman, sorry.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Gary Oldman. I confuse Gary's. But you've got the FETlock thing going there.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Yeah, I got the Commissioner Gordon mustache.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I love that. You know, I love that. Good to have you two, Mr.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Scott Proff and just the long winters.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   The Internet knows that. The Internet knows.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   December, winter, it's all the same.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Also with us is Storm. Where's Storm? There's Storm.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Oh, that's Paul. Oh, damn. There's Storm.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Oh, there's Paul. I was going clockwise.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   What? Paul and Paul and Storm. You know Paul and Storm. They're very funny.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   But Paul did not go to Yale, right?
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   No, all right. I wore this as a gesture of goodwill to my
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   new friends on the show.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Nothing but Yale, actually.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Honestly, Paul, that's maybe the most offensive thing you could do.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Yes.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Mission accomplished. Where's my banner?
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   You're insulting the memory of a lot of
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   a lot of positive white dudes on a pampered
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   positive white shoe lawyer dudes.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   What you can't see, Hodgman, is that I'm wearing a pair of sweatpants
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   that say "bulabula" on the butt.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Yale is everything that's wrong with America.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   It says "John Roderick."
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   All right, that's Paul, so this must be Storm.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   I am Storm.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   There is Storm coming to you from the Blackmold studios in
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   beautiful Brooklyn.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Greg D'Custanza.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Yeah, I don't think I've ever called you by your true name.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   No one does. It's best not to.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   It's kind of a Beetlejuice thing.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   I'll just appear.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   So we've said it once.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   If I say it two more times, we're in trouble.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   He sent back to his original dimension.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Oh, that wouldn't be a bad thing.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   And then finally, to the left of the giant candle,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   it's Jonathan Colton of Jonathan Colton.com.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   And the funny thing about this is they're all within one block
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   of each other.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   So we just tape off the screen to make it look like.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   No, we're actually in the same room.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   That's right.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Yeah, they're in the same room.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   We've got buzzwords.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   John and I both live in Brooklyn.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   John Roderick lives in another major American city called Seattle.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I don't know where Paul and Storm live.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Baltimore and Philadelphia.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Baltimore, yeah.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Baltimore and Philadelphia's that order.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Now, somebody told me that John Roderick is kind of like the
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   rain man that you can say things and he will just say the answer
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   just like he did right there.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Right.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   That's right.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   But usually I incorporate Hitler somehow.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Well, we're fortunate he left that out because this is supposed
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   to be festive.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   This is our...
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Now, I wasn't, to be honest, I wasn't going to do this show.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Paul and Storm insisted.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Well, I don't know what happens.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   You can't make a way.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   One of their major...
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   I mean, this has been on their calendar since last year.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   I live for this thing, Leo.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   What am I supposed to get?
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   I'm going to have a hodgepant abuse if we don't do this show.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   This year was such a car wreck that we just thought, I'm not
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   going to do that show anymore.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Was it a car wreck?
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Was it a car wreck?
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Why was it a car wreck?
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Just like this.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   It was just like this.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   It was just like this.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   It was terrible disaster.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   There's no train wreck in a car wreck.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   I want some credit for the improvement in the background.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   I was going to say, I was all set to ask if you had moved the
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   cardboard box this year.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Yeah, but everything that you accomplished with the upgrading
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   your background has been reversed by John Hodgman.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Who's down there?
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Who's down there?
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Oh my God, he's in his bedroom with an unmade bed and some
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   strange dude with a beard.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   That's Brooklyn.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   It's beginning to feel a lot like Christmas.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   I missed the sideways guitar case in the backdrop of Jonathan
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Colton.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   I got one of those.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   I got it covered.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   You got some stuff.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   You got some boxes and junk back here.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   I bet.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   We're in a real stuff over there.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Look at that.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   So the part of the problem with doing the show is that we have no
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   agenda whatsoever.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   It's just really a chance to get together, drink heavily and
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   talk about the sad disappointments of 2012.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   I'm glad I came.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   You'll fit right in.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   What are you drinking tonight, Leah?
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   I am drinking.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Well, it's an interesting concoction.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   It's Armenian brandy, era rat brand, which I think is,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   isn't that the mountain where Noah's Ark finally landed?
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Noah's Ark is there.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   It's 20 year old brandy, but it's kind of a concoction because I
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   thought, well, for the festive occasion, I would throw some
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   miniature marshmallows in it, but they dissolved almost
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   instantly.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Yeah, they are.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   That's what they use.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   They use Armenian brandy regularly as a marshmallow solvent.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Can I see those marshmallows go?
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   It's almost like the perfect marshmallow solvent.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Now, I've added an orange peel to give it some flavor, but
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   they just, well, we'll check back in a minute or two.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   It doesn't happen.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   We're not going to stare at it for 40 minutes?
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   We could.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   I'll tell you what.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   I would fill up a lot of the show.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Why don't I do a commercial?
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   And while I'm doing a commercial, and then we'll check back and
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   see how the marshmallows are doing.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   That's how they do it on Juliet Child.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   We're just going to take a break.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   If we come back, we'll pull it from the oven.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   I'm sure it'll be a...
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Actually, I'm pretty sure that was public television, so...
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Yeah, you wouldn't know that.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   It's possible that I've saturated it by putting so many marshmallows in it
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   that no longer...
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Well, more brandy then.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   You've exceeded its marshmallow carrying load.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Exactly.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   It's a super suspension or something.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   You've turned it into a marshmallow, Arminyak colloid.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   It's hypermallowed.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   No, it's hypermallowed.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   You stick a stick in there, and you tap it, and the marshmallow
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   then coagulates on the stick.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Oh, so they're not Newtonian marshmallows.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   You have a book of matches?
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Oh, let's try it.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Anybody have a...
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Anybody on fire?
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Are they quarantined?
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   That was the last time anyone saw Leo alive.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   We used to choose questions.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Do you have a book of matches, and is that Santa had made out of polyester?
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Yes, and yes.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   You must have some matches, don't you smoke something?
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   She's going out the way he always wanted to with a great big mess of our
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   media brandy.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   We're hosting on an open fire.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Marshmallows dissolving in Arminyak.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Our show, you know, our show is actually brought to you by a local company
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   that you guys probably know well.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Go ahead.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Squarespace.com, let's just see.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   I don't know what...
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   You know, on broadcast television, I think there are rules about this.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   If you die, this is advertising gold for Squarespace.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Gold.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   They'll be showing this on YouTube over and over again.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Is it all Squarespace right before you do it?
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Squarespace!
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   [laughter]
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   It's the worst battle cry ever.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   You have to drop the lighter into the glass.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   For Squarespace!
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Yeah, keep the lower third up.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Squarespace!
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   [laughter]
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   It doesn't work.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   You know, I think if we found out that Marshmallows are actually a very
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   effective fire retardant.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   I think they're going to be really happy with this ad.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   [laughter]
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Now, Hurricane Sandy, now this was an event that probably you guys have some stories
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   about because, of course, at least some of you on the East Coast.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   I don't know if you know, but Pier 1, which is the network provider for Squarespace,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   this is still a Squarespace.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Thank you.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   You can leave the lower third up.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   It was, of course, flooded in Hurricane Sandy, and they made a mistake.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   They put the generators in the basement.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   So the power went out.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   The generators are--
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   You can hear one retailer of wicker chairs and--
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   I may have the name wrong.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   [laughter]
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   It could be pottery barn.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   It's one of the big network operations centers.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Yeah, anyway, they did have one generator, but it was in the attic.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   So there's two big clients up here.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   One, one is Squarespace, of course, and the other is John's Joel Spolsky's company.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   They make Trello.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Wonderful.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   [laughter]
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   One of my children is playing the same.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   All right.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   I'll go see it.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   You take care of it.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   They just love Trello.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   They're Trello fans.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   They heard there was fire happening in a Squarespace ad, and they were like, "Oh, let me see that."
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   I hear Leo's going on and on about Pier 1.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   [laughter]
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   There they are.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Is that one of yours, John, or one of Paul's?
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   No, no, it's just a child.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Is that one of Paul Roderick's children?
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   It's just one of the many children that lives here.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   It's one of the murder practice children.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   If I ever have to dispose of the body of a marshmallow child, I'll know how to do it.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   She's solved with an Armenian brandy.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   It's gone forever.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   In any event, Squarespace...
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Anyway, Squarespace.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Well, they knew that the power was going to go out, that potentially this would affect the...
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   I don't know, how many?
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Hundreds of thousands of customers.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   And Anthony Castellena, the CEO of Squarespace, along with some of the employees from Trello,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   and some of the Squarespace employees went over to the building and they literally...
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   They brought gas...
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   I guess it was diesel, probably, upstairs from the basement to the generator upstairs all night long
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   in a fire brigade to keep those servers up and running so that your stupid blog would not go down.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Wow.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Meanwhile, a hospital across town was having to move the babies out of intensive care.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Exactly.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Exactly.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   That's dedication.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   They got...
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   They kept that generator out.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   They did not.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   They did not go down.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   The entire Sandy episode, Squarespace didn't go down and that's what I call a commitment to customers,
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   a commitment to service, a commitment to uptime, and it's one of the reasons you want to Squarespace site.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   But it's not even the most important reason.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   The most important reason is the software, the content management system that runs on top of this great web hosting.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   It's the best in the business.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   Their latest version does something called mobile responsive design.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   It's a site that expands and shrinks depending on conditions.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   So if you're watching, if you're looking at it on a big screen like this, it will fill the site.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   And you don't have to do anything.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   There's no mobile site.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   If you're looking at a little iPhone, it works perfectly.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   You don't have to do anything.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   In fact, even when you upload images to your site, it automatically makes seven different versions so that there's a suck.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   Wow.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   Wow.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   That's how it does it.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   Right like we're finished.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Look at that.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Seven different images.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   The bands.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   So you're a site will look great on any.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   A-da.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   Cool.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   [CRASHING]
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   [CRASHING]

[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   That's the wrong time I put my shoos in my cognac.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   Squarespace.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Squarespace.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   What happens to my website, man?
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   [LAUGHING]
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   I don't know about your website, but I'll tell you, Squarespace sites did not go down.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   They never go down.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   They have such great software.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   They look so good.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.800]   If you're a photographer, an artist of any kind, maybe perhaps a musician, you should
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.000]   be looking at Squarespace for your next website.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Here's the deal.

[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   WordPress.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Thank you.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.600]   You have that importer and also exporter, so you're never stuck in a Squarespace site.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.920]   And now look at the pricing.
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.320]   Eight dollars a month for the standard plan.
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.800]   Sixteen dollars a month for the whole kit and kaboodle.

[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Wow.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   They are blowing it up.

[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:15.800]   You know what?
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.880]   We've been with Squarespace for years now.
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.000]   I just pray that they don't leave us.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   So Squarespace.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Please, guys.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.560]   This was an aberration.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.080]   Usually we do a great ad.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.080]   Squarespace.com.
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.080]   Show them.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.720]   Folks, go at home.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.440]   Show them how much you love them.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.000]   Sign up for a site today.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.360]   Tell them, uh, Paul Roderick sent you.
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.360]   That'd be good.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.160]   But we check out the marshmallow status before you.
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.400]   How are we doing marshmallows?
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.080]   We actually have saturated because they haven't dissolved at all.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.640]   I put a lot more brandy in there.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:49.480]   And you're probably thinking I'm a lion sack of-- you know what?
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.400]   But a lion sack of posits.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.320]   One of your PAs probably just scooped them out while you weren't looking at this.
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.320]   Oh, it was-- no.
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.880]   They were just-- they were-- they looked like sad old men.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.440]   They were just-- hold up.
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.400]   It was terrible.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.960]   So let's talk about-- did John--
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.200]   now both John and Paul have disappeared.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.520]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:16.200]   And by the way, you can see that this is absolutely the worst I've ever seen in terms
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.200]   of backdrop.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.200]   John--
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.200]   Yeah, it's crazy.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:24.920]   That is John Hodgman's entire apartment, what you're looking at that is the whole apartment.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:25.920]   That's the kitchen.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.920]   They're on the right.
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:27.920]   I know it's cleaning up.
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:28.920]   That's so nice.
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.920]   Oh, John, get in the bed.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:30.920]   Do the rest of this podcast from bed.
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:31.920]   This is the kitchen.
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:36.920]   But John, get in the bed.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.920]   This is something you don't usually see.
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.640]   Hollywood star John Hodgman in his native habitat.
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.440]   This is Christmas right here.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.440]   This is so totally Christmas.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.440]   Watching John Hodgman make a bed.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.880]   I would have thought he'd have made some money on that Apple stuff.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:52.880]   I guess--
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.880]   You should be a Tom Waite song playing.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.440]   Just put that up a little more of him making his bed.
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:04.440]   I know what you're doing.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:09.440]   You're making his bed on Christmas Eve.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.920]   I'm doing something right now.
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:11.920]   It's OK.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:12.920]   You can have the children on.
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:13.920]   I think it's a kick in the worst in this.
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.920]   I don't want you to see my children, Leo.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.840]   I'm going to play me.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.840]   Do they look like you?
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:26.840]   Oh, no, on Christmas Eve.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.840]   It sounds like Bill Cosby covering.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.840]   What do you want to do?
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.840]   You got Tom Waite?
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:40.840]   I think some marshmallows in to the drink.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:46.840]   I'd like everyone to know, have you finished your advertising?
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:47.840]   Yes.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.840]   I'd like to tell everyone about my book.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:54.840]   That is all now available in paperback and audiobook.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.840]   I'm going to give the lights on here.
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.840]   I'm going to keep the bed made at John Hodgman.com.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:05.840]   Do you have some fancy exploding graphics that can illustrate this book for us?
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:06.840]   No.
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:07.840]   Chad?
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:08.840]   Chad can do it.
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:09.840]   There you go.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:10.840]   There you go.
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:11.840]   Look at that.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.840]   Nice.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.840]   Wow.
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:14.840]   Thank you very much.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:15.840]   He's good.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:20.840]   I'm going to plug in there for Warren Ellis' new book, "Gone Machine."
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:26.840]   Warren Ellis, a very famous comic book writer and novelist.
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.840]   There's a new crime book out, which is really good.
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:29.840]   It's scary.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.840]   Isn't that nice of you plugging up?
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:36.840]   And he's giving these books away to leave one somewhere in the world.
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.840]   I think that's in New York City.
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.840]   Take a picture of it.
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:45.840]   And then the first person who finds it can take it, and that might just be a random person,
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:51.840]   or the first person who identifies where it is and sends an email to him will get a free copy.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.840]   I think it's a very good book promotion.
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.840]   They already have a copy because they found one.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.840]   No, he's giving-- he'll give two away.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:05.840]   One-- he'll give away one to the person who identifies where that book is from the photo.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:06.840]   Ah.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.840]   And then obviously that one, he just leaves there.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:14.840]   So whoever takes it, whether or not they're a big Warren Ellis fan, or they just figure it's garbage
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.840]   and they have to throw it away or something.
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.840]   That looks like Columbia.
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.840]   Ah, well, maybe you're right.
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:23.840]   It's certainly not Yale.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.840]   That's the only thing I know.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.840]   No, no, oh no.
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:28.840]   Oh, no.
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:35.840]   And I'm drinking-- we were talking before about the origin of eggnog.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:42.840]   And I use the internet to find out that eggnog is one of many posits of Old England, a posit being
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:47.840]   a warm, scalded milk mauled with wine or ale.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.840]   And I decided to make some.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.840]   And I didn't have any wine or ale, so I put in Fernet Bronca.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:59.840]   And now I feel like I'm drinking a pine cone, a dipped in miracle lip.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.840]   Do you have milk and Fernet Bronca in there?
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.840]   It actually tastes pretty good.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.840]   It sounds pretty terrible.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.840]   It sounds like a medicine milkshake.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.840]   Well, have you had Fernet Bronca?
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.840]   I have, yes.
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.840]   So you know that it can't be worse than Fernet Bronca?
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:19.840]   I guess that's true.
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:20.840]   That's a good point.
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.840]   Eddie milk can only improve it, really.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:26.840]   Milk and Fernet Bronca is only less-- it's a little less bad than Fernet Bronca by itself.
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:27.840]   I like Fernet Bronca a lot.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.840]   But I like all those weird tasting things.
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.840]   What is, you know, I see all the hipster friends of mine drinking that.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.840]   What is that?
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.840]   It's very big in San Francisco.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:37.840]   It's huge.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:38.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:43.840]   Cooks drink it, chefs drink it after hours to prove to each other that there's still tough.
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.840]   Where is the origin of Fernet Bronca?
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:47.840]   Here we go.
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:56.840]   Fernet Bronca is an Italian liqueur, one of many amoros, which is Italian for bitter,
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:02.840]   which orders an aperitif or digestif in almost any Italian restaurant you'd see a dozen or more.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:08.840]   If you go down to Mario Patale's restaurant, Lupa, here in New York City, you'll see a wall of these amoros.
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:13.840]   And there are many, many different brands, different kinds of very intensity,
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:19.840]   varying intensity of bitter medicinal flavors, some are sweeter, some are more bitter.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:29.840]   Fernet Bronca, I believe, was originally designed as a medicine for women who are suffering discomfort
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.840]   during a certain time of the month.
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:33.840]   And then was...
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.840]   You're kidding.
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:35.840]   This is Italian lidal?
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:42.840]   I think that if my memory serves, you know, all those bitters are medicinal.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.840]   Yeah, they were medicinal.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:45.840]   Alcohol is a solvent.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:52.840]   Much like Brandy is a solvent for marshmallows, alcohol is a solvent for herbs and spices.
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:23:04.840]   And when herbal medicine was the only medicine, alcohol proved to be a very effective means of conveying medicinal herbs into the body.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.840]   It's a ten.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:09.840]   And it worked fantastic because everyone felt great after they drank it.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.840]   Sure.
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:16.840]   This is why I attended Yale University to learn that research with distinct facts like this.
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.840]   This is what you learn at the big ivies.
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.840]   So I understand that...
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:25.840]   Italian medicinal liquor, and it tastes... it's very piney.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:26.840]   Piney?
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:27.840]   Pine is the...
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.840]   Oh, it's good.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.840]   You're wrong.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.840]   You're all wrong.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.840]   You know, it's become the hipster drink in San Francisco, and I don't quite understand that.
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.840]   I think everyone's looking for a story to tell.
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.840]   On Christmas Eve!
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.840]   John Hodgman's bedroom!
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:50.840]   Ernie Bronka in the mug!
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:56.840]   So are you guys all going to do that crazy cruise thing again, the Joko Crazy Cruise?
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:57.840]   Sure are.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.840]   We're gearing up for it right now.
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:08.840]   As a matter of fact, on this Sunday, Paul and Storm and I and Scarface will get on the very same boat that the crews will be on to go on a...
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.840]   Test cruise.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.840]   Oh, come on.
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.840]   That's just the thing we have to do for work.
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:15.840]   That's a junket.
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:16.840]   Come on.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.840]   Really a test cruise like you don't know?
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.840]   Well, it's a sight inspection, John.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.840]   How long is this sight inspection?
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:23.840]   We're inspecting this sight.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.840]   It's seven days.
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.840]   In the Caribbean.
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.840]   And, yeah, it's a cruise.
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:31.840]   We're going on a cruise.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:32.840]   Are you going on a cruise?
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.840]   Because we want to make sure... we want to prepare everything.
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.840]   We want to make sure everything is cool for everyone.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:41.840]   We want to make sure all the spaces are up to our high standards.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.840]   So is this the same boat you took last year?
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.840]   No, it's a brand new boat.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.840]   Actually, we moved to a different cruise line.
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.840]   We're on ship, sorry.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.840]   We're on Royal Caribbean now and it's a bigger ship.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.840]   It's called the Freedom of the Seas.
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:55.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.840]   And it's many thousands of people.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:58.840]   What's the capacity on that ship?
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:59.840]   Do you guys know?
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:03.840]   It's like 3,600 passengers.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:04.840]   Jeez Louise.
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:05.840]   So huge.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.840]   There's a skating rink, there's a climbing wall, there's a wave pool.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.840]   It's insane.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.840]   So I'm looking forward to seeing the ship.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.840]   It's going to be kind of awesome.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:18.840]   And when will be the Joko Cruise Crazy Cruise itself?
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:23.840]   It is on this February, this coming February, February, what is it?
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:24.840]   10th?
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:25.840]   Is that right?
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:26.840]   Yes.
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:27.840]   10th to 17th.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.840]   You're going to be so sick of cruising by then.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:30.840]   Because you'll...
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:31.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:32.840]   Hold on.
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:37.840]   There's a lot of food in the islands and the sand and the beaches.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.840]   It's going to be a real drag.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:45.840]   It has a capacity of 3,634 passengers and 1,360 crew.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:46.840]   Wow.
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:47.840]   So it says...
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:48.840]   Crazy town.
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.840]   It is a town.
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.840]   It has a Ben & Jerry's onboard.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:54.840]   It's huge.
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:55.840]   Wow.
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:56.840]   It does.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.840]   So that means there's plenty of space for your perspective fans.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.840]   Tell me what a Joko Cruise is like.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.840]   What happens on the Cruise?
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:13.840]   Well, we have a bunch of different kinds of entertainers, comedians, musicians and other.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:19.840]   And we do a main show every day with a couple of performers.
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.840]   And then there are other events.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.840]   There are late night events, dance parties in karaoke.
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:25.840]   Nice.
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.840]   Because the Cruise Entertainment is usually kind of cheesy.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:34.840]   Well, the nice thing is we sort of fit in around the standard Cruise Entertainment.
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:39.840]   So it's a completely separate private list of events.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:45.840]   And my favorite thing about it is just, you know, in this day and age, there are all these
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.840]   online communities.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:52.400]   And this is one of those rare opportunities to get together with a fantastic community
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:56.840]   of people in actual meet space.
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:01.840]   And it's really kind of amazing for all of us to have all these people that we have
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:10.840]   corresponded with and known only online, all in the same place and sharing the same experience.
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:13.840]   It's surprisingly powerful to be with real people these days.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:14.840]   You forget.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:15.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.840]   And these things are wildly successful.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:22.840]   I mean, you know, I do cruises with geekcruises.com.
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:26.200]   You know, typically it's 60, 100 people like Mac mania.
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.200]   We just did Mac mania.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.680]   And it was about, I don't know, 85 people.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.960]   There you just saw a little bit of a map of the cruise right there.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:41.600]   And you'll be on the cruise.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.320]   I think John, John, I think it's jealous.
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:49.640]   But you get, you get how many people do you get on these cruises, Jonathan?
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.720]   We've been growing bigger and bigger every year.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.720]   So the first year we were about, we were at what?
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.720]   400?
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:57.720]   Wow.
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:58.720]   No, three something.
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:59.720]   Yeah, three 70.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.720]   Yeah.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:02.720]   Storm knows better than I storms the numbers guy.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.720]   Where are we at?
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:04.720]   Storm.
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:09.040]   We had the first cruise in 2011 was 372.
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:12.800]   The second year was 540.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:16.600]   And this year we are expecting a total group size of around 700.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:17.600]   Wow.
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:21.040]   So you're going to take over that ship.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.040]   Actually not really.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:27.680]   I mean, it's more or less than what a seven into 32.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.680]   We're what?
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:31.680]   Like half the ship.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:37.840]   We're really, I mean, we're a sizable group, but we're really only a portion of the actual
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.320]   passengers on the ship.
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.320]   Oh, that sounds exciting.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.680]   Someday it would be fun to take over an entire ship.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.160]   We'd have to take over a smaller ship.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.000]   But yeah, you're getting there.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   Not by force.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.760]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.280]   Some of the smaller cruise ships are 450 people.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.280]   I think you could do it.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.440]   Oh, we could totally do it.
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.440]   Yeah.
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.720]   But who wants to go on a crappy small cruise ship?
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:56.720]   They're not crappy.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:57.720]   They're little ones.
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:01.160]   They don't have the climbing walls, but they have a piano bar.
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.160]   Yeah.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.160]   Yeah.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.160]   Oh, it's because let's cram 400 people into a piano bar.
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.160]   That sounds like a blast.
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.800]   Did any, yeah, the Somali pirate cruise.
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.960]   That's the one we want to go on.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.960]   Did any of you ship?
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:14.960]   Did any?
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.960]   Oh, look, there's a small.
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:16.960]   It's great.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.040]   This is like how to succeed in advertising.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.640]   John has grown a small head on his shoulder.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.840]   Oh, good reference.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:24.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:30.680]   The children have started to play.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.080]   There is your Christmas card.
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:37.280]   It's right, the darnest things.
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:38.280]   Lies.
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:41.600]   The paper says lies.
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:45.400]   Did any of you go to the 12, 12, 12 concert yesterday?
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:49.520]   The big benefit for the sandy refugees?
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.080]   I couldn't get tickets.
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.080]   Really?
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:55.640]   Also, I was having steak with Jonathan Colton.
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:56.640]   There you go.
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.840]   Looked like an amazing, amazing guy.
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.280]   I also could get tickets in that.
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:03.480]   How did you survive the hurricane?
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.480]   Very easily.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.560]   Yeah, where we were it was not.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:10.280]   It looks like there might have been some dental damage, however.
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.440]   Yeah, that's the only problem.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.360]   Where we were, there was just some rain and some wind, which is why it was so bad.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:18.680]   It was so weird to see other parts of Brooklyn that had been completely--
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:19.680]   Yeah, that's amazing.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:20.680]   --leveled.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:27.680]   We were at Park Slope, so we were protected by our dome of liberal sanctimony.
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.840]   The weather did not touch us at all.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:37.160]   We just exchanged sustainably harvested organic Halloween candies with each other in our homemade
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:45.080]   and/or Etsy sourced costumes and enjoyed ourselves while Red Hook and Staten Island drowned.
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.080]   That's amazing.
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.280]   They kind of the localization story.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:52.520]   It was terrifying.
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:57.000]   Everyone thought that it was just fine, but then over the next couple of days, he began
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.640]   to stand better the damage.
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:02.080]   Of course, then we started to run out of gas.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.760]   We started to run out of food.
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.440]   ATMs were running out of money.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:10.920]   The very souvenir of civilization was beginning to chip away.
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:22.320]   Little guy had already put a samurai swords all over my car and started driving around
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.520]   with my shirt off wearing a gigantic wrestling mask.
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:29.320]   And that's when John Roderick moved in with you.
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.320]   Yeah, John.
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.080]   What are you saying?
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.880]   Big wild.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:38.720]   I should say for those of you listening on audio and there are a substantial portion
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:45.840]   of our audience does not see what is going on that John Hodgman has a small child on
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.480]   his shoulder who has written a note.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.480]   What does that note say, John?
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:55.600]   It says big lives, huge lives.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:56.600]   That's nice.
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.680]   You've trained it well, John.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.320]   That's right.
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:11.920]   And in any case, luckily I had already outfitted my massive 16-wheel supercar and was able
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:18.200]   to rescue a few people and then--
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.920]   And then apparently, he muted his microphone.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:22.200]   And then he muted his microphone.
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:24.000]   Whatever he said was classified anyway.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.840]   He's classified as a collegeman.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:26.840]   Classic hodgman.
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:27.840]   Boy, oh boy.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:28.840]   That's right.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:31.280]   And he cannot be replicated.
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:35.440]   So I understand that did Roderick do an album with you guys?
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.640]   What was somebody was saying that you guys--
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:43.400]   Well, so I'm glad you asked Leo because John Roderick and I--
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.200]   One Christmas at a time.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.200]   That's right.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:50.440]   This summer, John Roderick and I got together and said, hey, let's make a bunch of money
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:53.320]   by doing covers of classic Christmas songs.
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:54.320]   Everybody's doing it.
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.040]   It's obviously a way to get rich.
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.720]   And then when we got together, we realized we didn't like any Christmas songs.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.720]   And so we wrote our own.
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:07.080]   So it's an album of all original Christmas songs, which is maybe not the best way to
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.120]   make a million dollars.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.800]   But it was a lot of fun.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:16.440]   We did it very quickly and enjoyably this summer.
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:20.240]   Is it weird doing Christmas songs in the summer?
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:25.600]   It is except when you're doing a Christmas song, it's--
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:26.600]   I don't know.
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:31.040]   I always try to write around the thing that I'm trying to write about, which is--
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.920]   You've done Christmas songs before, "Bade of Prime" is a Christmas song.
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:37.440]   I have "Caring of Prime" and "Christmas" is interesting is another one.
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:44.560]   And I like to find stuff that's a little bit--
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.320]   Just an offshoot of the idea of Christmas.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:50.240]   So one of my favorite songs in the album is a song called "The Week Between," which is
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:55.600]   about that week between Christmas and New Year's that's kind of this melancholy weird
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.600]   nowhere time.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.600]   Uh-huh.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.600]   Yeah, that's not--
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:01.600]   Go ahead.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.760]   Go, go, go, go, go, let me hit her.
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.120]   No, I'm not going to stop.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.120]   I'm not going to stop.
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.120]   Just because he's--
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:11.400]   It's kind of funny that Hodgman's going to yell at us about every time.
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.400]   Of all people, John Hodgman, who got his plug in--
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.400]   Guys, I love commercials.
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:16.400]   I love commercials.
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:17.400]   I know you do.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.400]   Guys, are you still talking--
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.400]   Squirtface?
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.400]   Squirtface?
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:27.840]   Hey, no, I was just talking about the new "Hit Holiday" album, "One Christmas at a Time."
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:33.400]   I think, you know, is there any way we could get you guys to perform a little bit of that?
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.400]   That's it right there.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.400]   That was interpretive.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:41.160]   Is that a gallon jug of yaker mice?
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.560]   It's the largest bottle I've ever seen, actually.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.560]   It's impressive.
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:45.560]   Yeah.
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:46.560]   Hi.
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:47.560]   Talk to the deer, folks.
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:48.560]   Talk to the deer.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:53.800]   That is a tradition, actually, of-- you know, I think that started early on many years ago
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.480]   when we first started doing these shows.
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:56.480]   And it's a--
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.600]   Yeah, the yaker is an important part of the show.
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:59.600]   It is.
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:00.600]   It's with--
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:01.600]   It now storms the only one representing.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.160]   I know I have my bottle.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.160]   I have my bottle.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.360]   I'm having some apple juice here.
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.360]   Some--
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.360]   Some where my bottle is.
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.360]   There are two fingers of apple juice, Jonathan.
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:12.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.360]   I mean, your apple juice is neat.
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.360]   It's single--
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.760]   Two fingers, four fingers, whatever it takes.
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.080]   Single malt apple juice.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.080]   So, yeah.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.080]   There you go.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.080]   There we go.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.080]   Look at that.
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.080]   Wow, big bottle.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.440]   That's a plenty big bottle of yaker.
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:27.440]   Is it as big as yours?
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.440]   I don't know.
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.840]   Well, I don't like to brag.
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:31.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:32.840]   That's pretty--
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:36.360]   The camera adds 10 pounds.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.360]   So there's probably no way--
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.360]   Or on the marshmallows, though.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.360]   Given the marshmallows.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.360]   Put it on the marshmallows.
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.360]   Pour it on the marshmallows.
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:44.000]   Oh, they're already-- they've already started to do--
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Oh, that's--
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   They're starting to go, yeah.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   Yeah, let's put a little--
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   You could perform with the-- I imagine there's some crazy Skype
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.400]   delay that would make us sound terrible, like bad things.
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.400]   You know what, Johnson?
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.000]   We've played under worse conditions than that.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   Here, let's just see if we can clap along together.

[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   Perfect.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   [CLAPPING]
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   That was super cool.

[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:47.120]   - The title track is the catchiest thing I've heard
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:51.360]   in about 10 years and you will hear 10 seconds of it
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.680]   and you'll be caught in your brain
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:53.960]   and you'll be happy about it.

[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.960]   - Let's play, we could play a little bit.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.000]   We've got the technology, I'm gonna get Chad.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.760]   He's gonna, I think it's online on your website,

[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:07.320]   It's on Spotify and iTunes, it's in all the places,
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:08.760]   you know, you can get it.
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.880]   - All right, so we'll pull it up here.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:13.520]   And while we're pulling it up, let me do a little ad for
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:16.880]   another sponsor, a sponsor with even a better sense of humor
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:20.080]   than Squarespace.
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.280]   So they're gonna love this.
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.920]   It's called the Ford Motor Company,
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.280]   perhaps you've heard of them.
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:26.120]   - What?
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:29.560]   - I know they're just like the kind of motorsport.
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:31.640]   - I think you should just let Paul Roderick
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.760]   talk for two minutes about the Ford Motor Company.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:36.600]   - Paul, have you ever driven a Ford automobile?
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.600]   - Listen to me right now, I'm gonna tell you
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.120]   the serious truth about Ford's.
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:45.640]   As a touring musician, there's only one motor vehicle
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:49.360]   and that is the Ford E350 van,
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.000]   - Big fan, that's my true van.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.040]   - Yeah, any other van by any other maker
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.120]   is insufficient to the task.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.800]   - I think that's actually true.
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:58.800]   - Yeah, Ford van's. - That's not even
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.960]   the best I've ever seen.
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:00.840]   - I would concur.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:01.680]   - Yeah.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:04.160]   Now I wish that the Ford would put the,
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:07.640]   some of the high end, you know,
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:11.280]   technology in the van that they put in their cars.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.840]   I don't know, do you get things like the blind spot
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:17.160]   information system bliss in that van?
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.240]   Do you have bliss in that van?
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.600]   - You don't wanna mess around with that city.
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.120]   (laughing)
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:27.280]   Put a V10 motor in the front of a simple car.
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:30.560]   You drive it across America.
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.240]   (laughing)
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.080]   - Yeah.
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:34.320]   - It's basically a big black coffin
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:35.920]   filled with metal parts.
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.440]   (laughing)
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.480]   - Just drive across America with a snake
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.840]   on your neck and injury.
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:43.400]   (laughing)
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.720]   - For those of you that are not doing that,
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.120]   you might wanna take a look at bliss.
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:50.760]   Bliss keeps you from driving into traffic.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.480]   This you could use this, John.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.880]   Look it, watch what happens.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:56.720]   It's got detectors, some sort of sensors
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:00.280]   on the rear quarter panels of each side
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.120]   that detect blind spots.
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:03.880]   And when traffic is in your blind spot,
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.400]   it'll actually warn you, on the mirror,
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:09.440]   it has a little visual and there's an audible tone
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.600]   that lets you know that there's a car in your blind spot.
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.040]   Now that's a good thing.
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.120]   - It's interesting that every--
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.320]   - There's a giant blind spot.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.160]   - Oh yeah.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:19.000]   - Here's another thing that will help you
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.120]   in those same situations.
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:22.680]   That is learning to drive when you are young
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:26.040]   and then continuing to practice driving as you get older
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:29.000]   and checking your mirrors and not being a dope.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.920]   (laughing)
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:33.960]   - But I'll give you a E350 van.
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.240]   It's a big blind spot there.
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.080]   Now how about this?
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.320]   This must have happened to you once in a while.
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:40.800]   You're backing out of a parking space.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.640]   I guess it doesn't happen in an E350 van,
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:45.080]   but to me, I'm driving a Ford Taurus
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:46.480]   or I'm driving my Mustang
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.800]   or perhaps I'm driving the 2013 Fusion,
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.120]   which I'm very excited about.
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.240]   And there are two E350 vans on either side of you.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:55.480]   You can't, as you're backing out of the parking lot,
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.960]   you can't see around the back of the van,
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.520]   but this is so cool.
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:03.640]   It actually has, it will look around the corner
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:07.440]   and let you know if there is somebody out there
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.400]   driving along and actually bleeps at you.
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.000]   Now that's pretty cool.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.640]   - Does every car come with an autonomous drone
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:15.040]   flying camera so that they can--
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:15.920]   - They're getting very close.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.000]   They're getting very close.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.240]   How about this?
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:19.960]   Have you ever used the automated,
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:23.200]   the active park assist in a Ford vehicle?
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.120]   - I never have.
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:25.720]   - This is scary. - I like the looks of it.
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.200]   - So you're driving along in the car
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.720]   and it actually looks at parking spaces
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:31.280]   and when one is big enough for you,
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:33.720]   it says, "Hey, I'm looking, I'm looking,
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:36.040]   "hey, I found a spot."
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:38.720]   Watch this, space found, pull forward.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:40.360]   So you pull forward, you put it in gear
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:43.320]   and then you take your hands off the wheel, watch this.
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:44.640]   - Get the F out.
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:45.480]   - I'm not kidding. - No.
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:46.920]   - It actually parks you.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:49.000]   I've done this, it's kind of amazing.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.320]   It does all the geometry.
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.840]   It does parallel parking perfectly.
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.520]   And then you, now this is key 'cause I didn't do this.
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:58.360]   You take it out of gear and you turn off the engine.
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.680]   (laughing)
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.880]   I actually let it back right into the car behind me,
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.800]   but that's me.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.840]   - I am very interested in John Roderick's opinion
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:07.840]   of this technology.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.680]   - What do you think, John?
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:13.240]   - The problem is that natural selection should be
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.040]   weeding out drivers that can't,
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:17.720]   (laughing)
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:21.920]   and these technologies are boarding natural selection
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:25.280]   and our roads are gonna be filled with old people
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.280]   and people that should never be behind the wheel.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.160]   - People who can't parallel park.
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.520]   - Yeah. - But they're already there.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:31.360]   - They're already there. - Like you share.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.800]   - Or you should drive around in a rascal.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:35.640]   (laughing)
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:39.200]   - Leo, can I send you a link to a YouTube video
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.640]   of me taking two minutes to unpark a car
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.000]   that John Roderick parked?
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:43.840]   (laughing)
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:44.680]   - I guess.
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:47.760]   Send the link to Chad and we'll put it on the air.
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.280]   - All right, I'm gonna send it to Chad.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.280]   It's great for falling asleep.
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:54.040]   (laughing)
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.560]   - We're gonna get Alan Malawi,
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:56.880]   the CEO on the show of Fort.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:59.280]   He came from Boeing where he had designed
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:02.160]   the 777 cockpit, he's an expert in avionics
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.840]   and one of the things he's, I asked him,
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.800]   he said, "Why are we gonna get a car that drives itself?"
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:07.360]   He said, "Never."
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.360]   Now I don't think that's true
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.680]   but I think that's their position right now is,
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:13.240]   look, we're not designing cars that drives themselves.
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:14.920]   That scares people, but we are doing
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.680]   what we did in the Boeing cockpicks.
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:18.200]   You still have a pilot,
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:21.480]   but what we're doing is we are helping the driver
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:24.040]   be a better driver by giving them the kind of information
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.160]   they need to be a better driver.
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:28.480]   Same thing we did on the Boeing cockpicks.
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.920]   We give them the information,
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:31.680]   but ultimately it's the human in control.
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.520]   And that's what's so cool.
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.440]   - Can you ask him to hurry up
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.320]   and make the jet car already?
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:38.840]   - I keep saying that.
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.600]   I said, when we had, somebody actually,
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:44.080]   I was at an event with Alan at dinner at CES last year
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:45.280]   and somebody did ask him that,
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.320]   "When are we getting flying cars?"
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.920]   And he said, "No."
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.640]   He said, "Are you kidding me?
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.720]   Think about it, really, seriously.
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:55.400]   Do you want flying cars?
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:56.240]   Do you really?"
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:58.120]   (laughing)
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.040]   If they had blind spot protection.
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:02.880]   - Maybe you get all this autonomy in there, maybe,
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:03.720]   but I'm telling you,
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.360]   you don't want the kind of people you see on the road today
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.080]   flying.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:09.400]   - Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.400]   - That's not a good idea.
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.840]   You do want to take a look at the amazing stuff
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:17.440]   in the 2013 Ford Fusion and the 2013 Ford Taurus.
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.800]   These are available technologies,
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.320]   the Bliss with Cross Traffic Alert,
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.640]   the Active Park Assist.
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:22.480]   In all seriousness,
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.600]   I'm gonna be spending some time
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.360]   at the Ford booth at CES,
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:29.080]   talking to their CTO, Paul Muscarranis,
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:30.800]   talking to some of the amazing Prasad
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:33.280]   who's opened the Silicon Valley Ford office
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.680]   where they're getting developers to write software
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:37.840]   for the API and Ford vehicles.
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:39.080]   It's amazing what they're doing.
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:41.640]   They're really seeing the automobile
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:44.640]   as a platform for technological advancement.
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:45.920]   It's very exciting.
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:47.200]   I know you guys,
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:51.600]   I know you're Brooklyn hipsters, Maryland hipsters.
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.440]   - Some of us.
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:53.640]   - Wherever you are.
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.480]   - If I can just comment,
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:56.320]   I feel like--
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:57.640]   (laughing)
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:58.640]   - I'm gonna repeat this.
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:43:59.960]   But go ahead.
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:02.880]   - The 1967 Ford F250
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.720]   was a perfect motor vehicle.
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:05.560]   - Yes.
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:07.200]   - And they never should have changed the design at all.
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.280]   They should still be making it come.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.680]   - I drive a 2010 Mustang and I have to say I agree.
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:16.360]   I love the big iron and eight cylinder engine.
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:18.760]   It's just power, it's wonderful.
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:20.600]   But I also admire what Ford's doing,
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.880]   which is taking all that great technology
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:26.040]   that engine, the drive train,
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.720]   real American cars and then adding technology
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:30.600]   to make them smarter, better, more exciting.
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:32.360]   And I think that's a perfect melding.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:35.520]   I want you to go to Ford.com/technology, check it out.
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:38.920]   And also go to a Ford dealer near you.
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:42.080]   You'll go further in Ford.
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:44.520]   I don't know, you think they'll pay us for that ad?
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.920]   (laughing)
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:47.760]   - Hi boy.
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:48.600]   - Did you buy it?
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.440]   - I'll buy it.
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.280]   - That was fun.
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:51.120]   How much you want?
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:51.960]   - Yeah.
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:52.800]   - I'm not kidding.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.400]   You hipsters, you go, no, no, I'm gonna drive a SOB,
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:58.120]   I'm gonna drive a Subaru.
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:00.200]   (laughing)
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.040]   Uh oh, uh oh.
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:02.160]   So here's the car.
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.480]   That's John Roddry, car.
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:04.920]   - That's not gonna be a better engine on either side.
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:06.000]   He parked the car.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   (laughing)
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.040]   - How many back and forth is that now?
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:14.000]   - You can't get it out, can you?
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.160]   - How did he get it in?
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:19.440]   - He literally muscled the cars out of the way.
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:20.920]   There's the Ford parking assist,
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:23.480]   and I'll let you say like I would like to touch
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:24.920]   each one of these cars as I am.
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:27.080]   - No, it won't let you do that,
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:28.280]   it won't let you touch the car.
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:30.160]   - Yeah, see in Brooklyn that's how we do it.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:33.040]   This is a standard parking situation.
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:33.880]   - Look at this.
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:36.840]   - Look there should be some music or something.
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:40.240]   - How many back and forth did it take you, Jonathan?
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.800]   - Yeah, this is where I almost got it.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.720]   - I didn't count, but it really took me about four minutes
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.280]   to get out of the space.
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:49.720]   - And John, is it your, Paul, is it your feeling
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:52.520]   like this is some sort of test of--
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.680]   - And then you place numbers.
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:58.320]   - No, but when I parked that car initially,
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.920]   I didn't put-- - That's so close.
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:03.160]   (laughing)
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:08.200]   - Almost there, almost there, here we go.
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.200]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:13.280]   - Yeah, nice job, nice job.
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:14.840]   (car horn honking)
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:15.680]   Yeah!
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:16.840]   (laughing)
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.280]   Rock and roll!
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:19.840]   - Chad, you're a genius.
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:20.680]   - I love it.
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:23.480]   (car horn honking)
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:24.560]   - Yeah!
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.520]   - I know, you guys are all musicians.
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:30.000]   I'm hanging out with like these hip, cool musicians.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.680]   I'm just some old fart from some small town in California,
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:34.960]   but I got a horn.
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:36.800]   - And you can buy and sell the lot of us.
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:39.560]   (car horn honking)
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:41.160]   - I'm not afraid to blow it.
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:43.280]   - And for the record Leo, we're not really hanging out.
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:44.560]   I mean, it's, you know.
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:45.560]   - No, I'm not.
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:48.240]   I'm not with you now, I understand.
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.960]   You're putting up with me, I understand.
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:51.680]   No, I can understand that.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:55.440]   You don't wanna be tarnished by him.
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.840]   - Oh boy, the holiday blues are hitting hard all of a sudden.
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:58.680]   - Wow.
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:00.400]   (sighing)
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.240]   - Yeah.
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:03.440]   - It's all that marshmallow and brandy.
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:06.480]   - It's a bad combination, Paul, I gotta tell you.
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:08.360]   - It brings the sadness on.
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:09.840]   - It brings on the sadness.
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:12.320]   Sometimes I get in a fight, but mostly I just cry.
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:14.720]   - I was skeptical, but looking at that glass,
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:18.200]   there is decidedly fewer and smaller marshmallows in it.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.600]   - No, it's working.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.240]   But it's not working as well as it did the first time.
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:23.480]   It really, it just dissolved.
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:25.720]   - It's not like actively smoking now or anything.
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:26.560]   - No, no.
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:30.440]   - And I think, really, we have reached marshmallows saturation.
[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:31.280]   - Yeah.
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:34.080]   - The problem was, we were expecting marshmallow Leo.
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:37.760]   - What's going to say?
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.160]   - Well, it's going to say we were expecting it to be like
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.600]   the end of Terminator 2 when, you know,
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.880]   he goes into the mix and it's all gooey
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:45.440]   and it just didn't play out that way.
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:48.160]   So I think it was just, the expectations were too high.
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:51.800]   I probably, I probably, you know, oversold it.
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:52.840]   I am sorry.
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:54.360]   I just didn't expect that.
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.840]   I thought, 'cause you put marshmallows in hot chocolate
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:58.080]   and they'll sit there and they're floating.
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:47:59.800]   You can, you know, they last for a while.
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:01.760]   And I thought that that was my expectation.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.000]   And then it turns out in Brandy.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:03.960]   - They were gone.
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:06.080]   - They don't last a long time.
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:06.920]   - Yeah.
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:08.760]   - You know what would cure those holiday blues, Leo?
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:09.920]   - What would that be?
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:14.000]   - Perhaps a web series musical,
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.760]   such as one that is coming out soon by Paul in Storm
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:18.040]   that I would love to plug right now.
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:20.000]   - All right, please do go right ahead.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.960]   Anything a Yale man says I'm interested in.
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.920]   (laughing)
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:27.200]   - And it has blind spot protection.
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:28.600]   (laughing)
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:31.760]   - Does it have, does it have blind spot protection or serious?
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:32.600]   - It does.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:33.600]   - It has parking assist.
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:35.200]   (laughing)
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:36.040]   - What is this?
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:37.360]   Is this a new project for you guys?
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.360]   - This is a new project for you.
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:39.840]   - Is this a new project for you, Paul?
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:40.680]   - What's that?
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:42.040]   - Yes, I'm talking about learning town.
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:43.040]   - Learn town?
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:43.880]   - Yeah, but this is a new project.
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:44.800]   - Oh, that doesn't sound good.
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:46.200]   That sounds educational.
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:48.640]   - All the people in an position for talking about it.
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:49.480]   - What is it?
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:50.320]   - What is it?
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:51.880]   It's all anybody talks about now.
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:53.880]   (laughing)
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:56.040]   - Just finished filming a web series
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:58.000]   that comes out on January 15th.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.520]   The series is called Learning Town.
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:03.160]   And it's coming out on the Geek and Sundry YouTube channel,
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:05.080]   which is Felicia Day's YouTube channel.
[00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:06.840]   - Oh, you're spending some of that YouTube money.
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:08.840]   Spend a similar year with YouTube money.
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:09.800]   - It's been some Google money.
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.080]   We filmed it there,
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:14.280]   they're brand new studio space.
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:15.360]   - In LA?
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:16.200]   - Yeah, they just opened up in LA.
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.960]   - You went to their, the LA space and you filmed that?
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.720]   - Yeah, we filmed before they even opened.
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:23.760]   We got to Chris in the studio, it was pretty great.
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:26.120]   - I understand they have like state of the art,
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:29.480]   green screen and they don't have any Armenian brandy.
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:30.840]   - They had no Armenian brandy.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:32.680]   - But they have everything else that you could ask for.
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:33.680]   - It was pretty great, yeah.
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:38.120]   But it's a musical, it's 10 episodes.
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:42.000]   It's about a comedy music duo named Paul and Storm,
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   who take over.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   - Oh, so it's like Flight of the Conquards.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:45.840]   - Oh, come on.
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:46.680]   - Hold it.
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:49.880]   - But then we take over an old timey,
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:52.560]   kill children's, kill, kill.
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:53.400]   - Kill, kill, kill.
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:54.400]   - Sorry, I'm thinking of it.
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.920]   - Is it a real factory?
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:57.600]   'Cause I would love that.
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:58.960]   - Now they take over a children's show.
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:49:59.800]   There we go.
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:00.640]   - It's our store.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:02.280]   - You ever wear Paul and Storm.
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:04.640]   - We have a brand new web series called Learning 10.
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:06.920]   - Yeah, but we blew all our budget on the title graphics.
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:08.400]   That's why we're in this empty room.
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:11.080]   - So without any further ado, roll with the title.
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:14.840]   - Learning 10.
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:16.280]   - That's Comic Sans.
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:17.560]   Comic Sans.
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:18.400]   Stop it.
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:19.600]   Comic Sans, you are.
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.120]   (laughing)
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:22.760]   - Paul and Storm.
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:23.760]   Paul and Storm.
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.760]   (laughing)
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:27.200]   - That's good.
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:28.960]   That makes me wanna watch it.
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:32.000]   - So it's this duo they take over a long running children's show
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.720]   after the original host dies
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:36.280]   and they're completely incompetent at it.
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:37.200]   - That sounds good.
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.200]   That sounds good.
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:39.400]   - We're very excited about it.
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:40.240]   It's a lot of fun.
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:43.480]   John Roderick thinks it's awesome.
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:44.320]   - Yeah, I do.
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:46.840]   Paul and Storm are very, very talented young men
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:49.200]   and I support all their endeavors.
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:51.240]   - I have to say, I've read some of the script
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:54.280]   and I've heard some of the songs and it's the kind of thing
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:56.760]   that I'm so happy to see Paul and Storm doing
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:58.520]   'cause it's the kind of thing they were born to do.
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:50:59.960]   I'm very excited to see the film product.
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:01.760]   - Is it like a children's show
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:04.280]   but it kind of got grown up a little bit or what?
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:05.120]   I mean.
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:07.480]   - Yeah, we say it's not for kids.
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:08.680]   - Yeah.
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:11.000]   - So you can show it's the show within a show.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.160]   - So it's like when the drunk cigarette.
[00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:15.400]   (laughing)
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:17.400]   - Okay, that's where I was going.
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:20.320]   But okay, Paul just got an illustrated
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:22.160]   graphic fashion.
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:24.880]   - Yeah, it's all about puppets having sex.
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:26.240]   - That's awesome.
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:27.680]   - Yeah, I mean, it's really, it's about the people
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:30.480]   behind the scenes trying to keep the burning
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:32.040]   Viking ship afloat.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.400]   - So that's cool.
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:36.520]   So did Felicia Day call you to get involved with that?
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:38.480]   - She called us personally.
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:39.480]   - That's neat.
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:40.320]   - She begged you, right?
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:41.440]   Didn't she beg you?
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:42.280]   - I believe.
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:44.160]   - Wasn't she on her hands and knees
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:46.040]   in some sort of skimpy outfit begging you?
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:48.160]   - That's a strong word.
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:50.720]   - That's just your fantasy there.
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:52.880]   So now you met her probably in the,
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:55.800]   was it the geeka-palooza thing that you did?
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:57.000]   - No, we actually met her.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.240]   We kind of stalked her over Twitter.
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:00.080]   - Okay.
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:03.320]   - In a only semi-creepy fashion.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:07.040]   When we first started our podcast some time ago,
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:10.040]   one of our little goals that we set was that we wanted
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:11.880]   Felicia Day to notice us.
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:14.480]   Without our actively trying to make it.
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:15.800]   We could easily just, you know,
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:18.360]   bug her over and over on Twitter or something.
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:20.560]   But no, we just wanted it to happen sort of organically.
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:22.120]   And it took a few months,
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:24.080]   but she finally acknowledged our existence
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:25.720]   and we celebrate that day.
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:28.080]   - Instead of bugging her on Twitter,
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:30.880]   we started a podcast so we can get people
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:32.560]   to bug her on our behalf.
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:33.400]   - Exactly.
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:36.360]   - So, but she was part of Woodstock.
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:37.840]   She showed up at Woodstock, right?
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:39.080]   - She has been, she has appeared
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:40.040]   in a couple of Woodstocks.
[00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:43.520]   She has been along with every other nerd celebrity.
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:45.280]   - Right, Will Wheaton.
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:46.120]   - Yeah.
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:46.960]   - That's everybody.
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:48.800]   (laughing)
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.080]   - John, Jonathan Colton appeared at one.
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:51.920]   John Roderick has been in one.
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:55.400]   - I've never been asked to or participated
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:56.240]   in any Woodstock.
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:57.080]   - For some?
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:58.480]   Oh, you know what?
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:52:59.800]   - We have to change that.
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:00.640]   - That cannot be true.
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:03.160]   - We had some Leo in Woodstock and for sure.
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:04.440]   - But see, I don't have a talent.
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:05.640]   So it's important.
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:07.320]   I think they want to have a talent.
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:09.040]   - You can be like a ghost.
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:10.160]   - Go ahead, Stark.
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:13.240]   - That's the beautiful thing is we actually look
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:17.880]   for people who do things that are unexpectedly talented.
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:18.720]   So--
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:20.840]   - I could set whiskey on fire.
[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:21.680]   - There you go.
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:22.520]   - That's what I'm talking about.
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:23.360]   - That's awesome.
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:24.640]   - So remember the hip-hop group
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:26.000]   from the '90s arrested development?
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:26.840]   - Yeah.
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:27.680]   - They were the old guy that just sat
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:28.840]   in the sort of throne.
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:29.680]   - That's me.
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:30.640]   - And it was wise.
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:31.480]   That's you.
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:32.300]   - Yeah.
[00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:33.140]   - That's Leo.
[00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:34.040]   - His name was Mr. Wendell.
[00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:34.880]   - Yes.
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:35.720]   - It wasn't now.
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:36.560]   - No, no.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:38.160]   (laughing)
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.000]   - I'm wrong.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.720]   - That's about all I'm capable of now
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:42.880]   is just kind of sitting there.
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:44.360]   - You just sit there in the chair
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:47.080]   and drink and look regretful.
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:47.920]   - Yeah.
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:48.760]   - That'd be great.
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:49.600]   It's had a great tone.
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:51.240]   (laughing)
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:53.160]   - It's more what's the worst thing, though.
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:55.000]   (laughing)
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.600]   - Are you done with Woodstock?
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:57.640]   Are you gonna do some more?
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:58.960]   - No, we still do them.
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:03.080]   We got one coming up very soon.
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:04.600]   I think we're like a day away
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:06.200]   from being able to officially announce it,
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:09.200]   but we have one coming up in the Pacific Northwest
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:13.080]   and we should be back at Comic-Con,
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:14.920]   San Diego Comic-Con this summer.
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:15.920]   That's pretty much the only way
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:18.360]   we know everybody's gonna be in the same place
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:20.520]   and has a night free anymore is at Comic-Con.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:23.520]   It's tough to make 'em happen anywhere else.
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:24.520]   - You'll have to forgive me,
[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:28.040]   but I just, I don't feel a part akin
[00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:29.680]   with the young people today
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:31.800]   and they're kind of the geek culture thing.
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:33.840]   I don't understand that.
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:34.680]   - Well, we're not.
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:35.520]   - Have you not?
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:37.960]   - Have you ever masturbated to a comic book?
[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:38.800]   - No.
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:40.640]   (laughing)
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:41.480]   - No.
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:42.600]   - Well, I can't help you then.
[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:43.440]   - How about it?
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:44.280]   - Yeah, that's it.
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:45.520]   - I think there's a great divide
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:47.840]   between those who have and those who haven't
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:49.200]   and I'm on the other.
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:50.200]   - That's very interesting, Leo.
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:53.080]   You don't see yourself as a part of geek culture
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:57.240]   'cause I think of you as kind of a proto geek icon.
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:58.640]   I remember watching. - Well, that's it, maybe.
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:54:59.480]   - It's green sabers.
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:02.480]   - I was before there was geek culture.
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:05.480]   I was there and I was kind of the midden
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:07.200]   the fertilizer.
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:09.680]   - For the Rosa Parks of geek culture, Leo.
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:10.720]   - Yeah, that's it.
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:11.640]   That's exactly it.
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:14.400]   I made sure that geeks could ride in the back of the bus.
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:15.480]   (laughing)
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:16.320]   - That's fine.
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:18.200]   Well, whatever part of the bus you want.
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:19.640]   No, I don't, it's funny.
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:20.480]   I just don't--
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:21.480]   - You nailed it.
[00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:23.000]   (laughing)
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.040]   - I just don't feel, I don't understand it
[00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:26.000]   to be honest with you.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.200]   I don't get that.
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.040]   - I don't--
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.160]   - Well, what do you mean you don't understand it?
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:32.120]   This is interesting to me.
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:32.960]   What do you mean?
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:33.800]   - Yeah.
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:35.040]   - It's a whole thing.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.680]   Well, did you see The Simpsons this week
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:38.560]   was all about the hipsters?
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:41.480]   And they had left Seattle 'cause it was played out.
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:44.240]   There were restaurants with two branches there.
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:46.120]   And I'm not going to my kids anywhere near that.
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:47.920]   And they came to Springfield, Missouri,
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:48.720]   and they were hipsters.
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:51.120]   They were into, you know, she had a master's degree
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:52.960]   in mid-century kitchen culture.
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:56.600]   And I just felt like, you know, they had wallets attached.
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:58.320]   Are you guys, do you attach your wallets
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:55:59.680]   with chains to your pockets?
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:00.520]   - No.
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:01.360]   - I used to.
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:03.640]   - You used to it a long time ago, but that's really--
[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:05.160]   - We're now pretty 2002.
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:06.480]   - It's played out.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:08.720]   You've moved on. - Like, sure.
[00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:11.800]   - So, see, to me, I just don't, it's like, what?
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:16.800]   - Well, I do think that geek culture had a rise to power.
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:20.480]   And now, is in the process of becoming
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:24.000]   played out in that way.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:24.840]   I mean, I think it's--
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:25.680]   - It's mainstream, man.
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:26.680]   This is no good.
[00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:27.680]   This is what happened. - Yeah, exactly right.
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:28.760]   It's mainstream.
[00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:31.360]   And now it's like, it's not--
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:32.200]   - It's confusing.
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:34.920]   - It was like, now, see, I'm a child in the '60s,
[00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:38.320]   when flower power turned into stretch pants at Kmart's
[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:41.440]   with big daisies on it, it was like it would have become
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:44.120]   pop culture, it had become mass culture,
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:45.760]   and it was no longer cool.
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:48.600]   - Yeah, there are many aspects of niche culture
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:51.000]   that are becoming mass culture, and it's like, you know,
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.640]   all these niches have become--
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:53.480]   - What's the next--
[00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:54.480]   - They're collected by the thing.
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:56.080]   What's the next thing?
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:57.440]   - Mummy's. - It's a prop.
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:59.280]   - I can't think of anything.
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:01.720]   (laughing)
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:03.280]   - I would say it's web series.
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:04.640]   It's gonna be web series.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:06.800]   - It's not like zombies.
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:09.040]   It's not even-- - It's showing web series.
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:09.880]   - It's me.
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:11.400]   I am the next big thing.
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:12.560]   - I think you are, Paul.
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:13.480]   - It's gonna look like--
[00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:15.040]   - 'Cause I've never heard of you,
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:18.480]   so I think that that's what makes it figures.
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:22.160]   - I think that makes it key.
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:24.000]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.680]   - It's gonna be interesting to see what happens
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:27.240]   over the next 10 years.
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:29.600]   I mean, you think about where what geek culture
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:31.280]   was like 10 years ago,
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:32.240]   and the way it is now,
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:35.920]   and it's been a very fast and wild journey
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:36.840]   from there to here.
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:39.240]   So what are the loadstones of geek culture?
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:41.200]   This comic books is obviously one.
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:44.720]   - Gaming, I would say gaming is a big part of it.
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:45.560]   - Gaming, gaming.
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:48.400]   But now even gaming is very divided
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:49.640]   into different segments.
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:53.400]   You have people who are Mario, like Mario's all,
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:55.280]   it's all, they're all about Mario or Zelda.
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:56.960]   That's the Nintendo group.
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:57.800]   - Right.
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:57:58.960]   - And then there's the modern group,
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:57:59.960]   the Call of Duty group.
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:01.120]   That's a very different group.
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:02.160]   Those two don't.
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:05.040]   - There's also the people who do tabletop gaming.
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:06.920]   Like they're all these different subsets.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:07.760]   - Oh my god.
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:09.560]   - That's really out of control.
[00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:12.640]   And they have a 10-sided dice, and they do that.
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:13.480]   - Yeah.
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:14.320]   - Yeah.
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:15.160]   - Did you ever play Dungeon of the Dragons, Leo?
[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:17.080]   - I didn't, you know, and I kind of,
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:19.080]   I don't know why, 'cause that sounds like something
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:19.920]   I don't know why.
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:20.760]   - I didn't either.
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:21.760]   I had the same thing, it just never came up somehow.
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:22.800]   - I played chess.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:23.640]   It's a...
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:25.360]   - I didn't have.
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:26.520]   - Yeah.
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:29.520]   - Did you read Lord of the Rings back in the '60s '70s?
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:32.080]   - Oh yeah, I masturbated to Frodo Baggins.
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:34.240]   (laughing)
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:35.960]   - Oh, who did so this?
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:39.000]   - So this is a big weekend for you then, Leo, isn't it?
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:39.840]   - It is actually.
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:42.400]   - And you say, you don't understand geek culture.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:45.120]   You have masturbated to Frodo Baggins.
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:47.760]   - Now, actually, I did play a lot of risk.
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:49.080]   So somebody's mentioned risk.
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:50.840]   I did, see, I think it's a different,
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:53.960]   I'm in a different era, really, a different generation.
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:55.120]   And I'm starting to-- - I'm the same thing.
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:56.840]   - I didn't used to feel old,
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:59.720]   but I'm starting to see a generational rift.
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:00.560]   - Yeah.
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:02.360]   - I hear you.
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:03.200]   - I think that's true.
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:04.920]   - And you're getting old enough, you're not old yet,
[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:05.800]   but you're getting old enough,
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:09.480]   you're probably starting to see the outline of that.
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:12.720]   - Oh yeah, like you see people on some social sites
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:15.400]   that are nostalgic about Pokemon,
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:18.520]   which I get it, that's been out since early '90s,
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:20.880]   but to me, that's something, yeah,
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:23.160]   that's like that happened like two weeks ago,
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:25.160]   to be nostalgic about that.
[00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:27.960]   But even though this specifics change,
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:31.280]   sort of that vibe remains the same.
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:34.640]   So even though, yeah, geek culture is like very big
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:37.240]   in the public eye, big bang theory and all that,
[00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:39.720]   there's always something underneath that will pop out later,
[00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:42.080]   the thing that everyone's making fun of now
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:44.560]   that five or 10 years from now will become the thing
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:47.200]   that's like, "Oh, wow, we never appreciated it."
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:49.800]   Now, it's safe to talk about that again.
[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:51.520]   - Well, isn't Big Bang Theory, though,
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:52.680]   really the end game?
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:54.520]   I mean, isn't that when you know it's over?
[00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:58.520]   Because it's now on national network television.
[00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.240]   And in fact, I think in many ways,
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.520]   it's kind of disrespectful.
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:04.640]   It's kind of like, oh, it's kind of pigeonholing geeks
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:07.440]   in a certain way that I find offensive.
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.280]   - Maybe.
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.600]   - Yeah, I mean, I think it's--
[01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:12.400]   - One thing that characterizes geeks,
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.080]   it's that they take offense at everything.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:14.920]   - Ah!
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:17.360]   - There you go.
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:19.920]   - Now, John Roderick is another one who,
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:24.360]   I think that he, I've heard him say,
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:26.920]   "I'm not a geek, I'm a dork."
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:28.920]   That's the thing that you were before there was a geek.
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:31.280]   - I agree with that, actually.
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.200]   - Yeah, it makes sense.
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:33.640]   And I think-- - It's pretty obvious.
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:35.760]   - Geek has become this--
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:38.720]   (both laughing)
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:41.680]   It's become a flag that you wave
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.960]   on top of the stuff that you just like
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:46.200]   because you like it, you know?
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:50.000]   And Star Wars, like, you know,
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.080]   Pawn Storm's album title, "Do You Like Star Wars?"
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:55.960]   The reason that joke is funny is like,
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.800]   of course you like Star, like everybody likes Star Wars.
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:59.440]   - I hate Star Wars.
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:01.880]   - No, I hate Star Wars.
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:02.720]   - Do you hate Star Wars?
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:03.720]   - It's terrible.
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:05.440]   - Stemmerstern, you hate Star Wars.
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:06.840]   - Yeah, it's terrible.
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:10.720]   - Now you're just being argumentative, hate to strike.
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:12.840]   - No, in fact, it's unfortunately,
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:15.440]   I feel like I cannot express myself about this
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:18.160]   because I will become a pariah with--
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.360]   - Right, 'cause now all the geeks
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:20.200]   are gonna jump on you, right?
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:23.800]   - But it's terrible, it's badly plotted, it's stupid.
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:25.400]   It makes no sense. - Wow.
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:26.760]   - It's just crap.
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.840]   George Lucas is a hack.
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:29.760]   - Wow.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:31.280]   - Wow. - Are you a fan
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:32.880]   of other science fiction franchises?
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.360]   - I love science fiction.
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:36.480]   I have to say, I've never been a fan of science fiction
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:39.000]   on the big screen because I feel like it does not,
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.640]   it's too hard to make science fiction well
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:43.280]   and it makes it real.
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:46.560]   And in the books, it's really vivid because it's,
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:49.200]   you know, you couldn't make Ringworld
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:52.280]   into a credible movie because it's too big,
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:54.280]   it's too elaborate, it's too difficult.
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:57.200]   And go to the rings, I mean, it was a great--
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:59.760]   - You masturbated to Harlan Ellison, though.
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:01.800]   - I did, that was my problem.
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:05.040]   Actually, you know who was really sexy
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:09.160]   and it was Robert Heinlein.
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.160]   But that's mostly 'cause he thought women
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.800]   were just objects for fun.
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:14.800]   - Right, that's sexy. - Sure.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:15.640]   - That's very sexy.
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:16.480]   - You know.
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:18.840]   (laughing)
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:20.440]   Don't tell our wives.
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:21.880]   - Clear space.
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.480]   - Let me take a break right now.
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:26.520]   (laughing)
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.800]   You know what's sexy to me?
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.760]   The idea that-- - I'm exactly out.
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:33.480]   This show is going in a good direction.
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:35.280]   - I actually wanna talk to you a little more
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:36.320]   about this topic 'cause actually,
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:37.720]   I think this is an interesting talk.
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:40.360]   Yeah, drink some, drink some yager.
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:41.320]   I wanna talk more about this.
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:43.760]   But first, a word from stamps.com.
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.720]   This is sexy, printing your own US postage
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:47.920]   from your computer and printer.
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:49.560]   Now that-- - Oh, yeah!
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:52.280]   (laughing)
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:55.480]   - That's a party, waiting to happen.
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:56.320]   - You print that postage.
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:57.800]   You print that postage.
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.440]   - You print that stamp on that envelope.
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.280]   - You print that postage.
[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.000]   - No party like a postage printing party
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.200]   'cause a postage printing party's got--
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:05.440]   - Postage. - Stamps.
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:07.280]   - Stamps. - That stamp.
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:09.160]   - Lick that stamp. - Well, and that's one
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.080]   of the things that's different
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:11.840]   because you don't have to lick it and stick it anymore
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:14.040]   because stamps.com, you print it out.
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.680]   - Yeah, you just put it on.
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:17.440]   - You print it out.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:20.000]   - You print it, but--
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.360]   - I think a lot of people think
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:23.720]   that it's all about stamps, but that's just the name.
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:26.280]   It's not, it's about you could print on the envelope.
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:27.240]   You could print your logo,
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.920]   you could have a little paw on the storm right there
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:30.040]   on the logo on the--
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:33.200]   - Oh, lick that envelope, lick that whole envelope.
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:35.520]   - Oh yeah, print that logo.
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:36.880]   - Yeah.
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.640]   Oh, you like that logo.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:41.440]   You like that logo, don't you?
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.080]   Oh, who's a naughty logo?
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:44.720]   Oh, look at you.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.120]   (laughing)
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:47.720]   You gotta put something in the envelope?
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:49.640]   Oh, you're gonna seal it?
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.200]   (laughing)
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.840]   - Wait a minute, did you, okay,
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:56.240]   you guys must do fulfillment on your CDs, right?
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.240]   - Sure.
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:01.040]   - Are you going to the post office and buying stamps?
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.360]   - All the time.
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:03.840]   - What are you, just one of the time?
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.120]   - Oh, worst.
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.200]   - Okay, I bet you guys have what's called a Pitney's Bose
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.360]   postage meter.
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:11.720]   - Get that, what?
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:13.000]   - I know what you speak.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:13.800]   - I know the exact stuff.
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:14.800]   - You don't want that.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.560]   You gotta lease it, you gotta pay,
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:18.200]   it's got special ink.
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:19.760]   You don't need that.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:20.600]   (laughing)
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:23.800]   Your computer and your computer can print all everything you need.
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:25.680]   All the fulfillment, if you're selling,
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:28.440]   maybe you're taking PayPal payments or Amazon,
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.200]   maybe you're doing, you're not doing Etsy.
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:31.840]   Do you guys do crafts of any kind?
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:36.840]   - Oh yeah, I make, I make dioramas out of noodles.
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:39.400]   - Perfect example.
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:40.400]   - I need to-- - No rubs.
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:42.360]   - The last thing you wanna do is spend time
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:44.360]   doing the mailing, you wanna focus
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:45.920]   on what really counts.
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.640]   Dioramas of noodles. - Dio's.

[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:51.240]   Free, so you could, now how many CDs
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.200]   would $55 mail out?
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:56.360]   - At least eight hundred, just one I think, right?
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:57.360]   - They're really good ones.
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:58.560]   - They're really heavy. - Very large CDs.
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:00.840]   - So you need a scale, Jonathan, because no--
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:02.520]   - Yeah, maybe I'm doing it wrong, I don't know.
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.160]   - I think you're doing it wrong.
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.800]   You need the scale.
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:08.000]   - I should put $55 on it, 'cause I don't want it
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.480]   to get sent back, so I put extra--
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:10.960]   - Exactly, have you ever done that?
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.240]   You put three extra stamps,
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:13.320]   'cause you don't wanna get it back?
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:14.560]   - Sure, all the time.
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:16.360]   - Stamps.com, that's, I'm just telling--
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:18.920]   - You know, Leo, when I was an undergraduate
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:20.760]   at Yale University, I--
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:21.600]   - You lie, you lie.
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:24.880]   - Many was the time I would sit around with my fellow Ellie.
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:27.280]   (laughing)
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:29.480]   - Just Eli, no lie.
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.240]   - No, I believe we call ourselves Ellie.
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:32.080]   - Eli's.
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:34.160]   (laughing)
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:35.000]   - Eli's.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.600]   - We said one day, we will all have a personal computer,
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:40.640]   and we will use that personal computer
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:43.080]   to print out postage in our very own homes.
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:44.920]   - That's exactly right, that's the future.
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:47.080]   It's now, it's happening at Stamps.com.
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:49.080]   Hey, let me ask you guys, you guys are young enough.
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:51.680]   You all had computers at college, didn't you?
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:53.200]   - I bought it at a computer.
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:57.640]   - Couple of years in, I had a Mac SE.
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:58.720]   - Wow.
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:06:59.560]   - Oh.
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:02.520]   - I had a typewriter, not an electric,
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:05.960]   a manual typewriter, that's how I wrote my papers at Yale.
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:06.800]   - Did you type them off?
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:07.960]   - On a box.
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:09.160]   - On a box?
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:10.320]   - On rocks.
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:13.400]   - No, no, you took it on paper, we had paper.
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:15.080]   It wasn't that long ago.
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:17.560]   - And you carried it uphill both ways to install.
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.560]   - No, we had paper.
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:22.680]   Although in the basement of my dorm at Derphi Hall
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:25.680]   on the old campus, they had a plaque that said
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:29.480]   "Rackety X Co-X Co-X" which was the Yale Cheer
[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:31.480]   from "Aero Stoffen's the Frog."
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:33.880]   I bet you didn't know that, Paul.
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:36.680]   - Oh, you must be referring to Paul Roderick
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:39.160]   who the United Champion, he was great.
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:41.520]   (laughing)
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:43.520]   - He doesn't ask anything.
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.680]   - Where did Hodgman go?
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:46.080]   What happened to Hodgman?
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:49.640]   - Yeah, oh, now we're realizing what trouble is going on.
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:51.600]   - No, actually, I'm actually thrilled to have Paul Roderick
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.520]   'cause Hodgman's played out.
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:54.560]   - Yeah.
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:57.320]   - Paul Roderick is the new, Paul Roderick is the new genre.
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:59.820]   (baby crying)
[01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:02.760]   - Make him a baby cry, Leo.
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:05.520]   - It wouldn't be Twitter if we didn't make a baby cry.
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:06.360]   - That's true.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:09.720]   It's kind of the secret to the whole thing.
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:12.640]   So you had a computer late in the last couple of years.
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:13.480]   How about you?
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:16.800]   - I did, I remember I had, I took a computer science class
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:21.280]   and so I got an electronic mail account.
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:22.120]   - Wow.
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:25.720]   - It was a new thing and I remember I would send emails
[01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:29.120]   to my friends in the class and say things like,
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:31.880]   "I hope you've enjoyed my electronic mail."
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:33.400]   We all thought it was a big joke.
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:34.400]   (laughing)
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:35.960]   - It was Yale.edu.
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:39.160]   It was actually still having a Yale.edu address
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:41.400]   but we didn't have them when I was in school.
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:42.240]   - Right.
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:43.080]   - They gave them to alumni later.
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:45.280]   That's kind of cool to have,
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:49.040]   Yale was very early on into email and technology
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:51.960]   and getting involved in this but not in my time, no.
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:55.480]   - No, it was exciting to be there when it was just starting
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:57.800]   though, it was just 'cause it was still like such a crazy idea.
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:01.400]   - You were there in the 80s or 90s, 90s.
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:03.320]   - I graduated in '89.
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:04.160]   - '89.
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:05.000]   - And the 80s, yeah.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:05.840]   - I got Paul in 2004.
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.520]   - No, sorry, '93 was college, sorry.
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:08.360]   (laughing)
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:10.200]   - '93, he's thinking high school.
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:11.040]   - I forget.
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.520]   - '93, what about you, Paul?
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:13.760]   What is it?
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:18.760]   - I bought a 286 in my senior year of high school.
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:21.440]   - And you brought that to me.
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:22.920]   - Wow.
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:25.560]   - And then I upgraded to a 386 part way through college
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.360]   because I wanted to play Wing Commander.
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:29.560]   - Wing Commander, great game.
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:33.400]   - I lost most of the fall semester of what was it, '89?
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:34.720]   When was it that came out?
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:36.280]   - I think it was fall of '89, I think.
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:39.520]   I lost most of that semester to playing Wing Commander.
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:40.360]   - That's awesome.
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:41.400]   That was a fun game.
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:43.160]   It was a lot of CDs.
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.880]   - It was, it was like 800 cabillion.
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.040]   It was floppies back then.
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:46.880]   It was a floppies.
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:47.720]   - It was floppies?
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:49.920]   - 10 or 12 floppies, the first couple copies were, yeah.
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:50.760]   - Wow.
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:53.320]   - I think like, Wing Commander 3, I think was the first game
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:54.400]   certainly I ever owned.
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.600]   I think it was Wing Commander 3 on that had CDs
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:58.200]   instead of floppies.
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:09:59.680]   - I feel sorry for kids in college.
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:02.920]   It must be today, it must be so distracting.
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:05.040]   - Thank you.
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:05.880]   - Yeah, it seems they could choose.
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:07.160]   - Sure, a mess.
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:09.680]   - Well, they've got their computers right in their pockets
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:10.840]   with the smartphones.
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:13.520]   Imagine that they're pretty much always connected.
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:16.320]   Which, it seems normal enough to us now,
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:19.080]   but it seemed like you'd lose a lot of that experience.
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:21.640]   Like, back when we were in college,
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:23.920]   I remember going to the computer lab.
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:27.760]   Like I had a Commodore 64, but it didn't quite get the job done.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:28.720]   - Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:31.480]   You brought a Commodore 64 to college?
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:32.320]   (laughing)
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:33.440]   - It didn't last very long.
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.120]   (laughing)
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:37.400]   - You thought it was a real computer?
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.000]   - No, I really didn't.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.120]   - Eventually your roommates,
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:43.240]   your roommates was how old when you brought--
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:46.680]   - I can't stop playing Chisholm Trail, I can't stop.
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:48.920]   (laughing)
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:52.760]   - You didn't have a cassette drive storm?
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:53.920]   (laughing)
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:55.880]   - I didn't have the cassette drive.
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:57.840]   - I did have the cassette drive, yes I did.
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:01.920]   - That's ambitious, that's optimistic.
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.880]   That you're gonna be able to use a Commodore 64
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:06.800]   in any way that would be helpful in college,
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:07.640]   is optimistic.
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:08.640]   (laughing)
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:13.640]   - I had the first PC, I had 64K.
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:15.280]   - Yeah, there you go.
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:19.080]   - I used the word star, the word star program.
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:20.800]   - Dot commands.
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:23.880]   - And I took that to college with me.
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:26.240]   - But you could do word processing with that, I don't know.
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.840]   Could you hand in an all upper case,
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:32.000]   40 character across paper to your professor?
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.360]   - And say, you can do that once.
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:37.840]   (laughing)
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:39.560]   - And not necessarily successfully.
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:45.120]   - I've used a word processor to write this paper.
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:50.120]   - I used a pen to give you an F.
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:56.360]   - I have older kids, my oldest daughter is 15,
[01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:59.640]   and so I'm sort of, in a way,
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:02.920]   I'm on the front lines of watching this newer generation.
[01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:06.080]   I observe them from behind my wall
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:11.080]   of Xbox 360 games and old school technology.
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:14.880]   But it is genuinely fascinating to me to see them.
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:17.680]   I mean, they were literally born with computers
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:18.520]   in front of them.
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:19.360]   - That's right.
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:21.200]   - My oldest daughter figured out how to use a mouse
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:22.240]   before she was two.
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:24.440]   Like she got the concept of I moved this thing,
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:27.400]   and this thing on the screen moves accordingly.
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:28.560]   - What is a mouse?
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:29.560]   What is a mouse?
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:30.400]   - A mouse.
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:31.400]   (laughing)
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:36.400]   But it's cliche how they say this younger generation
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:40.520]   is all wired and multitasking and all of that.
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:44.880]   But it's true, they live on texts and instant messages,
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.920]   and they're fine communicating.
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:48.560]   That's their default method of communication,
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:49.960]   and we can bitch about it all we want.
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:52.120]   But it's the same thing that the older generation said,
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:56.720]   when phones first came in to everyday widespread use,
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:00.280]   I'm sure it's just, it's a different method of interacting.
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:03.680]   I don't necessarily know if it is a worse way of interacting.
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:06.000]   - You know, I'm just trying to make you miss out on things,
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.000]   but you also, it's an evolution of, I don't know,
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.600]   society, I don't know what the hell I'm saying.
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:14.240]   - We didn't even have a phone.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:15.120]   I'm just thinking now,
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:18.240]   we didn't even have a phone in our dorm room.
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.000]   - We would have to go there.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.480]   - You did not have a telephone in your room?
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:23.760]   - I don't think so.
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:24.840]   Maybe we did.
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:27.120]   Maybe you could order a phone from the phone company
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:28.000]   and have it put in your room.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.240]   I guess you could. - Go ahead, extra.
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:32.720]   - From Snetco, Southern New England telephone company.
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:35.920]   - My younger, go ahead, sir.
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:37.840]   - Oh, it's because that's what the fancy kids did,
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:38.680]   that's all.
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:39.520]   - Yeah, it might have been fancy.
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:41.240]   I had a bong.
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:42.240]   - Yeah, sure.
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:43.360]   - And you talked into that.
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:44.200]   - Hello.
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:47.080]   - Was it a network to bong?
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:48.840]   - No, it was not a network.
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:50.480]   - Did you buy it from Ma Bong?
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:52.720]   (laughing)
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:58.000]   But my younger daughter, who is 11,
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.320]   had to sleep over to friend's house
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:00.680]   just a couple of weekends ago.
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:03.360]   And in their basement, her friends,
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:07.520]   that behind their bar had had a wired telephone.
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:09.720]   And she thought that was the funniest thing,
[01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:10.880]   that they had this telephone.
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:11.720]   - Really?
[01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:13.400]   - You could only get about 12 feet away from the basement.
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:14.240]   - Wow.
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:17.160]   - I realized it was the first time she'd ever seen
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:20.880]   a wired telephone in person in her life.
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:25.280]   That made me feel real, real quick.
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:28.160]   - Well, it's kind of one of the things that interests me
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:31.320]   is that we started with this geek culture conversation.
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:34.080]   And what I've noticed is it really is generational,
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:36.480]   that what geek culture to you is,
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:39.760]   is really very specific to, within a couple of years,
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:41.800]   your age cohort.
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:44.840]   And you've seen that with technology in general now,
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:49.080]   that you're, and so it'll make you feel old faster,
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:51.520]   because even within a few years,
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:53.640]   oh, that we weren't into Zelda,
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:56.520]   we were into Galaxian, or I don't know what the hell it is.
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:57.880]   - Yeah, oh, it's true.
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:00.000]   You know, my-- - The real feeling for lack though.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.160]   Go ahead, sir.
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:05.520]   - Oh, sure, just gonna say, they all overlap,
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:07.280]   and some of them are very short.
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:11.480]   Like if you weren't in sixth grade in 1992,
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:12.400]   you wouldn't get this.
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:13.240]   - Right.
[01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:16.440]   - It's like Star Wars that span longer periods of time.
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:18.560]   - Well, but maybe that's why I'm not a Star Wars fan,
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:19.640]   because I was in college.
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:23.240]   I remember waiting in line in 1977 to see Star Wars.
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:26.520]   So I saw it, unlike you guys, I saw as an adult,
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:27.840]   or a close-time adult.
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:28.800]   - That's a big difference.
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:29.720]   - That was 21.
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:32.680]   And so I had a very, it really is a child story.
[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:33.840]   It really is like the way it is.
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:34.680]   - It is, it is.
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:37.160]   - It is, and it's inextricably, you know,
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:39.200]   my own affection for the Star Wars universe.
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:40.960]   I know they're not perfect movies by these stretch,
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:44.800]   but they're definitely, it's tied inextricably with--
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:46.160]   - It's your childhood.
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:47.720]   - My childhood memories, exactly.
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:49.720]   I was right in the wheelhouse for George Lucas.
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:52.080]   I was age 7-14 when those movies--
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:54.000]   - So for me to say, I don't like Star Wars
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.800]   is offensive in the sense that I'm attacking your,
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.640]   something that's at your very core.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:00.800]   - But you're sort of not,
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:04.440]   because we feel the same way about the newer Star Wars movies.
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:05.920]   Like we look at those and say,
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:08.000]   "Oh God, they're a car patrol."
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:08.840]   - "Jar, Jar, Binks."
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:10.640]   Everybody hates Jar Jar.
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:11.640]   - Exactly.
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:13.200]   - Storm and I were just having this conversation
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:15.320]   not long ago where, as Storm was saying,
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:18.720]   like it's a very fine line depending on your age
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:19.880]   and when a thing happens,
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:22.880]   how there is a tremendous affection from a lot of people.
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:27.560]   I've noticed in a number of Reddit comment discussions,
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:30.720]   people of a certain age and younger,
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:32.280]   their love for the movie The Goonies.
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:34.720]   I was just old enough when The Goonies came out
[01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:36.880]   that I thought it was ridiculous and terrible
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:38.800]   and loud and shrill and stupid.
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:41.520]   But then I just turn around and I look at,
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:44.320]   "Will he walk in the Chocolate Factory or Star Wars?"
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.320]   And I really don't have--
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:48.600]   - Or the Elmo Grover Divide.
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:51.520]   Like if you're in a rough one on Sesame Street,
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:52.840]   you loved Grover.
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:55.160]   - And entire families have been decimated
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:56.880]   over the Elmo Grover divide.
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:00.680]   - And for the record, it turns out the Grover camp was right.
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:02.640]   - The Grover camp was right.
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:04.560]   - Isn't that funny?
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:06.680]   And I bet you there's a whole generation of kids
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:08.200]   who will be offended if I said,
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:09.800]   "Jarjar Binks was stupid."
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:11.520]   They say, "What are you talking about?"
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:14.560]   He was the seminal influence in my growing up years.
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:17.040]   This was, "Jarjar was everything to me."
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:19.400]   - I don't know anyone who is pro-jarjar.
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:22.520]   I don't think there's anyone that would just pro-jarjar.
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:23.800]   - He's just so terrible.
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:24.960]   He's just so terrible.
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:25.880]   - He was just bad.
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:27.560]   He's a fat sir.
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:29.560]   You sir, hate sir.
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:30.400]   Yeah.
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:31.280]   - Well, and then you do this thing also.
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:33.840]   When you have kids, you sort of try to recreate
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:36.520]   your childhood by--
[01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:38.040]   - Have you done that?
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:43.040]   - Yeah, I mean, you know, I made my daughter watch Star Wars
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:46.560]   and she was like, "Yeah, it's okay."
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:47.960]   - It's okay.
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:49.200]   - I was crushed.
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:50.720]   - I can't even--
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:52.240]   - I don't even know how to talk.
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:53.520]   - She's a girl, what is she?
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:54.360]   - No, but it's true.
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:56.240]   You look at these old movies and the effects
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:00.440]   that you thought were so amazing, do not age well.
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:02.120]   - Of course, yeah.
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:03.880]   And yeah, I agree.
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:08.520]   It's funny how, at a certain stage of life,
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:11.240]   if you just come up, here's where we just start talking
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:12.440]   about how old and sad we are,
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:16.360]   but there's a certain stage of life where you identify,
[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:19.840]   you can identify more with this cultural moment.
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:21.640]   And then the older you get,
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:24.480]   the more you start to identify with a generational
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:25.960]   component of your life.
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:28.720]   - It's real, I'll tell you why I spent a long time
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:31.880]   thinking about it because we do geek culture shows
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:33.520]   and they don't do well.
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:35.640]   And I think that the same reason our gaming shows
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:40.120]   don't do well is because it's a very chopped up segment.
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:43.920]   There's, for instance, John Slanine at Jamberby
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:45.320]   who's my age was just saying,
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.720]   we're of the buckaroo bonsai generation.
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:49.200]   That's really true.
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:51.360]   But if you say buckaroo bonsai today,
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:54.000]   most people go, I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:54.840]   And so--
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:55.760]   - I think it's a puppet.
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:56.600]   - Yeah.
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:57.440]   So you can't--
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:59.040]   (laughing)
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:00.920]   It should be a puppet.
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:01.760]   - That's how we got a puppet.
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:05.200]   - I just fuckaroo bonsai to the masses through puppetry.
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:07.720]   - But it's hard to do a show for gamers
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:09.600]   and it's hard to do a show for geek culture
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:12.040]   because there isn't one thing.
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:16.480]   - Yeah, it's a medium more than a culture.
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:18.320]   You know, it's like talking about gamers
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:21.160]   is like talking about piano music.
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:23.400]   Well, there's a bunch of different types of piano music.
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:24.240]   - Right.
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:25.160]   - Now, ragtime is classic.
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:26.480]   - Only kind of piano music.
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:27.320]   (laughing)
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:29.880]   - I would submit it's gotten worse
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:32.120]   because of how fast culture is moving
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:34.200]   that it is really now a very narrow slice.
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:36.720]   I could ask you five questions and name and say
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:38.600]   how exactly how old you are
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:40.640]   by just saying Brady Bunch.
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:42.160]   - Yes. - Yes or no.
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:44.320]   Buckaroo bonsai, yes or no.
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:47.280]   You know, Mario, are you Mario Kart?
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:48.760]   Or are you, you know, I mean,
[01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:50.760]   you could immediately tell how old somebody is
[01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:52.760]   from those specific questions.
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:53.600]   It's very--
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:55.600]   - I can tell how old you are from one question.
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:57.760]   I asked them, how old are you?
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:59.200]   (laughing)
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:00.880]   - Wow.
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:01.800]   - It's really smart, Paul.
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:03.240]   That's a shortcut. - I can't do all the crap.
[01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:04.240]   Yeah.
[01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:05.560]   - That's a Yale shortcut.
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:06.400]   (laughing)
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:08.000]   - I was gonna say, yeah, I'm gonna miss fucking Yale.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.840]   - You must be a management consultant.
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:11.320]   (laughing)
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:13.240]   - You took a shortcut, it's 101, right?
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:14.800]   - Yeah, of course.
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:15.800]   - Yeah.
[01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:18.160]   - So, okay, let's talk about modern culture.
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:19.440]   What are you guys into?
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:21.240]   What are you excited about today?
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:23.680]   By the way, we've completely--
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:26.160]   But not only did we lose hodgeman early on,
[01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:28.720]   but Paul Roderick is now bored to death.
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:32.240]   And all we have, joining us now, Paul Hodgeman's bedroom.
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:34.760]   (laughing)
[01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:35.760]   - I think it's a bed.
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:37.840]   - John Hodgeman's bedroom. - I think beds are really awesome.
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:40.360]   - He made it, I gotta say, it's made now.
[01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:42.240]   - It is neat and tidy.
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:45.240]   - Even the children, even the children have left.
[01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:47.160]   (laughing)
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:48.600]   - Yeah.
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:49.680]   Do you know what's interesting, Leo?
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.840]   I find it harder and harder to be excited
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:55.600]   by current cultural stuff.
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:57.760]   - You see, you're jaded and bored like the rest of the--
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:58.600]   - Right?
[01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:00.520]   - Yeah, I mean, I feel like the,
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:02.800]   I only listen to old music anymore.
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:05.320]   Because I'm a musician, I get this all the time.
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:08.040]   You know, it's like the classic last interview question.
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:09.080]   Who are you listening to now?
[01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:10.920]   And I'm like, ah.
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:12.600]   (laughing)
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:14.000]   The Beatles.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:14.840]   - The Beatles.
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:17.800]   - Well, it's especially challenging for a musician
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:20.520]   because you're supposed to, this is your medium.
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:22.160]   You're supposed to be an expert
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:25.200]   and you're supposed to know who the hot new things are.
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:27.200]   And it's the Beatles. - Sure.
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:31.360]   - Yeah, and the truth is, I don't like the hot new things.
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:32.480]   - Yeah.
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:33.360]   - 'Cause I'm an old man.
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:34.360]   I'm an old man who's very sad and tired.
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:35.880]   - I always admit, for me, it may be,
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:36.960]   it may be this is true for you.
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:38.280]   It's more cowardice.
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:39.880]   Because the other thing that happens is
[01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:44.400]   if you say Mumford and sons, you're in a box.
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.240]   - Yeah?
[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:46.080]   - That's true. - All of a sudden,
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:49.120]   you're saying something that is supposedly
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:52.040]   totally revealing about who you are.
[01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:53.680]   And you don't wanna do that.
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:55.600]   Beatles is safe. - That's true.
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:57.840]   - Yeah, that's true. And musical taste has always been a thing
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:02.720]   that is, I've always felt shy about saying who I liked.
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:03.680]   - So here's a question.
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:08.320]   Can Paul McCartney represent fairly
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:12.080]   in a fair representation in Nirvana?
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:16.840]   Can he, could Paul McCartney be the lead singer in Nirvana?
[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:18.520]   I say no.
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:21.440]   - As a, I mean, as a going concern right now?
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:22.280]   - Well, he did it.
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:23.400]   Didn't he at this concert?
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:25.760]   - Well, they sang it song. - He played Kurt Cobain.
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:27.520]   But he did the Kurt Cobain part.
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:31.360]   - No. - I mean, the thing is,
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:33.000]   that's like-- - Weird.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.560]   - Yeah, when Paul McCartney was doing his thing
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:38.120]   with the Beatles, like they were tapping into
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:39.920]   what was happening in-- - It's like Frank Sinatra
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:41.960]   playing Mick Jagger.
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:43.240]   - That's a good idea.
[01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:45.080]   I would pay a lot of money to say.
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:46.240]   - That would be awesome.
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:53.240]   - I can't get no satisfaction.
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:55.040]   - That would be pretty amazing.
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:56.680]   Yeah, no, I, no.
[01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:59.880]   Of course, of course, Paul McCartney can't, I mean--
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:01.360]   - We talk about a generational divide.
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:02.560]   - That was a strange mix.
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:03.400]   I don't know why they did it.
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:04.600]   - Sheepers.
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:05.480]   No, I didn't see it.
[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:06.400]   Did you see it or hear it?
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:07.240]   - I didn't.
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:08.080]   I just heard it badly.
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:08.920]   - I saw it.
[01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:10.040]   I mean, it was enjoyable for, you know,
[01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:13.000]   they only did one song as that group.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.480]   And it was an enjoyable cover song.
[01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:16.880]   Like you'd see any other cover in somebody else.
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:17.720]   - I feel like, I feel like--
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:20.520]   - He's covering it with, you know--
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:22.320]   - Shouldn't Paul McCartney go away though?
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:23.400]   I mean, he's, I mean, really.
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:24.960]   Let's remember the wiggles.
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:25.800]   - You know what?
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:26.640]   It's funny.
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:28.720]   I sort of normally would feel that way.
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:31.040]   And then I happened to be up and watch,
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:34.480]   I caught the last couple of songs of Chris Martin
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:37.120]   and then whatever his name is from Coldplay.
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:38.720]   And then Paul McCartney came on.
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:41.120]   And he just put on a good--
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:41.960]   - Wow, that's great.
[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:42.800]   - Yeah, that's great.
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:48.800]   - Paul McCartney is probably my favorite musician of all time.
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:52.240]   And it just sort of, it doesn't matter to me.
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:55.760]   That maybe he's not doing whatever is the newest hottest thing
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:56.560]   right now.
[01:23:56.560 --> 01:24:02.720]   He just has this natural talent that will always be part of him.
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:03.840]   So even though--
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:05.680]   - His royalty, at this point he's really--
[01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:06.920]   - Really? He is really--
[01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:09.320]   - And just like the queen, he should just die.
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:11.320]   - No.
[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:12.480]   - Damn.
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:13.360]   - Squarespace.
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:14.560]   - That's a joke.
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:15.120]   That's a joke.
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:15.720]   I'm joking.
[01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:16.520]   I went for the joke.
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:18.920]   I went for the cheap joke.
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:19.520]   - He should die.
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:21.960]   - Just as the entire Hodgman family has been murdered.
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:23.680]   He should either die--
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:27.240]   - He should either jump out of a helicopter with Daniel Craig.
[01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:28.640]   That would be OK.
[01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:29.440]   - That would be amazing.
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:30.200]   - Nice tomorrow.
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:31.640]   We know who's responsible.
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:32.000]   - All right.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.080]   - It's my fault.
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:34.480]   I've had a little too much--
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:36.560]   what is this, error rat?
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:39.640]   Armenian Brandy with Marshy.
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:41.840]   Do not mix your marshmallows and Brandy kids.
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:43.560]   That's one thing I learned at Yale, right?
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:44.480]   Right, Paul?
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:46.960]   - That's absolutely right.
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:50.040]   I learned it in my third form at Yale.
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:51.240]   - Third form.
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:52.480]   - Yeah.
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:54.280]   - We called him forms.
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:54.720]   - Sure.
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:55.760]   - Because it was on the British model.
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:56.240]   - No, we didn't.
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:56.600]   - Sure.
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:59.000]   - No, we didn't.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.320]   - I have to confess, I learned--
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:03.240]   one thing I did learn-- in fact, it's probably
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:05.840]   the only thing I learned at Yale was not to drink.
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:09.760]   Because I drank so much that I realized what I was--
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:13.240]   that I was not going to have a liver if I didn't graduate.
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:15.600]   But I learned not to drink.
[01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:16.960]   - You learned how to hold your liquor.
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:18.840]   You learned how to drink responsibly.
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:19.840]   - Drink responsibly.
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:21.520]   - Like a Yale man, what the heck?
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:23.160]   - Like a Yale man.
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:24.800]   - There was more-- there was so much booze.
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:26.400]   And now I went there-- I was young.
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:29.040]   I was below a drinking age when I went there.
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:30.520]   And they don't care.
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:32.640]   They said, I have a bloody Mary that's
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:34.480]   time for the big game.
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:36.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:36.920]   - So you were--
[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:38.120]   - They were still talking like that when you were there?
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:38.720]   - Yes.
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:39.920]   We all talk like that.
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:40.440]   - Yeah, you do.
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:41.720]   - I don't know if you would have.
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:46.800]   - I went to Yale with a guy named Dink Morgan.
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:47.640]   - Dink Morgan.
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:48.480]   - Dink Morgan.
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:51.560]   He used to snort cocaine with $100 bills.
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:53.080]   - That's the only way you could talk with that,
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:53.920]   letting him just like--
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:55.400]   - It's all tough.
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:57.400]   - It did not open his teeth.
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:57.960]   So let me ask--
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:58.480]   - There's a guy.
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:01.120]   - So you were in the Whiffen poofs.
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:03.160]   - That's right, archipelago, archipelago.
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:06.080]   - I love the Whiffen poofs.
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:07.440]   Give us a little course.
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:08.840]   We are little lost lambs.
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:09.800]   Let's all do it together.
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:13.920]   - Ooh, the table's down at Maurice.
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:16.680]   - Well, the place where Louis dwells.
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:19.360]   - Yeah, nobody wants to hear the Whiffen poofs song.
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:21.480]   - I love that song.
[01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:22.160]   - I do too.
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:25.800]   - We are little lost lambs who have gone astray.
[01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:29.000]   ♪ Pa pa pa pa ♪
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000]   - Yeah.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.400]   - That's when you ringtone for when you call in the mouth.
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:37.000]   - But those--
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.480]   - But see, in that song, it's all actual places.
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:41.440]   So there is a Maurice.
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:42.560]   - There is a Maurice, yeah?
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:43.480]   - Which I think--
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:46.440]   - I believe Maurice went bankrupt over the last few years.
[01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:47.440]   They're back.
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:49.520]   They closed for a while, but they're back.
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:51.440]   I haven't been there in their new incarnation,
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:56.280]   but yeah, it's this weird, throwback restaurant.
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:57.920]   Like members-only restaurant.
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:01.320]   And the Whiffen poofs sing there every Monday night.
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:02.640]   It's kind of awesome.
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:05.080]   - The place where Louis dwells was Louis lunch,
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:07.840]   the original, originator of the hamburger.
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:08.920]   - Yeah, sure.
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:10.360]   - Sure.
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:11.640]   - You mean the hamburger?
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:13.240]   - I'm sorry, the hamburger.
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:14.240]   - The homb.
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:15.800]   - The hamburger.
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:18.400]   - I can't open my mouth, by the way.
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:21.760]   - My teeth, if I opened the money, it would fall out,
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:23.240]   so I have to close.
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:25.120]   (laughing)
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:26.880]   Our show today is brought to you by Audible.
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:29.120]   Now surely you guys could get behind Audible.
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:30.840]   Where the hell is Hodgeman?
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:33.600]   He's got a book on Audible.com, and is he here?
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:34.440]   No.
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:37.800]   - He's at Audible headquarters right now.
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:40.000]   - Recording book four, probably.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.040]   In fact, you're on those books too.
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:44.280]   - I am on those books, yeah.
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:46.240]   - So in a way, I'm on Audible.com.
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:47.320]   - You are.
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:50.600]   You performed the furry old lobster on the first one.
[01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:51.440]   - I did.
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:52.960]   - The areas of my expertise.
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:56.920]   - Saying the songs of the States.
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:57.760]   - Yes.
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:58.760]   - I did say the songs of the States.
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:01.000]   And actually, John Roderick is on the most recent one,
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:01.840]   as well.
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:04.560]   John Roderick did a little, a few bits with Hodgeman
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:06.080]   on the most recent one as well.
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:08.120]   - Let's not mention him, he's not here.
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:09.200]   - Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:10.640]   - Screw him.
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:11.680]   - Yeah.
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:12.760]   - Stricken from the record.
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:14.080]   - He's stricken from the record.
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:15.080]   He's not in the record.
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:17.200]   But what is in the record is Audible,
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:20.480]   which is the greatest source of audiobooks.
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:24.280]   I tell you, one thing that happens as life takes over.
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:25.960]   You know, in college, you do a lot of reading.
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:29.120]   I remember going to the cross-campus library
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:31.120]   and falling asleep over Ulysses.
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:33.800]   Actually, I still fall asleep over a book
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:35.360]   'cause why I cannot read a book.
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:36.600]   I'll read one page.
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:38.520]   (laughing)
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:39.400]   It's right away.
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:40.560]   It's a great way to go to sleep.
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:42.320]   But I still, I want to read,
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:43.600]   and this is where Audible is great.
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:45.560]   While I'm in the car, and I can't fall asleep,
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:47.640]   or I'm at the gym and I'm working out,
[01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:49.520]   or even while I'm doing housework, walkin' the dog,
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:51.760]   I listen to audiobooksfromaudible.com.
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:53.280]   And they're so great.
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:54.960]   A hundred thousand titles, everything.
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:57.520]   Nowadays, it's just kind of done.
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:28:58.420]   It's the done thing.
[01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:00.040]   When you put out a book, it's unaudible,
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:02.360]   as well as in print.
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:04.320]   And that's fantastic 'cause it means
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:06.360]   that all the new books are available for you,
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:07.520]   but also all the classics.
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:09.320]   If one of the things that Audible's done
[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:12.640]   is they've gone back, when I first joined Audible in 2001,
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:14.560]   they didn't have much science fiction.
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:16.520]   They literally have created a program called
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:19.160]   Audible Frontiers, where they are recording
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:23.480]   the great science fiction books that were never recorded.
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:25.080]   If you have not read The Hobbit,
[01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:27.000]   I don't know how that could possibly be.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.840]   Before you go see the movie, Read It.
[01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:30.800]   Lord of the Rings, Read It.
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:34.880]   So many great novels, so many great nonfiction books,
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:39.240]   historical books, technology.
[01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:43.000]   It's just an amazing collection of wonderful,
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.360]   and I always say reading.
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:45.920]   I know everybody says, "Well, you shouldn't say reading,
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:48.280]   "it's listening," but it's whatever it is.
[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:49.640]   It's available for you right now,
[01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:53.000]   and I'm gonna tell you how you can get three books.
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.440]   We're gonna give you two books via our offer
[01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:57.320]   that says Audible.com/22.
[01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:59.120]   That's the, you'll sign up for the platinum plane.
[01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:00.160]   That's two books.
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:02.740]   (gentle music)
[01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:05.760]   (laughing)
[01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:10.760]   Jesus.
[01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:12.760]   (laughing)
[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:16.320]   You wandered off, and the show is going on.
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:17.800]   I went away and learned a song
[01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:20.600]   and a wasale with my friends.
[01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:22.640]   You had an entire career in the time
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:23.840]   that this show has been going on.
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:25.080]   I can't, I can't.
[01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:27.120]   Guys, you still doing this, I can't believe it.
[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:28.640]   I've been sitting here for a half hour going,
[01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:29.480]   "Where's Hodgeman?"
[01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:30.840]   I hope Hodgeman comes back soon.
[01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:32.240]   I hope he has a song for us.
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:35.120]   (laughing)
[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:37.920]   Audible.com/22.
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:40.520]   Sign up for the, I guess that's the platinum account.
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:42.280]   That's two books.
[01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:44.600]   Your first two books are free, your first month is free.
[01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:46.360]   Cancel at any time, pay nothing.
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:47.320]   The books are yours to keep.
[01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:49.120]   I know that sounds like a rip off.
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:50.520]   I mean, like you're ripping them off,
[01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:52.400]   but no, you can do that, they encourage you.
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:53.400]   Go ahead.
[01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:54.520]   Your first two is free.
[01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:55.400]   Try it.
[01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:57.920]   Get the areas of my expertise.
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:30:59.640]   Get the new book.
[01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:00.720]   That is all.
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:04.760]   What's the first one called?
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:07.120]   More information than you require.
[01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:09.760]   It's all there.
[01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:11.080]   Audible.com.
[01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:12.880]   And now here's the third book,
[01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:14.720]   a wonderful book by Brandon Sanderson.
[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:17.200]   It's actually a novella called Legion.
[01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:19.120]   It's kind of an interesting,
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:20.600]   he's like a murder mystery.
[01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:24.000]   He's a detective who uses his multiple personalities
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.120]   to solve mysteries.
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:26.880]   It's actually very cool.
[01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:30.240]   It's not exactly sci-fi, it's not exactly fantasy.
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:31.920]   It's unique, but it's yours for free.
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:33.600]   You don't even have to be an audible member.
[01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:35.200]   And if you are an audible member,
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:36.320]   it's still yours for free.
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:40.480]   Just go to audible.com/sanderson.
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:45.480]   S-A-N-E-R-S-O-M, a fabulous book.
[01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:47.160]   John Hodgman is on Audible,
[01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:48.520]   all three of his books.
[01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:50.240]   He's read the novel.
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:51.960]   Now John, I gotta say,
[01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:54.800]   one of the things about that is all
[01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:57.120]   is that it's about Ragnarok.
[01:31:57.120 --> 01:31:58.160]   The end of the world.
[01:31:58.160 --> 01:31:59.120]   That's true.
[01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:01.400]   Which is eight days from now.
[01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:04.600]   Eight more shopping days till Ragnarok.
[01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:08.720]   What should we do to prepare for the end of the world?
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:13.040]   I don't know if there's anything you can do at this point,
[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:13.880]   Leo.
[01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:15.520]   I think it's all over.
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:18.200]   You're hunkered down there in Hetolduma.
[01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:21.720]   I know you have stockpiles of alcohol, so...
[01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:24.240]   People just thought that we were building
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:27.560]   this million dollar studios, a video studio, is not.
[01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:28.680]   It's a shelter.
[01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:30.000]   I've been there.
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.440]   It takes a 45 minute elevator ride
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:35.560]   to get down to the basement where you are.
[01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:36.600]   We are, yeah.
[01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:38.080]   So it looks like that you can see
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:39.120]   the great outdoors here.
[01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.880]   That's a green screen.
[01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:44.120]   No, so it's clear that you're already well insulated from...
[01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:47.480]   It's the one with the Eigapulse, the dog storm,
[01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:48.920]   everything that's gonna come down.
[01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:52.440]   This may be the last place standing.
[01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:54.640]   That very well may be.
[01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:57.920]   And that's why I need to get in there as soon as possible.
[01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:02.920]   We've got stockpiles of rum, red wine, and 223 ammo.
[01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:07.080]   And good cheer, I dare say, as well.
[01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:09.360]   Well, the people who are working here
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.520]   are cheering pretty hard because they know
[01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:12.840]   they're gonna be safe.
[01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:17.040]   The minds predicted that the world was going to end
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:19.440]   on December 21st.
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:22.600]   And this show is gonna air on December 23rd.
[01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:24.840]   (laughing)
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:28.560]   So if you're watching this...
[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:29.560]   - So if you're watching this...
[01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:30.920]   - It didn't happen.
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:32.600]   - That was right.
[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:35.680]   - If you're not watching this, it happened.
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:39.600]   - Yeah, but if you're watching this, don't blame me.
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:42.520]   Blame the ancient minds 'cause I'm starting to think
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:43.680]   those guys were dumb.
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:46.280]   (laughing)
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:47.200]   - Oh, don't say that now.
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:49.120]   You wrote a whole book about it.
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:50.640]   - They didn't know how to make smooth pyramids.
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:51.960]   Why should we trust them?
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:56.760]   - I'm not gonna let them solely my good name
[01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:59.560]   in the disaster preparedness community.
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:02.280]   If it doesn't work out, I'm gonna blame them.
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:03.640]   I'm just gonna say they were dumb, dumb,
[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:05.320]   say, "I got the calendar wrong."
[01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:07.640]   And it's all gonna happen next year instead.
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:09.920]   - I've often wondered because there have been so many
[01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:13.560]   preachers, so many prophets, so many soothsayers
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:15.960]   who have predicted the end of the world.
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:18.320]   And it must be kind of embarrassing when they get up
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:20.680]   to midnight on that day.
[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:22.120]   And it hasn't happened.
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:25.400]   And I've always wondered, how do you recoup from that?
[01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:27.680]   How do you recover after, as he said,
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:29.600]   the world is gonna end and it doesn't.
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:32.400]   So, and now you've written in a time and talk about
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:37.400]   the end of the world and you're already backing down a little bit.
[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:41.840]   - Well, I'm just saying, I will be very sorry
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:44.240]   if the world doesn't end when I predicted it
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:45.920]   'cause then I'll look foolish.
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:46.760]   - Okay.
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:50.520]   - But thinking, I am preparing for that
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:53.600]   most terrible eventuality that I'm wrong.
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:55.520]   And I don't like to think about it,
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:57.080]   no one likes to think about it.
[01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:58.560]   But it would be foolish not to prepare
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:01.960]   'cause if I am wrong, then I'm going to have people
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:04.080]   who gave their life savings away.
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:06.320]   (laughing)
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:12.480]   - From the mountains of days, everyone.
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:14.480]   - These are all lines.
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:17.480]   (laughing)
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:18.920]   - You're familiar as,
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:21.360]   does not have confidence in your story.
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:22.800]   (laughing)
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:26.640]   - You have to understand that in my survival bumper,
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:28.920]   I have a little man who serves me
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:31.480]   just like Marlon Brando on the island of Dr. Mariah.
[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:33.120]   (laughing)
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:34.600]   - Mariah.
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:35.440]   - I don't like that.
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:38.520]   - In any case, I am preparing for the terrible eventuality
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:40.120]   that I am wrong.
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:43.200]   And that is why my survival bumper comes in a candy twice.
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:45.840]   If the blood wave comes, I'll be prepared.
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:48.520]   And if it doesn't come, then I'll be protected
[01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:50.680]   from you losers who gave all your money away
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:53.680]   and bought only white clothing like I told you to.
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:56.960]   - JohnHodgeman.com, please get the book
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:58.440]   so that you know what's coming.
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:01.080]   You'll have nine days to read it.
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:02.400]   - Right, thank you.
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:05.960]   I would love, I, look, I enjoyed making the book very much.
[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:07.560]   The audio book in particular features
[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:09.440]   my friend, Jonathan Colton.
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:10.360]   - Yeah, if you've been here,
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:12.560]   you probably would have heard us talk about that.
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:13.400]   - Hello.
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:15.000]   (laughing)
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.560]   - Lea Loportburger.
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:17.400]   - John Colton.
[01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:18.240]   - Bye.
[01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:19.360]   - Here I am.
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:20.640]   - Here, did you miss me?
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:21.480]   (laughing)
[01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:22.480]   - Oh, Patrick.
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:24.840]   - Apparently, he's on it as well.
[01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:27.080]   (laughing)
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:29.000]   - Oh, shit.
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.000]   (laughing)
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.960]   - You can't say that.
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:33.880]   It's a matter of what's going on.
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:34.960]   - Oh, oh, oh boy.
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:36.040]   - Don't go on the wrong way.
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:38.720]   (laughing)
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:41.920]   - JohnHodgeman's Posit recipe will be on his website,
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:44.320]   johnHodgeman.com.
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:45.800]   That's also where you can find out more
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:47.280]   about his book, that is all.
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:51.160]   And upcoming engagements right up to the day of Ragnarok.
[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:52.280]   - On the day of Ragnarok,
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:55.680]   but this will have aired after Ragnarok, so.
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:57.360]   If Ragnarok does not happen,
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:00.760]   may I say that Jesse Thorn and I will be doing a live
[01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:03.880]   judge, JohnHodgeman at Sketchfest in San Francisco,
[01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:05.880]   not very far from you, Leo,
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:09.440]   on January 25th of 2013.
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:11.160]   - Oh, we should go to that.
[01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:12.960]   - Yeah, if you'd like to come,
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:15.000]   I'll put you on a list.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:15.840]   - Put me on the list.
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:17.360]   - Put me on the list for Snoop Dogg on Saturday,
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:20.800]   and then I would be on the list for you in three weeks.
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:21.800]   - All right, so you don't have to work.
[01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:22.640]   - You don't have to work.
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:23.800]   - It's fine.
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:25.200]   - It's a little brag.
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:26.120]   - It's a small brag.
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:27.040]   - Humble brag.
[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:31.880]   - Hey, John Roderick, is there anything you'd like to plug
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:35.360]   besides your fine group, the winter solstice?
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:36.200]   - Tom Winters.
[01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:38.440]   (laughing)
[01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:44.480]   - Buy my CD.
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:46.560]   - The CD.
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:50.360]   - Roderick on the line is a fantastic podcast.
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:52.280]   It is the reason the podcast were invented.
[01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:53.120]   - It is.
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:55.920]   - Merlin Mann, I made Merlin Mann the man he is today.
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:58.680]   I made him famous with our show "Mac Break Weekly,"
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:00.440]   and then he just shuns us,
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:03.520]   and goes on and does a series of fabulous podcasts
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:05.040]   without me, but that's okay.
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:07.400]   - He can be a shunner.
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:09.440]   - Sometimes. - He's a shunner.
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:10.280]   I like your shoes.
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:11.120]   - Your doctor's shoes.
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:12.560]   - That's very festive.
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:13.720]   - Yeah, I'm drunk.
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:15.960]   (laughing)
[01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:19.440]   - Paul, it's the yager mister.
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:21.840]   Paul and Storm, they go together.
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:24.480]   That's Storm, do you hear Costanza?
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:25.880]   Do you celebrate Festivus,
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:28.420]   given the heritage of your Costanza family?
[01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:31.800]   - I'm actually kind of a pizza bagel,
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:35.000]   so I've got the Jewish thing and the Italian thing happening.
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.120]   - Wow, that's confusing.
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:39.640]   - I just celebrate, that's my way.
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:41.480]   - You know the Pope is tweeting now.
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:46.520]   - I am wrapped with attention for the Pope's tweets,
[01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:48.760]   because his hat is even funnier than mine.
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:51.000]   (laughing)
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.840]   - Actually, it almost looks like the...
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:56.680]   Miterbin, the Pope's hat, right there.
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:58.920]   - This was the Pope's hat. - That is Storm,
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:03.080]   that is Paul, above him in the grid.
[01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:04.960]   He went to Yale.
[01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:07.480]   - I did it, it says so, right here on my sweatshirt.
[01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:09.840]   - He went to Yale to get that sweatshirt.
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:13.200]   - I just want to say that I can tell by the typography
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:15.760]   that's Yale as in Locke.
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:17.240]   Not Yale as in university.
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:18.240]   (laughing)
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:19.560]   - Yes, yes.
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:21.720]   - I have a man's locksmith sweatshirt.
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:23.360]   (laughing)
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:25.880]   - But that's just why that's just a locksmith's jumper.
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:28.360]   (laughing)
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:31.000]   - Oh, I have been discovered and I know I'm done.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:32.440]   - Condone!
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:35.480]   - You can catch Paul and Storm also on Geek and Sundry
[01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:38.840]   and see their brand new show, which debuts Wensers.
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:41.080]   - January 15. - January 15.
[01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:43.760]   - That'll be a day that lives in infamy.
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:45.600]   - Yeah, we hope.
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:47.040]   - What's it called again?
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:48.480]   - It's called Learning Town.
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:50.040]   - Learning Town Dot.
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:54.400]   - No, it doesn't have a, it doesn't have a URL.
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:55.320]   - No, it does!
[01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:56.680]   No, it does!
[01:39:56.680 --> 01:40:01.800]   - There is a learningtown.com that goes to some organization
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:05.040]   of people who apparently are dedicated to educating children.
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:05.880]   - I have some things.
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:07.200]   - Some stupid reasons.
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:09.560]   - Learningtown.geek and Sundry.com, however.
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:11.520]   - It's a redirect to Yale University.
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:12.520]   There you go.
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:15.120]   - It's a village for learning professionals.
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:18.120]   But if you go to learningtown.geek and sundry.com,
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:20.680]   you'll get the learningtown trailer.
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:21.560]   - Yes.
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:22.400]   - Which is--
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:24.520]   - There will be an actual series that will appear
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:25.960]   on January 15.
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:28.320]   - And some have, some in this room have seen it
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:30.080]   and say it is good.
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:31.800]   - Some claim.
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:34.840]   - Jonathan Colton's latest album,
[01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:39.240]   one he did ironically with our unexpected guest Paul Roderick,
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:41.960]   is called One Christmas at a Time.
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:44.960]   Who did the illustration of that?
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:45.920]   - On Christmas Saturdays.
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:46.760]   - Isn't it great?
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:49.320]   It's a fellow named Zach Rock.
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:50.160]   - Yeah, well, Christmas.
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:53.480]   - That we met at a tweetup in Seattle.
[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:57.600]   - I can't, is it supposed to be medieval kind of illustration?
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:00.080]   - I know, it's us hanging out Christmas morning,
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:03.120]   the way we always do with a hot chocolate
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:06.160]   and I play some songs and Roderick hasn't brushed his hair
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:07.280]   and we're in our robes.
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:08.640]   I don't wanna talk about it.
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:11.880]   - Jonathan Colton.com/OCAAT.
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:15.280]   - Pull one Christmas.
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:17.520]   (laughing)
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:21.880]   - You got a pretty heavily mallowed havin' jewelry though.
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:23.200]   - Okay, this is the last I saw.
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:24.360]   - At the mallow.
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:27.120]   Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you so much
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:29.960]   for joining us for this special holiday edition of "Twick."
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:33.400]   ♪ You're out of bed, papers put away ♪
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:35.160]   - That's the thing you're gonna think.
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:37.280]   - See, if this were a normal song,
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:38.680]   I'd be able to talk up the intro,
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:40.440]   but it has some sort of strange
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:43.640]   convention at the beginning, where are the...
[01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:45.560]   (laughing)
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:47.520]   The intro is where it should be.
[01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:49.080]   - Uh-huh.
[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:49.920]   - That's how we do.
[01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:50.760]   - Yeah.
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:53.640]   - You didn't play the guitar long enough at the beginning.
[01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:54.480]   - Sorry.
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:56.640]   - For me to say, I wish you all a very,
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:41:59.400]   whatever you celebrate, whether it is winter solstice
[01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:04.000]   or festivals or quanza or Hanukkah or Christmas,
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.880]   that you have a wonderful holiday season
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:10.160]   and we thank you for being here for what is inevitably
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:11.440]   going to be seen as...
[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:14.160]   - The last Christmas ever.
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:15.360]   - The last Christmas ever.
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:16.360]   (laughing)
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:18.360]   The day Twit jumped the shark.
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:21.400]   (laughing)
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:22.720]   We thank you all for being here.
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:24.760]   Happy Festivists, we'll see you next time
[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:27.760]   on This Week at Twit and Now, another Twit.
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:29.000]   - He's in the can.
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.360]   - Yeah, yeah, the rooftop.
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:32.040]   - I've never met those words.
[01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:34.200]   - We're seriously.
[01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:35.040]   - We're...

[01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:39.860]   That is from the CD.

[01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:44.260]   - Oh, that's the one you were talking about.
[01:43:44.260 --> 01:43:45.100]   That's cool.
[01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:46.100]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:43:46.100 --> 01:43:47.340]   - Very beautiful, as always.
[01:43:47.340 --> 01:43:48.180]   You do such great things.
[01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:50.060]   - I think it was like the saddest version
[01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:53.300]   of the Brady Bunch of All Time on these squares.
[01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:54.140]   - Yeah.
[01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:55.140]   - Kind of true.
[01:43:55.140 --> 01:43:56.740]   - Whatever you call.
[01:43:56.740 --> 01:43:57.580]   I'm here.
[01:43:57.580 --> 01:44:02.580]   - It was, you know, I admit, I did not want to do this show.
[01:44:02.580 --> 01:44:05.060]   (laughing)
[01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:07.220]   - Leo, Leo, I love you for your honesty.
[01:44:07.220 --> 01:44:08.060]   - I do.
[01:44:08.060 --> 01:44:08.900]   - I do.
[01:44:08.900 --> 01:44:11.500]   - You know what, the first time we did the show,
[01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:13.460]   I think it was the, we were doing the cruise.
[01:44:13.460 --> 01:44:14.820]   Or maybe it was the second time we did the show.
[01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:16.140]   It was the first cruise.
[01:44:16.140 --> 01:44:17.900]   And at the end of that show, after I'd,
[01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:19.500]   we'd spend all this time talking about the cruise,
[01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:21.740]   you were like, I don't think they got enough people
[01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:22.580]   going on that cruise.
[01:44:22.580 --> 01:44:24.840]   (laughing)
[01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:27.820]   I think they didn't get the numbers they wanted.
[01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:29.180]   (laughing)
[01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:30.180]   It was fantastic.
[01:44:30.180 --> 01:44:35.100]   - I wasn't planning to buy a Ford, Leo.
[01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:36.900]   - You better buy one now.
[01:44:36.900 --> 01:44:37.740]   - I know.
[01:44:37.740 --> 01:44:38.580]   - I know.
[01:44:38.580 --> 01:44:39.420]   (laughing)
[01:44:39.420 --> 01:44:41.020]   - I'm gonna buy one, I'm gonna mail my check
[01:44:41.020 --> 01:44:43.460]   with my postage printed at stamps.com.
[01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:45.900]   - You know what is my fervent hope?
[01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:49.020]   That next year, we could all be together
[01:44:49.020 --> 01:44:50.820]   in the same room doing this fine.
[01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:51.660]   - Let's do it.
[01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:52.660]   Next year in Jerusalem.
[01:44:52.660 --> 01:44:53.500]   - Guys, yeah.
[01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:55.740]   (laughing)
[01:44:55.740 --> 01:44:57.940]   - I'll do it.
[01:44:57.940 --> 01:44:58.780]   - I'll buy my ticket.
[01:44:58.780 --> 01:44:59.620]   - That's it.
[01:44:59.620 --> 01:45:00.460]   - That's awesome.
[01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:01.940]   Next week, next year in Jerusalem.
[01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:02.860]   - Great idea.
[01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:04.420]   - That's the title of the show, by the way.
[01:45:04.420 --> 01:45:06.300]   Next year in Jerusalem.
[01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:08.500]   - In the holy city.
[01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:10.300]   - I have to say, for having me on the show, Leo,
[01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:11.140]   it was nice meeting you.
[01:45:11.140 --> 01:45:12.740]   - Hey, Paul, it's so great to meet you.
[01:45:12.740 --> 01:45:14.180]   I'm a huge fan, actually.
[01:45:14.180 --> 01:45:16.340]   I was just jostin' with you.
[01:45:16.340 --> 01:45:17.660]   But I love the show you do,
[01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:18.780]   and I haven't heard your music,
[01:45:18.780 --> 01:45:21.220]   but I will be listening to the Colton CD.
[01:45:21.220 --> 01:45:24.300]   And the fabulous, I've been a fan of the December
[01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:25.820]   since the beginning, so.
[01:45:25.820 --> 01:45:27.380]   - Yeah, thanks for a great fan.
[01:45:27.380 --> 01:45:29.640]   (laughing)
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:33.380]   - I look forward to hearing your music.
[01:45:33.380 --> 01:45:34.220]   No, it's awesome.
[01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:35.540]   - What do you hearin' it too?
[01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:36.620]   - That's great.
[01:45:36.620 --> 01:45:37.860]   It's so nice to meet you, Paul.
[01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:38.700]   Thank you.
[01:45:38.700 --> 01:45:40.020]   I'm thrilled that you could be here, actually.
[01:45:40.020 --> 01:45:41.180]   That's awesome.
[01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:42.100]   - Yeah, it was great.
[01:45:42.100 --> 01:45:44.260]   Tell 'em how much you love the screen savers.
[01:45:44.260 --> 01:45:45.900]   - I do, I love screen savers.
[01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:47.540]   The Flying Toaster was my favorite.
[01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:49.340]   - Wow, that's a great screen saver.
[01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:50.340]   One of the best.
[01:45:50.340 --> 01:45:51.580]   (laughing)
[01:45:51.580 --> 01:45:53.020]   We used to get that a lot.
[01:45:53.020 --> 01:45:56.860]   So, it's interesting, you take that I,
[01:45:56.860 --> 01:46:00.020]   that because of geek culture, that I was geek culture,
[01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:02.060]   I have no association with that.
[01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:02.900]   It's so funny.
[01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:04.260]   - No, I know, well, it's funny.
[01:46:04.260 --> 01:46:05.540]   The generational thing is big,
[01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:07.300]   and geek culture was not a thing.
[01:46:07.300 --> 01:46:09.460]   It was not a thing, you know?
[01:46:09.460 --> 01:46:12.100]   - And it's, I feel a little weird about this,
[01:46:12.100 --> 01:46:13.700]   so, to me, it's not culture.
[01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:17.060]   It's pop culture, but I don't get it.
[01:46:17.060 --> 01:46:17.900]   - I'm with you.
[01:46:17.900 --> 01:46:21.940]   I think it's a fascinating topic for discussion.
[01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:22.780]   - Yeah.
[01:46:22.780 --> 01:46:23.620]   - Perhaps on future shows.
[01:46:23.620 --> 01:46:25.100]   - Yeah, I thought, well, we actually had
[01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:26.500]   a pretty good conversation.
[01:46:26.500 --> 01:46:27.340]   - We did, we had a nice talk.
[01:46:27.340 --> 01:46:28.180]   - So thank you guys.
[01:46:28.180 --> 01:46:29.020]   Thank you so much.
[01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:29.940]   You guys are wonderful.
[01:46:29.940 --> 01:46:31.420]   I'm so glad we could do this.
[01:46:31.420 --> 01:46:32.260]   - Thanks, Leo.
[01:46:32.260 --> 01:46:33.100]   - Sorry we badger you.
[01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:33.940]   - Thank you, Leo.
[01:46:33.940 --> 01:46:35.220]   - No, I'm sorry.
[01:46:35.220 --> 01:46:37.180]   - Sorry I was something of a
[01:46:37.180 --> 01:46:39.220]   itinerant member of this year's party.
[01:46:39.220 --> 01:46:41.780]   - I feel like I'm touching Storm now.
[01:46:41.780 --> 01:46:43.700]   I wanna thank you, Storm.
[01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:45.180]   (laughs)
[01:46:45.180 --> 01:46:47.220]   For actually, you know, the truth is,
[01:46:47.220 --> 01:46:48.780]   I, the reason I didn't wanna do it
[01:46:48.780 --> 01:46:50.580]   is I didn't wanna put upon you guys.
[01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:53.780]   I didn't wanna overstay my welcome.
[01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:55.700]   So I'm thrilled that you wanted to do it.
[01:46:55.700 --> 01:46:57.300]   - Oh, it's totally fun.
[01:46:57.300 --> 01:46:58.140]   It's totally fun.
[01:46:58.140 --> 01:46:59.140]   - For me, I love it.
[01:46:59.140 --> 01:46:59.980]   - Yeah, we're fun.
[01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:02.220]   - We were thinking, oh, we can't make those guys.
[01:47:02.220 --> 01:47:04.540]   - We can't make those guys do it all again.
[01:47:04.540 --> 01:47:06.980]   - I thought it was huge lives, Leo.
[01:47:06.980 --> 01:47:08.500]   - No, I'm actually dead serious here.
[01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:10.580]   We just, I didn't think, I thought I can't,
[01:47:10.580 --> 01:47:13.860]   these guys are now all big celebrities, big stars.
[01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:16.180]   I can't make them do this again
[01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:18.300]   'cause they get no remuneration.
[01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:20.380]   - It's the only time we see each other all year.
[01:47:20.380 --> 01:47:21.220]   - Yeah, right.
[01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:22.060]   - That's true.
[01:47:22.060 --> 01:47:22.900]   - That's true.
[01:47:22.900 --> 01:47:23.740]   - This is my only office here.
[01:47:23.740 --> 01:47:24.580]   - Also, if we didn't see it,
[01:47:24.580 --> 01:47:26.700]   if we didn't do it, I wouldn't have to see you fall.
[01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:29.020]   - Yeah, well, I mean, you could look at it that way.
[01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:31.100]   If you wanted to be here for many days
[01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:32.220]   and I'm looking forward to it.
[01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:34.460]   - Are you guys going on the road together
[01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:36.020]   in your bathroom?
[01:47:36.020 --> 01:47:37.660]   - No, we're going on the cruise.
[01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:38.500]   - Oh, the cruise.
[01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:40.180]   I think that's really amazing.
[01:47:40.180 --> 01:47:42.540]   You guys get to go to a test cruise
[01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:44.740]   and then come back and do the real thing.
[01:47:44.740 --> 01:47:45.780]   - Yeah, it is kind of amazing.
[01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:46.620]   - It's kind of amazing.
[01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:48.620]   - Is that 'cause you sell so many cabins?
[01:47:48.620 --> 01:47:51.980]   - It's just, they do it for large enough groups.
[01:47:51.980 --> 01:47:54.620]   They do that kind of thing for the management to go.
[01:47:54.620 --> 01:47:56.740]   - Guys, it's nice because the children in this house
[01:47:56.740 --> 01:47:57.900]   is crying, so I gotta go.
[01:47:57.900 --> 01:47:59.100]   - I'll see you, John.
[01:47:59.100 --> 01:48:00.380]   Take care of it. - But I love you all
[01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:04.260]   very much and marry a happy and enlovee, Miss to you.
[01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:05.100]   (laughing)
[01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:05.940]   - See you soon.
[01:48:05.940 --> 01:48:09.180]   - Do what thou wilt is the whole of the law.
[01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:11.700]   - But as I was saying, it's nice because we actually get
[01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:13.940]   to have some semblance of a vacation on this one
[01:48:13.940 --> 01:48:16.180]   because on the next one, it's so sort of, you know,
[01:48:16.180 --> 01:48:18.740]   we're just going and going and when we're not working,
[01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:21.020]   we're being celebrities and all of that.
[01:48:21.020 --> 01:48:22.060]   - Yeah, people don't realize that
[01:48:22.060 --> 01:48:23.460]   'cause I've done that for years.
[01:48:23.460 --> 01:48:24.700]   When you're working on a cruise,
[01:48:24.700 --> 01:48:29.140]   it isn't a vacation as much 'cause you have to perform.
[01:48:29.140 --> 01:48:30.820]   - Yeah, no, it is a lot of work.
[01:48:30.820 --> 01:48:34.220]   I mean, it's fun work, but it's a pretty intense week.
[01:48:34.220 --> 01:48:36.500]   You know, I'm always exhausted at the end of it.
[01:48:36.500 --> 01:48:38.340]   - I think you guys, that's a huge group.
[01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:39.780]   I've never heard of such a big group.
[01:48:39.780 --> 01:48:42.340]   You guys are doing very well.
[01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:43.500]   - Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:46.300]   I can't, you know, I'm just, every time--
[01:48:46.300 --> 01:48:48.940]   - RCL must be thrilled that you decided
[01:48:48.940 --> 01:48:50.460]   to move over to them, frankly.
[01:48:50.460 --> 01:48:53.260]   - Yeah, hopefully they were the line
[01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:55.300]   that had the spaces that we needed.
[01:48:55.300 --> 01:48:57.500]   The biggest thing was they have this conference center,
[01:48:57.500 --> 01:48:58.860]   a 4,000 square foot.
[01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:00.380]   - Oh, that's interesting. - Conference center
[01:49:00.380 --> 01:49:03.780]   that's gonna be for us a 24/7 game room,
[01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:04.900]   or anything we walked through.
[01:49:04.900 --> 01:49:07.300]   - Yeah, that's a huge freaking ship.
[01:49:07.300 --> 01:49:09.180]   - It is really big.
[01:49:09.180 --> 01:49:10.020]   - It's really big.
[01:49:10.020 --> 01:49:10.980]   - It's not even their biggest.
[01:49:10.980 --> 01:49:13.460]   They have the super huge ones that have,
[01:49:13.460 --> 01:49:16.380]   it's like two skyscrapers going down the side of the ship
[01:49:16.380 --> 01:49:17.980]   and there's like a zipline going down the--
[01:49:17.980 --> 01:49:18.980]   - It's crazy. - The central area,
[01:49:18.980 --> 01:49:19.820]   it's ridiculous.
[01:49:19.820 --> 01:49:21.820]   - So Storm, do you put this together?
[01:49:21.820 --> 01:49:23.580]   Is this kind of your thing or?
[01:49:23.580 --> 01:49:26.300]   - Oh no, the three of us really put it together.
[01:49:26.300 --> 01:49:28.540]   We have some other folks that help with it.
[01:49:28.540 --> 01:49:30.820]   We chat first thing. - All in Storm,
[01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:33.020]   do an enormous amount of work for it.
[01:49:33.020 --> 01:49:37.380]   I mean, we've sort of all found our specializations.
[01:49:37.380 --> 01:49:42.380]   And me and my assistant who has sort of become my manager
[01:49:42.380 --> 01:49:47.100]   drew, have sort of created the software
[01:49:47.100 --> 01:49:49.100]   that does the booking and-- - Oh, that's neat.
[01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:50.340]   So that's neat.
[01:49:50.340 --> 01:49:52.380]   - Yeah, it's great.
[01:49:52.380 --> 01:49:54.140]   - We've talked about doing a Twit Cruise.
[01:49:54.140 --> 01:49:56.940]   We're gonna do a cruise to Hawaii in December
[01:49:56.940 --> 01:49:59.980]   and I just decided it's too off purpose for us.
[01:49:59.980 --> 01:50:03.060]   We, you know, it just tracks from the main job
[01:50:03.060 --> 01:50:06.100]   and I don't really want the staff to enjoy themselves that much.
[01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:08.340]   (laughing)
[01:50:08.340 --> 01:50:10.020]   - It's too fun.
[01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:12.540]   - But if you change your mind, give us a call.
[01:50:12.540 --> 01:50:13.380]   Give us a call.
[01:50:13.380 --> 01:50:14.460]   - You know, if we did it to a cruise,
[01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:17.140]   it would be great to bring you guys along.
[01:50:17.140 --> 01:50:20.900]   - Oh sure, or if you need any pointers on the cruise bits.
[01:50:20.900 --> 01:50:23.940]   - Well, the guy, you know, I do these insight cruises,
[01:50:23.940 --> 01:50:25.140]   formerly Geek Cruises.
[01:50:25.140 --> 01:50:28.380]   And so the guy who does that was offering it to a cruise.
[01:50:28.380 --> 01:50:29.220]   - Oh sure.
[01:50:29.220 --> 01:50:31.220]   - So he does all the work.
[01:50:31.220 --> 01:50:32.460]   - Sure, you got the hookup.
[01:50:32.460 --> 01:50:33.300]   - Yeah.
[01:50:33.300 --> 01:50:36.660]   It's an interesting idea.
[01:50:36.660 --> 01:50:38.380]   I love, I agree with you, Jonathan, though,
[01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:41.100]   the idea of having everybody in a real world,
[01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:43.460]   in a meat space is kind of an amazing thing.
[01:50:43.460 --> 01:50:44.820]   - It's a powerful thing.
[01:50:44.820 --> 01:50:46.660]   It's a powerful thing because you forget, you know,
[01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:48.380]   you have all these online interactions
[01:50:48.380 --> 01:50:50.300]   and it's just a very different experience
[01:50:50.300 --> 01:50:51.420]   from getting together with people
[01:50:51.420 --> 01:50:54.700]   and seeing them to get together with each other.
[01:50:54.700 --> 01:50:56.860]   I mean, that's the most exciting thing is that,
[01:50:56.860 --> 01:50:59.500]   you know, I feel like after having done this a few years,
[01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:00.980]   if we stopped doing it,
[01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:03.500]   they would keep doing it themselves.
[01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:05.020]   Like they don't need us at all.
[01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:07.780]   - The Geek Cruises is about 50% or more,
[01:51:07.780 --> 01:51:10.420]   maybe now 70% returnees.
[01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:12.940]   I see the same people every year.
[01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:14.380]   And that's really what it's become.
[01:51:14.380 --> 01:51:15.540]   It's their thing.
[01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:18.460]   Oh, we're gonna, all our friends, you know everybody.
[01:51:18.460 --> 01:51:21.140]   And so it's become this group that does stuff together
[01:51:21.140 --> 01:51:23.860]   and that actually is the benefit of it, I think.
[01:51:23.860 --> 01:51:25.460]   It's really important. - Yeah, I agree.
[01:51:25.460 --> 01:51:28.340]   - And the group, like even within this group,
[01:51:28.340 --> 01:51:30.060]   like there's some people who absolutely embrace
[01:51:30.060 --> 01:51:32.020]   the whole being offline.
[01:51:32.020 --> 01:51:34.460]   - That's a challenge, isn't it?
[01:51:34.460 --> 01:51:35.820]   - Yeah. - And then there's a whole other,
[01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:36.620]   there's a whole other batch.
[01:51:36.620 --> 01:51:40.380]   Like they've developed their own shipboard intranet,
[01:51:40.380 --> 01:51:43.580]   like sort of, they call it TwitR, like pirates,
[01:51:43.580 --> 01:51:45.580]   where it's sort of an on-board messaging system
[01:51:45.580 --> 01:51:46.460]   that just our people can get out.
[01:51:46.460 --> 01:51:47.580]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[01:51:47.580 --> 01:51:49.900]   We ended up doing that on the first Geek Cruises I went on.
[01:51:49.900 --> 01:51:53.180]   We sat up in the library and I was Google
[01:51:53.180 --> 01:51:54.780]   and somebody was Yahoo.
[01:51:54.780 --> 01:51:57.260]   (laughing)
[01:51:57.260 --> 01:51:59.300]   - Point played a little small network
[01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:01.300]   and that was the only way we could get on the--
[01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:02.380]   - Yeah.
[01:52:02.380 --> 01:52:03.700]   - That's awesome. - Yeah.
[01:52:03.700 --> 01:52:05.140]   - Hey guys, really thank you.
[01:52:05.140 --> 01:52:06.460]   I appreciate you doing this. - Thank you, Leo.
[01:52:06.460 --> 01:52:08.300]   - It's thank you, Leo. - It's something I would
[01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:09.300]   find it to all of you along. - It's crazy to have
[01:52:09.300 --> 01:52:10.580]   - Thank you Paul Storm. - Yeah.
[01:52:10.580 --> 01:52:12.740]   - We're all gonna be, we are all gonna be out there
[01:52:12.740 --> 01:52:14.740]   over the course of Sketchfest.
[01:52:14.740 --> 01:52:16.500]   We're actually, we're doing, I couldn't say it on the air
[01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:17.940]   because I don't know that it's official official,
[01:52:17.940 --> 01:52:20.940]   but we are doing a Woodstock Founders night.
[01:52:20.940 --> 01:52:23.500]   February 1st I wanna say there at Sketchfest.
[01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:26.260]   - Well, let's coordinate so you can come up here.
[01:52:26.260 --> 01:52:28.420]   I really, one of the things that we can't do,
[01:52:28.420 --> 01:52:30.620]   and I wish we could do as a performance of some kind.
[01:52:30.620 --> 01:52:34.860]   I would love, we have the space here.
[01:52:34.860 --> 01:52:36.300]   - And we've had bands before.
[01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:37.380]   - We've had performances. - We've had performances.
[01:52:37.380 --> 01:52:40.580]   We have a place you could get to stage
[01:52:40.580 --> 01:52:42.260]   and I would love to have like a mini,
[01:52:42.260 --> 01:52:44.260]   just a couple of songs, but a mini performance.
[01:52:44.260 --> 01:52:46.780]   - Absolutely. - Would be so awesome.
[01:52:46.780 --> 01:52:49.780]   - Yeah, that would be great. - All right, all right.
[01:52:49.780 --> 01:52:51.260]   - Thank you guys. - See you.
[01:52:51.260 --> 01:52:53.300]   - See you later, guys. - Bye. - See you.
