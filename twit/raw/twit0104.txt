[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   The Twit Ultimate Hoodie Microfleece.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Finally, we've got a--
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Now, I don't want to make it commercial for this,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   but finally, we've got a hoodie that really is just worthy of the name.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   And it's expensive.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   It's not cheap.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   But if you really want a nice fleece hoodie, this is beautiful.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Soft.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Thank you, Scott, for doing a nice job.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   >> All right.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   I appreciate all your support.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   I enjoy your podcast every week as well.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   >> We're going to send one to all of you guys.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And anybody who wants one, go to twit.tv or Think Geek.com.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   So, Scott, you have a website.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   You do e-commerce.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   The Scotty Vess site is-- is it ScottyVess.com?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   >> That's right.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   >> And like any sensible guy selling online,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   you wanted to put some sort of indicator on the front page
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   that you-- you know, had security policies in place.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   That your credit card was safe, that kind of thing.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   You've got the verified by Geotrust and the BBB Online Reliability Program.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   But you got a little bit of trouble with-- with another one.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   What happened?
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   >> Well, you know, I started seeing on just my own online shopping experience,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   all these hacker safe emblems popping up on a lot of major websites.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   And so I inquired with hacker safe, you know, what the deal was.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And I was very interested to learn about what they do to provide a level of security
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   for your visitors and whatnot.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   >> I've seen sites with that hacker safe logo on it.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   >> Yeah, it's amazing how many sites, especially recently, are using that.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   >> So what do they do to make-- I mean, how do you earn that besides getting that money?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   >> Well, I-- you effectively pay a fee, is what it amounts to.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   And a fee that is much more than most typical small e-commerce sites web hosting piece.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   It amounts about, I think it was like 1,800 bucks a year, about five bucks a day.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   And that's how they like to sell it.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Just five bucks a day.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   >> And it will increase your conversion rates by up to 15% they tell you.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   And, you know, I was very intrigued by it.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   I tried to find out a lot about the technology beyond, you know, just, you know, putting a symbol up
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   another logo up on my website to understand what they're really providing in terms of hacker-proof material.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   And I had several phone calls with them and they had a very difficult time explaining their technology.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   It seems as though their biggest selling point was that, look who else is doing it.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   >> Right.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   >> And technology.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   >> There's no technology.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   >> Well, you know, they say they do this, that, and they scan your computer every 15 minutes.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   >> Oh, they do.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Okay.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   >> And over 75,000 websites are protected.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   But it got a little interesting because I started thinking about it.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   And just like you said, I was skeptical about the quote unquote technology beyond, you know, the SSL certificate and other, you know,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   the customer practices that my webmasters, you know, employ, you know, import scanning and whatnot.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   And it occurred to me that the primary reason to do this is to provide your users with a reason to let them feel safe.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   So I came up with a symbol called hacker-proof.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   And it just merely described what we were doing and guaranteeing 100% of hackers, you know, versus the 99.9% that they provide.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   >> So they didn't like that too much.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   >> No, they didn't.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   They actually threatened litigation and insisted that we take it down.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   And it was --
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   >> Do they say we have a trademark?
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   >> Well, actually, they do.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   They have a series of trademarks with a number -- with the word hacker in it.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   You go to uspto.gov and search "scan alert."
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   You'll see.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   They're very aggressive in --
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   >> I didn't know you could trademark hackers.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   So what terms do they have trademark?
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   >> You know, I don't have that pulled up right now, but --
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   >> Obviously, hacker --
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   >> Hacker-safe, clearly.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   >> -- would be one of them, yeah.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   >> And you understand that.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   I mean, you don't want hackers and sites that -- you know, malicious sites to put that logo up.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   I mean, you kind of want to protect that.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   >> Exactly.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   I mean, I can appreciate, you know --
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   >> But they claim that you can't say hacker-proof either.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   >> Well, hacker-proofs someone else had filed for that a number of years ago, and they abandoned it.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   >> Oh.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   >> And I felt that, you know, all the registrations -- and I was a lawyer in my prior life before,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   I became a fashion designer for us geeks.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   And I'm a bit familiar with the registrations and whatnot.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   I don't think they had a legal leg to stand on.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   We made it really clear that the symbol did not look anything like their symbol.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   They used a green and white look and, you know, a little shield.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   We used a lock similar to the SSL lock that appears in your browser.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Used red colors.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   And they were very, very aggressive in their protection of this.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   And rather than, you know, go about a lawsuit and a fight, even though I knew I would win,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   I just decided it wasn't worth it.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   I'd been sued by Scott USA for the ski poles and goggles.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   I thought we were trying to copy them.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   And IBM threatened to sue us at one point because the E and Scottie Best resembled the E business solutions.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   All of which was unintentional.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   I did not, you know, hope that people would confuse a clothing company with IBM or with a ski pole maker.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   So, you know, it really --
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   You know what this reminds me of is this green bar now that you're seeing in some browsers.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   And that costs $1,500 a year.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   With that?
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Well, it's the anti-fishing thing.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   And Firefox does it, IE7 does it.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   But you have to buy a certificate.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   And, you know, it's a standard, which is great.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   But the certificate, this extended validation certificate or EVSSL is very expensive.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   And the whole -- you know, it's interesting we were talking about it on security now.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   The whole theory behind it is, well, in the old days, banks would big build big buildings
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   because that way you'd know that the bank wasn't fraudulent because a fly-by-night company couldn't big a build a big building.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   So we have to charge you $1,500 for this to prove that you're not a fly-by-night, you know, fishing site.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   And that just didn't make a lot of sense to me.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   But it has the upshot, and this does, too, of if you don't have that green bar, you don't have the hacker-proof logo,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   then there's somehow this feeling that you're not really safe.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   I don't know about that.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   I think almost every site I have ordered things off of does not have the hacker-proof green logo bar for the world.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Yeah, and it was Amazon doesn't do it.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Yeah, a lot of websites don't do it.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   I mean, did you feel --
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Once you're offended to it, you'll start to realize it's pretty prevalent.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   I'm not arguing that it's not prevalent, but I'm thinking about a lot of -- most of the major -- you know,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   most of the larger corporate e-commerce websites --
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   You know, big ones don't do it.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   I think they feel the same way as you do, Scott, like, "Who are these guys, and why should we have to do this?"
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   I'm glad that you decided not to cave into them, because I don't -- and I don't think anybody really --
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   really is going to say, "Oh, I don't see that song. What is it?"
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   I'm just sorry that you couldn't put your own sign up, and it's a shame that they claim, I mean, all rights to --
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   The use of the word hacker.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   That sounds like their main IP right there.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Those trademark names.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   We've created a lawyer backhand off.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Well, Scott, hey, it's great to talk to you. I thank you for stopping by, and I do want people to --
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   it's safe to visit ScottyVest.com.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Thank you.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   I assure you, and if you don't feel that way, well, you can always go to ThinkGeek.com.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Either way, we'd love you to take a look at these new Twit hoties. They're really great.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Scott, I'm going to let you go, because Franklin Harris is on the other line.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   I want to make sure that he can get on as well.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   I appreciate it.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   My pleasure.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Take care.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Have a great weekend.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Scott Jordan, always been one of the great guys in the business, and it's great to talk to him.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   I have a box, a care package for you guys.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   So I will make sure you get --
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Leo, can you hear me now?
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Couldn't I hear you before?
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Okay.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   No, you're saying that you couldn't hear me.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Oh, you had dropped off, and then we --
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Yeah, it's really weird.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   Skype.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   You know what's funny?
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   It's Patrick's Sounds Great.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Yay!
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   I've always had trouble -- Patrick's always had trouble.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Are you at work still, or did you go home?
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   No, I'm at work. I'm actually on -- I only pretty much only use two systems for this, and this is
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   actually running on my notebook rather than on these, you know, 4000 megahertz desktop.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   So the big story that broke today, Microsoft took a charge for $1 billion for Xbox 360 repair.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Holy moly.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.400]   Oh, you know what?
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:09.000]   I was listening to a bunch of the one-up guys talk about this, and the one thing nobody talked
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   about was that Microsoft -- Microsoft's going to miss a billion, a lot less than I'm going
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   to miss 100.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   I think the key here -- I agree.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   But I think the key is that Microsoft is finally admitting something that Xbox 360 owners have
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   known for a long time, that the failure rate on these things is pretty spectacularly high.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Some are saying -- Matt, I would agree with.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Yeah, sometimes I think 30 percent -- it's hard to find an Xbox 360 owner who hasn't had a
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   heat rate or heat-related failure, and this summer I think is -- they're dying in droves.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   Have any of you had Xbox 360 problems?
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   No, I've had some friends back.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Say again, Robert?
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.440]   My buddy just sent his back for an exchange for a new one, and I don't believe it was
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.440]   heat-related at all.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.840]   I believe I really would love to know that how many of these are more about the quality
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.960]   of electricity coming into a person's home than it does about the device itself.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:00.960]   And that new warranty that they've extended on the 360 is for the, I guess, the somewhat
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.960]   infamous three red light error.
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:03.960]   Right.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.120]   So if you do get one of those, you now have an extended one-year warranty on top of what
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.120]   you already had.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.120]   The red ring of death, we call that.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.720]   I have to say, I mean, I've got a 360, and I know at least four friends that have got
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.120]   a 360, and none of us have had any problems whatsoever.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.360]   Paul Therat has, like, knows everybody.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.400]   Paul's brought three back.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:25.000]   So I guess it's just -- maybe Paul's like skewing the average.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.680]   He said, "I've had one for -- I bought one, I guess, last Christmas, so it's only been
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.120]   six months, but I haven't had any trouble.
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.280]   But I don't play with it every day.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.080]   I'm sure you play with it all the time, Will."
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.880]   No, not so much.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.440]   I mean, I play with it a few times a week.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.960]   I actually use it more for watching TVDs than anything else.
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:43.960]   Me too.
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:48.400]   I mean, a lot of email, though, from Xbox, frustrated Xbox 360 owners, there's one site
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.240]   that asserts it's a 50% failure, right?
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.880]   People are just freaking out.
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:56.640]   And I just can't believe that they've screwed up the manufacturing to that degree.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.720]   Well, especially a year and a half later, you'd think that they've been --
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.920]   And I mean, you'd think that they'd have an understanding of what you can and can
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:04.920]   put out in the marketplace.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.280]   I mean, the Xbox was a fairly reliable machine.
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.040]   So what have they really stuffed up this time?
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.800]   Like, it can't be anything in the design because they'd understand the design, so it
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.800]   must be something.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.800]   Well, you know, I mean, it's purely based on manufacturing, surely.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:23.080]   Look, for one of a nail, a shoe was lost, for one of a shoe, a horse was lost.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.960]   We don't know what's causing the failures.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.280]   Is it a problem with resistors?
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.960]   Is it design flaws and inadequate cooling?
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.560]   Is it a bad assumption about obvious temperatures?
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.920]   Is her and right?
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:38.160]   Maybe they didn't bulletproof the power supply enough to compensate for voltage fluctuations
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.880]   in local areas.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:43.040]   I mean, there's so many ways places things can break.
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.800]   And this is essentially a very complicated computer.
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.880]   Microsoft was saying it's not any one problem.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.680]   They say it has 1,700 components and 500 million transistors.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.840]   There's three power PC processors in there.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.840]   There is a lot of heat in that sucker.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.840]   Definitely.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.520]   But interestingly, if there had been an issue, you'd think they would have redesigned something
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.520]   with the Elite.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.880]   And that's pretty much the same, I think, internally.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:09.840]   Anyway, I'm sure it has a handful of those fixes, though.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:14.840]   My buddy, when he did swap out his last 360, which about two weeks ago, he ended up getting
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:15.840]   the Elite.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.920]   And he claims it is a more stable unit compared to the first unit he had certain games, especially
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:25.480]   for him, were driving him crazy back when Madden was still for the Madden 2006 at the
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.480]   time.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.440]   But that was one title that we were never able to really get into because that was one
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.080]   that would simply lock up his console every time we tried to play it.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.040]   For any extended period of time.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:41.240]   His new Elite, though, is at least so far has been dramatically more stable.
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.960]   They also have a problem people have reported with gouging discs.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.520]   Has anybody seen this one where you'll put a disc in it?
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.520]   It'll come out.
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:54.040]   That can happen on just about any game console that you can turn vertically or lay flat.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:58.160]   If you have it upright and you bang it, or it starts rocking back and forth, or you lay
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.440]   it down while the disc is spinning, you run that red.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.440]   Or they're turning it.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:12.360]   Well, I mean, it's also because it's one up has a really good interview with Peter Moore
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:17.800]   that they put together today or yesterday.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:22.120]   With Mike and, excuse me, with Peter Moore.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:25.680]   He talks about like, they've had 10 million units out there.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:30.920]   They're analyzing the data and they've been redesigning the machine as they go along.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:35.600]   But it does seem to be a lot of recurring issues.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.320]   If you thought you'd buy a PlayStation 3 instead because of the rumors, there was going to be
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.560]   a $100 price drop and dream on.
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.520]   Sony's president said, "Nope, we're not dropping the price."
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:49.440]   Even though nobody's buying the PS3, we're going to still try to get 700 bucks out of
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.000]   you for it.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.520]   No, because they just launched a $500 Blu-ray player and that has to be the low price Blu-ray
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.440]   player for at least six months.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.440]   That's a good point.
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.440]   They can't undercut the Blu-ray player.
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.520]   No, it was the PS3, was the cheapest Blu-ray player.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.160]   But now it's Sony's, I think it's their BD 300.
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.160]   Have you played with it?
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.600]   Not yet, but a friend of mine just bought one.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.560]   I've been meaning to borrow it for an afternoon just to test it out.
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:19.120]   I'm about to receive a Samsung's new BDP 1200, which should be a very sweet Blu-ray player
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.320]   with a great video process.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:23.120]   Where do you come down on the Blu-ray HD DVD?
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.880]   Is there one that you think is better?
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.480]   Yeah, personally, at the very given moment and since the beginning, I really feel that
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.160]   the HD DVD had an advantage and still does for a couple of reasons.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.640]   One, the hardware has been consistent since launch.
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.560]   There is no difference between a player.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:40.160]   You would have purchased at the beginning of the launch of the HDVD format compared to
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.160]   today's hardware.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.760]   Whereas with the Blu-ray hardware, you're looking at significant changes before the end of the
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:50.240]   year to add things like persistent storage, like a little bit of flash RAM, a network
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.760]   connection for internet-enabled features.
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:56.040]   All of these things are coming before the end of the year and while you will be able to
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.720]   play these new titles that support those features in the Blu-ray format on older players, you
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.680]   won't be able to take advantage of any of these new upcoming features unless you get
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:07.640]   yet another new piece of hardware to play it on.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.640]   That's really minor.
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.480]   If you love movies, it really doesn't matter.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:15.760]   Both formats offer literally identical performance in terms of resolution and audio support and
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:16.760]   everything else.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.880]   It is a really nothing that for me.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:19.880]   It is addictive.
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:24.640]   I watched the Xbox 360 HD DVD and it's just hard not to fall in love with it.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.640]   I mean, it looks so good.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.640]   You have a pretty decent HDTV as well.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.880]   That's the whole thing.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:35.440]   Once you start really getting into the HD movies, you're spoiled almost immediately.
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.440]   It's hard.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.440]   It's hard to go back.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:42.880]   Survey says, "Customers prefer plasma."
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:47.760]   They surveyed a number of people, which is interesting, the widespread point of view
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:55.920]   that many customers have is that plasma is somehow better than LCD.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.480]   I know you've said it depends on where you're watching, right?
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:03.240]   The thing I liked about that story was that they even made it clear that these weren't
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.840]   right out of the box.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.160]   They set them up properly with LCDs and plasmas.
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.480]   They actually sat them down in front of it and said, "What do you like better?"
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.480]   Right.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:18.240]   It doesn't surprise me.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.200]   Probably viewing angle has something to do with that.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:24.320]   Even with the better LCDs out there right now, if you get as little as 15 or 20 degrees
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:28.360]   off center, you start to see significant color loss and things like that.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.760]   The whole motion performance thing was brought up.
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.360]   There is significant blurring compared to other display technologies.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:39.680]   When you look at LCD versus a plasma display or most rear projection technologies too.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:43.200]   If you look at a lot of fast moving images, well, the one that gives you the clearer
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:48.520]   picture is going to cause less eye fatigue and usually more pleasurable to watch.
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.520]   I do like how plasma looks, I have to say.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:55.680]   The only thing that plasma really had kind of slipped on a little bit was just straight
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.600]   up resolution, putting more pixels on the screen.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:04.960]   Now, especially with the latest release of Panasonic's Glass, they're offering 42 to
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:09.640]   65 inches and all sizes in between available at 1080p now.
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.680]   I'm looking forward to seeing that.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:16.400]   However, though, I was in the store shopping for a new 50 plus inch flat panel for a friend
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:23.040]   of mine and I was staring him toward the plasma displays, but in store lighting, that
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:27.760]   glass that you see with plasma display, glare everywhere.
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:34.240]   The bright detailed picture you get with an LCD with minimal reflection is hard to ignore
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.760]   that and you ended up going LCD for that reason alone.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:41.520]   Yeah, I think in a bright room, you do want to go LCD generally.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.520]   Almost.
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:50.400]   However, I just finished a review of Samsung's new 52 inch T series LCD and they put a clear
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.800]   coat on top of the display that makes it look very plasma like and it does improve black
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:21:00.200]   level and color saturation, the apparent color saturation anyway.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:04.560]   But it now takes that one thing that LCD kind of had really dominated and that was the
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.640]   matte screen.
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.360]   It's good at minimizing light reflections and now here it is glossy and reflective as can
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.160]   be, which is kind of funny.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.080]   Bad day for piracy all well bad and then good again.
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.120]   All of MP3 has been shut down by the Russian government.
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.120]   We've been talking about all of MP3.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.640]   I think since Twit began.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:27.880]   This is the site looked so professional, so real claim to be paying.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:28.880]   Before then.
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:34.720]   Yeah, claim to be paying money to artists through some Russian agency.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.680]   Finally after pressure from the World Trade Organization, the Kremlin has taken the website
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:42.360]   down by the way, it's like whack-a-mole.
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:45.120]   It's already back up with a different name.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.040]   All the same songs.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.040]   Do you think they'll?
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:51.760]   Yeah, and if you've got an account of all of MP3, you've also got an account of the new
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.760]   one as well.
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:53.760]   Yeah, isn't that interesting?
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.240]   They transferred to the accounts.
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.240]   MP3sparks.com.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.240]   Hmm.
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.720]   Which is down at the moment.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.720]   Oh, it is.
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.720]   Interesting.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.160]   Do you think the Russian government really has the will to keep following these guys
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.880]   around and shutting them down?
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.840]   I've really got the will to join the WTO.
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:11.840]   Maybe they do.
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:12.840]   Yeah.
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:13.840]   Oh, you're right.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.320]   MP3sparks is gone.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.320]   Huh.
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.320]   Huh.
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:22.120]   But I want to buy cheap pirated music.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.120]   Aww.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.960]   Well, you know, it's, I mean, you laugh, right?
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.400]   But I mean, think about it.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:34.120]   You're essentially, you know, international policy is being declared by the recording industry.
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.120]   Well, that's right.
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.680]   Darrice is a dictated.
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:37.680]   Yeah.
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.200]   So on one hand, it's like, okay, you know, stopping piracy.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.200]   It's good for Americans.
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:46.120]   But on the other hand, it's like, wow, doesn't our federal government have more interesting
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.920]   things to lean on people about?
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.040]   I've got three stories that really belong together, but that I'm not sure how they
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.040]   could be tied together.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.120]   Bill Gates, no longer the world's richest man.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:23:00.640]   He will be speaking at CES and NASA buys a $19 million toilet.
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.960]   Somehow these, these belong together.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.480]   How about a moment of silence?
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.480]   For how long?
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.480]   He's been like 13 years.
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.480]   He's been the world's richest man.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.440]   Bill Gates now number two.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.440]   Behind who?
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:16.480]   Carlos Slim, the guy with the billionaire with the best name in the world.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.480]   That is.
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.840]   That's got to be a fake name.
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.360]   A new pseudonym.
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.640]   Oh, I am Carlos Slim.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:27.640]   I'm worth $67.8 billion.
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.480]   But what it shows really is the value of telecommunications.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.040]   Yeah, I was going to say.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.120]   Mexican telecom stocks did him well.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.120]   They did him well.
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.360]   But you know, if you look at the top, what is it?
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:43.000]   50 billionaires or whatever the, I can't say 50 or 100.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.840]   There's a lot of telecom guys new on this list.
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:49.480]   I mean, telecom is definitely the place to be right now.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:50.960]   And I think that shows you what's happening.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.720]   I mean, software was the place to be.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:58.200]   Michael Dell and Bill Gates are still on the list, but you see in these telecom guys up
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.040]   and coming big time.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:03.960]   Is any of it VOIP related or is it really just the people with the hardware out there
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.840]   doing things like cellular technology?
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.920]   Cell phones, pretty much, isn't it?
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.080]   Seems that way.
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:13.080]   Carlos Slim, he also owns part of a cop USA.
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:16.720]   In the case you didn't know.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:22.880]   There's a bill Gates has been doing the keynote at CES for the last 10 years.
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.680]   Might be his last time though.
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:29.720]   Yeah, we'll be stepping down next year as an ES chief architect or whatever he is at Microsoft
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.440]   and say this is going to be his final who wrong.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.920]   He talked about this in January.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:40.480]   We weren't sure if he'd come back in CES '08 and now he said yes.
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:44.280]   I think I'm going to have to go to CES this year just to see it, just to say goodbye.
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.480]   Don't you think it'll be like Elvis retiring?
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.920]   Yeah, I mean, Gates keynote is a CES.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.400]   They're always actually pretty well received.
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:55.560]   Although a lot of people sort of criticize him for being a sort of maybe not the best
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.240]   public speaker all the time.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.400]   The stuff that he does there is usually pretty interesting.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:03.240]   I mean, he has a memorable one with tone in it and stuff all the way.
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:06.320]   But unlike Steve, there's always something that breaks.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.320]   Like Jobs like, you know.
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.320]   That's part of the fun of it.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:16.600]   Yeah, it's like what's going to fail for Microsoft Gates on this keynote presentation?
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:21.160]   He doesn't have the swab sophistication of Steve Jobs, but what they do is they spend
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:26.360]   a lot of money and they get big name celebrities and they get special movies.
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.360]   So it is more interesting.
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.200]   I mean, the set is beautiful.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.040]   This is going to be, this will be, I think this will be a big one, right?
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:36.520]   This is, this is, I mean, unless he's going to come back, he even said this in January,
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.000]   unless they want me to come back and talk about world immunization.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.600]   I'm not going to have a lot to say after 2008.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:48.120]   So who would you bring in for CES 2009?
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.600]   Steve Jobs.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.840]   It's his year, isn't it?
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:51.840]   He's the Elvis.
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:52.840]   He's the Elvis.
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.320]   Who'd you get to top Bill Gates?
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.880]   Well, it's going to be Steve Jobs surely.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:02.440]   Even though Apple's such a small player in the PC world, are they maybe by 2009, they
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.440]   won't be such a small player?
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.480]   Well, you're also defining the PC.
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:13.280]   Gates isn't the head of, isn't the key noteer at CES because he's, he's, he's hard to
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:17.800]   the PC world because they're probably investing the most money and buying the biggest booth.
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:18.800]   Oh, there you go.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:19.800]   Yes.
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:20.800]   Of course.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:21.800]   That's one of my thinking.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:26.360]   The consumer electronics world where the iPod owns what 87% of the MP3 player, which
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.720]   is, you know, but Apple doesn't buy a booth at CES.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.880]   So there's a music show though.
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.520]   It's really about personal computers and computing technology.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.200]   CES is not about computing.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.200]   It's about everything.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.680]   It's about everything.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.680]   Everything under the sun.
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:39.680]   Computing it.
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.680]   It just, you know, it's just because it's so soon.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.680]   How about Carlos Slim?
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:42.680]   Let's give that back to you.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.000]   I can't really, I should take that back to you.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.440]   There is some really high end audio as well.
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.440]   It is.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.080]   Yeah, there's TVs is yeah.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:51.080]   Comdex is just gone.
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.760]   I mean, that that was the computer show.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:53.920]   That's gone.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:54.920]   What's that?
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:55.920]   What was com?
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:01.880]   You know, someday we'll be saying, I remember there was something called comdex.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.640]   People go, what are you talking about, grandpa?
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.840]   Shut up and play with your iPhone.
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.680]   I saw my first ethernet adapter.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:13.040]   Okay, we've been putting off the iPhone stories.
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.920]   There are quite a few cringey.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:15.920]   Actually, go ahead.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.960]   One question before the iPhone festival.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.800]   Anybody care about E3 being next week?
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.760]   You remember the electronic or the public, though?
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:24.760]   Or is it even?
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:25.760]   What happened?
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:26.760]   They closed.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:27.760]   They've moved it.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.520]   Well, what's interesting, right?
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.040]   It's no longer the big giant show at the Las Vegas Convention Center.
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:37.080]   They've got it in Santa Monica for the guys that are going down there.
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:40.360]   They've got to do appointments all over hotels, all over Santa Monica.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.160]   And then I guess that's not a big convention town.
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:48.680]   Well, what's interesting is they are going to be using an aircraft hanger to have a somewhere
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:52.560]   near there, I guess, in Santa Monica to have sort of a central zone to keep the convention
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:56.200]   center, Las Vegas Convention and Tourism Bureau or something.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.280]   This is the rumor I was told from...
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.520]   E3 has always been in LA, number one.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:01.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:06.360]   And LA Convention Center, if they're not using that, then, well, oh, boo-hoo, I guess they're
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:07.360]   just spreading it out.
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.680]   But I thought it was shut down.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.920]   Is it practically shut down?
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.920]   It's back now as a kind of a...
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:12.920]   What is it?
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:13.920]   A press-only event?
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:14.920]   What is it?
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:15.920]   It's basically a press-only event.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:20.920]   And it's more of an affiliated gathering of sweets than an actual sort of big center event.
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.120]   It's going to be interesting here.
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:25.960]   The guys, the game guys are actually freaking out because they've got to go to...
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:29.080]   Instead of being able to run around the show floor and figure out what the big surprise
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:32.440]   stories are, because you kind of go and know them what a lot of the big stories are going
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:38.640]   to be, they've literally got to do 20 vendor meetings on the Wednesday of the first day
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.680]   of the show to figure out what everybody's got.
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.240]   So they're running all over the place.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.240]   Well, yeah, wait.
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.840]   But think about it, dude.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:51.160]   If this whole event is about the press and you're starting out by ticking off the press,
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:54.640]   that sounds like every other trade show we do.
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:58.280]   I know, but E3 sounds like my experience at E3.
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.800]   That was at Zoo.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:03.800]   I'd love to see them break that up and shrink it down just from the side of E3.
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.920]   Well, it seems like they've actually made it even uglier than CES because instead of
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:12.400]   everybody being in a hotel and running from suite to suite or from like, you know, booth
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:16.080]   to booth in that nightmare at the Las Vegas Convention Center, they've got people that
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:21.160]   are going to have to get into a car in LA and drive to your meeting in the next hotel.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:22.280]   But it's just like, it's so funny.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:26.720]   It's like, is anybody, the other thing it said, it's going to change the way people
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:30.000]   are marketing their games because they're not going to be spending all the money on the
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.560]   booths and there's going to be a lot more junk at base coverage and permission.
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:38.680]   And of course, there's the sort of pseudo competing event, which is a couple months later
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.320]   in Santa Monica, right?
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.480]   Which is open to the public.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:46.360]   So there's like, they've taken the massive E3 event and split it up into sort of the
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.080]   journalistic end and the public end.
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:52.400]   And you know, conceivably it could cost more.
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:57.200]   Oh, I don't, you know, there's so much money in gaming.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.280]   I don't think it really matters.
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.280]   Does it?
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.840]   It's going to, it's going to go forward no matter what.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:01.840]   It does.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:06.280]   If you're one of the smaller titles at a place like EA, you feel like you're wasting your
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.600]   cause they've, they basically, they pull what I never knew is they pull the, they pull
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:13.840]   the money for these big trade shows or for E3, they pulled it out of the individual marketing
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:18.000]   budget for every game rather than being some central corporate expense.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   So that's why a lot of the product managers have hated E3.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.160]   Not just because it was kind of a, you know, strange place where they're getting yelled
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:30.640]   at by angry blogging children, but because, you know, it was pulling their marketing budget
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.760]   away from this big central effort.
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:37.000]   So they pay, I'll pay for this huge booth where nobody pays attention to their game because
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.680]   super giant first person shooter is taking all the space.
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.680]   Did you see this?
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.960]   The guy killed by his cell phone exploding.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.560]   No, is it true?
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:48.560]   I don't know.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:53.400]   Because this comes from China, although it's published by Wired, a wired blog.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.680]   Is it a, like a wire story?
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:00.840]   Um, you know, it doesn't say what the provenance is of this.
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:04.840]   A worker died yesterday, almost three weeks after his cell phone exploded in his chest
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:05.840]   pocket.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:15.400]   Zhao Jin-ping of a Gansu China had a Motorola handset and they, that maybe it was the high
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:18.120]   temperatures, official investigations are underway.
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:19.120]   Reports seem to apply.
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:25.800]   The phone was so badly damaged that ascertaining the exact, you know, what back in 2003, there
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:30.440]   were a bunch of Nokia phones that were exploding and burning people.
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:35.240]   And it was almost Nokia claimed it was almost entirely due to bad counterfeit batteries.
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:40.040]   I could say, I think that's the case because the key on an all lithium ion batteries, you
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.520]   got to stop charging when it's full.
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:44.680]   If you keep going, bye bye.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.440]   And if these cheesy batteries don't have the proper circuitry, you're, you're, you could
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.680]   be in trouble.
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.680]   Let's see what this is from.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.920]   It's from new launches.com.
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:56.160]   I never even heard of this, this site.
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.440]   There's a picture of the phone there.
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.880]   It doesn't look good.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:04.320]   Motorola's Beijing representatives say the company is not to be blamed and think that it
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.520]   was either a fake cell phone or a fake battery.
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:09.040]   I think that's probably the case.
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:15.280]   Nevertheless scary for that poor bastard, maybe, but maybe that's why Apple didn't allow you
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.280]   to remove the battery.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.560]   There's no chance of it exploding now.
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:21.240]   Hey, you know what else is up on that website?
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.240]   What?
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.840]   Will your suffering will soon be over?
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:27.920]   Amazon UK starts advertising the iPhone at 329 pounds.
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:30.600]   And first is a delivery date.
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.600]   How much is that?
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.400]   How much is that in real money?
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.400]   $650.
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.840]   Not that much more.
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.880]   No, it's, I mean, it's, it's rubbish.
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:44.680]   We've had, if you've been a Brit following the iPhone all week, there's just been rumor
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:48.080]   after rumor after rumor about which carrier.
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.080]   It looks like over here.
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.520]   It's going to get to the contrary.
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:56.280]   No, because, oh, you know, that story ran, you know, with the typical sources close to
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:01.240]   the deal and then O2 denied and then it was, oh, Vodafone has its sources close to the deal.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.240]   No, that was done.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.840]   Oh, there's a T-Mobile graphic in the eye.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:05.840]   No, well, they denied it.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.920]   Well, T-Mobile got it in Germany, right?
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.280]   And orange has it in France.
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.080]   No, because it's all rumors.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.880]   Nobody has confirmed anything.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:18.760]   And the trouble is eventually, you know, every reporter on the planet eventually ends
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:23.120]   up saying that everybody has got the contract and then somebody is right a month down the
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.120]   line.
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.400]   One of them will definitely have it.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:27.400]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:28.600]   I mean, that's exactly it.
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:33.640]   Cringley says the good news is that there will be what Apple's strategy was.
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:37.760]   Now, Cringley is just making this up, I understand, but this is his thesis.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:41.920]   Apple's strategy was they would, you know, they want to have a big Christmas selling season.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:45.680]   They rolled it out now so they get all the bugs worked out and they'll ship the 3G phone
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:50.600]   with everything fixed for Christmas.
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.760]   So maybe you're going to get the good one.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:56.920]   Yeah, I don't believe that.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.280]   I said Patrick back in.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.760]   He got bumped off.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:00.760]   Sorry about that.
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:02.160]   You don't believe that?
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.160]   Why not?
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:08.840]   Well, because I mean, they're saying that the main concern with 3G was battery life.
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:09.840]   Really?
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:10.840]   And the rollout.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:11.840]   And I think that's true.
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.280]   Anybody who has an HSDPA phone knows it.
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:17.880]   It's just, but you said, you know, we seriously think that in the next four months, they can
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:22.200]   advance battery technology, create a new hardware revision and rollout and you sell it
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.200]   in a network.
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:26.720]   And it will be a tricorder that we'll can be able to diagnose any illness.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:27.720]   You know what?
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:28.800]   I think they can do it.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:34.320]   I think this is the beta iPhone that Leo spent hundreds of dollars on.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:37.440]   700, 600 bucks, and waited in line six hours.
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.160]   And since my time is worth, gosh, hundreds of dollars an hour.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:43.040]   Really, the effective cost of this was thousands.
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:46.840]   You know, you really need to hire an intern to wait online to buy your products.
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:47.840]   It was so sweet.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:48.840]   Dane came and sat with me.
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.000]   He went the very next day without the line.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   I know.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   Isn't that fun?
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   Actually, most places sold out.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   They are sold out now.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   Some did.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.040]   Lots of people told stories about walking in even that evening after the line cleared and
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.560]   just strolling and saying, I'll take two.
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.120]   Anyway, I had to, I have a reason.
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:09.480]   It wasn't because I, you know, I had to have it for the radio show the next day and I just
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:15.320]   need to imagine me going on the radio and saying the iPhone looks pretty good.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:16.320]   Don't have one.
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:19.920]   I had to, I had to have one so I could review it.
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.920]   I'm still using it by the way.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:21.920]   I'm pretty happy with it.
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:22.920]   I like it.
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.520]   There are obvious negatives on the thing.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:25.520]   It's been hacked already.
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.520]   And guess who did it?
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:27.520]   DVD John.
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:30.800]   Yeah, it's not the, it's not my favorite DVD John hack.
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.800]   It's like, okay.
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.640]   So, you know, kind of a crap hack.
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:37.720]   You can, you can sort of not activate it and have Wi-Fi and basically.
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:40.040]   Basically, Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi web browsing and MP3 playing.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.080]   $700 iPod is basically.
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.080]   No, no, no.
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.520]   The best eight gigabyte iPod ever.
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:49.240]   Well, I have to say it is, it is, it is a great iPod.
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:53.080]   I mean, a plus on on this one, Apple definitely made the best iPod they've ever made.
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.080]   It's beautiful.
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:56.560]   The screen is stunning.
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:57.840]   And it's great to watch video on.
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:01.040]   It's great to listen to music on the cover flow works.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.040]   So there's no question about that.
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:03.040]   It's pretty good phone.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:06.560]   I have the biggest issues are, you know, the fact that it's a locked platform.
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:10.800]   I can't think of a single smartphone that doesn't let you, at least I would like to
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.520]   replace the stock button.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:16.640]   Couldn't care less what Apple stock price is with, with something useful like a to-do
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:19.480]   list, which doesn't come on the phone.
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.480]   It's just bizarre.
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:26.040]   I mean, I think it's a 30 minute or longer phone call with the iPhone yet.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:28.040]   No, I don't usually talk that long.
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.040]   Why?
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.040]   What happens?
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.040]   I was just saying it just seems uncomfortable to hold that.
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.040]   I agree with you.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.040]   Face for any like the time.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.040]   So you probably wouldn't want to do that.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:39.280]   But you know, the earbuds that come with it actually work very well and sound very good
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.280]   too.
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.280]   Oh, there you go.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:45.680]   So for as a hands-free it works fine works with any Bluetooth hands-free device as well.
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:50.840]   And Apple will have its highly overpriced version soon, I believe.
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:55.440]   There are some issues about singular voicemail being or AT&T singular voicemail being susceptible
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.640]   to a caller ID spoofing.
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:58.640]   Ew.
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:36:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:01.440]   That's been weird.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:06.080]   I've been a singular customer for a while and watching this AT&T singular conversion has
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:08.880]   been very peculiar as a customer.
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:14.040]   So what you use is you get a calling card from spoofcard.com and that lets you spoof
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.960]   your caller ID.
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:17.440]   You call your cell phone.
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:20.680]   This is to test to see if the problem exists on your system.
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:23.880]   With your spoof card, when it asks you what number you want to spoof, you enter your number
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:28.600]   again, don't answer the phone when the call goes to voicemail.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.600]   See if you can listen to your messages without being prompt for a password.
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:34.400]   Apparently, many people have this problem.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:38.240]   You just spoof your number, pretend you're calling to yourself.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:43.040]   And because it says, it looks, it says, well, clearly if the person has the originating number,
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:45.080]   it must be you.
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:48.400]   And of course, you can spoof that number.
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.240]   So I think that's just turn on the phone.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.240]   A-fear, isn't it?
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.960]   You see you have to go in and turn on the password.
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:53.960]   Turn on the password.
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:54.960]   I mean, you just have to worry.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.440]   Pretty leaky, uh, insecurity there, isn't it?
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:58.640]   Well, you know what?
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:37:59.640]   It's the spoof cards, though.
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:04.040]   They've been people of users to emulate, you know, people they wanted to pretend to
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:09.520]   be, they were calling from, there was a, a representative's office that somebody hacked.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:12.040]   So people were getting calls, badmouthing representative.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.040]   Ooh, ow.
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:15.040]   From his own office.
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:19.360]   Hey, let's add Franklin Harrison to the call here right now.
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:22.160]   If you want to leave, Patrick, I know you had to go at 430 if you want to split.
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.160]   You can't.
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.160]   Oh, I'm late.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.160]   It's been a pleasure, everybody.
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.160]   Thanks.
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.160]   Thanks, Pat.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:28.160]   Watch dl.tv.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.160]   Please do.
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.160]   Anything else you want to plug?
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.160]   Hey, have a great weekend.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.160]   That's a good thing to plug.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:38.400]   Oh, and moms in, uh, not in Selena in, uh, yeah, Selena, Utah.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.600]   What is it, a race?
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:40.600]   It's a restaurant.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.800]   Mons in Selena, Utah.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:43.800]   Moms, moms.
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:44.800]   Really?
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.080]   Moms Cafe in Utah.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:48.320]   You ate at a place called Moms and you lived?
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:51.240]   Uh, it's a, it, it started in, uh, 1928.
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.600]   Oh, it's a venerable institution.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.200]   Original moms.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.160]   It may be the original moms.
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:00.120]   My wife highly recommends the blueberry sour cream pie.
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.520]   I will stick with the scones.
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:02.760]   Ooh, that's it.
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:03.760]   Not Selena, Kansas.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:04.760]   Selena, Utah.
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:05.760]   Selena, Utah.
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:06.760]   Mom.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:07.760]   Yeah, well, 10 East Main Street.
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:08.760]   You can't miss it.
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:09.760]   You know what?
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:10.760]   Just north of 70.
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.400]   They don't have a website, but there are reviews of them.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.400]   They're, yes.
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:16.040]   At roadfood.com, splendidtable.publicradio.org.
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.760]   It apparently is quite well known.
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.360]   Yes, it's a, it's a classic.
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:25.200]   And by the way, the, the folks, the new biography of the road foods folks is an outstanding
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.200]   read.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.000]   He just, they just wrote a book.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   Oh yeah.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   Who are they?
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.280]   Is that the, uh, is that the couple?
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:33.960]   They're the couple that, that rates.
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.080]   Yeah, I've interviewed them.
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.080]   They're wonderful.
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:40.400]   And the, they've just did a, uh, they just wrote a book, uh, two for the road.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.000]   I don't know how recently they wrote it.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.100]   But it's basically, it's kind of an autobiographical discussion of finding all these, you know, home
[00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:48.920]   town small restaurants.
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:50.200]   It's an epic read.
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.200]   It's great.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.200]   Anyhow.
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.400]   So we've got two plugs.
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:54.400]   I don't know.
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.320]   I'm going to have to look and see if that's an audible.com because that could be our audible
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.320]   book of the week.
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.320]   We'll find out.
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.320]   That would be cool.
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:00.320]   Thank you, Patrick.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.320]   Oh, my pleasure.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:02.320]   Take care.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.320]   Take care.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.880]   Um, Patrick had to run and, uh, for people who were saying, where's Devorak?
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:08.560]   Uh, he couldn't make it today, but we've got Franklin Harris on the line along with Will
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:09.560]   Harris.
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:10.760]   So that's very confusing.
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:11.760]   And Robert Herron.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.760]   That's the H's version of Twit.
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:17.960]   I'm not even going to attempt my British accent.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:21.680]   Frank is, uh, is, is actually an L, but I always think of him as a Harris.
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:23.000]   Hey, Frank, how you doing?
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   Good.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   Good.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   How is everyone doing this fine day?
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.320]   Frank is, uh, as a good friend who's been on the call for help in the lab many times
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:34.360]   and also has promised his sworn to hack the iPhone.
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:37.200]   Now you have to drive to Buffalo to get one because he's.
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:41.520]   Yeah, I actually did on, uh, on release day drive all the way to Buffalo only to
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:45.800]   find out that I needed a credit card draft that at a US bank before the AT&T store would
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:46.800]   give it to me.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:47.800]   So you didn't get one?
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:51.200]   No, there was like, there was 60 people in line at the Apple store in the Walden Gallery
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:54.040]   and Buffalo and like five at the AT&T store.
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:55.440]   Oh man, I'm sorry.
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:57.400]   So we'll get you one.
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.400]   We'll get you one.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.400]   There have been some hacks.
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:02.120]   We mentioned the DVD John hack, which is underwhelming.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:05.840]   Well, I mean, I was looking over the source code.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:10.400]   I downloaded the source code directly from his site, uh, where he released the activation
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:15.600]   server and it seems to me that the interaction between iTunes and the activation system at
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:17.600]   AT&T is not encrypted.
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:18.760]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:19.760]   So that's how I figured it out.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:20.760]   He just sniffed it.
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:22.240]   Sniffed it, sniffed the traffic.
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:25.040]   I mean, someone was bound to do that.
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.520]   People have also figured out that you can remove the SIM card.
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:28.680]   There's all sorts of shenanigans.
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.440]   You can play with that.
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:33.880]   You can't take your existing SIM card though and pop it into your iPhone.
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:39.200]   No, you can't, but you can't take your iPhone SIM card and pop it into any AT&T phone.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:44.480]   If you want to travel somewhere and maybe not damage your iPhone, that works just fine.
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:48.520]   The real question is how soon before we can get Will Harris an unlocked iPhone?
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.520]   Yes, please God.
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:57.280]   As soon as I see this, I'm on a plane for your benefit and for Frank's benefit, I asked
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:02.560]   AT&T when I was there and they said, well, there here's the issue is if you roam for more
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:08.040]   than two months in a country outside of the US, we will brick your iPhone.
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:11.480]   It's in the contract.
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:13.840]   I could bring it over.
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:17.120]   You could use it for two months, but we'd have to get it back in the US every two months.
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:21.320]   I'm sure there are also what we have left at Elling.
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:25.800]   You're probably saying there's services that will do this?
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.880]   I believe so, definitely for what?
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:31.320]   For the price, you just put it on the Virgin Atlantic.
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.680]   You make one call in the US and you fly back.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:38.680]   I was going to say, can we activate one here and just send it to Europe for them?
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:39.680]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:42.760]   You do that, but you can absolutely.
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:46.760]   If I go to Canada and I could bring one up for Frank and Amber and everybody, but the
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:50.760]   problem is after two months in Canada being used in Canada, it'll stop working.
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:55.960]   Also, the other problem is that I would have to pay American roaming charges for every
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:57.120]   cool price.
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.120]   Right.
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.800]   Another reason why, and this is actually good to know, that's how you can get out of a
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:05.680]   contract because they don't want you to roam that much because they end up observing a
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.680]   lot of that cost.
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:10.400]   How's Ringo supposed to be a software push for the iPhone yesterday?
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:11.400]   Did that happen?
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:12.400]   Oh, really?
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:13.400]   Was it updated?
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.400]   That's what I was told or I was reading.
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:18.800]   They were talking about July 5th being the great software push for a new update.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.560]   Now, I was just curious if anybody had seen it.
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:21.640]   Yeah, it hasn't happened yet.
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:26.160]   I had heard rumors that that would happen, but I synced my iPhone today and it did not
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:27.360]   give me any new software.
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:28.360]   So we're still at 1.0.
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:33.920]   But I mean, people are predicting that it'll be unlocked before the weekend is done.
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.520]   Frank, what do you think?
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:36.920]   I'll put my money on that.
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.600]   I'll definitely put money on that.
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:43.440]   Maybe not the weekend, but definitely by mid next week, people have taken this thing apart.
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:48.120]   They've already figured out the root password for the actual version of OS 10 that's on
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:49.120]   the software.
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:50.120]   Now, what does that give you?
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:51.880]   If you can get the root password, what is it?
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:57.280]   Right now, absolutely nothing, but it directs access to the operating system, which will
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:02.560]   allow people to figure out exactly what type of security they've got to keep the phone
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:08.000]   locked down or what's called the PLU code for the phone to unlock it.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.440]   So is there a central site where this is going on that you could go to to keep an eye on
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:13.440]   things?
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:19.240]   Most of the discussions are happening on kind of backroom IRC channels, to be honest with
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.240]   you.
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:23.800]   That's where I've been hiding out under an unassumed alias.
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:24.800]   What people are doing.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:29.600]   So unlock your iPhone.com is not necessarily the place to go to find out what's going on.
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.080]   Was that Scott Bourns site?
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.080]   No.
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:35.840]   Scott Bourn has not done that site yet.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:39.800]   How are they pushing out the software?
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:40.880]   They're doing it over the network?
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.200]   Or will they be doing it with the Wi-Fi?
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:44.200]   Does anyone know?
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:45.200]   Won't be Wi-Fi.
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:48.400]   It will be through iTunes.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:52.240]   As far as I know, the same way that you update an iPod is a firmware update that iTunes
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:53.240]   will apply.
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:56.320]   It's not just iTunes.
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:01.080]   When you dock an iPhone, you get just like you do with Apple TV or an iPod, you get a
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:04.120]   new page, a new button on your iTunes.
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:05.720]   It's your iPhone.
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:08.920]   And right in the front there it says, "How often do you want me to check for firmware
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:10.480]   updates?"
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:11.480]   And you can check.
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:16.000]   So in other words, if you unlock it using this DVD John unlock, even if you're using
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.160]   the Wi-Fi, I think you're safe.
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:19.000]   I don't think anybody knows you're on an iPhone.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.440]   No, you can only push something to you.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:26.440]   You have to be on the three store and iTunes and revert right back to the pre-activation
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:28.240]   state on the iPhone.
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:32.920]   Well, you'd have to get a fresh iTunes though, because you have to hack the iTunes as well
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:35.600]   as the iPhone for DVDs John's thing to work.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:39.600]   Yeah, but I mean, you just install iTunes, you use a friend's copy of iTunes or a different
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:45.600]   computer you might have laying around.
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:46.600]   It's interesting.
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:48.560]   There's been a backlash against iPhone.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:54.080]   A lot of people, in fact, a lot of the press, I think covering iPhone failures may be a
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:59.040]   little bit more assiduously, enthusiastically than they would have had there not been so
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.440]   much promotion on the iPhone.
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:06.000]   Chiefly comes to mind and one that got a lot of coverage on all the local news is the
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:12.960]   MSNBC reporter Joe Hutsko, who had an iPhone die on him.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:15.920]   But I mean, they sold a million of these guys.
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:17.680]   Kevin had a lot of problems with his iPhone.
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:19.040]   Kevin's was rebooting all day.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:20.040]   He brought it in.
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:21.640]   Kevin Rose we're talking about.
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:22.840]   Tried to get him on the show, couldn't do it.
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:23.840]   He's very busy.
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:24.840]   He's got a new product.
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:27.040]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:28.560]   But yeah, his die.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:33.720]   But as with Hutsko, you bring it in to Apple and they say, "Oh, well, here's a new one."
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:38.360]   It's not like a big deal, right?
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:40.400]   Apple's created a marketing frenzy with this thing.
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:41.560]   People are bound to unlock it.
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:46.240]   There's people all over the world like Will and myself that are just dying to get not only
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:49.880]   their hands on one, but one that actually has the phone features enabled.
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:51.360]   That's the key, right?
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:54.760]   You don't care if it's a $700 iPod or a $5.69.
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:56.240]   Well, I kind of do.
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:58.080]   I mean, I'm not against it.
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:01.520]   I mean, if it's that or nothing, I will probably take that.
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:06.160]   But it will be like constant torment every time you pick it up and realize that you can't
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:07.160]   phone on it.
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:10.960]   You could just take your Nokia N95, you tape it, duct tape it to the back of the iPhone.
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:11.960]   And then it's a hybrid device.
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:12.960]   There you go.
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:13.960]   Yeah.
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:14.960]   That'll work.
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:17.320]   I don't have a exact list or anything like that online somewhere.
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:21.200]   So if you do have to trade in your phone, you would make it really good to do those.
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:22.200]   That's first.
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.200]   Yeah, because it's all...
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.080]   No, no, no, you don't need to do that, Mac.
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.080]   It's all synced anyway.
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:27.080]   As soon as you...
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.080]   Oh, there you go.
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:29.080]   It's coming from...
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:33.720]   In the case of the Mac, it's coming from address book and ICal on Windows is coming from
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:34.720]   Outlook.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:35.720]   So you never...
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:36.880]   You don't really lose anything, I don't think.
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:40.720]   And because it's such a lockdown phone, it's not like you have any other applications on there.
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:42.960]   You have to restore.
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:49.160]   All you can do is get it basically the way you got it, the day you activated it when it
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:52.960]   synced up your phone numbers and everything.
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:55.880]   I think that's one of the things that the iPhone does very well, by the way, is it's very
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:56.880]   clean.
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:01.600]   It's not as good on the Windows side as you might imagine.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:07.680]   It does sync with Outlook and Outlook Express for your contacts.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:12.000]   But the calendar thing only works without Outlook.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.120]   As I said, there's no to-do list.
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:14.280]   It doesn't sync the...
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:15.880]   Here's what's weird.
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:17.040]   It doesn't sync the notes.
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:20.240]   There's a notes application, but it doesn't sync it with anything.
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:23.400]   This is only on the phone.
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:24.400]   Almost useless.
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:26.400]   I mean, what's the point?
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:29.000]   Okay, I got a note on my phone.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.080]   This feels like it's not finished, to be honest with you.
[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:32.520]   It's great.
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:33.520]   It works.
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:36.200]   It does the job, but it feels like there's more to go.
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:38.600]   There's something else they could do with this.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:39.600]   I just...
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:40.600]   I don't know.
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.600]   Anyway, maybe you guys will hack it.
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:43.240]   Are you having any issues bookmarking websites?
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:46.000]   You were saying something about that earlier, but would you then be able to say use an online
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.840]   calendar and just have that page bookmark?
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:50.080]   You could, but what I'd like to do...
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:52.600]   It's not that there's an issue doing it, but what I'd like to do is replace some of the
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:53.800]   buttons I don't use.
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:56.320]   There's a weather button and a stock button.
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:59.960]   You should be able to replace that with a bookmark to say an online to-do list or an
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:02.280]   online something else.
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:05.240]   For instance, you can use Google's applications on the iPhone.
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:08.960]   They work quite well, but you should be able to bookmark them, right?
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:09.960]   Yeah.
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:10.960]   Yes.
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.400]   I mean, you just have to launch Safari.
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:13.960]   So Apple's saying, "Oh, fine.
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:19.800]   Develop applications, but your platform is Safari, but Safari is not up here with everything
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:20.800]   else.
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:23.360]   There's no way to take a bookmark and put it right up on the front page.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.000]   So I'm stuck with this stupid stock."
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.320]   Now I'm sure Apple fixes.
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:28.320]   Maybe even by the time you hear this show, Apple fixes.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:29.320]   I don't know.
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:33.100]   I just can't believe they're going to force us to look at the Apple stock price instead
[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:35.800]   of my to-do list.
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:37.680]   I don't care about stocks that much.
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:38.920]   Kevin Rose has a new company.
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:44.080]   He has started something with his buddies, Leah Kaltlea Culver and Daniel Birka.
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:48.920]   Daniel is the great designer for dig.com.
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:53.920]   And Leah is a well-known programmer who's been around the Bay Area for some time.
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:54.920]   And it's called Pounce.
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:58.120]   Have any of you guys tried Pounce yet?
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:49:59.200]   It's like crack, Leo.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.920]   It's become like crack in my life.
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:04.000]   Franklin Harris, you're a Pounceer?
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.600]   Yeah, I can't seem to get off it.
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:07.080]   I got to let everyone now know.
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:12.160]   I mean, I was doing this with Twitter, but for some reason it's this invite-junkie syndrome
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:13.160]   that Pounce is created.
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:16.560]   I got to let everyone know at every second of the day everything I'm doing.
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:19.440]   Do you think Pounce is more compelling than Twitter?
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:25.920]   I like the features of being able to send files and links and directing your posts either
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:31.160]   to a group because you can group your friends in certain groups or directly to a person.
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:36.600]   P-O-W-N-C-E.com, unfortunately, it's invite-only.
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:41.800]   And I don't know if this is good or bad, but unlike Twitter and unlike Jiku, which I also
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:46.560]   use, for Jiku, you could go to my page whether you're a member or not and see what I'm saying.
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:47.560]   You can't do that with Pounce.
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:48.560]   You got to sign up.
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:50.560]   You got to get an invite.
[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:52.360]   Robert, are you or Will?
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:54.600]   Are you on the Pounce at all?
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:55.600]   No.
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:58.600]   I don't need another instant messaging client, unfortunately.
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:50:59.840]   It's more than an instant messenger.
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:01.920]   I don't know exactly how to do that.
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:05.480]   But I mean, I don't know what he's paraded here because I'm sure Kevin's thought about
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:06.480]   it a lot.
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:10.400]   But I mean, it is just like, you know, it's a combination of Twitter or great.
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:11.400]   I've got Twitter.
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:13.200]   It's like, send files to your friends.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.200]   Well, great.
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:17.520]   I've got email or instant message or FTP.
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:18.880]   Send events to your friends.
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:24.120]   Well, I've got upcoming or email or any number of shared counter things.
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:27.880]   And then it's, you know, share links and text with your friends.
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:32.920]   Well, I've got SMS or email lists or whatever.
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:37.160]   Do I really need all of those things, you know, again?
[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:40.960]   And so I'm not sure I get it, really.
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:44.160]   If that's an applet that would be brought over to the iPhone, it would probably be awesome.
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:45.160]   Ha ha.
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:46.160]   Yes.
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:47.160]   And that's kind of what it needs.
[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:51.360]   I use Jaiku, which is, you know, Jaiku is kind of, if there's a continuum, there's
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:53.120]   Twitter, which is basic and simple.
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.360]   And a lot of people like it for that reason.
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:56.320]   It's very easy to get.
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:58.120]   Pounds is kind of in between that and Jaiku.
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:59.360]   Jaiku has more features.
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:01.520]   Pounds is very pretty.
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:07.040]   But, you know, there are ways to do it on Safari, all three of them.
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:08.040]   But there's no dedicated client.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:09.600]   You have to use the browser to do it.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:12.480]   And then you also have to use the iPhone keyboard, which is a mixed bag.
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:15.240]   I mean, some people say, oh, oh no, just give it time.
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:17.200]   Apple says, trust it.
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:18.560]   If you trust it, it will work.
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:19.640]   It's like the force.
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:24.920]   For the file, the grouping features and else that you've named so far, those are all
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:26.280]   things that I've had available to me.
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:28.520]   You're within like a trillion.
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:31.920]   A trillion or any of those clients really.
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:33.760]   And I get the support of multiple IM.
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:34.760]   Good point.
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:35.760]   Engines.
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:40.120]   So why is it better than the IM, Franklin Harris?
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:44.720]   It just seems, you know, you and your public notes, it said something about Pounds that
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:47.760]   really made a lot of sense to me and probably to the general public.
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:49.240]   You kind of do what your friends do, right?
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:51.160]   I mean, if you, you got this grouping of P.
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:52.800]   Well, that's the same with IM, isn't it?
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:57.040]   If your friends are on AIM, you're going to use AIM if they're on ICQ, use ICQ.
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:00.240]   There are a few features that are still lacking.
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:02.600]   They don't have SMS support yet.
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:05.640]   They aren't working on it from what I understand.
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:10.320]   And really, you can either, you can only update it through their client, their desktop client,
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:14.000]   which is written in AIR, or belief, or via the web page.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.360]   I'm sure the work, all the kinks of.
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:20.120]   The problem with Twitter is there's a lot of people that were sending feature requests
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:23.240]   in and their dev cycle has been really slow in updating stuff.
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:25.720]   Well, I don't know if that's the case or if they don't want to.
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:28.520]   And I think they may want to keep it very simple.
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:30.120]   That's the appeal of Twitter, right?
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:35.760]   It's, you know, Jaiku, which has a lot of features, drives, some people go, I admit,
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:37.360]   when I first went there, I had the same reaction.
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:38.360]   I don't understand.
[00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:39.360]   It's too much.
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:40.360]   I don't get it.
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:41.360]   It's too complicated.
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:42.360]   Pounds is kind of nicely in between.
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:43.360]   We'll see.
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:44.360]   You may be...
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:45.360]   You spell Jaiku?
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:46.360]   J-A-I-K-U dot com.
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:47.360]   K-U.
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:48.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:49.360]   It's Finnish.
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:50.360]   Another question.
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:54.920]   Can a web 2.0 company that's not in the San Francisco Bay Area succeed?
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:54:02.120]   I mean, both Twitter and Pounds are in San Francisco and benefit from that because, you
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:03.200]   know, we're friends at Kevin.
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:04.200]   We know Kevin.
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.200]   We joined Pounds.
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.200]   We're friends of Ev.
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:07.200]   We're joined Twitter.
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:10.000]   You are a featured member of Jaiku.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   That's right.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:17.560]   About half of Jaiku's users are following me because I'm very in a very public way.
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:20.640]   This was... you're out of the commission when this happened, but I moved from Twitter to
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:22.840]   Jaiku because I was confusing people.
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:24.360]   Twitter sounds so much like Twitter.
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:25.360]   It was confusing.
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:26.360]   So I went to Jaiku.
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:27.360]   I like Jaiku.
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:29.160]   I still use it, but Pounds is appealing.
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:30.160]   But my real...
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:36.000]   I guess the question and you really raised this, Robert, is why do we even need these...
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.720]   These new ways of socializing?
[00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:41.600]   Don't we already have that with I am?
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:45.480]   I don't mind a new technology, especially one that wraps up a lot of things I like doing
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:46.480]   anyway.
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:51.840]   I still need to maintain my backward compatibility to the I am clients and other clients that
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:54.240]   I know most of my other friends are already using.
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:56.240]   I'm not going to get everyone to switch.
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:58.480]   That's my big thing.
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:54:59.480]   Moving on to...
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:02.840]   I'm sorry, Patrick's not here for this because I know he'd have something to say about it.
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:07.280]   AMD announced it's investing $7.5 million in TransMetta.
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:09.920]   Is that money being thrown away?
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:10.920]   What's that all about?
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:12.920]   Cheese.
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:15.880]   A little low power computing necessary to expand...
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:16.880]   They're probably a product line.
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:17.880]   They just don't have much.
[00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:21.880]   Maybe AMD needs a patent or two that TransMetta has.
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:22.880]   Could be.
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:28.240]   Right, because AMD's really got $7.5 million to throw into another company.
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.600]   They're still paying for ATI, right?
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:31.600]   Well, right.
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:37.400]   I'm trying to fund the ridiculous stock price buying.
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:41.080]   What do you guys think about the new AMD processors?
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:44.760]   We're starting to see benchmarks and hear stories about...
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:49.880]   Look, they're still a little ways off, but AMD is right now.
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:51.880]   They're getting handed their...
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:52.880]   Yeah.
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:54.400]   About Intel's just clobbering it.
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:55.680]   They just don't have it.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:56.680]   They just don't have it.
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:58.520]   Real they, though, are these new prices?
[00:55:58.520 --> 00:55:59.520]   No.
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:03.520]   Back at the beginning of the year, Barcelona, native quad calls going to launch.
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:09.480]   It was going to launch two months ago, and it was going to come in 2.6 gigahertz, 2.8
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:10.480]   gigahertz.
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:12.400]   It was going to hand Intel.
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:15.200]   It's but here we are two months later.
[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:17.720]   It's not coming out till next month.
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:23.360]   Even then you're only getting the two gigahertz version, which is nowhere near approaching
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:26.680]   the performance of the current Zions that Intel has out.
[00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:30.520]   And the proper Barcelona product, anything over decent speed, you're not going to get
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:34.520]   until Christmas by which time Intel would have re-reveged everything anyway.
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:35.520]   So when they're saying...
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:36.920]   It's just too little, too late.
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:39.440]   When they're talking about these two points, the inquirer published some notes.
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:41.600]   I guess from an AMD marketing presentation.
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:47.080]   When they're saying the 2.6 gigahertz Barcelona, they're talking about a part that's not even
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:48.080]   available now.
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:49.080]   It won't be available.
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:50.080]   Doesn't even exist.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:51.080]   Isn't going to exist for another three or four months.
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:53.680]   So when they're saying it beats the Clovertown, it's meaningless.
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:54.680]   Absolutely.
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:56.840]   Now what about Phenom?
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:58.720]   This is next year's chip.
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:56:59.720]   Yeah, great.
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:01.480]   Well, if they can deliver it.
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:02.480]   It's a low-power version.
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:07.680]   So you thought they haven't delivered anything that they've promised in the last nine months.
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:12.680]   So the attitude is show me.
[00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:14.560]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:16.480]   That is the attitude.
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:20.360]   That's too bad because I think it's really important that AMD provide a credible alternative
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:21.360]   to Intel.
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:23.960]   Otherwise, we're back to where we were.
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:28.000]   Yeah, I mean AMD has the potential to put out a lot of cool stuff.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.640]   I mean, they undoubtedly have some really good chip designs.
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:33.160]   You know, Barcelona is a good chip design.
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:36.760]   They've just completely dropped the ball when it comes to actually getting these things
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:37.760]   made.
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:40.520]   Either is it the process is too difficult?
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:43.280]   Is it that they don't have the facilities?
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:47.160]   They don't have the infrastructure that Intel has.
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:52.480]   The one thing that Intel does really, really well is it really makes stuff very well.
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:53.760]   They have some great fabs.
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:55.920]   They keep restocking them with the latest technology.
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:58.440]   They have a really quick turnover.
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:04.240]   You know, AMD has forever been struggling to keep up to build new fabs, new facilities.
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:07.120]   You know, there was the rumor last month that they were just going to kill all their
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:10.240]   fabs and outsource all their manufacturing elsewhere.
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:15.120]   So bad has their execution be on this front.
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:18.000]   And so they just need to get better at making stuff.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   Right.
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   Well, that's too bad.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.160]   You know, I'm rooting for them.
[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:24.760]   But when I see them spending money on things like Transmeta, I have to wonder what the heck
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:25.760]   must be a patent.
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:26.960]   It must be a patent they want.
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:29.360]   There must be some IP there that they need.
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:34.560]   It wasn't a great couple of months here either for Intel in terms of at least that microcode
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:38.000]   update that they pushed for the Core 2 series processors.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.920]   That was something that was affecting the server sides for major companies, including
[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:42.920]   Dell.
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:45.160]   They really issued their own major update for that.
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:47.480]   So you can update the microcode on these things?
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:52.280]   Apparently through BIOS updates and in addition to code updates that was pushed.
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:57.360]   What did it jump to the BIOS if there's to patch the code out?
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:58.840]   That's why.
[00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:00.240]   Not exactly sure about that.
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:03.160]   But it was just apparently the main issue was that they were getting some blue screens
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:06.400]   and other specific crashes related to server environment computing.
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:07.400]   Trust me.
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:09.840]   You know, it's on the high end.
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:12.200]   Yeah, Intel is just kicking butt right now.
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:17.000]   But for some of the value in processors for regular computing, not necessarily the state
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:21.560]   of the art server or or the high end gamer, I think either platform offers some great value
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:22.560]   right now.
[00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:24.400]   So AMD is still OK.
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:29.080]   Yeah, unless you're strictly focusing on the high end server and the people who want the
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:31.800]   latest and greatest gaming boxes in my pick.
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:32.800]   Yes.
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:35.560]   AMD would be an acceptable choice for anybody to surf in the net and wants word processing
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:36.560]   that kind of thing.
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:37.560]   Oh, heck yeah.
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:40.120]   Either either company has some great value parts out there right now.
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:44.160]   But for the last nine months, like Wolf was saying, it's just it's kind of depressing
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:48.840]   to see them slip this far and not ship product.
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:52.920]   Another interesting teleg-- the most interesting stories this week were telecommunications stories.
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:57.440]   Google buys Grand Central, which is I think a really interesting service.
[00:59:57.440 --> 00:59:59.880]   I haven't used it, but I know people who have.
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:03.280]   It's invite only, although I don't think it's too hard to get one.
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:06.640]   Does anybody here use Grand Central or have tried it?
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:07.960]   Nobody?
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:12.760]   The idea is it's a kind of a follow me service.
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:16.560]   It's got VoIP capabilities.
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:18.720]   Messages come in your email.
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:21.200]   It's been free, which is kind of neat.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:24.400]   Google says Google will continue to run Grand Central.
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.080]   It will remain operational.
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:29.240]   Uninterrupted service for current customers.
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:34.960]   I'm not sure whether new customers will be allowed.
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:39.320]   It's still free, although Google may charge at some point.
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:42.640]   It says we'll send out a limited number of invitations during the beta period, but we'll
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:46.920]   open the service to the public in the near future.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:50.280]   It's a very interesting service, and I think it's a smart play for Google.
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.720]   They already own Dialpad.
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:56.560]   They're getting into telecommunications like every other business, frankly.
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:59.560]   It's pretty amazing what Google's up to.
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:04.480]   Any products that can provide asterisks for an independent service?
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.640]   Oh, frankly, really.
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:09.880]   I wish we had a better VoIP situation right now.
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:12.320]   You're probably on Rogers, aren't you, Frank?
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.320]   Yeah.
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:17.880]   We always have this problem with Amber as well, that Rogers starts out fun.
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:20.880]   It's as if they're packet-shifting, packet-shaping.
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:25.000]   They notice you're on Skype and they start to deteriorate you after about half an hour.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.440]   It ends almost every time.
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:29.440]   I don't.
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:30.440]   It's too bad.
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:31.440]   I'll tell you what, Frank, we're going to...
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:33.640]   Let me hang up on you and call you back.
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:34.640]   Watch this.
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:35.640]   This is kind of...
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:36.640]   Sometimes this helps.
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:39.880]   Let's see if we can add Frank back into the conference.
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:40.880]   All right.
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:42.520]   Now, is it better, Frank?
[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:44.520]   You guys have fun, I guess.
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:46.520]   No, it's just you.
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:48.240]   That's a problem with me.
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:49.240]   You know what?
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:50.240]   We're done anyway.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:53.160]   I want to thank you, Franklin Harris.
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:55.320]   Is there a site you want to plug?
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:58.720]   I mean, you're going to be on the lab soon.
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:00.720]   In fact, pretty much all the time.
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:06.920]   We're just talking about the sort of digital underground that will have an iPhone in its
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:07.920]   pieces.
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.640]   That's cool.
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:10.640]   That's cool.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:12.440]   Digital Underground.tv, right?
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:13.920]   Digital Underground.tv.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:14.920]   Yep.
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:15.920]   It's a great...
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:18.080]   It's a great podcast, video podcast.
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:21.320]   The next one is going to be "Take it Apart the iPhone."
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.000]   Whose iPhone are you taking apart?
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   I'm not out of here.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   This is close.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:35.280]   I'm going to let you go because it just sounds just awful, but I do thank you for joining
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:36.280]   us.
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:37.280]   He sounds like a robot.
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.560]   He sounds like a Dalek.
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:40.960]   I'm going to make it...
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:43.000]   It's a time for our commercial for Audible.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.240]   Now, normally what we do is kind of like a book group and give people a chance to pick
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:53.120]   a book, but you know, I didn't will or Robert, I didn't give you some forewarning here.
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:54.120]   So...
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.120]   I have a book.
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:56.120]   You have a book?
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.120]   Will you demand?
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:00.280]   Well, first let's mention that you can get this book for free if you're not already an
[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.320]   Audible subscriber.
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:06.400]   If you're in the US, you for sure can get it free, and in many countries you can, but
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.400]   some you can't.
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:11.560]   So it just depends on the book, but it's worth a try.
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:16.600]   Audible.com/twit, and we do thank Audible for their support.
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:20.280]   Now, each week we like to recommend a book that you could download and listen to.
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.280]   What's your choice, Will?
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:28.720]   Okay, well my choice is The Audacity of Hope by Barack Obama.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:32.920]   You know, I've heard some really interesting things about this.
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:33.920]   The audacity...
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:38.120]   Interesting, because there's a whole section on Google that's actually quite interesting
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:39.640]   to read about as well.
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:42.240]   So he talks about tech a little bit.
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:49.160]   Yeah, so the reason I liked it really was because it definitely sets out like it's very
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:50.160]   readable.
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:55.360]   Like, I just read the new Al Gore book, and I felt like I was really like...
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:04:00.640]   It was tough knowing the Earth's got warmer and...
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:03.120]   Yeah, Al's funnier than he used to be.
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:06.120]   But he's still kind of an academic.
[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:08.120]   He still loves those facts and figures.
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:10.120]   And it could be a little dry.
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:14.320]   And so the Obama book was quite accessible, especially to someone like me who is not particularly
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:18.240]   intimate with American politics and all their perhaps more intimate than a lot of Americans
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.240]   are.
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:27.560]   But yeah, an interesting thing about how Google has a problem with hiring people, with immigration,
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:29.040]   and the whole H1B-B-B situation.
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.040]   Right.
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.040]   What does he stand on the...
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:32.320]   He's not very fine enough.
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:33.560]   Where does he stand on the H1B?
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:36.480]   He says that Google's policies are not good?
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:47.280]   No, just that Google would love to hire more American, you know, super-duper math grads
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:51.320]   within American schools and not producing enough super-duper math grads for them.
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:54.200]   That's the complaint of every tech company in the United States.
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:59.360]   And of course, the debate is, well, aren't you by asking for more to bring in more workers
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:02.320]   from other countries who have this training?
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:06.360]   Aren't you undermining further undermining US engineering programs?
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:09.280]   If you're not going to hire the engineers from the US, why should somebody go to school
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.280]   to study it?
[01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:11.280]   Well, exactly.
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:15.040]   And that's one of the sort of things that goes round about in the book.
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:16.360]   Well, I find it very interesting.
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:17.720]   Yeah, it is fascinating.
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:18.720]   He reads it.
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:21.640]   It is one of many books available on Audible.
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:28.120]   You can get it for free if you're not already an Audible member by just going to audible.com/twit.
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.320]   Thank Audible for their support of Twit.
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.560]   And I thank you, Will, for your recommendation.
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:34.840]   I'm adding it to my wish list right now on Audible.
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:37.200]   That sounds like an interesting book.
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:38.560]   He's a great speaker.
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:40.360]   I don't know what he's like reading.
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:41.360]   But boy, he's dying.
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:42.360]   Quite good, actually.
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.160]   He actually does a podcast.
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:45.160]   No.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:46.160]   Really?
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:49.960]   Yeah, it comes out maybe once or twice a month when he's in session.
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:53.880]   They say this will be the YouTube election in the US.
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:57.880]   Now, you have an election coming up in the UK soon, don't you?
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:58.880]   Not for a while.
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.520]   We had a transfer of power.
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:05.360]   So you mean Tony Blair says, OK, I'm giving up my post.
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:07.800]   That doesn't mean that there's a new election?
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:08.800]   No.
[01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:13.520]   That just means that the next in line in the end of the year ruling part takes over.
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:14.520]   Yeah.
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.160]   Can you call yourself a democracy?
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:22.160]   Yeah, you can follow the local papers here and discover how that's been working ahead.
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:26.680]   Shouldn't he call for an election if he's not going to be the prime minister?
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:28.200]   If he's not going to run the country.
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.080]   Doesn't work like that.
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:31.600]   You vote for the party, not the man.
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:33.640]   I will never understand it.
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:36.160]   Well, it's going to be a very interesting election.
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.720]   2008 is going to be very interesting in the US.
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.440]   They're already calling it the YouTube election.
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:42.480]   In fact, did you see?
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:43.480]   It's a little salacious.
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:45.200]   This is not for the kids.
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:47.120]   I'm a bomb a girl.
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:48.120]   Obama girl.
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:50.680]   I love with Barack.
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:52.320]   I'm starting to think poor.
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:59.120]   I mean, in a way, now Obama's team is trying to put a good spin on this.
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:02.240]   But I think in a way, this is not the kind of publicity.
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:06.520]   We'll only play a little bit of this just for you if you haven't heard it.
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:08.600]   The pictures are pretty sexy.
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:11.320]   But this is the part that I would be embarrassed by.
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:14.400]   Thank all of you for your time, your suggestions.
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.400]   There's Obama.
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:16.400]   I'm a purgeman and your presence.
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:17.400]   But she's dialing her phone.
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:21.320]   I look forward to continuing our conversation in the weeks and months to come.
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.320]   Hey, B, it's me.
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.600]   If you're there, pick up.
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:30.680]   I was just watching you on C-Span.
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:32.520]   Anyway, call me back.
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:35.960]   This kind of smack-semonica-loinsky a little bit, doesn't it?
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:36.960]   I mean, I...
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:41.400]   It's a Christmas tree down at the Spice Girls, isn't it?
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.400]   It's not good music.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.680]   And it's been watched millions of times.
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:47.520]   Over two million hits in the last three weeks on YouTube.
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.160]   Mostly because she wears a bikini.
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:52.640]   And there's a lot of...
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:53.640]   It's not...
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:54.640]   There's no nudity.
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:56.400]   Oh, money-fame and power, man.
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:59.440]   It's a great aphrodisiac.
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:05.840]   But if I'm Obama, I'm going, "I don't really want to bring up these visuals of Monica Lewinsky."
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:11.960]   I mean, she even talks about rewarding him, so to speak, in the Oval Office.
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.720]   And I'm thinking...
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:16.920]   You could bet Mrs. Obama is a two-plegist.
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:18.920]   No, I would really back-poo.
[01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:19.920]   Oh, no.
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:23.320]   You're not going to see this anything like this for Hillary.
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:26.200]   I can tell you right now.
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:30.280]   Although she did, I thought, a very good video that was a spoof of the last episode
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:32.720]   of The Sopranos.
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:35.560]   And Johnny Sack was on it and stuff.
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:37.520]   I mean, that was pretty good.
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:38.520]   Where?
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:39.520]   Yeah.
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:46.800]   I mean, Edwards did a fundraising video with...
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:51.480]   Were he and Elizabeth baked a pie?
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:57.080]   And it brought in, according to the campaign, it brought in $300,000.
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:01.960]   They did his mom's pie recipes, pecan pie recipe.
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:04.600]   Well, that's politics for me.
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:08.960]   We so need to reform our campaigning, election processes in this country.
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:12.280]   Well, in a way, though, this is democratizing because it goes right to the people.
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:13.520]   There's no money spent on it.
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:16.920]   You don't need campaign donations to make these.
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:18.280]   And here's the other side of it.
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:23.080]   When you make a goof, a boo-boo, everybody sees it over and over and over again.
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:28.000]   Like McCain, we played this on the show a few months ago where McCain goes, "Bam, bomb,
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.320]   bomb, bomb, Iran."
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:36.640]   I mean, he probably would love to live that down, but no, that's on YouTube and it's
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:37.640]   going to be forever.
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:43.160]   Rudy Giuliani dresses as a woman and they do a drag skit.
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:47.160]   In which Donald Trump kisses his chest.
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:50.400]   And this is, of course, a video that, I mean, I'm sure Rudy would love for this.
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:52.240]   He's a Republican candidate for president.
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:54.720]   Can't we give him aptitude tests or something?
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:58.560]   None of this is doing it for me.
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.040]   It's not going to make you vote, you mean?
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:01.040]   He's not going to bring you to the polls.
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:03.960]   I don't want to vote, but it just won't be for any of the above.
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:04.960]   Yeah.
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:08.160]   Mitt Romney and his wife do MIT TV.
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:10.600]   Oh, that's got to be scary.
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:11.600]   Oh, dear.
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:12.600]   Oh, that's not fair.
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:14.600]   It's time to watch this crap.
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:18.160]   Well, apparently the electorate, two million downloads on the Obama girl.
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:20.080]   Oh, that's the election.
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:21.760]   That's below 18.
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:22.760]   You're right.
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:25.040]   They can't vote, can they?
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:27.760]   But they can talk their moms and dads into voting.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:32.560]   Oh, well, anyway, I think just a fascinating, I think this is going to be a very interesting
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:37.000]   election and we're going to watch a lot of it, not on TV, but on YouTube.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.640]   And I don't, you know, I have to say, unlike you, I think that's not necessarily a bad
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:42.640]   thing.
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:48.520]   I think at least anything that gets people thinking about these issues is a good thing.
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:53.480]   It'd be nice if they all read each candidate's book, but you know what they would be.
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:55.560]   You know, that's not going to happen.
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:57.920]   It'd be good to get more people just in the habit of voting.
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:58.920]   That'd be nice.
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:00.920]   They'd be even that.
[01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:01.920]   Even that.
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.720]   Leaving it up to so few.
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:05.160]   That's right.
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:06.160]   That's what you get.
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:08.000]   Hey, I really want to thank you for joining us.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000]   Robert Herron, we've missed you.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.800]   It's been a long time.
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:13.000]   And we're glad to get you on.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.360]   We're glad your health is great.
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.640]   We look forward to seeing more of you on dl.tv.
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:19.880]   We'll be back in about 10 days.
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:20.880]   Good.
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:23.160]   Just taking some time off to go kick it with some friends.
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:24.160]   Good.
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:27.920]   Will Harris is doing his thing in Britain, doing his own TV channel.
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:31.320]   You can find out more about it at willharris.co.uk.
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:34.960]   It's W-I-L, one L, Harris.co.uk.
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:38.160]   Anything else you want to promote?
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.800]   That I've had something to do.
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:40.800]   All right, guys.
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:41.800]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:43.680]   We remind you, we've got those great Twit hoodies.
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:44.680]   I know they're 70 bucks.
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:48.480]   They're expensive, but believe me when you get them and you'll see them, they're worth
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:49.480]   it.
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:50.480]   They're beautiful.
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:51.480]   Scotty's gear is just great.
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:52.480]   He makes the best stuff.
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:53.480]   It really does.
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.840]   I still have a vest that I picked up a while back and it's awesome.
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:59.040]   It's a well-made and just a great piece of gear.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.040]   If you're into that sort of.
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:03.040]   I haven't counted the pockets in the Twit hoodie, I will, but I think it's a well over two
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:04.040]   dozen.
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:05.040]   I doubt it.
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:07.560]   And it's got a pocket chest right for the iPhone.
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:09.440]   It's the only clothing I've lost stuff in.
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:13.320]   I know it's in the Coke somewhere and I either I can't find the zipper to get into the pocket
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:14.320]   or not.
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:15.320]   I can't get to it.
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:17.120]   But it also held a 12-pack of soda.
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:18.520]   So yeah, there you go.
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:20.160]   You can put your laptop in it.
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:23.400]   The hoodie does not have a laptop pouch because we want to keep clean lines on it, but it
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:24.400]   is a nice fleece.
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:25.400]   Very pretty.
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:26.400]   You can find out more about that.
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:31.200]   And if you if you so would like to support the podcast, we sure would appreciate that.
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:32.840]   You can see I feel guilty even asking.
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:34.640]   I'm falling all over myself.
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:36.760]   Twit TV is the place.
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:41.480]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:43.760]   We'll see you next week.
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:44.760]   Another twit.
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:45.760]   He's in the can.
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:46.760]   Round the horn.
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:47.760]   Round the horn.
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:48.760]   Round the horn.
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:49.760]   Round the horn.
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:50.760]   Round the horn.
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:51.760]   Round the horn.
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:52.760]   Round the horn.
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:53.760]   Round the horn.
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:54.760]   Round the horn.
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:55.760]   Round the horn.
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:56.760]   Round the horn.
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:57.760]   Round the horn.
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:58.760]   Round the horn.
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:12:59.760]   Round the horn.
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:00.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:01.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:02.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:03.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:04.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:05.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:06.760]   I should have paid attention.
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:08.760]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:09.760]   Too much work.
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:10.760]   The problem is, there's no limit.
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:12.760]   My server is completely collapsed.
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:13.760]   So here's the deal.
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:16.760]   I'm just trying to get the thing off, but I have a hell of a time.
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.760]   What blue screen's like, forget it.
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:19.760]   I'm killing you.
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:20.760]   I'm killing you.
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:21.760]   I'm killing you.
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:24.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:25.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:26.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:27.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:28.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:29.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:30.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:31.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:32.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:33.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:34.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:35.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:36.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:37.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:38.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:39.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:40.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:41.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:42.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:43.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:44.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:45.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:46.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:47.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:48.760]   Round the horn.
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:49.760]   Round the horn.
