[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   This is Twit, this weekend tech, episode 32 for November 27th, 2005.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   [music]
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   [music]
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   [music]
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   [music]
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   [music]
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   [laughter]
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   This is episode 32, 31, 32.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Who's counting?
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   I'm not counting, sir.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   32, I think.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   32, and we are on Skype, obviously.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Let me introduce the Skypeettes.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   You've already met G Gordon Liddy, aka Steve Gibson,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   who is definitely no Republican.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   He's got my BDI staring out of the screen, looking at Dvorak.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   [laughter]
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   John C. Dvorak is here using his new M Audio Fast Track,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   which sounds really good.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   What mic are you using, John?
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   It's also an M Audio mic.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Sounds really good.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Of course, Patrick Norton back from the races.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Back from the 1000.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   He was down in Baja and had a little hard time getting back
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   for a last to it, because what, three hours at the customs?
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Did they search you?
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   No, there were forest fires near the border,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   and some sort of parade in Tijuana that shut down the access rope
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   we were lined up for, so we went to Ote Mesa,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   where somebody lit a bunch of cars on the border on fire,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   and it was just good.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   We ended up being chased around.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   We ended up following a bunch of firefighters from Tijuana,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   because a couple of the guys down there were fire guys from Colorado
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   talked to him, and they basically showed us a little firefighter
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   courtesy, and drove us around to find a couple different on-ramps
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   in Ote Mesa.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   It's good to have connections.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   It's good.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   It's good.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Also, here, Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   who is speaking to us, also probably with a pretty good mic.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   What mic are you using today?
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   I'm actually just using a little Flex mic.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   You're not using my PR40?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   No, if I was not in San Francisco, I'm actually down in La Crescenta.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Ah, okay.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   And out of LA, froze down here for the holidays.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   John missed this, but at the podcast Expo,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   we received best podcasts of the year award from the People's Choice Awards,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   and then one of the prizes was this really nice mic.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Not expensive, either.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   $300 mic from Bob Heil of Heil Sound,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   the PR40 there, top of the line.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   It sounds fantastic, but Alex has it in his Cherrywood box,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   so you've got to get it back from you.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I think we should just, you know,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   you don't have to come back to the Fix going time soon.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Yeah, you want us to keep?
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   You know, I used it on Twitter 30, but I'm hoping,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   well, here's the deal, Alex,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   so a nice conversation with Bob Heil,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   who is a fascinating fella.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   He told me how he invented the quadriphonic PA that the Who used in Quadrifenia.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Who is this?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   His name is Bob Heil.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   He's an old-time rock and roll sound guy,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   worked for Humble Pie, The Who, the Grateful Dead, the Eagles,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   and then he started making microphones,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   and he's a ham and made ham microphones,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   really good ones, but the broadcast industry is discovering him,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   and you know who really, where his biggest ad is,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   if you watch Letterman,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   did you notice about two months ago, Letterman got a new mic?
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Yes, I was noticing Leo that that's the same mic that you had at the show.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   But that mic's dead.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   He taps it all the time with his pencil,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   and he's like, "Oh, I know, I know, I've never had comes from it."
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Well, Bob told me the story about that mic.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Letterman wears, as most TV people do,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Lavalier, you know, lapel mics.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   He wears two of them, in case one dies.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   The guest is also wearing a lav.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   The problem is with the guests, they're unpredictable.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   They jump on the furniture, they move around,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   sometimes their mics fall off or die.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   If that happens, the PR40 is live and can be turned up,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   and if you look at it, it's aimed at the guest,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   it's not aimed at Letterman.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   It's an emergency guest mic.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Also, the top of the mic is hot.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   In fact, one of the nicest things about the mic, Leo,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   is it looks so good.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   It's perfect for when you're doing TV stuff,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   because it looks like you ought to sound good.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   So, Bob is very kindly lending us four PR30s for our live Twitch,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   and a fifth mic that he made specially for me.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   They also make an old--
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Yes, with their ears cupped, and it's got the mic flag on the top,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   it's going to say "Twit," and it's going to be great.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   So, that's going to be my mic.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   You guys will have to--
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Now, what's the model number of the EV mic
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   that most radio people use, which is a dynamic mic?
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   It's not even a condenser.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   It used to be the RE20, and now it's an RE27.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   The condenser mics are powered mics.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   They use fan of power.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Bob hates condenser mics.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   He's a dynamic mic guy.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Oh, so these are dynamic mics?
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   They're all dynamic.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   He far prefers it.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   He says, "As soon as you put power over the cable,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   you get all sorts of issues."
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   So, these are all dynamics, and I think, well, you'll hear,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   we're going to use them this Friday for the next coming--
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Next Friday.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Yeah, a week from whatever.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   I don't think the "Twit" 30 really showed off the mic.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   No.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   I mean, it just sounded so amazing.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   It's an amazing mic, so you'll hear.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   And I think Bob's very small.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   What are they sell for?
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   They're inexpensive.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   They're around $300.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   And I told Bob, I said, "You're not charging enough,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   because no, I'm on charges, you know, two grand for their top of the line mic."
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   And I think he's got a better mic, and he says, "Well, I should charge more,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   but that's how much they cost."
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   So, this guy is a character.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   We will get him on.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Really, and amazing.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   The stories he was-- he invented--
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   You know, when Frampton comes alive, the talking guitar thing,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   "Wah, wah, why?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   I want to.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Thank you."
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Yeah, we get it.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   He invented that.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   That's called a "high-ol" voice box.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Oh, really?
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   You know what it is?
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   It's actually pretty straightforward.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   It's a little amp that comes off the guitar,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   pumps the sound up a tube into your mouth,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   and then you shape your mouth to a shape to sound.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   So, where's the pickup, Bob?
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   He said, "It's the mic.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   You're doing it into the microphone."
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   So that "wah, wah."
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   It's just coming off the mic.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   And this guy sounds like an interesting character.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   We definitely must have him on.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   He wears purple sneakers.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Just like you.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   It's like me.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Well, and the other thing I think is interesting about him is he's smart enough to see that
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.640]   it's hard to penetrate the radio market.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.160]   All these guys are, "I love my RE27 or my Noym on it."
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.440]   But the hams picked him up early, and now he recognizes that there's a big market with
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.960]   podcasters.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.320]   And I think that he's very smart.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.320]   He's going after podcasters.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.280]   Well, I think at the price point that his mics are at, I think is that reasonable.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.280]   It's reasonable.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.080]   Well, does he have a cheaper mic for the cheap podcasters?
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.080]   I mean, those guys aren't going to buy a $300 mic.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.080]   No, he does.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:55.800]   They start with the PR10, which is still a very good mic.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.640]   And that's, let me see, that's $89.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.400]   I mean, it's a hundred bucks, something like that.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.600]   It's very reasonable.
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.320]   I think he's on target.
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:09.640]   But we're going to use a PR30s, and I'll get a PR40 in that special case.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.800]   And the PR20 is $160.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.080]   What's the difference between the 30 and the 40 in terms of just the guts?
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.960]   You know, we'll have to get Bob to tell us that.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.840]   I think it's the size of the coil, but I'm not sure.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.840]   He uses B coils.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.840]   That's why he knows it.
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.840]   So you're going to be booming over a second.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.840]   I am.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:26.840]   Once again, I'm going to beat you.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.840]   I'm going to steal that mic.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.000]   As you have to switch the guts out.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.080]   I have to try to get a hold of this guy.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.080]   Have you had any problems, John, with your Xbox 360?
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.080]   Zero.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.080]   And you've seen what's happening.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.040]   Have you actually used your Xbox 360?
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.200]   I've got two kids.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.200]   Are you kidding me?
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.200]   I don't know.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.200]   The things being used 24/7, they're out of no.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.920]   They don't sleep anymore.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.960]   Is the power supply on the ground?
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.800]   Yes, it's on the rug.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.320]   See, that's one of the things people are saying.
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.320]   Is it heating up?
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.320]   No.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.320]   They say the power supply is overheating.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.320]   It's not.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.320]   But it's not.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.800]   Well, maybe the yours isn't, but some people's are.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.880]   It might be any different.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.800]   Different production runs, different factories, a bunch of reasons.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.600]   I think it's possible.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.600]   The one they said--
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.240]   I mean, all it takes is a bad pass.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.040]   But do you have one, Patrick?
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.360]   No, we have one at work that I was using for about a day.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.360]   Is it overheating?
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.360]   They run hot.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.240]   Well, it's got three gigahertz processors in there.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.960]   Yeah, I mean, it's amazing.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.680]   It sounds like an old school desktop PC.
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.680]   Really?
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.600]   The fans are that loud.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.000]   If you're not-- I mean, basically, if you're--
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.680]   Where did this one must have been made in Kenya or something?
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.200]   Because mine makes no noise.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.440]   It doesn't sound like an old--
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.440]   It depends.
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.160]   If you're playing a game, it makes noise.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.480]   If you're just browsing the menus--
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.840]   No, we're talking about playing games.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.840]   We're talking about playing that racing game.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.960]   We're playing-- I've got all the games.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.320]   You think you don't hear anything?
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.760]   There's any chance they sent you a special job or--
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.080]   No, or an echversion.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.080]   No, no.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.400]   I can tell when they do stuff like that.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.320]   And that's not the case.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.560]   This is just a bulk sent out to all the reviewers.
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.760]   Oh, that's good.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.480]   According to iSupply, which I guess
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:06.960]   looked at all the parts, Microsoft's losing $126 per unit.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.560]   That doesn't surprise me.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.120]   But that's part of the marketing plan for stuff like that.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:11.640]   It's normal.
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.560]   These boxes are sold that'll lost all of them.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.000]   Razor blades.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.760]   Exactly.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.320]   It's the razors, actually.
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.120]   I'm not totally sold.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.040]   I mean, I think that someone's calculating it.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.720]   They're losing $126.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.480]   But that's probably calculated against what
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.240]   the normal price would be, or even a discounted price.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.520]   But probably-- I would guess that Microsoft probably
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.760]   got a better deal than that.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.260]   Yeah.
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.160]   I don't think microchip--
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:33.960]   I would agree with that.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.960]   That's much leverage on the hardware.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.400]   Really?
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.040]   If you're making-- they're going to sell 3 million
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:39.760]   by the end of the year.
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.240]   If you're making 3 million to anything,
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.720]   don't you think you have a little--
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.960]   Patrick, I think you're wrong there,
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.880]   because there's been stories in the trade press
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.120]   about Microsoft putting the screws to people
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.000]   about their prices.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.920]   And I suspect that they do have some leverage.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:57.600]   And actually, it may be that leverage that causes these inferior--
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.720]   if they're out there, unless it's BS,
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.200]   these inferior power supplies.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.600]   So you're saying that they bid a lower price to get the deal,
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.560]   but then they had to make inferior components?
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.960]   It's not unheard of.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.080]   I can tell you they got leverage.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.480]   They got 3.2 gigahertz power PC processors
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.560]   that Apple couldn't get.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.800]   Somebody's got some leverage somewhere.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.360]   Well, I'm telling you, I have this box makes no noise,
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.880]   and the power supply doesn't overheat,
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.320]   and the thing works like a champ.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.200]   All right, we're going to have a new slogan for John.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.400]   It makes no noise.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.440]   No, I don't need another catchphrase.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.520]   But as far as I'm concerned, we did have the box did crash once
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.480]   in the week that we've had it.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.880]   Did we have hung?
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.160]   It hung on some screwing around with--
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.400]   Oh, by the way, I've seen the screenshots you were talking
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.440]   about last week, John, the UI on it.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.440]   It is beautiful.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:54.600]   Yeah, it's kind of-- you can get lost at it, unfortunately.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.280]   I think it could be a little-- because sometimes
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.920]   to find stuff, for example--
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.520]   The blades, they call them.
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.040]   Yeah, it's like 23 of them, it feels like.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:04.760]   What's a blade?
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.280]   What's that?
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.760]   These things slide out from the side,
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.400]   and then they have all these menus on them.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.880]   It's like a menu that comes from the side.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.920]   It's sort of like these margins are stacked up
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.200]   on either the left or the right.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.600]   And when you click the thing, it slides everything over,
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.000]   and opens up the space in between.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.040]   Blade sounds much better than digital file folder tabs
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.360]   that slide out from the left side of the television screen.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.720]   No, I think Blade's is a good moniker.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.640]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.800]   But whatever the case is, you know, you could--
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.720]   it's sometimes a little-- I mean, if you wanted to switch
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:40.720]   your display from 480p to 720p or 1080i or whatever,
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.440]   you have to really dig around to find that tab.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.280]   So do you think that-- I mean, some of these surveys
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:51.040]   on some of these Xbox fan sites say 15% to 25% errors,
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.920]   crashes-- you think those are overblown,
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:53.760]   you think it's not?
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.880]   Microsoft says it's a minuscule number of people.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.400]   You know what?
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.040]   I think this is part of a campaign
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.720]   to besmirch the machine, to be honest about it.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.520]   Seriously.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.080]   Like hardcore gamers are saying, PlayStation 3
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.360]   and dumping on the Xbox.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.280]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.760]   And then what I'm seeing, which is really, I think, kind of freaky
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.160]   and kind of creepy, to be honest about it,
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.840]   is kind of one of these iterations of fanboys,
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.960]   like the people who used to be Amiga fans
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.400]   or the way the Macintosh guys are now.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.200]   You know, they can't afford to have both machines
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.200]   or all three machines.
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.040]   So they have to dump on the one they can't get.
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.680]   Right, so they dump on the one they don't own,
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.680]   or they can't get, or they don't like, or whatever.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.800]   And I think it's just creepy.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.600]   You know, baffles me.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.360]   There is a fairly large contingent of Windows fanboys
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.160]   because I hear from them, because I recommend Macintoshs.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.160]   And they're virulent.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.800]   It's like, they're Bill Gates is their secret lover.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:46.640]   I don't understand.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.480]   It's creepy.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.640]   And the other thing, these guys were like,
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.680]   actually making a bigger scene during the OS2 era.
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.560]   And I thought they'd gone away.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.440]   Well, they loved you.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.480]   You were a big OS2 fan, I remember that.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.320]   So, Apple is not part of this group,
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.920]   but Microsoft, Opera, Mozilla, the folks at Conqueror
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.800]   have all agreed to kind of change the security standards
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.440]   and browsers.
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.360]   They're going to add a new certificate,
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:17.320]   a super certificate, that when you go to a certified website,
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.880]   you'll see a green address bar that'll kind of be a green light.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.360]   IE7 features this, and so will Opera and Conqueror.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.200]   Yeah, it was really neat that they all got together
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.040]   on this plan.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:31.000]   And it's really aimed also at defeating the whole fishing
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.720]   problem so that people are--
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:36.160]   So, well, the UI will make it very clear
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:40.680]   if the certificate does not match what's shown up in the URL.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.120]   So it'll be something that--
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.320]   Better than a padlock.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.360]   Yes, exactly.
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.360]   Instead of the same--
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.120]   Is it the same as a padlock?
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.160]   I mean, is it the same--
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.560]   Is it telling you that you have a secure connection,
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.280]   or is it doing more?
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.720]   It's going to go further and make sure you really
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.600]   understand if the certificate that's been exchanged
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.160]   does not match what is displayed, the URL displayed,
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.440]   up in the address bar.
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.600]   Normally, users have to go fishing for that.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.880]   You got to right click on the padlock, view the certificate,
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.080]   and visually make sure that it all matches.
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.840]   And this is going to make it extreme--
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.000]   I mean, it's going to be in your face flashing at you
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:16.880]   if there's a problem.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.040]   I guess that's what you need to do.
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.040]   I think you do.
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.600]   And people will still ignore it.
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.080]   In order to get what they want.
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.200]   Well, it would be better if it would flash red at you
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.360]   if it didn't match.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.280]   It just flashes green if it does.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:30.640]   It would probably be actually better
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:34.040]   if nothing worked at all if there wasn't a match.
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.280]   Because there's no reason that you should ever
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.680]   have a mismatch unless something's wrong.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.480]   I don't know, Steve.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.880]   I frequently will get--
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.280]   I'm not frequently, but it happens to me on legitimate sites
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.920]   that I'll get a certificate error.
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:45.800]   No kidding.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.920]   Out of date certificates.
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:47.720]   I get what I mean.
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:48.560]   I'll give you an example.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.680]   If you go to Google AdSense, instead of going
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:57.080]   www.google.com/adsense, you go to google.com/adsense.
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.840]   It still works, but the certificate apparently
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.240]   says only wwws.
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.160]   That's true.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.600]   There are some you're able to get.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.480]   And there are actually a little bit scary that are asterisk.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.720]   Like google.com.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.240]   That would probably be a bad idea.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.520]   It is a bad idea.
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.680]   For example, I have to purchase--
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.920]   in fact, mine are expiring in the middle of December.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:19.640]   And I'm getting constant email now from Verisine warning me.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.000]   In fact, I've got one that came into date.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.560]   It's I have 21 days remaining.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:28.040]   So I've got one for GRC and www.grc.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.600]   Separate certificates.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.640]   So Google was cheap and didn't buy a Google.com certificate?
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.440]   Yep.
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.040]   That's stupid.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:41.000]   Or they're not redirecting people who come in at Google.com
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.960]   over to www and forcing the www to be on there.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.560]   That's a silly thing.
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.560]   You get your certificates from Verisine.
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:49.120]   I do.
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.000]   And it hurts.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.600]   I mean, it's like $700.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.640]   It's really--
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:54.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.680]   I mean, it's just bend over.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.480]   What are you using the certificate for?
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.640]   What do you have?
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.000]   In order to do SSL connections for our web server,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.520]   so that people are able to do HTTPS to grc.com for e-commerce stuff.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.080]   When you connect to a secure server,
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:13.120]   whether it's a bank or Amazon.com, you're using an SSL link.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.200]   And that has to be validated by a certificate
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.880]   from a trusted third party.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.440]   There are other people besides Verisine, there's thought.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.280]   And Verisine bought thought.
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.120]   Oh, they did?
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.320]   They're no longer independent, and the price is one up.
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.440]   Oh, that's too bad.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.080]   Gee, huh.
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.800]   What a shock.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.520]   Capitalism at its best.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.000]   That's really-- because thought used to offer free certificates
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   for personal use.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:34.480]   Yes.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.800]   That's kind of sad.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.640]   I guess by the buy to that.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.360]   Well, as long as we're talking browsers, Firefox 1.5
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.360]   is going to come out probably this Tuesday the 29th
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.880]   with a big marketing blitz.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.400]   Wow, open source has changed.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.560]   Firefox has always been kind of one of the more aggressive
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.080]   groups about convincing people to switch.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:58.040]   There's a spreadfirefox.com and a get Firefox website.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.840]   Yeah, Leo, let's wait and see what this so-called marketing
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.480]   blitz really looks like.
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.280]   You don't think it's going to be an open source style marketing
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.480]   blitz with quotes?
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:11.000]   It won't be hanging banners off that giant tower in Toronto.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.080]   I guarantee that.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.160]   You know, I have to say though, companies like Firefox
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.120]   have these--
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.440]   talk about fanboys, these adherents who will put banners
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.440]   everywhere and badges everywhere.
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.480]   And Firefox makes money off these Google searches,
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.720]   as you told me, I think a couple of episodes ago.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:30.120]   So there is some money to spend on marketing.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.840]   Yeah, they get a piece of the action
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.360]   when you use that little Google thing.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.600]   They say they're going for 10% of the browser market
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.480]   by the end of this year.
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:40.040]   I still don't believe they only have that.
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.160]   I think if the problem with the--
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.480]   this is like to remember the old days of the original Star Trek
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.880]   show, and before they had demographics for TV shows,
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.640]   and they finally figured it out, and they said, well, wait a
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.040]   minute, we lost this audience.
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.000]   That was a pretty good audience, even though we didn't
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.200]   have real numbers.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.320]   The same thing I think holds true with these browsers.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.720]   I don't think they're real numbers.
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.440]   I mean, yeah, maybe they only have 10%.
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.920]   But who are these 10%?
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.160]   These are probably 10% of the people who really use the
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.120]   browser a lot.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.640]   I mean, my mom who doesn't even have a computer, if she goes
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.880]   online, she'd use the Explorer, but she'd use it once every
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:11.760]   five years.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.240]   So I'm not convinced that that 10% number is what it really
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.320]   sounds like.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:16.720]   It really--
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:20.440]   Loggers, for example, my blog, I get over 60% of the
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.800]   Google or Firefox users.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.280]   I think on Twitter, it's even 70% or 80%.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.520]   Very few users in Internet Explorer anymore.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:27.720]   So it's the literal--
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.280]   the literate technical technology users.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.800]   I think that 10% number doesn't mean anything.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:36.760]   And I think we need to read, examine what we mean by 10%
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:37.680]   market share.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:38.960]   Right.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.840]   I love Firefox, and I've been using one 5.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.400]   It's the current release candidate.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.080]   It's very stable.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.120]   I think they do a nice job.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.240]   It's a great browser.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.880]   It's remarkable.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:53.240]   And the open architecture for extensions is great.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.920]   You know, they did a smart thing.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:59.560]   Basically, the UI in Firefox is JavaScript and XML.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.680]   So it's very easy to modify the UI.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.120]   If you write extensions, you just have to know if JavaScript.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:09.320]   I think in some ways, because of that and things like Apple's
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:13.600]   dashboard, which is also in JavaScript, JavaScript is
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.160]   surprisingly, even with all its flaws, becoming a very
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.080]   popular language for writing stuff on the web.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.920]   Ajax.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.200]   Next topic.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.640]   I guess so.
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:25.480]   I guess so.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:28.320]   iTunes is number seven, the number seven music retailer
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.520]   in the United States.
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.560]   Is that weird or what?
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:35.960]   For the first time since ever, it's
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:36.360]   one down.
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.600]   It's Walmart's number one, then Best Buy, Target, Amazon,
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.520]   FYE, Circuit City.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.840]   These are all brick and mortar.
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.760]   And then, boy, boom.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.320]   I don't even know what FYE is.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.680]   You'd see it around.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.440]   Where you see FYE, don't you, Patrick?
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.080]   You live in the Midwest.
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.080]   I don't think I've ever seen one of those.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:55.840]   All the rest of them.
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.480]   Well, the FYE, I've seen it.
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.760]   I wonder, maybe it's East Coast.
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.200]   Hold on.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.600]   This calls for a Google search.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:07.480]   It's FYE.com for your entertainment.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.760]   And they have stores all over.
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.880]   I could have sworn I'd seen them around.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:12.480]   Maybe it's the--
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:12.880]   And I just--
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.080]   They're near you.
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.720]   Wow, they have-- oh, wow.
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.880]   They have stores everywhere except for--
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.160]   They're a big retailer.
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.280]   Idaho and Montana.
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.360]   I think they're in malls.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.360]   I think you guys don't go to the mall enough.
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.760]   But are they under the name FYE?
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.720]   F.Y.E.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.800]   It looks like it.
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.840]   I mean, you should see the map.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.680]   I mean, there's a ridiculous number coming down
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.560]   the Eastern seaboard.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.800]   They're the number five music retail in the US.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:42.240]   Somebody knows where they are.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.160]   But it's interesting, isn't it, that Walmart is dominant?
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:45.800]   It's the number--
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.560]   Walmart's been dominant for years.
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:48.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.040]   In fact, that's a big deal because sometimes Walmart
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:54.000]   will refuse to carry covers that are distasteful.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.960]   Well, at one point, they were selling, I think,
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.800]   over 20%, 25% of the music in the United States.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.440]   Wow.
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:00.800]   But then--
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.800]   Yeah, they were having huge influence.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.800]   Are you surprised the best buy is number two there?
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.720]   No, I'm not surprised by that.
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.640]   People go to Best Buy to buy music, huh?
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:15.520]   What do you think about the notion that Apple is basically
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:20.440]   charging a buck a song for low bit rate, low quality digital
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.200]   music?
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.480]   Do people care anymore about high fidelity?
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.680]   I do.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.480]   Well, most people have--
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:26.840]   Well, most people have--
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.120]   They buy tunes off there.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.240]   Most people have been using those earbuds
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.000]   and they keep them cranked up and they've blown out
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   their ears.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:33.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.760]   Well, maybe that's a strategy.
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:35.480]   But it's a problem.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.520]   That's a strategy.
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.440]   Well, for a while, we were getting more and more high
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:38.940]   fidelity.
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.040]   Music was getting more and more accurate.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.800]   And digital music really is taking a big step back.
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.480]   I'm not talking about CDs, uncompressed CDs,
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.840]   but compressed digital music is taking a big step backwards.
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.240]   I can't hear the difference, but I'm an old man.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.320]   And I've been using earbuds.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:56.760]   I don't know.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.320]   It's something that you're either excited about.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.320]   Are you not?
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:02.200]   Apparently, it's almost almost all of the CDs.
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.120]   Everybody's all excited about FYE.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:04.960]   That seems to be the--
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.600]   There's one at Stone Ridge over here in the East Bay.
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.840]   So yeah, I think it's a ball.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.160]   I think it's mostly malls.
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.640]   So Patrick, you would not buy digital music.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.160]   You would only buy CDs.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.520]   I do it once in a while for something.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.680]   I can't get any other way.
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.880]   But I don't like having the rights management.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.040]   So I like to be able to move my stuff around the house
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.080]   without having problems.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:26.160]   And I also like to be able to do a higher compression.
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.600]   To do less compression than they usually offer on the download
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.120]   sites.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.800]   When you put it on a portable player, what do you compress that?
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.960]   Depending on which player, basically building up
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.680]   two sets of music.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:39.480]   One's like 192, and the other one is lossless.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.360]   Do you use FLAC?
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.800]   What do you use for lossless?
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:42.800]   I've been playing around a lot.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:43.480]   It's not the best.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.400]   But I've been playing around a lot with the Apple Lossless
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.200]   codec just because it'll play on the--
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.720]   I've got a 60 gigabyte iPod, and I can just dump it on there
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.520]   and volume.
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.240]   And a lot of people use iTunes.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.360]   But you have to use iTunes.
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.920]   The nice thing about FLAC is it's kind of standard,
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.920]   but it doesn't work on an iPod.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.760]   Well, it's hard to find-- I mean, the Lossless codecs,
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.320]   it's hard to find support for them on the--
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.800]   I know I'm going to get a bunch of angry emails about this.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.640]   But it's more difficult to find support
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.040]   for the Lossless codecs on the players.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.040]   On the players.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:12.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.160]   But I've been doing some listening stuff.
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.160]   There's a lot of-- I had a chance
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.560]   to recompress a bunch of stuff and listen to it
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:19.560]   in a Lossless codec.
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.640]   And it was a reminder that you lose detail when you go down
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:27.520]   to 192K.
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:31.440]   It seems to me that at some point, the question is,
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.160]   is the content good enough?
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.600]   Look at the slow--
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.480]   Well, look at the slow--
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:36.720]   Is this--
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:37.920]   No, no, no.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.240]   I mean, in terms of the general market
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:44.240]   Patrick, look at the incredibly lethargic adoption of HD.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:48.440]   We know from John that HD is fantastic and sharp
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.800]   and crystalline and wonderful.
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:53.480]   But most consumers haven't made the move because--
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.040]   I know.
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.880]   I think you're looking at that the wrong way.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.880]   Because the TV picture is good enough.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:58.520]   Hold on.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:58.880]   Hold on.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.320]   Hold on.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.120]   Take a step back.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.080]   First of all, if you look at-- I'm pretty sure if you take
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.880]   a look at the consumer electronics alliance numbers,
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.120]   but they're going to tell you the majority of new TVs being
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:11.200]   purchased are starting to swing over to HD.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.200]   I know it's especially for DL.tv.
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.440]   We constantly get questions about HDTV
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.040]   because everybody's moving to that.
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.600]   But what do you mean when it comes to--
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.680]   I'm not arguing that the future is not HD.
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:23.520]   I think it is.
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.160]   Although it's been available for years
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.640]   and people haven't moved.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.480]   Certainly as old TVs die, you're
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.680]   going to replace it with an HD capable TV.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:39.200]   Yeah, but I mean Gary, how many times since 1970,
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.760]   how many televisions have you bought?
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.280]   You know what's going to transform this
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.600]   is when HD DVDs come out.
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.960]   I think people are smart enough to know that your DVD
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.960]   isn't going to be helped by HDTV.
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:50.960]   I don't know.
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:51.960]   I don't.
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:52.880]   Listen to me.
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.360]   The FCC is forcing the world over to HD.
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.600]   I mean, the old analog--
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.000]   The FCC is trying to liberate bandwidth.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.880]   And in the process, the side effect of that
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:02.800]   is to force people to--
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.800]   I have to say, I've changed my tune.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:08.680]   I, for a long time, was kind of berating the FCC saying there.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.840]   This is going against what consumers really want.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.080]   But I have to say now, consumers are pretty clearly
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.080]   in the HD camp.
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.520]   They want HDTV.
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.160]   Costco's got a lot to do with this.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.000]   Every time you go to Costco or these big stores,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.400]   you walk in and you see these things
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.800]   and you go, wow, this is pretty cool.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.960]   And now they're starting to show better content
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.280]   on those screens.
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:29.920]   And HBO is almost all HD.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.600]   Once you have HD DVD players in widespread use,
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:36.400]   I think every-- and look at the Xbox 360.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.520]   The full version comes out of the box with HD.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.040]   Well, yeah.
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:40.960]   Let's get back to the point in the next--
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.640]   OK, let's get back to the audio.
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.360]   I think this argument's different than the--
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:47.240]   I mean, I was gallant of you, Steve, to try this.
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.600]   But I think the argument for audio is different.
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.880]   I know a lot of people who--
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:51.600]   I know a lot of people--
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.280]   I agree with you.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.040]   The people who don't get it.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:58.560]   I know a lot of people who download music from iTunes,
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:02.120]   the quality of the audio is absolutely never an issue
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.160]   for your typical just--
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:04.760]   I agree.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:05.880]   The Huy-Pulloy.
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.600]   I'm Huy-Pulloy then, because it sounds fine to me.
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:09.080]   Yeah.
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.280]   By most of my music on iTunes, it's convenience for me.
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.800]   And Patrick, is the iPod good enough
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.400]   to notice the difference if you put a lossless audio on it?
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.080]   Yes, it is.
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:20.680]   I don't think it does a little--
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.280]   Absolutely.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.320]   Can you hear it in the difference in the little headphones?
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:25.680]   Well, you--
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.280]   In the little headphones, not so much.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.320]   But I'm usually using a decent set of headphones
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:33.800]   or I'm running it through my desktop speakers.
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.240]   So you just said a BMW speaker is in a 100 watt amplifier.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.160]   Yeah, you might hear it.
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.560]   And I can hear huge differences, especially--
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.160]   I do agree with Patrick.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.600]   --souples, high-end, jazz.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.720]   Even the punk rock stuff, you can definitely
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.400]   hear differences in the quality of the audio.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.320]   Are we breeding a generation of kids
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.040]   who don't know the difference?
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:52.520]   Absolutely.
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.480]   It's probably more even read.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.480]   I had a meeting with the mission electronics
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.400]   people in Las Vegas at the last CES
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.040]   who are used to make these really fancy speakers and amps
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:01.360]   and stuff.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.160]   And they said that there's a lost generation of people
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.200]   that have a nice stereo system in their house.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.960]   They listen on these earbuds and these mediocre little computer
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:14.160]   speakers, and they're losing their ears.
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:14.680]   Wow.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.560]   You can't sell these speakers anymore.
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.280]   It also just changes the way you even mix the album.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.000]   I mean, everything has to be much harder.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.040]   Well, we do-- we noticed that with Twit,
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.360]   we mix it for earbuds because we know
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.240]   that's how most people will be listening.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:31.000]   Not that we're high fidelity by any means.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.760]   But partially also to tap on what the mission folks are saying,
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.160]   one of the things they're forgetting
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.640]   is there's usually-- there's a small percentage of people
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.760]   who buy decent audio equipment through high school and college.
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.720]   I mean, the classic nerd, geek demographic.
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.680]   And then a lot of people come into it later.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:45.360]   You know what I mean?
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.200]   But if you're looking at high quality audio,
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.800]   that's always been a minority of the--
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:53.400]   No, but they see the numbers dropping drastically.
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.920]   And worse, huh?
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.400]   My gripe is DRM.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.200]   I don't want to buy something that I don't have the right
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.400]   to do with whatever I want to in perpetuity.
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.680]   So I buy CDs and rip them and compress them myself,
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:09.480]   just like Patrick, because I like having a really strong master
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.480]   that I own.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.480]   I mean, it's interesting.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.320]   Look at it.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.080]   Because if you take a generation of kids,
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.520]   a really guy had the indie music around the time
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.680]   that Napster first became popular.
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.760]   The audio quality, and that was atrocious.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.360]   There's a good enough for-- on the flip side,
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.520]   you've got entire generations for the last decade
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:32.360]   that have been building up insane car stereo systems,
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:35.960]   where it's moved beyond just beyond the big dual 15-inch
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:38.320]   woofers that are rattling the spare tire and the trunk,
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.640]   but to do in serious competition on audio reproduction
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:42.800]   quality.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.720]   And the other thing is maybe the mission people
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.880]   are in acknowledging is that the average quality of a lot
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:51.320]   of consumer electronics has gone up dramatically
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.520]   in the last decade.
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:53.520]   You know what I mean?
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.440]   There used to be a huge gulf between mid-fi and the stuff
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:59.240]   you would find for sale on the consumer,
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:02.960]   the shelves that your local Sears or Target or Walmart
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.760]   or Kmart or wherever you shop for your stuff,
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.560]   Best Buy, Circuit City.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:11.360]   I don't think that void is as vast anymore.
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:11.960]   Interesting.
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:15.360]   Well, you know, Nick, I think we should go to the next topic.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:15.860]   I know.
[00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:17.240]   I think it's kind of interesting that--
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:20.280]   I mean, before Patrick names every retailer in the country.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:22.740]   All right.
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:24.280]   I got a related topic.
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:29.640]   Charmin Networks, given just 10 days by Australian courts
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:34.600]   to take pirated music off its system or shut down entirely
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.800]   until December 5th.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:36.360]   Wow.
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.040]   It's kind of the end of the line for Kazah.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.240]   Or are they going to squeak out of this one?
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.640]   Well, is it-- they had to take it off
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:42.640]   or they have to filter it?
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.240]   This is exactly the--
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.840]   almost to the letter what happened in Napster,
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.120]   where the judge said, all right, you have--
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.840]   and this is what the record industry was saying.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:56.760]   They have the technology to filter out copyrighted music.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.000]   They have 10 days to do it.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.880]   And remember, Napster said, we can't do it.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.960]   And eventually just close their doors.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:04.520]   What would happen?
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:07.240]   Charmin must, as a first step only, by the way.
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:10.720]   This isn't the final compliance, implement a keyword
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:14.440]   filtering system for Kazah that will remove links
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.720]   to copyrighted files being shared over the network.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.080]   Of course, if there are misspellings--
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.640]   and this is exactly what happened in Napster--
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.480]   people started misspelling Metallica
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.560]   to get their stuff through there.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.840]   It'll get by the filters.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.760]   And that's why the judge, I think in the long run,
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:31.360]   will say, no, you've got to get this copyrighted music off.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:35.000]   Rockstar and E. Dockey, shut down last month,
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.440]   thanks to lawsuits.
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:39.840]   BitTorrent just signed a deal with the MPAA.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:42.360]   I could-- it's kind of more symbolic than anything else.
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:45.040]   But Bram Cohen said, no, we won't carry any pirated music
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.240]   on BitTorrent.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:46.680]   Not the BitTorrent.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.640]   No, what they said they would do is
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.280]   he would work to make the search in to take--
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:51.800]   The track.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.600]   Copyright and material that shows up in the search engine.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:58.200]   But does Bram even run a tracker?
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.160]   I mean, he makes a soft--
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:31:59.680]   Yes.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.680]   Oh, he does.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.680]   Yeah, he put the search on.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.520]   Brown the time that everybody started getting shut down
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:08.080]   by the lawsuits, he put a search up on the BitTorrent website.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:08.920]   OK.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:11.080]   But that's not the way it searched that BitTorrent.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:13.440]   Pirates don't use BitTorrent.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.760]   I mean, to use their searches, they go to a tracker
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.160]   like Pirates Bay or something.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:20.160]   Yeah, there's a bunch of black sites in Germany, everyone uses.
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.520]   So it's more symbolic, I think, for Bram to say that.
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:25.240]   But I think the motion picture association is hoping that here
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:28.480]   is the guy who invented BitTorrent if he says no pirated stuff.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.720]   And I think Bram's doing it because he's
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:35.120]   looking at that Supreme Court decision saying--
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.360]   Well, he's also looking-- BitTorrent's raised $9 million
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.960]   of venture capital funded to develop more--
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.520]   They came to move off.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.480]   Well, they bought it.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.680]   Well, I think that the MPAA.
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.480]   I think BitTorrent has a lot to gain from gathering--
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.280]   getting people in the MPAA to distribute--
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:53.800]   Oh, sure.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:54.880]   --they're gaining them as clients.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.480]   And the MPAA knows that BitTorrent right now is still
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.680]   the best solution for them.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.000]   They have a few--
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.680]   But they have to start with some kind of formal agreement.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.040]   They're coming for you, Alex.
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:03.680]   Or is it that?
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.240]   You know, the other thing is BitTorrent.
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.200]   BitTorrent isn't about content.
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.040]   It's about a distribution mechanism.
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.680]   And he shouldn't even be caught up in any of this stuff.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.280]   And in fact, I think what's going to happen
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.960]   is that the Motion Picture Association is
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:18.960]   going to use peer-to-peer of some kind, maybe BitTorrent,
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.520]   to distribute movies.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.360]   And that's just the beginning of that.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.640]   Well, I think that Apple needs to really pay attention
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.440]   to what's going on there related to iTunes.
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.960]   To make iTunes truly scalable for video,
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.080]   Apple has to have some kind of peer-to-peer in the back-end
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:32.480]   to iTunes.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.000]   It kills us.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.840]   We can't distribute-- we're not visible.
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:36.680]   Our video is not visible on the iTunes music store,
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.640]   because we can't afford the bandwidth.
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:39.560]   We're not Ziff Davis.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:42.560]   We can't afford to pay--
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.720]   How many terabytes are you using for digital life TV
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:46.220]   Patrick?
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:46.720]   I mean, it must be--
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:47.720]   A lot.
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:48.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.240]   Yeah, I mean, it's just--
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:52.560]   it must cost thousands of months.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:55.480]   We got a pretty good deal on the bandwidth, actually.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.040]   Well, can you help me?
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:57.360]   We just got another provider.
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.480]   Can you help a buddy out?
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.440]   OK.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.400]   I'll see what I can do.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.680]   I've been going around and out and hand-sing.
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:06.880]   Please, sir, can I have some bandwidth?
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:07.400]   But--
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.560]   Let me see what I can set up.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.320]   You're talking 500 megabyte files,
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.920]   and you're talking potentially 100,000 downloads
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.200]   of that file.
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:14.700]   Yeah.
[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:16.720]   That's a scary amount.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:19.720]   Well, talking about big files, let's talk about that 300 gigabyte
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:21.640]   DVD nonsense.
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:24.280]   What's the deal there?
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:27.600]   Well, I mean, it's essentially a technology that--
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.080]   It's holographic memory.
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.600]   Yeah, well, holographic memory.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.320]   It's a technology that people have been playing around
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.560]   with for decades.
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:36.040]   And it never worked commercially before,
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.680]   and I don't see it working now.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:40.040]   I mean, it's nice that we have these kinds of things.
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:43.880]   But as far as I can tell, it's similar to that run-up we
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:47.320]   had with these field emission displays, these so-called Feds
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.160]   that were also known as the thin CRT.
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:50.680]   But this is a credible company.
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:53.200]   This is in-phase, which is a spin-off of Lucent.
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.960]   They say they're going to start selling them next year.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.160]   Yeah, sure.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.920]   They can read and write, they say, at 10 times the speed of DVD,
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:04.360]   they fold 300 gigabytes on a disk.
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.640]   It's roughly the size of a CD or a DVD.
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:10.080]   Yeah, they probably can sell one or two at $150,000 a pop.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.920]   Ah.
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:14.360]   So you're saying it's not going to be affordable?
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.080]   Exactly.
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:15.600]   All right.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.760]   You think it'd be affordable initially?
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.680]   Well, I know, but this is really unaffordable.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.800]   We're not talking about-- you could buy some of these DVD
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.960]   burners when they first came out for 10 grand.
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.320]   This thing is going to be over the top.
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:27.480]   There's no way it's going to even be that cheap.
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.120]   Be interesting, though, if they could come out with this,
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.320]   then you would have-- I mean, you already
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.600]   have a format war on high-def DVDs.
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.120]   Oh, this is never going to happen, Leo.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.280]   This is one of those things that come up all the time,
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.160]   and they just flop every time.
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.760]   They suck up a lot of venture capital money.
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:44.200]   And then you wonder what-- some years from now,
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:45.400]   maybe they'll get the thing to work,
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.640]   but it'll be a decade away.
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:47.240]   They got a talk.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.960]   But they've got a video that shows the insights.
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:51.240]   They actually have a prototype.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.200]   They've got the feeling it.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:52.880]   They've got a time.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:53.760]   It's not rendered.
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:56.920]   It's actual physical machinery going on.
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:59.280]   Max-L has agreed to make the discs.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.080]   So why?
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:03.040]   They would agree to do anything.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.520]   As a business model for the--
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:06.400]   I mean, the movie industries are fighting over
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.840]   whatever format they're going to end up using,
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:10.400]   and they'll probably finish fighting over the DVD formats
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.080]   about the time when we realize we don't really care
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:13.440]   about DVDs anymore.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.280]   But--
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.200]   What's that?
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.080]   Just how curiosity.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:18.720]   When's that going to be?
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.240]   I think within a decade, we're going
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:22.560]   to stop really thinking about the idea of--
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:23.840]   I mean, even now--
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.080]   How will we get-- well, you mean you're saying online
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:25.880]   distribution?
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:26.840]   Yeah, you just download it.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:30.600]   I mean, the thing is, right now, that's a big file.
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.880]   In Korea, right now, it would not be a big file.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:34.880]   You need to download a movie.
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:35.600]   Because they've got the--
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.200]   You need to download 4 gigs.
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:39.840]   Yeah, they got the bandwidth to just drag it down.
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:40.680]   I don't see any--
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.480]   I can believe buying this.
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.240]   I mean, we could be doing that with music right now,
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.480]   but people still buy CDs.
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.760]   My wife won't download anything.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:49.720]   I'm not even into this.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.280]   This is-- you can also download books,
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.440]   but people still buy books.
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.560]   I don't think media necessarily goes away
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:56.040]   when it gets such a foothold.
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.400]   I don't think it just disappears.
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.640]   I think it just manages its own market after a while.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.040]   I don't see these things going away.
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.320]   I don't see newspapers going away.
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.480]   I don't see magazines going away.
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:05.640]   I don't see nothing going away.
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.160]   So why don't you--
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.000]   I just see these things stabilizing.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.080]   DVDs aren't going away.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:09.680]   I think you're right.
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:12.080]   I think I'm going to make a bad train joke here.
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:15.040]   Well, there is a eventual phase out.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:17.080]   Eight tracks are gone.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:20.960]   Yeah, but eight tracks never got the big foothold.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:23.080]   Now, you could make the argument that vinyl--
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.160]   yeah, that one away was replaced by something else,
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.640]   and that's always a potential.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:27.600]   Because that's not on their way.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:28.880]   Vinyl is still being made.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.480]   Well, yeah, it'll be made, but the question is,
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.600]   is it the center of the market?
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.680]   And when you look at Apple going to number seven,
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:37.880]   it's starting to become--
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.480]   I mean, there's a lot of us.
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:44.080]   I even buy-- I buy CDs and rip them for my own use as well.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.800]   But the thing is, is that what we want
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:48.240]   is we want it to end up on our portable player.
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.200]   We don't want to have that piece of plastic.
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:54.720]   I have this little system to rip my DVDs
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:59.280]   so that I can watch them on my PSP or on my iPod.
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.640]   And I'm not downloading them.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.080]   I go get my DVDs, and I do it.
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:04.080]   But the thing is, I'd rather just download it.
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.680]   It's way easier for me to do it.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.040]   But I think for you, it is.
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.680]   I think maybe 10 years from now to be interesting to check this out,
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.680]   because this is really worth examining.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.680]   But the idea of these portable players,
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:19.000]   I have mixed feelings about them ever getting the kind of traction
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.520]   that everybody thinks.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.240]   There's this interesting thing going on where
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:26.920]   you have the one movement toward HDTV with 40-inch plasmas
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.120]   and 60-inch screens.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:31.600]   And I have a 90-inch projector, along with these little handheld
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.480]   devices with a four-inch screen that we're
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.880]   supposed to watch movies on.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.880]   But we'll know what about IPTV?
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:39.080]   Well, what about IPTV, though, where you download--
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:40.920]   the movie is still coming in through the internet,
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:43.280]   but you're going to watch it on your big screen TV.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:46.200]   Yeah, you maybe want to watch it on a portable device, too.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.240]   But it just seems-- I think these portable devices
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.760]   are a flash in the pan, personally.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.520]   Well, I just think that I think that the media goes
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:53.480]   in two different directions.
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:56.080]   So there's some media that makes sense to work on a small screen.
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.800]   There's some media, like a big movie
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.880]   that would be great to see on a projector.
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.640]   And I think that-- but whether it's
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.440]   a large screen on the side of my wall
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:07.640]   in my house or in my iPod video, the thing--
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.200]   the bottom line is is that I don't
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.600]   want to buy some piece of plastic that holds it.
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.440]   I just want to log in and download it.
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:16.760]   Well, relevant to these stories, there's two big stories.
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:20.000]   Tivo has announced that they're going to allow you to move
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.800]   TV shows using the Tivo Tacos system onto an iPod.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:24.160]   Only on a--
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:25.440]   Desperation.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:26.840]   Desperation?
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:27.600]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.160]   These guys are going out of business.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:29.560]   I don't know.
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:32.240]   I think the Tivo Yahoo deal is significant.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.240]   Don't you think Tivo's got--
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:35.440]   it goes up, let me know.
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:36.720]   I'd buy now.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:40.760]   I think Tivo has a shot now because this deal with Yahoo--
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:41.560]   and we talked about this.
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:42.400]   You weren't around, John.
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.640]   We talked about this in Twitter.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:45.480]   I think this deal with Yahoo means
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:50.040]   that Tivo is in good position to become the IPTV set-top box.
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.720]   This is Tivo's best shot.
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.720]   I think Tivo's in trouble.
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:54.720]   All right, what do you know?
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:54.760]   There's another one.
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:57.480]   CBS in talks with Yahoo and Google
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:00.800]   to start making television shows and archival news footage
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.320]   available on the web.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.160]   Wow.
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:04.040]   Now, which one is it?
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:07.240]   I think it's CBS that's actually still looking at selling shows
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.840]   and then adding advertising to it as well.
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.640]   And selling shows for $1.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:13.040]   And advertising?
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.680]   And advertising.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:18.400]   Disney did this deal with Desperate Housewives and Lost.
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:19.960]   But there was no advertising.
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.880]   There's no advertising, but they're selling it for money
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.120]   if you make enough money.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.400]   And I know you'll be happy about this, John.
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:29.760]   NBC has made a deal with DirecTV for My Name Is Earl.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.600]   Your favorite show?
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:32.080]   You know what?
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:34.480]   It's not my favorite show, but it's one of my favorite shows.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.440]   It's a tremendously funny show.
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.440]   So they're making a deal?
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:39.640]   Battlestar Galactica as well to--
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:43.080]   She's not-- that's the bad side of the argument.
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:43.760]   There's a lot.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.560]   But see, hey, if you're going for the big audience,
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:48.080]   Battlestar Galactica is probably a good choice.
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.680]   Well, and the advantage of all this,
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:53.480]   I totally agree with Alex, the preparation of the media
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:57.760]   from like a DVD to a file that you can then
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.640]   make transportable at the moment.
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.440]   It's not only very labor intensive,
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.960]   but even if you automate it with scripts,
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:06.400]   it takes an amazing amount of time to transcode this stuff
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:06.900]   down.
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:07.400]   It's true.
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:10.160]   I mean, CBN says they want to put their entire 60-minute archive
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:12.800]   online so that you could type in Harry Truman
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.520]   and find footage of Harry Truman.
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.360]   Well, that'd be great.
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:15.920]   It'd be great.
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:16.800]   But boy, you're right.
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.040]   That's a lot of work.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:19.720]   That's a lot of work.
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:23.560]   But do you think if you've got enough little worker bees doing it,
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:24.920]   there's a bit of--
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:27.560]   And I think also if you're going to do it on that scale,
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:30.280]   then you bring in some serious hardware compression
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.560]   and you can do a much better job.
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:34.440]   Well, also, I'm sorry, a lot of these companies
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:35.560]   already have that.
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:37.520]   Like Discovery Channel has that entire--
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:40.680]   they can search all of their old data right now.
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:43.280]   So making it available to the public is not something
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.400]   like they have to do a lot of work.
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.800]   They just have to turn the database outward.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.720]   So it's already online and digitized?
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:50.720]   Yeah.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:52.440]   In the example of Discovery Networks,
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:54.120]   all of that stuff is already there.
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.760]   And BBC was the same way.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.760]   A lot of these companies are already working that way.
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:00.480]   When you buy your stock footage from ABC stock,
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.840]   that stuff has all been digitized.
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.520]   It's all been sorted, tagged.
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.840]   Everything's done.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.520]   For a lot of these companies, they've
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:10.880]   been doing all of the work to make that possible for a decade.
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.080]   Now, a lot of the data wasn't at full res.
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:15.440]   That's why it's easy for them to turn the low-res stuff public,
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:18.160]   is because it was just to search it so that they could--
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.960]   so then you would be able to search 320 by 240s--
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.280]   Sort of like a thumbnail.
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:23.160]   Exactly.
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:24.520]   And then you'd say, I need this footage.
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:25.080]   I need this footage.
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:27.680]   We used to order this stuff all the time when I was working
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.400]   at a cable network.
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.840]   And so you would just go through it.
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:30.800]   You'd watch all the stuff.
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.920]   And then you would just order--
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:34.240]   you'd pay whatever you were going to pay for the licensing.
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:37.880]   And you'd get a beta tape of all the stuff
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:39.040]   that you had ordered for your edit.
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:42.120]   You know who's really making money on the net?
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:43.520]   Ruth Parrisall.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.400]   You ever hear of her?
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:47.520]   Ruth Parrisall's a 38-year-old lawyer
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.760]   lives in the tax habit of Gibraltar.
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:52.880]   She's worth $1.8 billion, one of the wealthiest women
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:53.680]   in the world.
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:56.160]   How'd she make her money first with phone sex?
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:00.360]   Then web porn, then with partypoker.com.
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:03.080]   She's as rich as Mark Cuban.
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:03.800]   How old is she?
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.240]   She's 38.
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:07.080]   She's looking for a jage.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.040]   Hey Steve, Steve, she's a looker.
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:10.640]   She's gorgeous.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.320]   She's apparently quite beautiful.
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:15.880]   She's from Marin County, a mother of two.
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:18.400]   And she is one of the richest women in the world.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:18.920]   How'd she do it?
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.680]   Partypoker.com.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:21.720]   What's not to like?
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:23.200]   There you go.
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:29.800]   So I'm just saying, if you want to make money, it's the same old story.
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:30.760]   Sex and gambling.
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:32.720]   Sex and gambling.
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:34.760]   Pretty amazing.
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.520]   Well, I just think it's very interesting
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:41.200]   to see all of these mainstream media giants get sucked in by this IPTV thing.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:45.320]   Do you think they're being fooled by the flavor of the month,
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.120]   or do you think they're--
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:48.560]   You know, IPTV is big everywhere in the world,
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.600]   except the United States already.
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:56.240]   If you go to my website, IPTVDaily.com, there's a plug.
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.680]   When did this start?
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.680]   I started about six months ago.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:00.880]   I know it's another one.
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:04.760]   But it's basically-- you know, there's all these stories
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:08.680]   that I've been cataloging, and it's like, this is everything's going on everywhere,
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:09.280]   except here.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.200]   It's unbelievable to me that we're so far behind on this one.
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.600]   We don't even know what we're doing.
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:14.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.840]   Well, so you said you liked the idea of being able to search
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:18.840]   for Harry Truman and finding footage of Harry Truman?
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:19.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:20.600]   That would be very useful for writers.
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:21.760]   Well, that'd be awesome.
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.560]   I think it'd be useful for anybody.
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:24.760]   Because you can't get these quotes.
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:26.680]   I mean, there's a lot of good stuff that's done on television
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:27.960]   that you can't find the quote.
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:30.000]   You can't get the quote because they don't do transcripts.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:30.920]   I think the biggest one--
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:31.920]   Because you want to quote somebody.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.240]   Because they haven't been saving tape.
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:37.280]   You know, where is our old tech TV tape?
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:37.960]   Who knows?
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:38.440]   You know what?
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:40.040]   I took all mine home.
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:40.960]   They're smart.
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:42.760]   Because they were going to throw them out, like they always do.
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:48.240]   So I have all my shows right until the day that they went to the hard disk for the recorder,
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:51.400]   which was just before they took the show off the air.
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:52.000]   That's the sign.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.080]   I have all the other shows.
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:55.200]   I've got four years where the show is all downstairs.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:55.840]   I see it right here.
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:45:00.440]   Devorak talking to Google Yahoo for putting all his archives online.
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:01.400]   Actually, you know what?
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:01.880]   I'm joking.
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:02.360]   But actually--
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:03.320]   Yeah, they really want that.
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:04.000]   I don't know.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.840]   I think that that could well be serious value.
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:09.080]   I think you're smart to save that stuff.
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.000]   After all, think about it.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   We talked to--
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.360]   I mean, this was always one of the things I liked about tech TV.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:17.320]   And one of the things I had hoped it would be is an authoritative record
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:21.880]   of these people who, you know, in 100 years, were all going to be dead.
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:22.880]   But there might be--
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:25.600]   If somebody saves this stuff, a record of it.
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:27.680]   Yeah, there's also the problem with dead media, though.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:28.680]   You know what I mean?
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:29.200]   Well, exactly.
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:32.960]   That's why digitization is a key right now.
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:34.440]   Get it into bits.
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:40.280]   And I think that somebody is going to get to a point where they can normalize the procedure
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:41.280]   of downloading this stuff.
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.960]   And I think right now, the company most--
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:46.920]   you know, you have AOL, it has a really, really good--
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:48.640]   you know, it is positioned well for that stuff.
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:51.480]   But I don't know if old content is really going to be the answer.
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:52.000]   I think that--
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.040]   Old content's bad.
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:57.680]   Yeah, and I think that-- but I think that if Apple let people buy videos,
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:00.920]   you know, I think that it would-- the whole thing would flip on.
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:02.320]   I think that Tivo is really great.
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:04.320]   But Tivo's got 2 million subscribers.
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:06.240]   There'll be 2 million people with video iPods.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.080]   There's already 3 million PSP users.
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:08.720]   Is that right?
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:10.000]   There are 8 million.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.120]   I don't know what the number is.
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:13.400]   But there's all these people with these portable devices that are ready
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:17.720]   to buy stuff, you know, that are ready to get that stuff either.
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:21.680]   It's just the purchasing process and that sorting process is the part
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:24.000]   that is still missing.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.360]   You know, and I think that-- and for us as individuals to not have
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.520]   to deal with the e-commerce level of it.
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.360]   And I think that all these companies are trying to work
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:33.640]   with the big media companies to make it--
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:36.440]   to figure out some way to take their old content and shovel it
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:39.480]   up on the web rather than working with new content creators
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.880]   to find a way to create fresh stuff.
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:43.560]   Well, while you bring out--
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:45.120]   It's just free money for them.
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:46.480]   That's the way they look at the old content.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:46.880]   Right there.
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:49.360]   Yeah, but it's not free money because it costs money to serve it.
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:50.400]   But anyway, while you're on the--
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:50.800]   You know that.
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:51.360]   I know that.
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:53.880]   But they're looking at it from the--
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:55.880]   Since we're-- I don't want to make a segue here.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:58.200]   But since you brought up television in the first place,
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:02.160]   we should talk about the bad news this week in TV, which you mentioned.
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:03.720]   Which "Ayleus" is the number.
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:04.720]   Although I--
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:05.240]   Now, wait.
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:05.760]   Ayleus--
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:06.640]   This is the last season.
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:08.600]   And what a painful death.
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:10.080]   Oh, you're not talking about "Ayleus" wavefront.
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:12.000]   You're talking about the TV show "Ayleus"?
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   Jennifer.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:13.520]   Jennifer.
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:14.760]   Jennifer's gone.
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.400]   And-- and-- and-- and she's gone.
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.440]   I don't think she's gone.
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:18.000]   I think she's gone.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   Thank god.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   She's--
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:20.160]   You know what?
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:22.280]   I see Steve Gibson is a big fan of the show.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:25.840]   I watched it religiously until they moved it to Thursday,
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:28.240]   where it collides with everything else in the world.
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:28.840]   And it's like, oh--
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:29.760]   And it's like, oh--
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:30.960]   See, that's why two of them--
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:32.280]   Download it to your iPod.
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:32.920]   There you go.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:33.280]   See--
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.840]   And you know, you know, they've been trying
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:35.560]   to screw with the show.
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:36.480]   They move with the Thursday.
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:37.400]   They moved it to Wednesday.
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:37.840]   They changed.
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.120]   They keep moving back and forth.
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:41.680]   And they wonder why the show never got traction.
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:42.040]   Hey, they--
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:43.680]   I mean, it seems to me when it was on Wednesday,
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:44.520]   it was doing fine.
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:46.400]   At least they never moved it to 6am Pacific,
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:47.960]   like a G4 move call for help.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:49.400]   The real earmark--
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:52.040]   The real earmark of its death, if anybody's a real fan out
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:54.920]   there, there used to be a website called sd6.com.
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:56.960]   And it was sd-6.com.
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:59.160]   And when that guy folded the website
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:01.160]   after the fourth year, because it was too much work for him,
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:03.960]   he had maintained all the highlighted letters.
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:05.840]   And he was doing all kinds of weird stuff.
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:07.560]   And he kept all the show, a synopsis.
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:08.560]   It was amazing.
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:11.600]   And then he closed it down because he got a real job.
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:13.240]   To me, that was the end of the show.
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:16.160]   And of course, sd6 was shut down, too,
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:19.600]   when Arlen got captured and figured out all that stuff.
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:21.120]   But anyway, at least ABC says they're
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:25.360]   going to try to pump up the last few episodes for the fans.
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:30.080]   Anything else that you guys have on your agendas?
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:30.800]   It's it for me.
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:34.080]   I want to mention we did a survey, a very interesting survey
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:38.480]   through PodTrack of tweet listeners.
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:40.520]   And some interesting results came out of that.
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:41.600]   I'll tell you what.
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:44.280]   I'll see if I could-- it's an Excel spreadsheet.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:47.600]   I'll see if I can figure out a way to post it on the website.
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:48.760]   Can you summarize it?
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:51.040]   Well, yeah, 97% mail.
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:57.640]   60% single and living alone.
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:00.140]   Uh-oh.
[00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:01.680]   That's not good.
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:04.240]   Now, this is out of, I think, 3,500 or something
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:09.480]   like that responses for 75-year-olds, but most of them.
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:11.560]   It might be self-selecting at that, you know,
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:12.280]   with this kind of thing.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:13.520]   It is self-selecting, of course.
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:15.800]   A guy living at home more likely to do it.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:16.880]   Maybe that's it.
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:21.240]   Well, he has enough peace and quiet to be able to concentrate.
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:24.480]   They're all Steve Gibson's.
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:26.760]   All right, nobody nagging him.
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:31.440]   About 16%, 70% students, which is what I would expect.
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:32.920]   A broad demographic range.
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:36.400]   But I was kind of surprised as so few women listen to this.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.400]   3%.
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:41.960]   Well, we do want to thank all the folks who make this possible.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:43.840]   Most importantly, of course, our donors.
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:46.000]   And we want to remind you that if you like Twit,
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:46.760]   you can keep it going.
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:49.600]   We are-- by the way, oh, I have a big announcement.
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:51.840]   The Twit Store is going to go online later this week,
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:54.160]   just in time for the holidays.
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:55.600]   And we'll have Devorak.
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:58.000]   I get no spam hats.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.680]   We'll have Twit hoodies.
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:02.960]   We'll have T-shirts, caps, stickers, bumper stickers.
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:06.240]   Anything I can jam into that store, we're going to put there.
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:08.000]   In fact, if I can figure out a way to get
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.840]   CDs of Twit security now and our other podcasts online,
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:12.760]   I will.
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:15.840]   We are starting a new podcast, a Twit extension,
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:18.320]   is what I'm going to call these.
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:20.240]   On Tuesday with Amber MacArthur, we're
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:23.760]   going to do a web 2.0 podcast called Inside the Net, which
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:26.600]   will be all about the new web technologies.
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.440]   We're going to start with a look at the Flock browser
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:29.200]   with its creator.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:31.880]   We're going to talk about Mozilla 1.5 with Mike Shaver
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:34.560]   from Mozilla.org and some other great topics.
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:35.200]   Very cool.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.520]   Yeah, it'll be a fun podcast.
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:38.280]   Yeah, like Inside the Net, that's a great name.
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:40.680]   Yeah, Inside the Net, Under the Net, Cotton the Net.
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:42.840]   I don't know, something like that.
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:45.680]   About internet tonight.
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:47.480]   You know, if I could find Harry-- and I think he's
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:50.440]   off chasing Sasquatch-- but if I could find him,
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:52.200]   I think he'd make a great podcast.
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:54.080]   You know, I should mention the listeners out there.
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:56.800]   We did have a show at Tech TV called Internet Tonight,
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:59.760]   which was the most professionally produced
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:01.360]   and slickest show that they did.
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:03.440]   First to be canceled, and for no good reason,
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:05.040]   out of the blue, with no numbers.
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:05.920]   First show to be canceled.
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:07.640]   You know why I got canceled?
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:10.280]   Paul Allen hated it.
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:11.320]   I'm not kidding.
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:13.440]   Was it too slick for him?
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:15.120]   I think it was-- well, it was also
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:16.640]   one of the more expensive shows.
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:18.160]   But I thought it was brilliant.
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:21.200]   Michaela Pereira, who has gone on to start him at KTLA in Los
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:21.640]   Angeles.
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:23.120]   So Paul didn't like it.
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:23.720]   I didn't know that.
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:24.680]   I never heard that story.
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:26.400]   I believe that was the case.
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:29.360]   Paul killed it.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:31.360]   Scott Herry had funny, funny comedian.
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:33.840]   It was the best written show on Tech TV.
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:35.240]   Well, it was probably the only written show on it.
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:36.120]   And it was fast.
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:37.560]   It was great.
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:39.880]   I always thought it was going to be the big hit on Tech TV,
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:40.920]   to be honest with you.
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:44.080]   You mean, it was actually a written show for Tech TV.
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:45.120]   It was well produced.
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:46.480]   It was beautifully done.
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:49.080]   I actually got to host it once.
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:49.840]   Did you?
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.320]   Yeah, I took Michaela's place for one show just because I
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:54.600]   kept on testing because I wanted to do a show like that,
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:56.160]   just to see what it was like.
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:57.960]   And it was really professional.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:59.480]   I mean, it was really a hot show.
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:00.440]   Very well produced.
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:02.480]   I just thought, there were some really good shows.
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:06.680]   I think the music show we did was quite good too.
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:08.600]   But people like the screen savers.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:10.360]   What can you say?
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:12.560]   Some people have no taste.
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:13.040]   Thank God.
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:14.880]   Screen savers, yeah, but that was just basically you
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:16.280]   carrying the show.
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:18.800]   Leo, what was the guy named Patrick John there too?
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.520]   Let's not forget.
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:22.400]   The love flowing over the phone, John.
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:23.400]   It's just--
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:25.240]   Oh, you know Patrick?
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:25.920]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:26.840]   Patrick's on the line.
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:29.360]   Patrick, I mean, you were carrying the show.
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:32.160]   You bite me a second time.
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:35.920]   Leo, what's the story with G4?
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:38.520]   God, I don't know.
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:41.160]   The ratings are appallingly bad for that channel.
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:44.480]   0.01, which is statistically zero.
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:47.720]   We were getting a 0.03 for call for help when we first got on.
[00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:50.200]   So they moved us to 9 a.m.
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.200]   And now we're down to 0.01 as well.
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:52.760]   The man shows--
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:53.480]   They're geniuses.
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:54.920]   They're brilliant.
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:58.520]   The man shows doing OK, though, 0.09, which is still pretty
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:52:59.120]   pathetic.
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:00.880]   And given the cost of the man show,
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:03.320]   I doubt that I think it's a money loser for them.
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:05.640]   So who knows what's going to happen with the show?
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:09.040]   How expensive is it to have gals and bikinis jumping
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:09.760]   on trampolines?
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.680]   Well, you buy a successful show like the man show.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:12.920]   You're spending some bucks.
[00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:13.280]   Wait a minute.
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.280]   You tell me G4 bought the man show?
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:16.160]   They bought these.
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:17.520]   Reruns of the man show.
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:19.320]   Oh, great.
[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:21.040]   Reruns of a topical show.
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:22.160]   Fantastic.
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:25.360]   You know, people don't watch for the news on that show, John.
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:28.720]   I think they watch for the trampoline.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:31.160]   Be my guess, but I could be wrong.
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:32.680]   I've never seen it, actually.
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:33.840]   And I'm sticking to that story.
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:35.640]   Oh, the commercials are annoying enough.
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:36.400]   It's like, oh my god.
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:39.040]   Well, they run them throughout call for help, which is really
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:39.720]   annoying.
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:40.840]   I wish they wouldn't do that.
[00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:43.440]   But we don't have any control over that.
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:44.120]   So the twist--
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:46.320]   What's all those big bucks you're making there, Leo?
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:47.840]   You shouldn't be complaining.
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:48.720]   Big bucks.
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.000]   What are you talking about?
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.120]   I'm barely straining about 500 grand a year
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:53.040]   to do that show.
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:54.560]   Really?
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:55.320]   Wow.
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:56.840]   No, not really.
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:58.080]   I'll take it.
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:53:59.560]   I'm going to go call Canada right now.
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:03.320]   Oh, it's $500 in Canadian.
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:04.880]   But we are going to open the Twitch store
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:08.680]   and look for that on thisweekintech.com while you're there.
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:10.600]   Your donations, of course, are much appreciated.
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:11.680]   We really do thank you.
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:15.960]   Just $2 a month is all we ask, less than the price of a latte.
[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:19.600]   We do thank, of course, Ashley Twitt for our closing theme.
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:22.080]   Mark Blasko for our opening theme, Dorothy Yamamoto
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:23.080]   for the little Twitt guy.
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:26.160]   By the way, I know Alex is working on animating the little
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:26.640]   Twitt guy.
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:30.400]   He's coming to life in some amazing ways.
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.680]   We're going to have Twitt sightings.
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:34.320]   Twitt sightings all over the world.
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:38.580]   And of course, to America Online's radio network, AOL
[00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:40.240]   Radio at AOLMusic.com.
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:41.800]   We're on the podcast channel.
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:44.800]   They've agreed to carry Amber's new podcast as well.
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:49.000]   So we can listen for it there at AOLMusic.com.
