[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.960]   Hello there.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.480]   How are you?
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.840]   Good to see you.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.480]   You're going to like this show because I have some really
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.840]   good people for you.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.160]   We've gathered together starting with Jason Snell,
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.920]   who drove up the road apiece and is joining us.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.560]   Howdy.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.840]   Good to see you from the incomparable and six colors.com.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.320]   Yes, sir.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.640]   The incomparable of podcast, six colors, is really good website.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.080]   Thank you.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.400]   Covering-- well, it implies Macintosh.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.560]   Yeah, that's mostly-- I mean, that's
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.320]   where I've been covering Apple for 20 years.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.040]   So it's that and other stuff too.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.720]   Yeah, but there's other stuff.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.800]   Also with this, great to have him from--
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.160]   I think it's his first time on TWIT--
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.200]   recode.net.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.720]   It's Kurt Wagner.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.800]   Kurt, great to see you.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.640]   Hey, hey.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.360]   This is my first time, first time.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.560]   And the timing is good because the newly recasted
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.440]   recode website has been launched.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.120]   The slash is gone, baby.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.640]   Long live the slash.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.520]   I think we just pushed that live, actually,
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.240]   like around noon Pacific today.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.520]   So I mean, we're talking hours old.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.160]   You surprised us.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.800]   I like it.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.240]   I like it.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.400]   Kurt kind of teased it out a little last week.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.960]   But you know, you like to mix it up, keep things fresh.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.720]   Did you go to recode with Kara from the journal?
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.760]   You were at the journal, right?
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.160]   I was at Mashable.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.160]   Mashable?
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.680]   All right.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.120]   Six months after recode became recode from all things
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.840]   digital, of course.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.560]   So I've been there almost two years now.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.200]   Wow.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.720]   Has it been that long?
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.760]   Yeah, two and a half years.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.960]   It must be because it's almost a year now since Vox
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.240]   bought you guys.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.680]   I know.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.360]   That's hard to believe.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.680]   We're getting ready for-- we have our big code conference
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.800]   at the end of May, early June.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.440]   And I was just thinking about that myself over the weekend,
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.240]   how it's hard to believe that was a whole year ago,
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.960]   that we found out we were joining the Vox family.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.440]   Time.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.120]   Been a good year, though.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.800]   Time flies.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.920]   Eyes, man.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.920]   I was just trying to think what we should talk about this week.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.000]   There's a lot of kind of more philosophical stories.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.400]   I don't know.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.120]   Do you-- what do you--
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.640]   Wait a minute.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.520]   I didn't introduce somebody beautiful.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.680]   Luria Petrucci's here.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.280]   Oh my god.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.920]   Luria, it's good to see you.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.040]   Did he just flash me up on screen to get your attention?
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.600]   I completely forgot.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.960]   No, it's great to see you because you're doing a new thing.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.440]   I'll just go away.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.960]   I'll just go away.
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:16.960]   No.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.120]   You may remember Luria as a Callie Lewis.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.440]   And I'm getting that out of the way
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.560]   because I will probably call her Callie at some point or other.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.480]   And you'll all be baffled.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.680]   But Luria, of course, is wonderful.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.800]   She's now up in the Pacific Northwest doing a new venture.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.840]   It kind of looks kind of interesting.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.840]   It's a beautiful studio.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.920]   GeeksUniversity.com.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:37.440]   Yeah.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.480]   So I do all my tech stuff at geekslife.com.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.520]   You're still doing geeks life.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.040]   OK.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.120]   And lifestyle, right?
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.200]   But we're also teaching businesses how to--
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.120]   entrepreneurs, small business owners--
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.440]   how to use live streaming and online video for their businesses
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.840]   because I've been doing it for so long.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.960]   And I've learned so much over the years.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.240]   And so we actually are doing two daily live streams on Facebook.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.960]   I think we're the first people to do a daily live show on Facebook.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.640]   And so we're doing the Geeks Life Daily show
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.040]   there at facebook.com/geekslifenet.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.160]   And then we're also doing a business show over there
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.960]   at slash Geeks University.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.000]   And so yeah, so Geeks Life and Geeks University,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.640]   we have a ton going on over here.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.800]   But I love to help other people learn how to do kind of what
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.880]   we do for a living.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.520]   I'm really intrigued by this Facebook Live thing.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.880]   I think we're going to talk a lot about video today.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.680]   Facebook launched-- again, I don't
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.600]   know if this is only on my app.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.400]   So you guys can confirm this.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.720]   My app has changed a lot.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.080]   This is the Facebook app.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.880]   And this is-- you'll like this, Luria.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.880]   Now, in addition to news feed and people,
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.440]   there's a new video button that if I touch that,
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.000]   it shows video.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.520]   Facebook is all in.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.240]   Well, look at that.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.680]   You're right there.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.760]   I was doing one earlier this morning.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.360]   How about that?
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.320]   Facebook is all in on video to the point
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.920]   where they're surfacing it as an equal to the news feed.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.240]   Well, Mark Zuckerberg came out recently and said,
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.560]   I mean, at the FA Conference, he was talking about how
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.880]   important live video is to them.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.560]   And they are freaking killing it in the live streaming space.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.240]   Leo, you've been doing live streaming for years.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.760]   You do it kind of on a more--
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.080]   I'm going to buy a full page ad in the New York Times
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.360]   that says, welcome Facebook, seriously.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.520]   But with mobile live streaming, I mean,
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.720]   they're really doing a whole lot in that space.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.400]   And so we wanted to make sure that we were kind of in that
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.840]   and killing it in that space as well.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.800]   So we actually-- we figured out how
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.840]   to use a live stream HD 550 Studio Box--
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.920]   So that's my question.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.960]   Because I know how to do this because it has a go live button
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.480]   right here.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.120]   And I can just go live from my phone.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.560]   And that's actually interesting because that's also
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.200]   been around in this.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.960]   But it was a little harder to find.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.280]   If you wanted to post to Facebook,
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.520]   you'd have to tap what's on your mind and then scroll down.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.640]   And then you'd see the go live.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.280]   In fact, for a while, I didn't even
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.200]   think this was in the Facebook for Android version.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.800]   But now they've--
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.760]   That just was released like two days ago.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.480]   But now-- and they've really because of this video button.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.040]   And so everybody has this video button now.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.760]   You have it, Jason?
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.040]   No.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.640]   No.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.840]   Not on iOS yet.
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.160]   They're rolling it out, I believe.
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.880]   I think they announced it a few weeks ago, right?
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:25.880]   Right.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.480]   Before F8.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:27.920]   And then--
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.720]   Probably slow rollout.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.720]   Tell me, Kirk, if you have this, because on the bottom
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.920]   of my Facebook, this is new too.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.400]   I have categories.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.320]   So I have news feed, but I also have world and US news.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.480]   Funny.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.880]   There's a whole bunch of subject matter.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.320]   And I can even turn it on or off with the Settings button.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.080]   I'm thinking I must be in some sort of beta test of this.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:49.800]   Sorry, it's so bright.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.720]   I should turn my screen brightness down.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.480]   I think you're getting this not necessarily something
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.040]   that's totally, totally new.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.640]   I know that people have written about that
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.120]   is a few months ago.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.000]   But at the same time, I don't have that.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.960]   A lot of people I've seen have not had it.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.320]   So I do think you're one of the lucky few.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.600]   They somehow picked you.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.680]   I don't know if I feel so lucky.
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.360]   But I've tested all of you.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.040]   It's interesting, though, because what it really tells me,
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.480]   both this scroll bar at the bottom and the new video
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.960]   category at the top is that Facebook
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.840]   wants to be a media company, not a social network.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.760]   Right, Kirk, is that fair to say?
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.160]   I think that they want to do a lot of stuff.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.400]   And if you were at FA, you could see that ultimately,
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.280]   the one thing I will give Facebook
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.400]   is that they really stay true to that mission, which
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.880]   is about connecting people.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.760]   And it sounds a little corny.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.120]   It sounds a little cliche.
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.760]   But everything that they do, right,
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.040]   I mean the fact that they're trying
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.120]   to set up Wi-Fi-enabled cities, they're
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.960]   going to test something in San Jose, California around that.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.960]   The fact that they're having internet beaming drones,
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.800]   it's all about getting people onto the internet
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.680]   and therefore connecting them with the different apps
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.560]   that they have.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.600]   I think the way that they keep you coming back
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.760]   is through the media and entertainment part of it, right?
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.680]   Because I'm only going to log on to Facebook
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:12.080]   if I'm exchanging a message or if I have a comment on something
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.080]   that I posted.
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.120]   But the reason I open the app every single day,
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.080]   even when I don't have those things happening,
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.040]   is because there's great videos and there's great stories
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.480]   and all these other things that I read.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.440]   So I don't know if they would describe themselves
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.760]   as a media company, but they've married media
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.480]   and communication in a way that hardly,
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.840]   I don't think anyone else is really done.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.440]   I think Snapchat's trying to do it, but that's about it.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.720]   And I'll add on to that, Kurt.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.120]   That's a very good point.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.720]   But because of their ad platform and how prominent that is
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.640]   and how much money they make off of it,
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.440]   that's a big deal for them.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.280]   They have to keep that attention coming back over and over
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.280]   and over in order to make sure that people continue
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.920]   to have effectiveness with those ads.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:04.080]   And of course, they're putting so much effort
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.360]   into people who use that.
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.480]   You almost can't necessarily be effective
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.720]   if you don't use it, which is kind of a negative.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.040]   But if you have high engagement, you can kind of get over that.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.800]   So I saw somebody in the chat room, I'm sorry, I missed your name
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:25.000]   a minute ago who said they're focusing on celebrities.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.840]   And they always start with celebrities.
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.920]   Then they always kind of roll it out to the masses.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.600]   Facebook Live is for everybody now.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.480]   And it's not just for less celebrities.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.440]   Well, they're paying.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.080]   They're paying.
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.160]   They're paying some celebrities.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.400]   And they're paying some media partners too.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.480]   So that's something that, as far as I know,
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.440]   Twitter and Periscope have never been willing to do.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.880]   And I think you're going to assume certain things.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.720]   OK, Facebook's now paying for this.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.320]   Eventually, they're going to want to pull that back.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.120]   And figure out another way, because you can't afford to pay
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.760]   people for content forever.
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.080]   But at the same time, you look at all the people who
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.440]   are broadcasting on Facebook Live in the last three months.
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.160]   I mean, it wasn't even a thing.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.080]   Basically, we didn't even talk about this at the turn of the year
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.360]   at January 1.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.760]   Now, every single publisher and every single media property
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.520]   around is going live on a regular basis.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.320]   So it's working.
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.160]   The problem is like, OK, now can they transition from, hey,
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.800]   we've been paying you all along to, we want you to do this
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.240]   because you want to do it, not because we're giving you money.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.560]   And so they're going to have to figure out a way to monetize it
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.320]   in a way that keeps that incentivized.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.880]   Facebook's not paying you, Kelly, right?
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.360]   This is a platform for you.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.360]   But I wonder, do you worry about going all in
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.720]   as you have on Facebook?
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.280]   Because it's not--
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:39.840]   So--
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.240]   I mean, it's--
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.720]   Yeah, that's about--
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.080]   You're a platform.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:43.920]   Right, exactly.
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:48.200]   You never want to go all in on somebody else's platform.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.360]   I mean, you're not--
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:49.760]   Well, it's risky.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.640]   It is risky.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.080]   I mean, you can if you have a strategy behind you
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.720]   to get people on to your own platform, right?
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.720]   And that's the way we use it.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.720]   So you're using it as a way to promote what you're doing
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.080]   elsewhere?
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.120]   Not fully.
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:05.960]   I mean, yes.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.720]   So we have that strategy in place.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:13.680]   And we always drive traffic to our own properties.
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.440]   So from a business perspective, you
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.400]   have to think about that kind of thing.
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.960]   From a content perspective, you don't get our content live
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.120]   unless you are their live on Facebook.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.880]   We do release that content later.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.320]   Well, it stays on Facebook, right?
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.040]   I mean, people can now see it.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.320]   If you're in my feed, I missed the first show.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.720]   But I can see it because it's in my feed.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.800]   Jason, would you--
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.600]   You're a content creator as much as anybody.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.680]   Would you consider creating a Facebook-specific show live
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.400]   on Facebook?
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.840]   I think you have to consider the power of Facebook
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.240]   and its ability to reach an audience.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.080]   But at the same time, I also think a lot of video producers
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:55.600]   are already dealing with a major platform that
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.400]   is taking up a lot of their oxygen, which is YouTube.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.800]   But it's different because YouTube--
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.200]   This is different.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.760]   You create a show, and then you put it on YouTube.
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.840]   YouTube is a distribution medium for you.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.480]   This is why I might disagree with you, Kurt.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.960]   I think Facebook does want to be a media company.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.600]   I understand that their business is broader than that.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.040]   But when you see them paying people,
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.160]   I think they want to incent people to--
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:24.960]   they want to be the place you go for information,
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.240]   for entertainment, for everything.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.080]   They want to be the platform for internet content
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:28.800]   for all their users.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:34.160]   And in fact, we know most people now get their news on Facebook.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.440]   So don't you think maybe there's some--
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.680]   Why?
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.160]   You said a couple of things that were provocative,
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:41.680]   I thought, Kurt.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.480]   One is that Facebook can't keep paying them.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.200]   Why not?
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.080]   I just don't think that it's sustainable.
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.120]   They got lots of money, don't they?
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.720]   Sure, I guess perhaps, sustainable is wrong.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.240]   You're right.
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.400]   I mean, they could continue to pay.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.720]   I don't think it's good business.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.920]   So I think what they're going to be inspired to do or driven
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.920]   to do is say, OK, now that you've gotten on the platform,
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.560]   you're comfortable with how this works.
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.000]   You've seen the audience that we can drive because we're
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:09.520]   Facebook.
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.200]   And we should talk about the algorithm, too,
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.040]   because that's a whole another thing that I think Facebook has.
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.040]   YouTube does some of that.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.920]   But I think this is Facebook's bread and butter, right?
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.440]   Is that they can basically show you what they want to show you.
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.960]   So let's set that aside for a second.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.760]   But you get these publishers comfortable going live on Facebook.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:30.000]   And then you say, all right, how can we both make money here
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.360]   so that we're not losing money on this content project, if you will?
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:36.680]   And so--
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:40.760]   I'm already said that they're going to start paying producers
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.440]   for that content.
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.800]   But it's not what they're doing now.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.640]   But I think--
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.880]   I mean, but revenue split for all users,
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.880]   as opposed to just paying celebrities.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.720]   You know what I mean?
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.800]   But revenue split's different.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.280]   So that's what YouTube does, right?
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.160]   We're going to put ads on it, and you get some of that money,
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.040]   and we'll get the rest of it.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.720]   And I think that's what Facebook will ultimately--
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:02.720]   That's what they want to do, too.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.240]   They haven't--
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.240]   That's OK.
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.600]   So that might be the distinction between a media company
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.880]   and a social media company.
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.200]   Because if you're CBS, you pay people
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:17.080]   to make content to put on CBS that you could put ads around.
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:21.000]   And CBS can't go to Louis C.K. and say, we'll do a revs
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:21.760]   share with you.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.320]   We'll put some ads on there, and we'll give you 5%.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.800]   That's not how it works.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.440]   Is that-- I mean, is it a media company if you do that?
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.760]   Is YouTube a media company?
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:31.520]   I don't know.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.320]   We may be splitting hairs a little bit, or at least
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.800]   identifying how confusing this whole thing is.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.280]   But I think the way this slight or subtle difference
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.240]   that I think about is traditionally,
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.600]   Facebook has preached that it's a platform.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.760]   It is not the one creating any of this.
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.760]   Yes, it may be, at this point, even paying CNN.
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.160]   But it is not coming out and saying,
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.960]   we're going to create a new show--
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.080]   They don't want to be Netflix.
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.840]   They don't want to create originals.
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.880]   I think they want to host as much great content as they can,
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.080]   because that's where they can sell advertising.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.960]   But I don't think that they want to be seen as--
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.280]   even though we all-- again, the algorithm,
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.320]   they choose what we see.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.000]   They don't want us to think that they choose what
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.480]   they-- we see.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.560]   They want us to think that everything in our newsfeed
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.400]   is there because it's tailored towards us.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.440]   And there's an almighty algorithm that picks this for us.
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.680]   But Facebook is in control of all that.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:28.560]   And it's very easy to forget that they have essentially a say
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.960]   in what succeeds and what fails on Facebook.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.320]   And right now, they want live video to succeed.
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.760]   And that's why it's doing so well.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.960]   Yeah, I mean, I go to Facebook, and it's Mother's Day, right?
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:43.800]   So the bulk of my feed is moms, people with their moms,
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:47.800]   pictures-- so it's very much still that social network.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.520]   It's an interesting idea, though.
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:53.520]   Does Facebook see that is not compelling?
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.040]   I mean, let's--
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.280]   Well, they had a drop in shareability.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.800]   Well, that's where people aren't sharing.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.800]   That's right.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.120]   So they saw a tremendous drop in in how many people
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.760]   are sharing content and sharing photos and stuff.
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.760]   And so they're putting all-- as far as I can tell,
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.280]   they're putting so much more effort
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:17.200]   into the 3D stuff and live video.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.800]   And they've said as much as well.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.360]   So this is a response to people not sharing.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.760]   Exactly.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.480]   No, Facebook wants to be indispensable, right?
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.800]   And they've built their business on--
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.640]   in large part, selling ads against everybody's personal
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.640]   comments and their connections to their family
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.520]   and things like that.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.360]   And it's like, where do you grow from there?
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.720]   And every news article-- and the instant articles
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.040]   system that they've got now, every video
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.480]   that you might want to see.
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.440]   If it's all inside Facebook, then if you're a Facebook user,
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.400]   why go anywhere else?
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.200]   And then they control every single thing
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:49.640]   that you see.
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.720]   That's great for Facebook.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.560]   OK, so here's a time now where Facebook would like to say,
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:54.800]   we're a media company.
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.800]   Facebook is getting a lot of heat right now
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.920]   for, in effect, sponsoring the Republican National
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:01.440]   Convention.
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.040]   And there are even petitions going on people saying,
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.720]   Google's doing it too, by the way.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.920]   And Facebook's response to this is not--
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:11.120]   no, we're not supporting Donald Trump.
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.320]   We are a media company covering the convention.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.960]   So now they want to be a media company, right?
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.320]   When it's convenient.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.160]   Yeah.
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.080]   When it's convenient, I think they
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.640]   want to be where the attention is.
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:30.600]   Because they make their money from advertising needs, eyeballs.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.360]   They need focus and attention from people.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.800]   And what better place than the Republican National
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.040]   Convention with Donald Trump front and center?
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:45.040]   They won't say that they're supporting any one particular
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:45.480]   candidate.
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.440]   That would be horrible for business for them.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.720]   But they're going to try to be everywhere.
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.200]   And this is a big place for them to be, for sure.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.960]   Yeah, and of course Zuckerberg at F8, the Developers Conference,
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.080]   took time from his keynote to, without naming Donald Trump,
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.440]   slam Donald Trump.
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.800]   So not so subtly.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.720]   Yeah, we want to build bridges, not walls,
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.720]   something like that.
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.720]   Right.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.720]   Little dig.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.720]   Right.
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.720]   Little dig.
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:23.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:28.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:32.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:33.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:46.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:48.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:57.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:03.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:04.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:18.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:23.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:32.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.720]   Yeah.

[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:46.720]   I'm just watching a periscope streams and you're right, it's really boring.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.720]   [laughter]
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:52.720]   They have a teleport button where you just get a random stream and
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:56.720]   but it just, it feels like there's something, there's so much potential.
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:00.720]   Everybody was so excited about this and Meerkat and they, Meerkat's gone,
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:04.720]   they've pivoted. I'm looking at a fence. Oh, wow,
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.720]   it looks like a tornado or storms coming.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.720]   -Live fence though. -It's a live fence.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.720]   -Live fence. -Live fence.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.720]   -Live fence. -The fence is happening right now.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.720]   -Yeah. -Don't mock the pool. -You're looking live at a fence.
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:20.720]   -Does it feel better now? -It feels like a network television, actually.
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:24.720]   I'm standing out here in a field for no apparent reason.
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:28.720]   -Again, nothing happening right now. -Nothing happening. There was a tornado here some time ago.
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:32.720]   -Fence is still standing. -And there will be one again soon.
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:36.720]   -And there will be another one. Any moment. You know what I will always tune in
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:40.720]   to watch live? SpaceX sticking the landing.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:44.720]   Oh man, that's two in a row.
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:48.720]   -And it looks like we-- -Look at that.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:52.720]   These are the, of course, the rockets that put the satellite
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:56.720]   in orbit or went to the ISS resupply.
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:00.720]   And this is the launch of the landing. -That's the landing.
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:04.720]   -That looks like a launch in reverse. -That's exactly.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:08.720]   They landed on that dron ship and that was a tough one. They gave it like a 50/50 chance of making it.
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:12.720]   -That's very impressive. -It's got three engines and boosting something
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:16.720]   in orbit and then having to slow down and return back to that. -What? They have young--
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:20.720]   Gen X, Gen Y hosts? -Oh yeah, they are really media savvy.
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:24.720]   Those are, I believe, all SpaceX employees, but they've got like, they've been media trained
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:28.720]   and they host their webcast. And then for the real nerds, they have a technical webcast
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:32.720]   that is just like rocket scientists wearing. That's more of your Apollo 13
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:36.720]   webcast. It's a lot of mission control and all that.
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:40.720]   Or you can watch the one with the genial hosts. -You know, when you see Elon
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:46.720]   and you realize it's possible to do everything right, to market it right, to do the science right, to the technology right,
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:50.720]   it's so impressive. And then you wonder what's going on with Twitter.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:56.720]   Like, is it just a really limited supply of brain cells out there?
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:01.720]   Is Elon so much better than everybody else? He just seems to be firing on every cylinder.
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:07.720]   Leo, you know this better than anybody. It's all media and how you control the mistakes that don't get seen.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:12.720]   Well, he knows that though, really. He really knows about, but it's more than that.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:17.720]   I mean, he's technically brilliant. What they're doing at Tesla and SpaceX and SolarCity
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:23.720]   is technically brilliant. It's marketed perfectly. The message is on point.
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:29.720]   And it's just very impressive when you see somebody who can stick it.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:35.720]   He's the Olympian of this. And you're right. He does not ignore the very important
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:39.720]   marketing end of it. Just getting the video out there.
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:43.720]   One thing to say, "Oh yeah, SpaceX landed another rocket at sea."
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.720]   Another thing to see that video.
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:52.720]   Well, NASA even, I hope they're paying attention to how, because NASA's tried some things with social media outreach.
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:58.720]   I've done a couple of NASA's socials. But the live stream production for SpaceX, I've been really impressed by.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:04.720]   They are putting on the whole production in a way that I think NASA relied on the networks to do that back when the networks covered them.
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:05.720]   Walter Cronkite did it.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:11.720]   But NASA's video feeds now are really dry. They definitely feel like video feeds from a large government bureaucracy.
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:22.720]   And then you see SpaceX and you're like, "Oh yeah, they get it. They get modern Internet video and why you want to be entertaining while you're showing off your launch of this."
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:26.720]   Because rocket launches are fun for the moments when the rocket is launching.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:33.720]   But SpaceX goes all out in terms of explaining what's going to happen and piping in the applause from the audience that they've invited to show launch.
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:34.720]   Yeah. What the live?
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.720]   I mean, it's showmanship on there too.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:38.720]   You know how this gets it?
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:44.720]   Donald Trump gets it. I think if you're going to get elected president going forward, you better get it.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:50.720]   You better get them how to use the media to your great effect. Trump didn't have to buy many ads or any ads.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:55.720]   Elon Musk calls. He wants an apology for comparing him to Donald Trump.
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:56.720]   Yeah, seriously.
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:05.720]   That's the key, isn't it? If you're going to succeed in the future, you need to know how to pull all of these strings.
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:06.720]   And in politics too.
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:12.720]   The live stream of the deep sea, the deepest point in the ocean from the submersible?
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.720]   No, that's cool.
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.720]   Yeah. So they went down in a submersible to the, what's that?
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:19.720]   The Marianas Trench.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:28.720]   And they live streamed the entire thing going down and seeing all of these crazy looking animals down there.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:33.720]   You know, things that you would never see kind of up towards the surface.
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.720]   So I thought that was pretty interesting as well.
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:37.720]   It could be Shina Ibu's.
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:41.720]   It could be hawks in their nests.
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.720]   It could be the Marianas Trench.
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:48.720]   This is the Ochianos Explorer 2016.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:53.720]   And it's not okay. It's not gripping.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:57.720]   It kind of was in the moment. Like we watched it around here.
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:01.720]   And I mean, it's you definitely kind of have to be a certain technique.
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:04.720]   It's like NASA TV though. It's space exploration, right?
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:10.720]   And they had good hosts too. I mean, there were certain moments where it was like, wait, what is going on over there?
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:11.720]   What is that?
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:14.720]   You know, that is kind of remarkable.
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:20.720]   I mean, it's a remarkable find.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:25.720]   Coral species that occurs as well as in Hawaiian islands, which is halfway across the Pacific.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:29.720]   They're really doing this like NASA though. It's really interesting.
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:32.720]   I mean, why not? It's the same kind of thing.
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:33.720]   Yeah.
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:39.720]   I mean, I just can't. I just don't know if I tune in guys. I'm sorry.
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:43.720]   Well, you know what? Okay. I admit it. I knew about it.
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:49.720]   I liked the idea a lot when you were describing it. I was actually like, oh, that's a perfect use case of live video.
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:54.720]   And then now that we're actually watching the footage, I'm a little disappointed.
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:58.720]   I'm a little disappointed. It's soothing. It's very soothing.
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:41:59.720]   It is soothing.
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:01.720]   It makes him tea.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:04.720]   There's ever watch a planet Earth or blue.
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:06.720]   Love that. VBC planet Earth. It's really.
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:10.720]   I'd be willing to wait for them to compile this into planet Earth.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:19.720]   Sure. You know what's sad? They made planet Earth in 1080p at the time that was like, this is as good as it needs to be.
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:25.720]   And now they have to reshoot. They're reshooting at all. They've caused a huge amount of money to make in the first place.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.720]   They're reshooting it all in 4K.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:30.720]   And you know what? By the time they finish that, it'll be 8K.
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:31.720]   Yeah.
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:33.720]   Yeah, they'll have to do it again.
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:43.720]   Yeah. Look at that. I think live also, Kurt makes a good point. Live is also a niche audience for something that then you dress up and reach a broader audience with.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:50.720]   And that's fine. That's one of the great things about having an internet video is you can have a live stream that appeals to 5,000 people.
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:54.720]   And then an edited version that appeals to 50,000 people.
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:43:00.720]   And then maybe there's a TV special that goes to 500,000 people. And that's all good.
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:06.720]   Totally. I think live has it's going to have its audience and it's going to have its uses.
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:13.720]   I just, again, to repeat, I just don't think it's going to be the thing that we all do.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:25.720]   Well, I mean, I think it has to play a part in, you know, if you're any kind of media, you know, company or doing any kind of, if you're doing YouTube videos, you should be doing live.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:43.720]   You know, you should be integrating that into what you do. You're never going to reach a massive audience without rebroadcasting that, just like you were saying, you know, but it's because of the, I mean, Leo, you've been doing live.
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.720]   I know everybody in the chat room.
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:52.720]   I feel like such a slacker though, compared to all of these people. I feel like I'm just lazy. I should really be doing a better job of, I don't know.
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:44:00.720]   I was like, what did I say earlier? They want to see you on Periscope. So, yeah, they've seen me on Periscope. It was embarrassing.
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:11.720]   But how long? I've used Facebook Live to, I really, I like Facebook Live, but the kind of stuff we do is really a little more, more like this, very honest trench than this.
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:15.720]   It's very relaxing.
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:21.720]   You can clip that up and put some really good, like, upbeat music to it and put that on.
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:23.720]   We do that. It's called a promo.
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:24.720]   Exactly.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:31.720]   Actually, you want to take a look? Look, this is what we, this is this little show and tell. If you missed anything this week on Twitter, here's what it looked like.
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:37.720]   Much more interesting than it actually was, by the way, but go ahead and watch the previously on Twitter.
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.720]   Alex could do the working.
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:41.720]   [Laughing]
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:44.720]   You do a whole podcast in Wookie.
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.720]   The new screensabers.
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:51.720]   Wait a minute. I'm having a flashback. I fought for a moment. That was Kate Mattello standing here.
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:53.720]   [Laughing]
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.720]   Oh my God, that's a long time ago.
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:56.720]   Oh, I know a lot.
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:58.720]   And we're so blurry back then.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:44:59.720]   Tech news today.
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:05.720]   Google has been feeding some interesting text to an AI engine to make it smarter.
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:12.720]   Now it's moved on to a project where it's fed over 2,800 romance novels to its AI engine.
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:14.720]   Well, that's a big, some more conversational.
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:15.720]   Yeah.
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:16.720]   That engine.
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.720]   Well, you did put it at the top of the article.
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:19.720]   [Laughing]
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:20.720]   This weekend law.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:24.720]   Mark has written perhaps the best legal brief ever. Much of it in Klingon.
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:29.720]   The fun thing is, it does shape the way you have to think about things.
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:35.720]   How do you say intellectual property law in Klingon when there is no word for intellectual?
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:36.720]   Twit.
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.720]   Twit with your head, not over it.
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:41.720]   We also have this weekend law translated into Klingon.
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:42.720]   Kostavi Struch.
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:43.720]   Oh!
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:44.720]   Oh, it's dead.
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:45.720]   [Laughing]
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:46.720]   That's the plot.
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:47.720]   You got the blood.
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.720]   Oh my God, I have to get on that program.
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:50.720]   That looks so awesome.
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:51.720]   Oh, it's a great show.
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.720]   It's all about law in Klingon.
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.720]   We have a great week coming up.
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.720]   Jason Howell has the week ahead.
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:45:59.720]   Thanks a lot, Leo.
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:04.720]   Here's a look at a few things we're going to be keeping an eye on in the week ahead.
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:09.720]   Oracle and Google are actually set to return to court on Monday, May 9th, in a retrial
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:15.720]   of Oracle's copyright suit, charging Google, use Java in Android without a license.
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:20.720]   We can expect to see Larry Ellison and Eric Schmidt to take the stand once again.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:24.720]   On Monday, May 9th also, TechCrunch disrupts New York kicks off.
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:29.720]   And one thing to look out for is the unveiling of the highly anticipated VIV AI assistance
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:33.720]   created by the ex-founding members of the Siri team.
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:37.720]   They claim VIV is what Siri was supposed to be before Apple bought the company
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.720]   and made the technology their own.
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:44.720]   A few earnings reports to follow with Electronic Arts and Nokia reporting on May 10th
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:46.720]   and NVIDIA reporting on May 12th.
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:47.720]   You know what?
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:48.720]   You know what?
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:50.720]   I'm guessing plenty more tech news will break all week long.
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:58.720]   So catch Mega Moroni and I on Tech News today at 4PM Pacific, 7PM Eastern 12PM UTC at Twit.tv/live.
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:46:59.720]   That's the look of the week ahead.
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:00.720]   Back to you, Leo.
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:01.720]   Thank you, Jason Howell.
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.720]   Everyone through Friday got to watch it.
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.720]   Actually, that Oracle Google Trials interesting.
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:09.720]   I interviewed James Gosling a couple of weeks ago, the creator of Java.
[00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:10.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:20.720]   And he said, "In Sun, we really thought that what was going on was what Google was doing
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:22.720]   with Android was slimy."
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:27.720]   He said, "No, the whole issue comes down to whether Google's implementation of Java,
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.720]   Dalvik, was a rip-off of Java.
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:35.720]   They tried to license Java, then declined after, I don't know, something went wrong,
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:38.720]   and wrote something that was identical.
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:41.720]   But he was of the opinion, wasn't exactly a clean room.
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:44.720]   He said, "If you look at the code, it's pretty obvious that they slimed us."
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:46.720]   Was the phrase Gosling.
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:50.720]   But Gosling said, "We were never willing to go to court over it.
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:55.720]   Jonathan Schwartz, the last CEO at Sun who oversee the sale at Oracle, wasn't
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:57.720]   willing to take on Google.
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:59.720]   But Larry Ellison sure is half-horse."
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:04.720]   Then the interesting thing, I thought this was, he said, but the lawyers, once they got
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:09.720]   to the case, decided that there wasn't really a case they could argue about stealing the
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:10.720]   code.
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:14.720]   So the cases ended up being something that Gosling thinks is a terrible precedent, which
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:16.720]   is copywriting in APIs.
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:18.720]   And he's dead set against that.
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:22.720]   So what Oracle is saying is that Google didn't copy the Java code.
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.720]   They copied the Java API.
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:28.720]   That's provable because that's how you make compatible code.
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:30.720]   You have to copy the API.
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:34.720]   So we're going to, as you may remember, this case ended and it's back again.
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:39.720]   And now Oracle wants $9 billion in damages from Google.
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:41.720]   What if they do the case and cling on?
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:43.720]   I think that would be more entertaining for all of us.
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:44.720]   Wow.
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:45.720]   Really?
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:48.720]   The first trial was a win for Google.
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:52.720]   The judge found that APIs are not eligible for copyright.
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:54.720]   But the Court of Appeals overturned it.
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:57.720]   And the Court of Appeals said APIs are creative works.
[00:48:57.720 --> 00:48:58.720]   APIs.
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.720]   This is the, this is not the code.
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:06.720]   This is the description of what the code should be looking for, what you should say to
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:10.720]   the code so that you can talk to the code that that also is creative.
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:11.720]   That's unfortunate.
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:14.720]   This is the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:17.720]   Google petitioned the Supreme Court.
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:23.720]   Google got support from Yahoo, HP, Red Hat, open source advocates.
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:30.720]   Microsoft, EMC, and NetApp told, on the other side said, you should let the Federal Circuit
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:31.720]   ruling stand.
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:33.720]   The Supreme Court did.
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:37.720]   They rebuffed the appeal.
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:44.720]   And now it's back to the jury because even though the Court said that the APIs are copyrighted,
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:52.720]   it didn't say which or how the use of the 37 APIs in question was fair use.
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:55.720]   So imagine this.
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:59.720]   We just found 12 people off the street and we're going to ask them.
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:04.720]   Well, isn't that the problem with a lot of the law involving technology today is, is it's not
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:06.720]   necessarily even that you can't prove something.
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:11.720]   It's that can you get a jury and quite honestly, can you get attorneys and judges and juries
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:16.720]   to understand some of these incredibly technical and esoteric things.
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:18.720]   It's really a tough job to do that.
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:21.720]   And then invested in everything that they're judging.
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:25.720]   They're also judging these companies that this is Oracle run by Larry Ellison.
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:30.720]   And it's this huge Google and how you keep that out of your mind if you're a juror
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:33.720]   while also understanding all the technical details.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:34.720]   I don't know.
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:39.720]   And this is why there's weird law when it comes to cutting edge tech stuff is that you
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:42.720]   don't have to be able to do strange rulings by people who often don't understand
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:43.720]   everything about what's going on.
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:48.720]   Joe Mullen who's writing about this in ours technique has said a big Oracle win
[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:55.720]   could be an extinction level event for small companies who can't fight these court cases.
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:51:00.720]   It's another battering ram for people who are trying to create compatible software
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:08.720]   where the company that made the baseline, the platform is not willing to work with them.
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:15.720]   This by copywriting API is you could mash out a whole sector of people who are trying to make compatible.
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:22.720]   We wouldn't have a PC industry if Phoenix and Compaq and others hadn't been able to
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:27.720]   duplicate the functionality of IBM's BIOS without actually duplicating the code.
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:28.720]   They were able to.
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.720]   They made the PC compatible industry.
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:34.720]   And thanks to that we have a personal computer industry otherwise it would be IBM
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:35.720]   dominating this still.
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:41.720]   With the APIs we're basically saying can you copyright the compatibility with our thing?
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:46.720]   I get why Gosling would say that that's the problem is he feels like Google did do a slimy thing.
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:48.720]   This is the wrong way to do it.
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:50.720]   This is the outcome no one wants.
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:53.720]   This is the lawyers talking.
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:56.720]   This is what they felt would be a case that was winnable.
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:57.720]   You know what?
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:59.720]   I guess they weren't far wrong.
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:02.720]   They're doing okay so far.
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:07.720]   Brazil speaking of court.
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:27.720]   In Brazil of course this was earlier in the week and it's what's app was shut down by a single judge in Brazil who said the judge was mad that what's app was encrypted and that Facebook wasn't helping and decided to shut down what's app for 72 hours.
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:29.720]   It's not the first time it's happened.
[00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:33.720]   The last time it happened to hire court overruled the judge.
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:34.720]   Same thing happened.
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:40.720]   Marcel Maya Montavo of a small town in the state of Cerahepe.
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:51.720]   Two months ago he put Facebook's vice president for Latin America in jail for failure to cooperate with the subpoena issued as part of a criminal investigation.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:53.720]   They want the content of what's app.
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:58.720]   And of course after that, it wasn't very much longer after that, that what's app announced.
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:00.720]   You know we're going to encrypt everything.
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:01.720]   It's just all encrypted.
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:03.720]   We can't see it anymore.
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:06.720]   That hasn't held back the Brazilian courts.
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:11.720]   They shut it down for 12 hours and then again the higher court came in and said you know what?
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:13.720]   There's 100 million people.
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:16.720]   93% of all adults in Brazil use what's app.
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:18.720]   I think you're turning it back on.
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:20.720]   That's the power.
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:28.720]   The guy that was arrested, the big issue, I mean multiple issues with just arresting the executive on his way to work.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:33.720]   But I was told at the time, I mean he was a Facebook executive, not a WhatsApp executive.
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:40.720]   I know that WhatsApp is owned by Facebook but like not even involved in the product or business in any way.
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:45.720]   So you can imagine that ruffled some feathers on the Facebook side of things.
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:46.720]   Yeah.
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:47.720]   Not happy about it.
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:53.720]   The judge said the arrest was justified by Facebook's repeatedly failing to comply with judicial orders.
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:56.720]   But it wasn't Facebook as you say it was WhatsApp.
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:57.720]   Yeah.
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:59.720]   I mean it's owned of course right.
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:07.720]   And I think these issues are certainly concerning for Facebook as they move.
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:12.720]   I mean they spent a lot of money on WhatsApp right 19 billion I believe.
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:15.720]   Yeah it's not going to just be Facebook or WhatsApp.
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:19.720]   That's the good news if they're going to court they're going to court with a lot of other companies and people.
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:20.720]   Totally.
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:25.720]   Yeah it's the trend towards total privacy, total encryption.
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:36.720]   And you write shortly before this incident but after the last one was when they formally announced they had rolled out end to end encryption for all of their WhatsApp users.
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:39.720]   But I mean they've been close to that for some time now.
[00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:44.720]   So most of it especially now, all the messages you're sending on WhatsApp they exist on your phone.
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:46.720]   And the person's phone you sent them to.
[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:53.720]   And that is really angering these governments that they want more control and they want to be able to see what people are talking about.
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:55:01.720]   Anger's me that the governments are having a problem with the fact that I want to say what I want to say and nobody else should be able to read it.
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:02.720]   I mean come on.
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:05.720]   It's happening here in the US but that's the point it's happening all over the world.
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:07.720]   It's happening to everybody.
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:16.720]   In fact this Feinstein Burr bill which of course is the Senate attempt to it's very sneaky because it doesn't say ban encryption.
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:18.720]   It doesn't say even provide a backdoor.
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:27.720]   It just says any company served with a judicial order a legitimate judicial order must provide the information the court order is asking for.
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:36.720]   But of course the implication is as geeks as we understand it is well that means you can't either have to have a backdoor you can't have encryption because WhatsApp can't provide that information.
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:48.720]   And they would be liable under Feinstein Burr and now Julian Sanchez writing for the Cato Institute says that would actually ban your browser because your browser is SSL built into it.
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:57.720]   You can't go to Google and say hey what was Jason Snell looking at last night because it's an SSL so what's his banking information.
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:58.720]   You can't.
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:15.720]   So this bill which as far as I know is still flying high would literally make HTTPS TLS security illegal because no company could then provide that information to a court order.
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:26.720]   We're in a very risky spot right now I feel like you know I mean I'm sure you guys have talked about it quite a bit over the course of last.
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:29.720]   I like bringing it up again and again.
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:31.720]   Because it's not going away.
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:44.720]   And it's partly our fault as consumers and as geeks right like because we get so excited by all these new technologies that can do this and can do that and we can you know do cool new things.
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:53.720]   And we give away our privacy without even thinking about it in favor of a cool new technology you know and I mean I do it too.
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:59.720]   But it's something that I think starts with us as consumers and geeks.
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:13.720]   Yes but are you going to want to stand up and say and by the way law enforcement shouldn't have any tools to fight crime to fight terrorism should they should they be unable to wire tap.
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:16.720]   Should they be unable to be communication.
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:27.720]   Well if you really look at it I mean what they're using all these tools for is not what they claim you know I mean that's a whole other discussion.
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:35.720]   But I mean it's not being used really to protect us like they want us to think it is.
[00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:40.720]   So you know I mean it's it is a complicated subject for sure.
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:53.720]   I'm curious what you guys think whose responsibility is it right I mean does Facebook or WhatsApp in this case have a responsibility for how their platform is used or who else.
[00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:55.720]   Right who else is responsible.
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:56.720]   I don't know.
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:58:03.720]   And isn't it provocative for WhatsApp to just put encryption in all of a sudden and say Nina Nina Nina.
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:06.720]   I mean they so.
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:08.720]   I'm sure they're not saying Nina Nina Nina.
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:09.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:10.720]   They might be thinking it.
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.720]   Fantastic if they actually were.
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:13.720]   Can't encrypt it.
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:14.720]   Right.
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:30.720]   I think that they I think the timing was certainly probably not ideal for folks who think that they're doing this just to to stoke the fire but again they had been working on this for some time.
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:38.720]   So it's not as if the Brazil the initial Brazil ban happened and they said okay we're going to get back at them by end to end encrypting everything on the app.
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:43.720]   You know that was already in the works so the timing probably looks worse than it really is.
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:53.720]   My guess is you know the whole reason they they ran into this issue before was that they were halfway done or more encrypting everything and that's why they weren't able to hand over messages to begin with right.
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:59:05.720]   So I think the encryption happened before the incident and then the encryption got completed and it was just it looks a little bit more menacing or malicious.
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:13.720]   Forget that one of the candidates for the president of the United States at least one of the candidates said quote to think that Apple won't allow us to get into that cell phone.
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:15.720]   Who do they think they are.
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:18.720]   We need to take back the internet from terrorists.
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:19.720]   That's Donald Trump.
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:25.720]   Actually I think if you before you vote for somebody in any election you might want to ask what's your position on encryption.
[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:28.720]   I should find out what the Clinton's position is on.
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:35.720]   I want my Facebook and my WhatsApp and my whatever services I use to encrypt my stuff.
[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:40.720]   You know I mean and I don't even do anything bad but at the same time like there was.
[00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:48.720]   Have you guys ever watched that I think it was a documentary of terms and conditions something it has terms and conditions in it.
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:50.720]   It's like oh yeah yeah.
[00:59:50.720 --> 01:00:05.720]   And in the like some some guy some journalist no a writer for a TV show actually gets arrested or something because he looked up how to murder your wife.
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:06.720]   Right.
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:15.720]   Because he was writing a drama series about where that happened in an episode right so I mean all that stuff can be taken out of context and bad things can happen.
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:18.720]   Like so I personally want my stuff encrypted.
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:28.720]   I don't know if privacy is the right angle or it's one angle but the other angle of course is security and the problem is if you know this is what protects us from hackers as well not just from the government.
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:31.720]   This is what protects us from bad guys.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:32.720]   These are security features.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.720]   Yeah.
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:37.720]   Let's also forget forget this is math and you can't outlaw math and the bad guys.
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:38.720]   You can try.
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:40.720]   You can try but the bad guys are going to use math.
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:44.720]   Professor was kicked it was almost kicked off an American Airlines flight for doing math.
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:48.720]   For doing math yeah we've got to stop this epidemic of math on airplanes.
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:49.720]   Wait what is this?
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.720]   Okay he's a professor of economics at University of Pennsylvania.
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:55.720]   He's Italian but he does have a beard so he could be in a rab I don't know.
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:01:02.720]   And he was writing math equations on a piece of paper while waiting for his American Airlines flight to take off.
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:09.720]   A passenger sitting next to him looked over there said those look like that looks like Arabic.
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:16.720]   Got up told the flight attendant the plane was delayed on the tarmac for 30 minutes.
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:28.720]   The economist was removed from the aircraft and questioned by airport security and the woman who turned him in never got back on the plane.
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:31.720]   He was able allowed to get back on the plane the plane did take off.
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:37.720]   It sounds like the airline people were pretty embarrassed about this because they realized that he was a professor and it was math.
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:38.720]   Yeah they could see it.
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:45.720]   I think the report I read said she faked being sick because she was worried about him and she apparently just walked away.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:50.720]   Yeah after reviewing the situation a spokesman for American Airlines said the captain determined the flight should continue.
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.720]   We apologize to our customers.
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:57.720]   They never did find the woman who turned him in.
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:58.720]   He's a nice looking fellow.
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:00.720]   He's a Italian.
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.720]   That's practically a terrorist.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:07.720]   I think I don't know if I'm currently hearing all of the people doing math.
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:09.720]   It's got a beard doing math.
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:10.720]   You know where math comes from?
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.720]   Hang on I'm a habitalian.
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:13.720]   Okay I know I am too.
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:15.720]   I'm a quarter battalion.
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:18.720]   Math was largely invented in the Arab world.
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:20.720]   That's right it's called Al-Jebra for a reason.
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:24.720]   Let's take a break.
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:25.720]   Where we live in.
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:27.720]   It is the world we live in.
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:30.720]   That's sad to say.
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:36.720]   By the way great panel great to have you Kurt Wagner is here from recode.net newly recast looking great looking sharp.
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:37.720]   Thank you thank you.
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.720]   Go look at recode.net.
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:44.720]   You've shown a few of our stories on the broadcast so far.
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.720]   I still get used to it.
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:48.720]   You show and I'm like hey that looks pretty sharp.
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:53.720]   That's my story but I know it doesn't look like what I thought it used to look like what I saw before.
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:57.720]   No I recode is absolutely go to every single day for me I read it religiously.
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:58.720]   Thank you.
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:02:59.720]   As I do six colors.com.
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:00.720]   Thank you sir.
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:01.720]   It's wonderful.
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:02.720]   Mac focused.
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.720]   I don't want to call it a blog.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:05.720]   That sounds demeaning.
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:06.720]   It's my website.
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:07.720]   It's an independent site.
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:09.720]   It's a bit of a publication.
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:10.720]   Yeah sure.
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:11.720]   On the internet.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:12.720]   Sounds good.
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:19.720]   And Luria Petrucci you may remember as Callie Lewis for so long at Geeks Life and now GeeksUniversity.com.
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:22.720]   Great to have you as well and yes she does math and I'm going to do it.
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:26.720]   She does math and she's Italian so watch out.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.720]   I'm just going to put it out there.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.720]   I just use my phones calculator.
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.720]   I don't write down math.
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:40.720]   Are sure they brought to you by the place I blog Squarespace and I might have a blog.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.720]   Although it could be a publication actually.
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:47.320]   Squarespace has recently unveiled some beautiful magazine style templates for people who want
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:48.720]   to do publications.
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:51.720]   Grid style landing pages will allow you to see all the posts in one place.
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:55.720]   It's got that infinite scroll now that everybody's doing where you just keep going.
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:57.720]   It's not paged.
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:01.720]   You've got related posts at the bottom encouraging visitors to explore more.
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:03.720]   There's author profiles.
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:04.720]   Search field right in the header.
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:05.720]   It is perfect.
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:06.720]   If you want to create a publication.
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:09.720]   But you know Squarespace is perfect no matter what you want to do on the web.

[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:13.720]   If you're a business.
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:15.720]   We just, you know, our new business Artisanal.
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:18.720]   We just created our Squarespace site.
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:19.720]   I, my blog.
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:20.720]   Leo Laport.com.
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:21.720]   That's on Squarespace.
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:23.220]   I started with a cover page.
[01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:27.720]   I love the cover page feature because you could put your images there and it's full bleed.
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:30.720]   You know, the template I use it goes all the way to the edge.
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:31.720]   So it really is great.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:34.720]   And then I put my blog there and the blogging tools are fantastic.
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:38.720]   Actually this last post I just put up I emailed to Squarespace.
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.720]   It made it so easy.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:41.720]   I just blog by emailing.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:42.720]   I love that.
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:44.720]   Squarespace is also great if you want to sell.
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.720]   They've got fantastic e-commerce.
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:53.720]   It's one of the few places where your store really looks a part of, as a part, a piece
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:54.720]   of your website.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:56.720]   It's the same design and everything.
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.720]   It's not just some thing hanging off your website.
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:02.720]   Now members who have built or contribute to three or more active Squarespace websites
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:03.720]   have access to something new.
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:05.720]   It's called Squarespace Circle.
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:10.720]   Circle membership includes advanced guides, optimized support, six month trial periods for
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:11.720]   new projects.
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:12.720]   Wow, six months.
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:13.720]   And a lot more.
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:17.720]   They want to really thank the people who use Squarespace a lot.
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:21.720]   And you'll also appreciate that they're now a domain registrar.
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:25.720]   If you are wanting to make a website, you know, some of these domain registrars they put
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:28.720]   the, you know, the holding page and it's the worst.
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:29.720]   It's embarrassing.
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:35.720]   You'll get a Squarespace page when you get your domain name from Squarespace domains,
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:38.720]   a clean, spam-free parking page.
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:40.720]   So you don't have to start building right away.
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.720]   It's just awesome.
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:49.720]   Squarespace domains, more than 200 top-level domain names, domain designations are available
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:50.720]   there.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.720]   It's a really nice registrar and it looks as good as Squarespace.
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:53.720]   Squarespace is the best.
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:06:00.720]   For hosting, for software now for domain registration, squarespace.com.
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:06.720]   Make sure you use the offer code to get 10% off and show your support for this week in
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:07.720]   tech.
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:09.720]   We're all in on the Squarespace.
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:13.720]   All right, Callie, you're from Texas or were.
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:14.720]   Luria.
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:15.720]   Luria.
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:16.720]   Callie.
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:17.720]   It's a guy.
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:18.720]   Callie's from Texas.
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:19.720]   Luria's from Portland.
[01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:20.720]   I understand.
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:21.720]   Right, right.
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:22.720]   Yeah.
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:23.720]   And they're both from Italy.
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:24.720]   Go figure that.
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:26.720]   Oh, Uber and Lyft.
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:27.720]   Support.
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:29.720]   This is so confusing to me.
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:34.720]   Supported Proposition 1 put $8 million into campaigning it.
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:37.720]   Proposition 1 lost by a wide margin.
[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:44.720]   Proposition 1 was to eliminate regulations the city wanted to impose on Uber and Lyft.
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:46.800]   Fingerprint registration.
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:47.800]   Things like that.
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:49.720]   I think regulations that aren't a bad idea.
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:54.720]   10,000 drivers are going to lose their job now because they lost and Uber and Lyft said,
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:55.720]   "Bye-bye, Austin."
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:56.720]   Wow.
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:57.720]   "Bye-bye, Austin.
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:06:59.720]   You don't want us.
[01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:03.720]   They have vowed to stop operating in Austin on Monday morning."
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:08.720]   And Uber says that'll put about 10,000 drivers for both companies out of work.
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:12.720]   They didn't get their way on Proposition 1.
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:20.720]   And Uber was using all those cool, like, they were doing the pedal stuff as well, I believe.
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:21.720]   Oh, that's right.
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:22.720]   Remember that?
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:23.720]   That's right.
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:24.720]   I took a petty cab at South By.
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:25.720]   And Uber, petty cab.
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:29.720]   I don't know if that's like, was that just for a South Byer?
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:36.120]   I think we were doing it like long term for just not just South By.
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:39.640]   I don't make me, maybe I'm wrong.
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:44.000]   I guess this leaves just open for a new company to come into town.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:50.560]   I mean, Austin's not a bad place to kind of start to chink away at Uber and Lyft if they're
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:51.560]   going to leave.
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:56.720]   I kind of wonder why they're against civic regulation.
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:08:01.720]   Were they onerous regulations?
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:08.200]   I mean, I understand it's complicated because a lot of times a city will have incumbent,
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:14.120]   cab companies that lobby hard against Uber and Lyft coming in.
[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:18.280]   And so maybe the Austin City Council wanted to do something that would be hard on Uber
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:20.000]   and Lyft.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.240]   So I should ask for more details on this.
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:27.120]   But it does seem like Uber and Lyft came in with 8 million bucks and said, "No, no,
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:28.680]   no, you don't want that."
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:32.400]   They circulated petitions, 60,000 signatures.
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:34.560]   Can you imagine?
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:41.840]   I always am shocked when I think about the regulatory red tape that Uber, Lyft, Airbnb.
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:47.400]   I mean, they're dealing with this stuff in like every city in the world.
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:52.960]   And I can't even imagine working on one of those legal teams at one of those companies.
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:56.680]   Like how you keep it straight and how you keep your energy up.
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.960]   I mean, they must be dealing with lawsuits and...
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:08:59.960]   Constantly.
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:00.960]   Yeah.
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:01.960]   Every day.
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:02.960]   We're a lot of money.
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:03.960]   So here's what happened.
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:08.880]   The Austin City Council in December passed 9 to 2, an ordinance aimed at regulating Uber
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:11.960]   and Lyft more like traditional taxi companies.
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:16.920]   Five hours of debate, the council voted to require drivers for vehicle to hire apps like
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:21.520]   Uber and Lyft to pass fingerprint-based background checks.
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:24.920]   Uber and Lyft at the time said, "We're going to leave if you do that."
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:25.920]   The ordinance began...
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:29.760]   It started in February 1st, but it was a 12-month phase in.
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:34.200]   So there was time and Uber and Lyft decided we're going to see if we can get the community
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.200]   up in arms against this.
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:36.200]   We want to self-regulate.
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:37.200]   Yeah.
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.200]   Sure they do.
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:44.160]   Doesn't this sound a little bit like a professional sports team threatening to move?
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:45.160]   Yeah.
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:46.160]   You can build them a new stadium.
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:47.160]   Yeah.
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:49.360]   It's like just they're just holding the city hostage because they figure they've got them
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:51.880]   over a barrel.
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:55.880]   They're going to relent because everybody's going to be grumpy about this high profile
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:56.880]   thing.
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:57.880]   But I agree with Luria.
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:02.640]   I think this is an opportunity for competitors maybe.
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:05.720]   Or if Austin is that attractive, then they'll be back.
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:06.720]   Uber said it's...
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:07.720]   I don't know that...
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:12.760]   I mean, I think if I'm understanding it correctly and I haven't researched the story
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:19.320]   at all, but if Uber is saying no because their drivers don't want to be fingerprinted,
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:24.240]   then competition would have the same problem then, right?
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:26.080]   Well, yeah.
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:31.320]   So when I'm not clear and I'm trying to understand it is if taxi companies have the same requirements,
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:36.840]   in other words, if taxi drivers have the same fingerprint requirements, I think they
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:37.840]   do.
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:43.720]   I think this just makes Uber and Lyft the same kind of regulations.
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:48.720]   Uber said we won't be able to get drivers.
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:50.960]   This makes the question of why.
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:55.880]   They won't be able to get drivers if they're required to get fingerprints.
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:59.320]   We won't be able to sign up drivers.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:04.880]   And Lyft said, "We do not operate in any market that requires the drivers to be fingerprinted."
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:06.520]   I want my...
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:10.760]   The chat room is talking about Uber wanting to be different, but I want Uber to be different.
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:12.920]   I don't enjoy taxi car rides.
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:13.920]   I enjoy Uber rides.
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:17.880]   Well, taxi drivers now are seeing this now in the chat room and I think it's probably
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:18.880]   accurate.
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:22.400]   Somebody says in Austin, you do have to be fingerprinted and background checked to be
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:23.720]   a taxi driver.
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:26.560]   Why should Uber and Lyft be any different?
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:36.800]   I mean, where did the original law come from for taxi car drivers that they had to do
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:37.800]   that?
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:44.280]   According to Austin police, Chief Art Acevedo, a lot of sexual assaults happened in the city
[01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:45.600]   of Austin.
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:48.120]   Which Uber has had to deal with and that's why...
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:49.120]   What is it?
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:51.960]   Chariot for women is starting to come out.
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:54.840]   Yeah, but then they're going to get sued at it existence instantly because they don't
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:55.840]   pick up men.
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:58.840]   They have female drivers and female riders.
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:01.360]   And of course, that's some say discrimination.
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:03.280]   I think it's a great idea, frankly.
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:04.280]   I would encourage...
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:07.320]   If there were a Chariot around here, I would encourage my daughter to use it.
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:10.240]   I don't think most drivers are harmless.
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:15.640]   I'm not saying that something about being a driver attracts a bad class of people.
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:21.080]   I mean, Jason Lorry, you guys mentioned competitor jumping.
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:25.680]   I mean, do you really think at this point there's going to be anyone besides Uber and
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:28.000]   Lyft getting into this space?
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.640]   And I realize that's...
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:35.000]   I'm probably going into a horrible trap right now by saying no one could ever go against
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   Uber and Lyft.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.760]   The amount of money they've spent, the progress they've made, we've already talked about all
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:42.920]   the legal hurdles that they're constantly going through.
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:45.880]   I just can't imagine anyone else would want to get into this.
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:49.160]   I know in New York there are many competing companies.
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:50.160]   Right.
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:51.160]   Yeah.
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:55.600]   And even the taxi companies in New York now have apps and there are multiple apps.
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:57.120]   I mean, it's gotten...
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:02.400]   I mean, clearly people look at Uber as a very successful unicorn and say, "Boy, I'd like
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.680]   to get some of those billions in my pocket."
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:07.840]   I could see a company coming in, especially into...
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:13.040]   Well, I don't know if Austin would fly with this, but I could see a company coming into
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:16.720]   a place that Uber and Lyft are not.
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:24.760]   And if they focus on the customer's safety issue, everybody's background checked.
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:31.480]   But at the same time, we're still better than taxis and we...
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:33.840]   Our cars are clean.
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:38.280]   They're not going to get stinky, backseat rides.
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:42.160]   I could actually see somebody coming in and doing that.
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:46.520]   I know that a lot of people have an issue with the fact that you don't know who you're
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.040]   getting with Uber.
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:55.440]   I've never had any types of problems and I don't really walk in fear of doing that.
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:14:00.800]   Like I'm not going to not do something just because I don't know who it is.
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:08.520]   I'm wondering if the issue is that Uber is attracting, given that these are border areas,
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:13.440]   undocumented immigrants who don't want to go through a background check because they
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:17.400]   can't, but who would otherwise drive?
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:18.400]   Not that they're unsafe people.
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:20.240]   You couldn't get a license though, probably.
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:21.240]   That's right.
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:22.240]   They have to have a driver's license.
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:28.000]   Hey, I would imagine Uber uses and Lyft uses third party background checks.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.020]   The city of Houston, for instance, says we're not thrilled about these because they don't
[01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:34.920]   catch every criminal.
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:42.800]   In fact, Houston has required fingerprints and there have been at least several cases
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:49.440]   where drivers who passed a background check were then incriminated by their fingerprint
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:55.040]   because their fingerprint was in a criminal database somewhere.
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:58.880]   You know, it's a complex thing because there's also the issue of traditional yellow cab companies,
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:02.720]   both Austin and Houston are limited in how many vehicles they can have the medallion
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:03.720]   system.
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:07.960]   And we deal with that in San Francisco too and that's why these companies are big in the
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:10.600]   Bay Area because the city of San Francisco kind of blew it in terms of this.
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:14.240]   There aren't very many cabs and those medallions are in New York and medallion's worth a million
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:15.240]   bucks.
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:16.240]   Right.
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:20.480]   And that's an artificial way to keep the demand high.
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:26.080]   I keep hearing about this out our medallion thing and I don't actually have any idea what
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:27.080]   that is.
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:28.480]   So license to have a cab.
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:29.480]   Right.
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:30.800]   Why is it worth a million bucks?
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:36.000]   Because well, it's not that the cab drivers are buying medallions, but some but investors
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.080]   buy medallions and have fleets of cabs.
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:40.080]   Because they're limited.
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:41.080]   There's a limited quantity.
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:45.080]   And it keeps it limited and it keeps it more valuable because you don't want a million
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:46.080]   cabs on the street.
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:47.080]   There are other reasons.
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.280]   I mean, New York traffic is terrible.
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:54.400]   And some, I know some New Yorkers say it's because of all the Uber and Lyft vehicles.
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:57.520]   Although there was a study commissioned by the city of New York that came out last
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:01.240]   couple of weeks ago that said, no, it's not Uber.
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:02.960]   That's not the cause of it.
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:03.960]   It's, you know what?
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:09.320]   This is a complex issue, but I do feel like passenger safety has got to be paramount.
[01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:13.560]   I think they're afraid of the president that they're going to have to do this everywhere.
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:16.320]   And so they'd rather at least threaten to walk away from a market.
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:20.240]   Although again, if that market is worth it to them, one or both of them will come back
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.240]   to it.
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:22.240]   Right.
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:24.920]   Yeah, they haven't left Houston, which also requires fingerprinting.
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:26.480]   And no one's sure why.
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:31.680]   Maybe it's a better market for them.
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:40.160]   I'm curious to know what the percentage of issues that both Lyft and Uber have had.
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:47.480]   I've heard that they have had issues, but I don't have any idea what percentage of
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:53.640]   people are complaining or is it a tiny, tiny, tiny percentage because it doesn't seem like
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:54.640]   a big issue.
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:57.120]   You feel afraid as a young woman, do you feel afraid of a take?
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:03.280]   I actually have been more scared in the back of a cab for my safety than I have with any
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:05.280]   Uber driver.
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:11.880]   I have had tremendously good experiences with Uber versus Cabs.
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:14.360]   And that's why I always choose that if I can.
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:17.400]   Yeah, I encourage my daughter to use Uber actually or Lyft.
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:18.880]   I just feel like they're...
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:19.880]   Yeah.
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:21.360]   I mean, I don't know what it is.
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:31.360]   It's just, I think taxi cabs are so ubiquitous and have been around for so long that there's
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:34.600]   no effort put into it.
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:36.600]   I mean, I guess Uber could become that.
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:37.960]   Uber introduced competition.
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:39.160]   This is the classic case, right?
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:45.000]   Of a kind of complacent industry with a Cabs or Raddy and the experience wasn't great.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000]   And then along...
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.840]   You can't get them because you got to hail them and all that comes to company and comes
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:52.680]   up with a better way and app.
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:58.120]   And somehow manages to get its drivers to drive nicer cars and be cleaner.
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:01.680]   And that's competition and they won in that regard.
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:06.720]   I don't know, I haven't seen any stats to say Uber is more dangerous than a cab.
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:08.320]   I don't think that's the case.
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:11.360]   I wonder if the cab distinction is going to go away at some point here too.
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:16.760]   At some point, like in Portland, for example, they have whatever taxi magic is called now.
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:17.920]   I think they rebranded it.
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:23.040]   But it's basically, you know, they're Cabs, but you get an Uber-like experience.
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:25.000]   It's getting there in terms of ordering them.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.480]   At some point, maybe all the cars are on demand with this way or most of the cars are
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:30.480]   that high.
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:31.480]   I totally see that happening.
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:32.760]   Now, there are a lot of drivers.
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:34.880]   I talk to Uber drivers a lot.
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:36.600]   And some drivers hate Uber.
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:39.120]   Most drivers hate Uber.
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:44.120]   Because a lot of times I think these drivers do it because they almost they have to.
[01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:46.800]   But they don't make as much money as one might think.
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:47.800]   They don't get tipped.
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:48.800]   I don't know.
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:49.800]   This is of course everybody knows this by now.
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:50.800]   They can ask now.
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:52.560]   I assumed that every...
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:56.000]   It didn't Uber in the beginning kind of imply you don't have to leave a tip.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.000]   Yes.
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:02.200]   So, the application, apparently only implication that they were doing it, there was no tipping
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:03.800]   ever.
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:09.920]   And now because of their consent decree with the FTC, they're allowing drivers to put up
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:13.200]   a sign that says, "I don't get a tip if you want to tip me."
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:14.400]   I didn't realize they did that.
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:15.400]   I didn't either.
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:16.880]   I feel like a jerky jerk for years.
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:17.880]   I didn't even know what it was built in.
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:18.880]   I thought it was built in.
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:19.880]   Did you do two?
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:20.880]   Yeah.
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:21.880]   It's not just okay.
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:24.280]   You're not even allowed to ask for a receive a tip.
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:25.280]   No you are.
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:26.280]   Now you are.
[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:27.280]   You can ask for a receive.
[01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:29.320]   But you can't tip in the app, which is still a problem.
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:30.320]   No.
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:31.800]   Because a lot of times you don't have cash with you.
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.440]   The Lyft app allows tipping.
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:36.000]   There's a button that says, "Give them 10, give them 15 percent."
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.960]   But the Uber guys say, "We're not going to add that to the app."
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:39.960]   Because you know what?
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:48.800]   I ask every Uber driver that I get in the car with if they drive both Uber and Lyft
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:51.680]   and what their experience is.
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:55.080]   And they open right up.
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:20:01.520]   And I've seen about a 50/50 kind of split on the happiness with Uber.
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:05.040]   Some of them think that Lyft, they definitely get paid more.
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:08.920]   But other Uber drivers have way more success with Uber.
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:13.320]   So I'm going to guess that's time of day.
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:18.440]   Whether you have a black car or an X makes a difference, I'm sure.
[01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:19.440]   So all those different factors.
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:21.120]   Jason, you've driven for Lyft.
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:22.120]   I produce her.
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:23.120]   I didn't even know this.
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:24.560]   You've driven for Lyft and Uber?
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:27.200]   I didn't know that.
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:28.200]   Is that now?
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:29.200]   Do we not pay you enough?
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:30.200]   No, no, it's not that.
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:32.560]   That's not why I wanted to bring it up.
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:33.560]   But now that's...
[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:35.200]   No, I just wanted to speak from experience.
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:36.200]   Tell me.
[01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:37.680]   But it wasn't that recently, I hope.
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:39.240]   No, no, it's been...
[01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:42.080]   I was doing what I first moved up here to get settled in.
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:43.080]   Oh.
[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:45.360]   Yeah, around here in Petaloma, just a little bit.
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:46.360]   What's your experience?
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:47.520]   Is it better to drive for one or the other?
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:48.520]   Is it a good job?
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:49.520]   Is it a bad job?
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:50.520]   It's a great job.
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:51.520]   I mean, it's fun.
[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:52.520]   Because you set your hours, right?
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:53.520]   You decide when you want to work.
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:54.520]   Right.
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:55.520]   I turn on, I say go.
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:57.520]   And I'm online.
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:58.600]   And I wait for a call.
[01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:00.320]   And I go out and I drive around.
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:04.120]   And I could be sitting home playing Xbox, or I could be driving around and making a couple
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:05.120]   of bucks an hour.
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:06.200]   Yes, yes, that's so bad.
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:07.480]   And I could work a weekend.
[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:13.920]   I usually do the pub crawls, like Friday, Saturday nights from like Kotati down to here.
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.480]   And I'll make like 250 bucks.
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:16.840]   I never knew this about you.
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:17.840]   It's just fun.
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:18.840]   Yum, sit at home.
[01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:22.640]   Now, imagine if I'd called an Uber and you showed up.
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:23.920]   That's what I feel.
[01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:26.160]   I think I actually drove your daughter once.
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.160]   Really?
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:29.200]   Yeah, I hope you said hi.
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:32.720]   Actually, I find it frustrating when there are not enough Ubers around.
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:34.440]   I really want them to be around.
[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:35.960]   I like it.
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:36.960]   It's so convenient.
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:39.200]   I mean, I could go on the app right now and it would ping me in a sec.
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:41.280]   Now, did anybody ever tip you?
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:42.920]   Uber, people offered me tips.
[01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:43.920]   I'd always fight them.
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:44.920]   Tell them no.
[01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:46.120]   I'm like, don't worry about it.
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:47.920]   It's just give me a good rating.
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:48.920]   Oh.
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:49.920]   Because rating is rule.
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:50.920]   Ratings was more than a tip.
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:53.440]   Waiting is way worth way more.
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:55.760]   I always give five stars always, even if you're crappy.
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:56.760]   I give you a faster.
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:57.760]   Wow.
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:01.600]   And then Lyft, I tried Lyft, but there's not that much demand for Lyft up here.
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:02.600]   Yeah, interesting.
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:03.600]   Yeah.
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:08.720]   One of my drivers told me that if somebody throws up in the backseat or because you mentioned
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:11.840]   the pub crawls, if you have an accident.
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:12.840]   I've had that happen.
[01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:16.240]   Okay, so they said that they paid for that cleanup.
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:17.240]   Is that correct?
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:21.040]   You pay for it outright and then you file a claim and they reimburse you.
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:22.320]   Okay.
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:24.320]   I have doggy bags now.
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:26.960]   Hey, but you know what you're doing?
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:29.560]   God's work because that person should not be behind the wheel.
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:30.560]   Yeah.
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:32.240]   And the fact that you're taking them home is great.
[01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:33.240]   Right.
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:34.240]   And that's what I like doing.
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:36.080]   Yeah, that's one of the reasons I tell my daughter, I don't want my daughter behind
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:37.080]   the wheel at any time.
[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:38.080]   Yeah.
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:39.080]   Let alone when she's drunk.
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:40.080]   Yeah.
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:41.080]   But any time, she's 24.
[01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:43.080]   She's old enough to have a beer or two.
[01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:44.080]   And you know, I've got that van.
[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:48.200]   So when I pick up on Friday nights for the, you know, from Sonoma State, I've got music
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:49.200]   playing in there.
[01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:50.200]   It's fun.
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:51.200]   It's fun.
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:52.200]   Yeah.
[01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:55.560]   And then the conversation is actually with Uber and Lyft drivers.
[01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:59.240]   Lyft a motion in the chat says the Lyft actually pays faster.
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:00.240]   Yes.
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:01.240]   I don't know if that's true, but okay.
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:02.240]   Yeah.
[01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:03.240]   Awesome.
[01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:07.880]   Well, do you guys remember the very beginning of sidecar when everything was donation based?
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:09.440]   I don't know if you guys did that.
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:10.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:11.440]   That didn't work too well.
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:12.440]   No, I mean, it didn't last very long.
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:16.720]   But I remember being in San Francisco and literally driving around and it would just
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:22.160]   say, you know, we recommend you give them $10 and I could give them anything.
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:23.160]   I wanted really.
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:26.600]   But see, you are the kind of guy and I think I am too, where we would give them more than
[01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:27.600]   the minimum.
[01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:28.600]   Yeah.
[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:31.160]   That's the sharing economy days that were over the idea was, oh, we're all sharing our
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:33.160]   cars instead of, no, I'm paying for a service.
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:37.400]   There's a lot of dopes who would say, oh, good, I can give you $5 then and we'd do that.
[01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:38.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:43.240]   I'd always ask, you know, how often do you get stiffed and each driver had, you know,
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:46.400]   I'd say maybe once or twice a night, they drive so much.
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:50.000]   Do you imagine driving someone and just they just get out and they're, you know, you
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.000]   at all, whatever.
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000]   I don't have to pay you.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000]   This is the sharing economy.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.800]   No wonder it didn't work.
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:55.800]   Thank you for sharing.
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:56.800]   Yeah.
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:00.760]   We need to hold show on just stories from Uber drivers.
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:01.760]   I think so.
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:02.760]   Oh my God.
[01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:03.760]   No, I mean, yeah.
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:08.240]   It's like tax to cap confidential except with an app.
[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:09.240]   Okay.
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:12.040]   That's a good conversation.
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:14.880]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:16.920]   All right.
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:20.240]   Let's talk about TV because everybody, now Apple for years has been trying to get a
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:25.280]   deal to do cable over the Apple TV basically over the top television.
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:30.720]   Now all of a sudden, a story that YouTube's doing unplugged YouTube unplugged and it's
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:36.640]   the same darn story and it's probably, Kurt, you probably cover this equally unlikely,
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:37.940]   right?
[01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:42.920]   I just think that this ties back to the thing that we were touching on at the very beginning
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:51.160]   with Facebook and Twitter's deal with the NFL, there is just so much demand for controlling
[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:58.920]   the content that we all watch and it's not at all surprising that someone like YouTube
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:07.800]   wants to kind of graduate from user-generated video library to something that's more professional
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:11.960]   and that's something that's the Netflix model, right?
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:18.440]   Like Netflix has really put this whole idea that we need to buy cable on its head and
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:21.760]   shown people that, hey, let's pay for what you actually want.
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:24.720]   I mean, maybe Netflix isn't quite like this, at least when it started.
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:28.480]   Isn't the problem though that they're just never going to get these guys to agree to
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:29.480]   this?
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:30.720]   For instance, NBC is owned by Comcast.
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:35.520]   There's no way Comcast is ever going to let anybody do it over the top service.
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:41.440]   Well, I'm hesitant to say never because you have to look at, you can be stubborn all you
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:44.920]   want, but you got to look at where people are actually consuming, right?
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:46.280]   I mean, so many...
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:49.640]   So the risk is that they'll all just watch YouTube and not watch you at all.
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:51.800]   Sure, or look at the NFL.
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:56.320]   I mean, if you'd asked five years ago, hey, is NFL A going to give up streaming rights
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:02.600]   to anybody that's, I think, what they sold on Yahoo, did a game.
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:04.680]   Now, Twitter's obviously going to do 10 games.
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:07.520]   But Twitter's not exclusive and it's just a million bucks.
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:09.920]   It's like a million dollar extra.
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:10.920]   It's a test.
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:12.400]   It's a test, right?
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:13.400]   Sure.
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:19.240]   But my point is that the idea that the NFL would be that freewheeling with its rights
[01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:22.960]   again five years ago would have been ridiculous.
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:25.040]   They're acknowledging the climate.
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:26.040]   Yeah.
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:27.320]   Got to go where people are, right?
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:32.320]   You got to go and you got to find where people are going to...
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:35.040]   What they're willing to pay and where they're willing to pay for it.
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:40.160]   And I think this idea that we all want specific channels and not others and we want to watch
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:42.280]   them on the internet, I mean, that's a real thing.
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:46.880]   And it's only a matter of time before someone comes in and figures out the model that's
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:51.360]   going to work or has the relationships built in place where they can convince a Comcast
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:27:00.080]   or someone like, hey, we can help you with distribution and make this an important part
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:02.960]   of your business because there's a lot of people who actually want this.
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:04.720]   So I don't know when it's going to happen.
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:08.200]   Hulu might have an inside track and apparently they're also trying to put something together
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:10.440]   because they are partly owned by the network.
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:16.600]   They're owned by Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox, Comcast, NBC Universal is a silent partner
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:24.280]   in Hulu, but that's only because they were required to shut up by the FTC.
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:26.240]   Be interesting to see if they could put this together.
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:30.760]   They may be the first company to be able to do this.
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:36.400]   Now YouTube isn't trying to take that stuff and put it on TV.
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:39.600]   They're just trying to, if it's not understanding, are they?
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:40.600]   Yeah, they're trying to create.
[01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:44.920]   I thought they were trying to cure it, like curate kind of topics within YouTube and the
[01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:45.920]   set up boxes.
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:48.080]   No, they're doing that as well, but they want to be.
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:52.400]   So the whole idea is, okay, if people are going to cord cut, how are they going to watch
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:53.920]   TV?
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:28:02.640]   And all of these online services like Apple TV, Hulu and YouTube would like to be the
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:04.400]   new way you watch TV?
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:08.640]   Well, the problem is everybody is offering something for a different price.
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:09.640]   We think it's cheaper.
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:12.840]   But the whole service would be 40 bucks a month.
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:14.680]   So it wouldn't be cheaper.
[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:17.760]   It wouldn't because you have already, you still have to pay for your internet.
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:21.680]   So of course, the cable companies, who most people get their internet, Comcast is number
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:25.080]   one, have been slowly jacking up the internet prices because they know they're going to
[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:27.240]   start losing the premium and TV subscribers.
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:28.240]   All right, no problem.
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:32.600]   We'll charge you 60 bucks and then we'll get a little chunk of the Hulu $40.
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:35.400]   And putting in some bandwidth caps too while we're at it.
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:36.680]   Well, now here's the good news.
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:38.080]   They just raised those bandwidth caps.
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:42.960]   Yeah, but still it's like Comcast is looking at a terabyte, which is fine now, but we'll
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:50.120]   probably, we will end up in a cell phone kind of tariff state at some point.
[01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:51.120]   Sure.
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:55.960]   Well, they're going to in one way or another, Comcast is not going to lose money.
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:58.440]   By hook or by crook, they are going to make the same revenue.
[01:28:58.440 --> 01:28:59.600]   They own the pipe, right?
[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:00.600]   Right.
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:01.600]   They own the content and the pipe.
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:02.600]   Yeah.
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:09.680]   I do love the fact that we're kind of moving towards a society where we're willing to pay
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:14.640]   for the actual content that we enjoy.
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:17.800]   I think that's a long time coming and needed.
[01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:23.080]   And so I think that's, I think what we're seeing is definitely move towards that direction.
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:27.800]   I would like to see it kind of, there's a, there's a new browser, right?
[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:33.280]   That actually there've been a couple of browsers and apps that allow you to pay for the content
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:35.280]   that you actually consume and the websites that you visited.
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:36.280]   Yeah.
[01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:39.920]   Google contribute is one and the folks at the ad blocker, adblock plus, we're going to
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:43.560]   do the same thing where you pay a little, I actually do Google contribute.
[01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:48.720]   It's maxed out at $10 and I see little putty tats wherever I would see, not that, not
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:54.520]   putty tattoos, putty cats where I would see, well, you got to be careful with this crowd
[01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:58.200]   but that would, that where I would see normally see ads that Google would provide.
[01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:01.760]   And then the publisher gets a little slice of that and I like it because I little kitty
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:02.760]   cats everywhere.
[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:04.440]   I think that's really cool.
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:05.440]   Yeah.
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:09.440]   So YouTube wants to put together basically a bundle of cable channels that would, they
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:12.240]   want to be your cable company basically.
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:14.000]   Google's doing this by the way.
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.000]   They have Google fiber.
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.280]   Well, they, yeah, they're doing where they are your cable company.
[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:20.800]   They just kind of like, alphabet's doing it is what I should say.
[01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:26.600]   It's one of their, you know, one of their AT&T's U-verse or if resin files, they offer TV service,
[01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:27.600]   cable service.
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:28.600]   Right.
[01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:29.840]   It's more of a Comcast competitor.
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:32.840]   It's a traditional direct Comcast competitor.
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:37.520]   But I mean, you know, shows that, that alphabet is, is interested in this idea.
[01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:42.760]   So I guess it does not surprise me that another alphabet property, YouTube would be trying
[01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:45.440]   to tackle the same thing but in a different way.
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.800]   Triple ad nail, this, triple ad nail this in our chatroom.
[01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:50.040]   He said, I don't want to buy channels.
[01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:51.200]   I want to buy shows.
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:52.200]   Yeah.
[01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:54.480]   And I think that's really what users want.
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:55.800]   But you can, you can do that now.
[01:30:55.800 --> 01:30:59.040]   You can buy shows on iTunes or Google Play and it adds up fast.
[01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:02.480]   If you only want to watch one or two shows, it's a better deal to do that than to pay
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:03.480]   it for cable.
[01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:06.360]   But if you watch 10 shows, it suddenly becomes a terrible deal.
[01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:07.360]   Yeah.
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:08.360]   No, you're right.
[01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:10.760]   I bought it like if you buy Game of Thrones, like what 50 bucks or something is ridiculous.
[01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:11.760]   Yeah.
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:14.720]   What is, what is a HBO cost for the entire run up Game of Thrones?
[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:15.720]   Right.
[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:16.720]   Yeah.
[01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:22.880]   And that you can do that on iTunes with big shows, but you can't do that with your favorite.
[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:30.000]   You can through YouTube Red for instance, but it's not the same.
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.280]   In my view, it's not the same thing.
[01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:38.280]   Going through iTunes to get a big show that's out there like, I don't know any shows that
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:39.280]   are out there.
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:40.280]   Sure.
[01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:44.920]   My point is just that buying a show doesn't scale very well because if you watch more than
[01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:45.920]   a few shows.
[01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:49.320]   I mean, this fallacy of though, I'm going to be a court cutter and I'm going to save money
[01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:52.000]   because they're not going to charge me for the channels I don't watch.
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:56.320]   But the economics don't work eventually, unless you don't watch very much TV at all,
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:57.320]   you'll pay anyway.
[01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:01.920]   You'll just be paying for the specific stuff that you want to watch, which might be, you
[01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:05.080]   know, it's more freedom, but it's not like you're, a lot of people aren't going to save
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:09.160]   any money because, you know, it doesn't scale if you watch more than a couple of things.
[01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:13.400]   If you, again, if you're a court cutter who only literally wants to watch HBO, great or
[01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:14.600]   Netflix, great.
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:17.200]   But then you start adding in other programming and it gets messy real fast.
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:22.360]   But ideally you would want this direct drive between the viewers and the creators where
[01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:24.920]   just as, you know, you would like to see this with the music industry.
[01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:29.800]   And of course, it's long way off, but we're, but a few artists like Jonathan Colton, I
[01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:30.800]   pay him directly.
[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:31.800]   I like his music.
[01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:32.800]   I buy his songs.
[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:33.800]   He gets the money.
[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:37.000]   You know, my website has a subscription and we're going to put together a membership thing
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.680]   for the incomparable podcast.
[01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:40.080]   We're going to do one for that.
[01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:41.080]   And that's direct, right?
[01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:46.000]   And that, that, I think that works, although again, I worry that ultimately people are
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.440]   going to tire of having a whole bunch of five dollar a month.
[01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:50.160]   50 podcast I listened to.
[01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:51.160]   Exactly.
[01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:52.160]   Each one is five bucks.
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:53.160]   That's a lot of money.
[01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:55.920]   We're actually going to talk about podcasting just a little bit because the New York Times
[01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:58.440]   had a front page story today and the Sunday Times.
[01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:00.240]   It was all wrong.
[01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:04.320]   And as podcasters, I think we need to explain what's wrong.
[01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:06.040]   It's coming up in just a little bit.
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:11.000]   Our show today brought to you by Go To Meeting, be a meeting MVP.
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.360]   Take your meetings to the next level with Go To Meeting.
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:15.160]   It is the way to have a meeting.
[01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:18.280]   Whether it's just a conference call, that usually if I'm setting up a conference call,
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:19.960]   we'll set up a Go To Meeting.
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:25.480]   I can meet with anybody around the world, of course, clients and colleagues.
[01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:30.320]   Ah, but if I want to turn on my screen sharing, now they can see my screen.
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:33.280]   They can see the PowerPoint presentation or we can collaborate in a document.
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:36.280]   And if I turn on my camera, now they can see me and I can see them.
[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:42.440]   And suddenly, it's like a face-to-face meeting without any of the inconvenience or expensive
[01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:43.440]   travel.
[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:45.880]   I'd love Go To Meeting for this.
[01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:47.360]   Start a meeting with a click of the mouse.
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:50.200]   And by the way, very easy for your clients.
[01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:53.720]   You don't want to make them jump through hoops to meet with you to see your sales presentation.
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:54.720]   And they won't.
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:55.720]   They get an email.
[01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:56.720]   They click a link 30 seconds later.
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:57.720]   They're seeing you.
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:33:59.320]   They're seeing your presentation.
[01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:01.280]   Clients prefer it.
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:02.280]   They prefer it.
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:05.880]   They have more eight martini lunches and they, you know, I got to talk to the guy.
[01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:09.040]   I just want to see what is he offering.
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:10.880]   You could pass off presenter duties with ease.
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:13.920]   So it's really easy to have multiple presenters in multiple places.
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:15.920]   Share your screen.
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:17.080]   Share your video.
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:20.240]   Even send private chats and video links.
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:21.760]   Go To Meeting.
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:25.280]   Time to put on your best performance and be a meeting MVP.

[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:31.960]   Click that.
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:38.080]   And I'm telling you, within two minutes you'll be up and running with Go To Meeting.
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:44.280]   We're talking about the week's tech news, as we always do on a Sunday afternoon with
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:48.240]   some of the smartest people in the tech business.
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:53.760]   Luria Patruccia is here, her new enterprise Geeks University.
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:54.760]   Yeah.
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:57.880]   What do I learn at a Geeks University?
[01:34:57.880 --> 01:35:04.920]   So we have free content and free courses.
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:10.560]   We teach people how to use live streaming and online video to grow their business, to
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:14.000]   get more traffic, more fans, more sales, all of that good stuff.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.320]   So what we're just talking about with Elon Musk, he knows, really knows how to pull those
[01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:19.480]   strings and how to do it.
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:20.840]   You teach people how to do that.
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:23.000]   Yeah, I've been doing it for 10 years.
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:29.200]   And so we take all of that, all the lessons learned and teach people step by step how
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:30.200]   to do it.
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:35.360]   We actually have a free course out right now at geeksuniversity.com/livestream where we
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:38.400]   teach people the three biggest mistakes that people make with live streams.
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:40.400]   So if you're doing it, you can...
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:42.960]   I'm probably making all three of them, aren't I?
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:45.120]   You can avoid those mistakes.
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:46.120]   Yes.
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:47.120]   Don't be old.
[01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:49.800]   That's what you learn online video live streaming.
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:51.120]   All that fun stuff.
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:52.120]   Nice.
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:55.280]   That's geeksuniversity.com/livestream.
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:56.600]   Jason Snell is here.
[01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:57.600]   Good friend.
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:35:59.640]   I was just, you know, Kate Patello was out here.
[01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:01.440]   She said to say hi.
[01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:05.240]   And I said, well, you know, Jason, she said, of course he did the Mac tips on call for
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:06.240]   help.
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:10.080]   You were showing that clip on the what happened last week of you guys being blurry.
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:11.280]   And it's like I was on that show.
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:12.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:13.280]   Absolutely back at 10 days.
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:14.640]   It's hard to believe we've been doing this long.
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:20.040]   You know, the May 11th, which is what three days away, is the 18th anniversary of the
[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:21.040]   launch of tech TV.
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:22.040]   Wow.
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:27.040]   It's hard to believe doing this a long time.
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:33.640]   Doing it longer than that because I started doing just technology radio in 92.
[01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:36.040]   So this is my 24th year.
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:43.480]   Don't you still love it though?
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:44.480]   You know what?
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:45.840]   It's the best beat ever because it's fun.
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:46.840]   I mean, this stuff is great.
[01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:50.040]   I can't wait to see the new just got the HTC 10.
[01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:53.280]   You know, the reason I got into it back when I started writing for magazines, I bet you
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:59.240]   have similar story back and I started writing for magazines at 78.
[01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:05.120]   And so I could get free software because I couldn't afford this stuff was expensive,
[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:08.200]   you know, floppy disks and all that stuff.
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:13.280]   And I said to myself, remember very well, I would like to always have the latest and
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:15.040]   greatest stuff and how can I do that?
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:18.040]   And that's how I got kind of one of the reasons I got to take journalism also because I loved
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:19.040]   it.
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:22.920]   And it turned out I was kind of able to talk about it in a way that normal people could
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:24.660]   understand.
[01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:27.120]   But Kirk, why did you get into this business?
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:28.520]   Where did you come from?
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:33.200]   You know, I was destined to be the center fielder for the Seattle Mariners.
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:34.200]   Oh, man.
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:41.840]   And all of a sudden, for some reason, your dream was that didn't work out exactly.
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:48.400]   And so I kind of got into journalism as a doing some sports writing in college.
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:50.320]   And I edited the school newspaper.
[01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:51.320]   I was at Inter in chief.
[01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:55.480]   And so I moved kind of more into news because if you're the editor, you kind of got to
[01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:57.600]   be able to do a lot more than just sports.
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:02.360]   And when I got out of school, I had some opportunities in Silicon Valley to do tech
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:03.440]   and business.
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:07.280]   And once you kind of get in that pipeline, it's hard to hard to transition, but it's
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:08.280]   been good.
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:09.280]   I like it a lot.
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:10.280]   Are you getting tired of it?
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:11.280]   You're just good.
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:12.280]   Are you?
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:16.760]   No, no, I mean, I have different, I would say, whereas a lot of tech journalists have
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:19.200]   a strong passion in tech.
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:22.720]   I wouldn't say that it's necessarily a passion of mine, but it's something I think that's
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:24.800]   actually better because I agree.
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:29.520]   And it puts, you know, let's me look at it through a lens of someone who doesn't necessarily
[01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:33.640]   think of this as a huge part of my life outside of work.
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:36.320]   Whereas with sports, of course, you know, that is a passion of mine.
[01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:40.240]   So maybe I wouldn't have been as objective or would have been harder to cover.
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:42.280]   No, but yeah, I like business writing.
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:43.280]   It's fun.
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:48.520]   I think we do need people who are a little more objective if people like me and Jason
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:50.400]   have a failing and so we love this stuff.
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:53.560]   And so you kind of are rooting for it all the time.
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:56.400]   And so that is a disadvantage in some respects.
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:01.040]   You got to try to bring some skepticism whether you come with that perspective or you force
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:02.200]   yourself to have it.
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:04.600]   Devorak taught me that.
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:05.600]   He hates everything.
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:06.600]   He does.
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:09.240]   So I realize, and generally speaking, he's right, right?
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:13.440]   And I realize that you can say you could just make your rule be everything sucks.
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:15.640]   And about 80% of the time you'd be right.
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:18.120]   You have a very good track record.
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:22.000]   So I learned that you should be skeptical out of the box almost always.
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:26.200]   We just got the HTC Vive and I have to say that is really interesting.
[01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:30.240]   That's the one that has hand paddles and sensors around you and we've been playing with in
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:31.240]   the other room.
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:35.280]   And there's there's something that I was skeptical about for a long time and I'm starting
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:36.960]   to starting to get the VR.
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:40.480]   It's a good to start from a place of skepticism though, right?
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:41.480]   Prove it to me.
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:42.480]   Show me why this is.
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:44.080]   Well, and you probably all do this.
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:48.240]   I don't want to be a cheerleader for something that ends up being a flop.
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:49.960]   Which has happened for sure.
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:54.520]   But you really don't want to get people to buy stuff that then they go, Leo, you were
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:55.520]   wrong.
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:57.200]   This thing is crap.
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:04.000]   So I'd like to focus on only tech that matters, you know, only stuff that really impacts,
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.360]   you know, we all hope to do that.
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:07.960]   But it's hard not to become a fan boy, you know.
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:08.960]   Anyway, this.
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:11.880]   So this HD said that Tiana is nice and I'm a fan of the HTC company.
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:17.200]   I wanted them to do a phone that they and I love the M7 and the M8, the original HTC
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:18.200]   ones.
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:20.320]   But they, but there were things missing on that.
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:24.920]   And I think we've really, Android has is very interesting is really mature.
[01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:29.880]   The Android space to the point where there's not much to distinguish this from the other
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:34.840]   top of the line Android devices like the LG G5 or the Galaxy S7.
[01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:39.360]   It's, it's a, it's a fair tiny amount of differences between them.
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:40.680]   There's some beautiful premium.
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:44.200]   Yeah, if you're willing to pay six or seven hundred bucks for a phone, that's the problem.
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:45.480]   They're very expensive.
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:48.920]   But this is the, if you're an HTC fan, I think you'd like this, the battery life, not quite
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:54.320]   as good as the S7 camera, not quite as good as the S7 screen, not quite as good as the
[01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:55.320]   S7.
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:58.680]   So I'm, I still think the S7 is the, is the phone to beat these days, but it does have
[01:40:58.680 --> 01:40:59.680]   a type C connector.
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:05.080]   I long for the days when Apple and everybody else shifts over to this new connector.
[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:06.080]   I don't know if Apple will do it.
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:07.680]   They're kind of, they just changed.
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:08.680]   Right.
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:09.680]   It might happen someday.
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:10.840]   There'd be a backlash.
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:11.840]   All those people about.
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:14.280]   I think you'll see it on all the Macs first before you do it on the iPad.
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:15.280]   Yeah.
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:16.280]   And you are seeing on the Mac.
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:19.880]   As somebody with a big iPad Pro, I actually kind of think would have been better.
[01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:20.880]   Would have been better.
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:22.480]   Not having USB C on the iPad Pro.
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:23.480]   Would have been better.
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:24.480]   Yeah.
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:31.040]   Just a charger and not just a USB port, but you get a really fast connectivity up to Thunderbolt
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:39.120]   3 connectivity, which is 40 gigabytes per second, or 40 gigabits per second.
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:42.880]   But you also can put video out of this at the same time.
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:44.920]   So it's really kind of the do all port.
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:47.080]   It's really an amazing port.
[01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:51.880]   But if somebody's asking the chairman, Galaxy S7 is the one, it's still the one, the one
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:54.560]   to beat on the Android side.
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:59.360]   And I feel for you, Jason, because you will never be allowed to carry an Android device.
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:01.360]   I have a, what, Nexus 5X?
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:03.520]   I use my Android reference.
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:04.520]   Oh, that's good.
[01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:05.520]   Yeah.
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:07.520]   I can see how bad Apple music is on Android every so often.
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:08.520]   All right.
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:13.520]   We should talk about Apple music because I am interested in this story and we were debating
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:14.520]   this.
[01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:15.520]   I was debating this earlier today with the chatroom.
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:21.800]   You probably all saw the post on vellum by a composer who kind of echoed what Jim Dalrym
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:30.520]   Paul had said about Apple's music losing, Apple losing his music.
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:36.720]   The guy in vellum is a composer who said his piece was titled Apple stole my music.
[01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:38.000]   No, seriously.
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.200]   This very, this is James Pinkstone.
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:42.360]   There's very similar to what Jim Dalrym Paul said.
[01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:44.800]   Yeah, it gets some details wrong is the problem with it.
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:48.520]   Serenity Caldwell wrote a nice piece at iMOR saying it pro, Apple probably didn't delete
[01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:51.720]   your music off of your, I think this is Apple's fault.
[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:56.280]   And probably not even because it's a bug, but because Apple's service, especially their
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:43:00.800]   matching features and the way that the software is written in iTunes and the dialogue box you
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:01.800]   get.
[01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:05.520]   If you accidentally press the delete key, you get this bizarre dialogue box that gives you
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:10.600]   these choices, all of which send other than cancel, send your files to the trash and not
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:14.960]   understanding how Apple music matches your music and how your downloads work.
[01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:20.000]   It's so complicated and you can very easily get to a point where you lose the music that
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:26.320]   isn't protected and that all the music you've got is protected DRM.
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:28.000]   And if you cancel, you lose your files.
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:31.760]   You can get there without realizing you get there, which is what I suspect happened to
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:33.160]   the person who wrote this story.
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:34.560]   That's ridiculous.
[01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:37.920]   I mean, that can't happen from a company's perspective.
[01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:42.720]   A, I wouldn't assume user error because I always hate to assume user error.
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:47.040]   Yeah, it's the problem is his story is very much like I talked to an Apple genius who
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:49.040]   said this is totally a feature.
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:50.040]   And it's not a feature.
[01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:51.960]   He's absolutely wrong about that.
[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:55.080]   The Apple person was wrong in telling him that.
[01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:56.560]   And so let me give you the story.
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:44:00.520]   Either like I said, it's either a bug or it's a misunderstanding.
[01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:02.800]   Either way, it's bad and it's Apple's fault.
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:03.800]   Right.
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:04.800]   Yeah.
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:05.800]   So here's what happened.
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:11.280]   He, as many of us do use, apparently used Apple's iTunes match feature.
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:13.600]   Yeah, although there's a match feature in Apple music.
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:15.360]   So Apple music will do it.
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:18.400]   So he had his own compositions because he's an amateur composer.
[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:21.120]   So he had his own compositions on the hard drive.
[01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:23.760]   They were in iTunes.
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:28.960]   He also had, and this is, this to me seems more likely, he had rare versions of some
[01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:31.440]   songs like, "Fountains of Wains.
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:32.440]   I'll do the driving."
[01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:33.440]   Now there is a fountain.
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:34.920]   Oh, he had a fountain of wanes.
[01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:35.920]   I've got that song.
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:36.920]   Live.
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:37.920]   For those versions.
[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:38.920]   Yeah, I kind of like a kennel demo or something.
[01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:41.320]   It's like an earlier version that's mixed differently.
[01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:42.320]   I've got it too.
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:43.320]   Same song.
[01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:46.120]   And then he also had, but the problem is Apple.
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:47.120]   Yeah.
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:50.640]   The good news is he had backups, so he did not lose anything.
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:55.880]   But he says, "What happened was Apple music matched that to the single, not to this rare
[01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:58.400]   original version and deleted."
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:03.440]   And this is the real question mark because he asserts in here, and I don't think this
[01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:09.760]   is the case, but that Apple deletes music once it's matched.
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:10.960]   Yeah, that's not true.
[01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:12.600]   I don't think this is true.
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:17.240]   And he claims an Apple person told in this, "I'm sure that's not true."
[01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:21.000]   When he says, "When I sign up for Apple music, iTunes evaluated my massive collection of
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:25.480]   MP3 and WAV files, scanned Apple's database for what it considered matches, and we all
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:27.520]   acknowledge those matches could be wrong easily."
[01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:30.320]   And that's freak with the R-R, yes.
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:31.600]   But this is the thing I question.
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:36.600]   He says, "Then removed the original files from my internal hard drive, removed them, deleted
[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:37.600]   them.
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:41.200]   If Apple Music saw a file, it didn't recognize which came up often," since I'm a freelance
[01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:44.520]   composer and have many music files I created myself, it would then download it to Apple's
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:49.520]   database, "deleted from my hard drive and serve it back to me when I wanted to listen."
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:51.400]   That's not behavior that iTunes does.
[01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:52.560]   That's not how it's designed.
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:57.160]   Now, is it possible that there's some weird bug in iTunes that caused this to happen?
[01:45:57.160 --> 01:46:00.240]   Yeah, I suspect we would have heard about it sooner.
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:03.600]   It's probably user error, but I hate to judge it.
[01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:06.440]   And God knows, iTunes is buggy enough.
[01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:08.080]   And Apple Music has enough problems.
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:13.760]   Jim Dalrymple, who is not an unsophisticated user, had a very similar experience.
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:19.240]   The difference is, so what happened with Jim is that his metadata all got messed up, and
[01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:20.960]   that also, if you're on a machine--
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:24.160]   He claimed originally that significant amount of music was also deleted.
[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:30.120]   Yeah, but again, I'm not unclear whether that happened because it deleted it or because
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:31.120]   he misunderstood.
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:32.120]   He deleted it.
[01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:36.320]   Because, seriously, the dialog box that when you hit delete, one of the options is "Remove
[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:39.880]   Download," which implies it's this transitory file you downloaded from the internet.
[01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:42.920]   What it really does is it throws your music in the trash.
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:43.920]   And there it is.
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:44.920]   Oh, nice.
[01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:45.920]   You got it.
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:46.920]   Are you sure you'd want to leave this song?
[01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:49.080]   Well, no, I would say not, right?
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:50.080]   Right.
[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:51.640]   So, delete song is scary.
[01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:52.640]   Remove download.
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:54.160]   Okay, well, that sounds safer because it's just a download.
[01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:55.160]   That's fine.
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:56.160]   I can get it back.
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:59.720]   But if it's mismatched it, then that download is actually your original file, even if you
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:00.800]   ripped it from an MP3.
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:01.800]   Oh, that's terrible.
[01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:04.480]   Or created it yourself, and then it'll just throw it in the trash.
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:07.880]   And the next time you say, "Hey, short on disk space, I'll empty the trash."
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:09.680]   Boom, you've deleted your files.
[01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:13.600]   And you can't get them back because the ones that Apple keeps up on the server are wrong
[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:16.200]   because they're a mismatch like that found in Sowain song.
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:18.360]   So there's no question that there's mismatching happening.
[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:19.360]   But that happens.
[01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:21.240]   CDDB would do that all the time, too.
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:22.240]   Yeah.
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:23.240]   I think that, I mean, Apple--
[01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:24.240]   It's hard to do.
[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:26.080]   I think Apple is overconfident about its ability to match songs.
[01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:29.360]   And if you've got any live albums, it'll match them to studio albums.
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:31.560]   If you've got rarities, it will mismatch them.
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:32.640]   It happens all the time.
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:33.640]   It's a mess.
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:37.520]   And the biggest problem is, although that should be better and Apple should be less confident
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:41.920]   in it, there's also literally no way to say, "Uh-uh, you got this wrong.
[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:45.080]   Just take my freaking file and put it in the cloud.
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:48.200]   You can't override iTunes match or iCloud music.
[01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:49.200]   Well, that's a flaw.
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:52.320]   You can't say, "Please just put my rarities in the cloud.
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:53.320]   You can't do it."
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:54.400]   Yeah.
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:48:01.280]   So I think that probably Pinkstone is wrong in asserting that Apple's-- I mean, maybe Apple
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:04.080]   is telling us some renegade service.
[01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:05.080]   Yeah.
[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:06.080]   But if you look at the descriptions on Apple's website--
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:07.080]   It's not supposed to happen.
[01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:08.080]   It's not supposed to happen, right?
[01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:09.280]   This is not a policy.
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:13.280]   And I think he-- understandably angry because he lost his files, but it's not like this
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:14.280]   is Apple's policy.
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:15.680]   They find your music and destroy it.
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:16.680]   That's not it.
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:20.080]   Either there's a bug or it's just terrible design.
[01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:26.080]   And it all comes back to the fact that it's merging your library with what's on the cloud
[01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:27.800]   in the music service.
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:32.160]   And there was another piece that Serenity wrote on iMore this week that was basically
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:33.920]   maybe Apple should stop.
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:38.500]   Stop trying to match your music with the cloud and just let you have your music and
[01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:43.000]   let you have Apple music in the cloud and keep them separate because then this stuff
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.000]   wouldn't happen.
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:45.000]   Yeah.
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:46.000]   Yeah.
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.800]   New York Times article front page of the Sunday Times.
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:49.800]   I was all excited.
[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:54.320]   I saw, "Oh, podcast surge on the front page of the New York Times, Sunday Times."
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:56.080]   But producers fear Apple isn't listening.
[01:48:56.080 --> 01:48:59.320]   When I saw that, I thought, "Huh?"
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:03.920]   So the article, I think, got it wrong in almost every respect.
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:09.600]   Thank God for Marco Armin who wrote a response in which he said Apple, the New York Times
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:11.840]   got this wrong in almost every regard.
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:15.680]   It's very rare when you see content creators say, "Hey, we would like a new--" I mean,
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:20.080]   this is literally like, we would like somebody as powerful as YouTube or Facebook to be the
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:22.480]   intermediary and take control of what we're doing.
[01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:26.720]   This worried me because first of all, the Times did not interview me and didn't interview
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:31.360]   you and I don't know anybody, they interview, though they say they talk to all many of the
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:32.360]   big podcast.
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:33.360]   Right.
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:34.360]   Most of which are NPR people.
[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:38.200]   Well, that's the problem is that in New York City, they think podcasting equals NPR.
[01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:39.200]   Yeah.
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:40.360]   Former NPR people current.
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:46.000]   Interviews with over two dozen podcasters and people inside Apple revere a variety of complaints.
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:49.320]   The producers-- and this is true, although I don't complain about it because we have
[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:52.400]   a good relationship with iTunes, but the podcasters say they're relegated to wooing
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:54.880]   a single Apple employee for promotion.
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:55.880]   That's true.
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:56.880]   Steve Wilson.
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:49:57.880]   Great guy.
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:49:58.880]   Love Steve.
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:49:59.880]   Yeah.
[01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:00.880]   And that's true in every country.
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:01.880]   There's a Steve, different Steve, but there's a Steve.
[01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:03.680]   It's always a Steve.
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:09.000]   But you shouldn't be relying on Apple promotion in iTunes if that's what you're relying on
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.280]   anyway.
[01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:15.560]   The thing that scared me a little bit more is according to the Times, Apple brought seven
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:21.280]   leading podcast professionals to the campus last month to air their case to a room full
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:23.120]   of employees.
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:25.080]   The people would speak only a bit.
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:29.520]   The company made no promises, but several pressing issues for podcasters were discussed
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:30.760]   in frank terms.
[01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:36.760]   And after the presentations, Eddie Q arrived for a closed session with the company's employees.
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:41.920]   Now, the reason that scares me is because they're saying, "Oh, Apple should give us
[01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:44.720]   some information about our listeners.
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:47.080]   Apple should count our downloads.
[01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:50.320]   Why isn't Apple doing more for us podcasters?"
[01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:51.320]   And I don't want that.
[01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:52.320]   Yeah.
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:54.800]   People don't realize Apple doesn't serve podcasts.
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:56.680]   Apple is a directory of RSS feed.
[01:50:56.680 --> 01:50:58.640]   They're simply a directory.
[01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:01.760]   And then they've got their own podcast app and they could do stats from their podcast
[01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:02.760]   app.
[01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:06.880]   They could write and they in fact may know those stats already, like what you listen to.
[01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:08.520]   They may be monitoring that.
[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:14.600]   But even if they are, that's going to be what 50% maybe of the podcast market, not 100%.
[01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:22.840]   So they have to monitor that because they have to curate and they have to show what's
[01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:24.280]   hot, what's the budget.
[01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:25.280]   No.
[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:26.280]   Okay.
[01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:30.360]   So this is important and nobody understands this properly and it's really, it bugs the
[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:31.360]   heck out of me.
[01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:35.720]   Yes, they have a billboard style list, right?
[01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:37.720]   The top podcasts.
[01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:43.960]   That is a simple count of the number of times that subscribe button is pressed.
[01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:50.240]   And it heavily waits, if not 100% waits, nobody's really sure the last few weeks.
[01:51:50.240 --> 01:51:54.360]   So for instance, and I think if you looked at that, you would assume all the number one
[01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:58.720]   podcast, which is always this American life, by the way, the number one podcast must have
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:01.240]   more listeners than the number one hundred podcast.
[01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:02.240]   That's not necessarily true.
[01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:06.280]   In fact, it's not true because I know because I know what my numbers are.
[01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:07.280]   Right.
[01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:08.280]   Because it's a subscription relationship.
[01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:09.280]   It's not a pop music.
[01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:11.280]   It's like a whole relationship.
[01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:14.880]   And how many times a subscribe button was pressed this week, basically?
[01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:15.880]   Right.
[01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:19.200]   And Apple also MP3, you know, podcasts are MP3 downloads, basically.
[01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:20.200]   They're file downloads.
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:24.880]   And what Apple does not seem to be doing in their podcast app or in iTunes is radioing
[01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:30.480]   back like where you are in the file or that you got to the end or that you listen to the
[01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:31.480]   ad.
[01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:32.480]   Advertisers would like that.
[01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:33.480]   They would love that.
[01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:36.000]   But no podcast was an information.
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:37.800]   I'm not sure the listeners want that either.
[01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:38.920]   And that's the bigger issue.
[01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:41.840]   I know my listeners don't want us track you.
[01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:45.960]   You don't want us tracking how much of the show you listen to.
[01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:49.840]   You don't want us to know that information or more demographic information about you.
[01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:50.840]   We don't want to know that.
[01:52:50.840 --> 01:52:53.200]   And I don't want to be the position of asking Apple for that.
[01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:55.440]   And I don't think Apple wants to be a position of collecting that.
[01:52:55.440 --> 01:52:56.440]   Right.
[01:52:56.440 --> 01:52:58.800]   The other people actually ask you for that to be advertisers.
[01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:01.240]   I don't think Apple wants to be in the business of it.
[01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:03.640]   And I don't want Apple to be in the business of it.
[01:53:03.640 --> 01:53:09.440]   But at the same time, I do want that information.
[01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:12.800]   I want to know where my listeners are.
[01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:17.560]   I want to know what people are actually paying attention to more and more.
[01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:19.760]   Now, with iTunes, you're absolutely right.
[01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:21.560]   It's a podcast directory.
[01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:24.360]   So I get that information from elsewhere.
[01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:31.360]   The one thing I would like to see from, I go back and forth on this, but I often find
[01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:38.160]   myself wanting more of a connection with the people watching on iTunes or listening on
[01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:39.160]   iTunes.
[01:53:39.160 --> 01:53:45.240]   Because, you know, if even a simple kind of social commenting system or something like
[01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:52.600]   that, but then I always come down to the fact that that's not how people use iTunes.
[01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:55.960]   It is purely a grab and go system.
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:56.960]   Right.
[01:53:56.960 --> 01:54:05.160]   I mean, I can see where other platforms, other podcasters and big companies are wanting that
[01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:09.080]   because I often find myself like, I can't get to the people watching on iTunes.
[01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:13.160]   I would just point out that that's what screwed up the web.
[01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:20.440]   And that desire for blogs to know everything about you is what created ad tech and what
[01:54:20.440 --> 01:54:23.160]   created ad blockers.
[01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:26.720]   And this is not a arms race that I want to get into.
[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:29.200]   And I think any reasonable podcaster would want to get into.
[01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:34.680]   We do surveys every year and if people want to participate, they can.
[01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:35.960]   And that's all we need to know.
[01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:37.560]   We don't even really need to know much.
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:40.400]   We actually decided our next survey to ask far fewer questions.
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:42.680]   We don't need to know, you know, that much.
[01:54:42.680 --> 01:54:47.520]   We just like to know a little demographic information in general because advertisers
[01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:48.520]   would like that.
[01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:49.520]   But we do not want to get.
[01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:55.280]   And Marco says this, we don't want to get in the situation where advertisers know whether
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:55:00.400]   you as a podcast listener search for a new refrigerator yesterday or whether you listen
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:03.560]   to ads or whether you listen to it at all.
[01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:10.200]   Big publishers and advertisers might want this, but I can tell you right now, this is
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:12.960]   exactly what we as users don't want, right?
[01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:13.960]   Right.
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:18.360]   And we don't want to require, for instance, as I think some would, oh, you have to use
[01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:22.560]   the iTunes player so that Apple can then just give us information about whether how many
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:24.960]   people heard it add three.
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:30.120]   Well, some, some podcasters have decided, I would argue they're not podcasters anymore
[01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:33.320]   when they do this, but like they built their own ad or their own app and they're like,
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:35.120]   you have to listen in our app.
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:36.120]   Yeah.
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:39.080]   And I feel like some of the motivation of them going to Apple and talking about this is like
[01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:41.920]   Apple's podcast app and iTunes are so big.
[01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:43.640]   Why can't your app do this for us?
[01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:44.920]   It's an open system, right?
[01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:46.080]   It's totally open.
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:50.920]   And so as long as Apple is just letting people listen to podcasts and not measuring everything
[01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:56.100]   they do, it will be very hard for them to get a really good, you know, control of the
[01:55:56.100 --> 01:55:57.600]   data of podcast listening.
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:55:59.440]   And so they're like, no, no, help us out here.
[01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:02.840]   And I, this is one of those cases where Apple's actually been a very good steward of podcasting.
[01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:03.840]   Yes.
[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:04.840]   They haven't always been super engaged.
[01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:05.840]   Because they've been hands off.
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:07.240]   But maybe that's all a good thing, right?
[01:56:07.240 --> 01:56:11.680]   Ever since 2005 or whenever they put this in, they just sort of keep the directory there.
[01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:15.020]   They did roll out some new features for podcast publishers in the last few weeks.
[01:56:15.020 --> 01:56:20.800]   You can now get access to your iTunes information on the backend and change it and add podcasts
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:24.400]   and things, which previously was sort of a secret that only a few people had access
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:25.400]   to.
[01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:26.400]   And that's good.
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:30.320]   But you know, it is, it is unappled like in a lot of ways because they're basically
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:32.660]   just, you know, they don't serve any of the content.
[01:56:32.660 --> 01:56:35.680]   All they do is provide the directory and it's pretty good.
[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:39.760]   So do you think, if I could jump real quick, I mean, do you think all of that is basically
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:45.220]   because up until now, podcasts were not really a big business?
[01:56:45.220 --> 01:56:50.940]   I mean, I feel like in the last year or two is when podcasts really became a more mainstream
[01:56:50.940 --> 01:56:55.860]   thing versus a, you know, niche, niche thing, I suppose.
[01:56:55.860 --> 01:57:01.060]   And maybe I'm, my ignorance is showing here and that that's kind of when I started getting
[01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:02.940]   involved in podcasts or listening to them.
[01:57:02.940 --> 01:57:06.660]   But do you think that now that it's like, hey, this could actually be a business, all
[01:57:06.660 --> 01:57:12.060]   of a sudden there's a need and a realization that we need to be able to know who's listening,
[01:57:12.060 --> 01:57:14.600]   how long they're listening in order to make the business.
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:22.760]   Well, I could tell you, and by the way, you know, the New York Times says, I think there's
[01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:28.000]   some funny that the business is worth, what do they say, an advertising business and podcasting
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000]   is worth something like, what do they say, $57 million.
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:36.960]   And if that's true, then I actually own 25% of all the podcasts written in the world,
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:38.040]   that it is a good business.
[01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:39.920]   It's been a very good business for us.
[01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:44.640]   And as one, as one of the actual large podcasters and one of the few people making money in
[01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:48.960]   this business, the last thing we want to do, and I am with you, Marco, if you're listening,
[01:57:48.960 --> 01:57:57.760]   I am so with you is to, in his last sentences, in his blog post, is let big data and the
[01:57:57.760 --> 01:58:03.800]   desire to make money off of podcasts due to podcasts, what it did to the web.
[01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:05.000]   This is not where we're going.
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:08.560]   And I could promise all of our listeners that we will never go that way.
[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:10.520]   And we do just fine.
[01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:15.360]   Thank you, without using big data and spying on you and keeping track of you.
[01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:18.760]   And I bet you, Jason, you would agree that this is not the direction you would want to
[01:58:18.760 --> 01:58:19.760]   go with.
[01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:21.000]   It's an open system right now.
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:25.320]   I mean, the last thing I want to do as a podcaster is end up having to work with a bunch
[01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:29.720]   of huge providers that are going to use my data and take advantage of it.
[01:58:29.720 --> 01:58:31.760]   And that's really what people are asking for here.
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:36.360]   And also, yeah, we can see what's happened to the web when the model was give everything
[01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:38.960]   away and measure everything.
[01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:39.960]   And you actually lose.
[01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:43.000]   And it's not just like we're trying to get away with something.
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:44.000]   That's not the case.
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:47.760]   There's a lot of stuff that gets devalued when you only measure things the way that
[01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:49.040]   web ads are measured.
[01:58:49.040 --> 01:58:52.880]   And you know, when you look at TV ads or print ads or billboard ads, there are lots of ads
[01:58:52.880 --> 01:58:56.400]   that are not directly measurable, you use indirect means to do it.
[01:58:56.400 --> 01:59:00.100]   And those businesses are, you know, relevant advertising businesses.
[01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:03.760]   Not everything needs to be a text link that you click on and get a referral link on.
[01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:10.520]   I definitely fear the, you know, the direction that we're going where people put more attention
[01:59:10.520 --> 01:59:16.320]   on on those numbers than the actual effectiveness that it happens across social, you know, everybody's
[01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:19.440]   only you have, you have two million social media followers.
[01:59:19.440 --> 01:59:20.440]   Awesome.
[01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:22.200]   But what's the effectiveness of it?
[01:59:22.200 --> 01:59:28.080]   We have to spend more effort pushing that and Leo, you do that wonderfully, you know,
[01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:33.000]   but then then any kind of number based system.
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:37.880]   But I am kind of curious from, since we're talking about kind of ads and retargeting
[01:59:37.880 --> 01:59:43.600]   and all of that stuff from the audience and from you guys's perspective.
[01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:49.640]   When I'm as much as I want my privacy protected, I also appreciate when I see an ad that's
[01:59:49.640 --> 01:59:52.960]   specific to what I want.
[01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:57.160]   Like I don't actually pay any attention to ads until, right?
[01:59:57.160 --> 01:59:59.360]   I mean, that's just not an aspect of paying.
[01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:03.280]   No, in fact, so much advertising is wasted because it's advertising to somebody who has
[02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:05.320]   never going to be buying that product.
[02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:06.320]   Right.
[02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:11.600]   And I guess, I mean, if we go with what, you know, we've all done for years, it's based
[02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:17.920]   on the host and the producer to decide to talk to the audience and decide, you know, what
[02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:18.920]   ads are most relevant.
[02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:22.000]   You know, we do something and I think you do the same thing.
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.240]   I know Jason does this up.
[02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:26.800]   That's very different from the traditional model, which is we try to bring advertisers
[02:00:26.800 --> 02:00:28.440]   to people that we know our audience wants.
[02:00:28.440 --> 02:00:31.640]   And we know our audience because we're niche broadcasters.
[02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:36.800]   Although I guess I'm a bigger than I thought because according to New York Times, there
[02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:39.600]   are 46 million Americans listen to podcasts each month.
[02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:44.440]   And since we have 12 million, I think we actually have a large share of the podcast.
[02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:45.440]   Congratulations.
[02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:46.440]   Good work.
[02:00:46.440 --> 02:00:47.440]   These numbers are wrong.
[02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:48.440]   They're just wrong.
[02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:50.840]   And it's all because you nailed it.
[02:00:50.840 --> 02:01:01.560]   It's serial and gimlet and all of these New York focused and X NPR people who are unfortunately
[02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:04.800]   not, they are not the podcasting is a grassroots movement.
[02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:05.800]   It's not.
[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:07.360]   I can try to channel them a little bit.
[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:12.320]   I get what they're saying in the sense that right now it's very hard to get even consistent
[02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:17.400]   numbers in terms of like what's a download, what's a listen, what's what's your subscriber
[02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:18.400]   base?
[02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:19.400]   How is that calculated?
[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:23.360]   And I get trying to find out NPR people have been trying to do that.
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:26.320]   They made a document that's like, here's what we think.
[02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:29.320]   Lister ship should be defined as and it's a new medium that's going to happen.
[02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:30.320]   I get that.
[02:01:30.320 --> 02:01:35.520]   I just I kind of can't get the idea that they're saying, you know, hey, Apple, why don't you
[02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:37.640]   come in here and be heavy handed?
[02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:39.120]   Stop it with this light touch.
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:43.480]   Why don't you just take control like you did with the music industry and with the.
[02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:44.480]   Please.
[02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:45.480]   That's a terrible idea.
[02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:47.520]   50 shades of podcasts.
[02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:50.160]   Please take me, Mr. Apple.
[02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:56.480]   They talk with a woman from a podcast called call your girlfriend.
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:01:59.680]   And she says with data like listener counts and listening duration, similar to what Apple
[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:02.360]   provides app developers, the industry could accelerate quickly.
[02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:03.360]   Oh, good.
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:05.440]   Can you imagine that?
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:15.080]   The benefit of how iTunes is structured is that you as a podcast producer can drive traffic
[02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:19.800]   to your own properties and not be owned by a YouTube or something.
[02:02:19.800 --> 02:02:25.160]   So I mean, you can you can still drive traffic regardless of what platform you're on.
[02:02:25.160 --> 02:02:28.600]   But if they go down, you go down if you if you put all your eggs there.
[02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:29.600]   Yeah.
[02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:30.600]   And what we really don't want.
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:34.640]   And of course, Marco, who has some experience with the app store, we really don't want Apple
[02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:36.840]   to create an app store experience out of podcasting.
[02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:37.840]   Yeah.
[02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:40.280]   That is really not the right way to go.
[02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:41.440]   Podcasting is free.
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:42.440]   Anybody can do it.
[02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:43.960]   They don't need to go to a particular provider.
[02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:47.440]   You put up your feed, you put up your files, people can find you in the iTunes directory
[02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:50.880]   and the Google Play directory and other places.
[02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:53.080]   And it's a pretty great thing right now.
[02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:59.560]   And I feel I fear we're hippies and that and that wall streets are coming.
[02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:04.480]   I think it's I think it's actually because I because we teach online video and stuff
[02:03:04.480 --> 02:03:10.320]   to people just getting into it because we've been around for from around this world for
[02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:11.800]   so long.
[02:03:11.800 --> 02:03:18.840]   People just getting into it, they find iTunes extremely confusing because it's not like
[02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:19.840]   YouTube.
[02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:21.640]   It's not like Facebook.
[02:03:21.640 --> 02:03:25.480]   With those, it's very simple to figure out, okay, you create a channel and you upload your
[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:28.200]   stuff there, they take care of all the hosting.
[02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:33.760]   And then you go to iTunes and you want to be there, you know, from that perspective,
[02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:37.880]   it's actually very confusing from a platform stance.
[02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:40.960]   So, so Steve Wilson, I know you listen.
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:42.480]   Jason and I, we love you.
[02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:44.280]   Keep up the good work at iTunes.
[02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:45.280]   Yeah.
[02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:48.160]   And don't listen to whatever those people you brought in told you.
[02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:51.200]   We don't want we like what you're doing just fine.
[02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:52.200]   Just keep it the way it is.
[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:53.200]   Awesome work.
[02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:54.200]   You know them too.
[02:03:54.200 --> 02:04:00.680]   Apple has done done right by podcasters for a long time in terms of being open.
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:04.640]   And I'm not saying like kickbacks, I'm saying like they're open to whoever and have really
[02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:08.400]   embraced that they're that the next great podcast can come from anywhere.
[02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:11.520]   I like Steve from somebody who used to work at a public radio station.
[02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:13.240]   I like Steve's boss James box too.
[02:04:13.240 --> 02:04:14.720]   He's a nice, he's a really nice guy.
[02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:16.760]   And I feel for those guys because they're in the New York Times.
[02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:19.840]   All of a sudden they got a whole bunch of email coming their way.
[02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:22.680]   Hey, I have a podcast.
[02:04:22.680 --> 02:04:26.080]   Maybe you can help me.
[02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:31.000]   Let's take a break and we'll wrap this up with some light airy fluffy stories to leave
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:32.920]   you with a one to cat.
[02:04:32.920 --> 02:04:33.920]   Kitty cat.
[02:04:33.920 --> 02:04:35.880]   So wonderful taste in your mouth.
[02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:36.880]   That's the, that's the deal.
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:37.880]   I want to talk about stamps.com.
[02:04:37.880 --> 02:04:41.280]   Somebody in the chat room said, I'm a 59 year old white male.
[02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:42.560]   There's nothing you could advertise.
[02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:43.560]   I'd be interested in.
[02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:44.560]   I bet this is.
[02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:50.680]   Do you ever as your business, you mail brochures bills, do you send out, you know, packages?
[02:04:50.680 --> 02:04:54.400]   Do you do you sell on Etsy or eBay or Amazon?
[02:04:54.400 --> 02:04:55.880]   And you're using the postal service.
[02:04:55.880 --> 02:04:58.240]   I got so much of a better way to do it.
[02:04:58.240 --> 02:04:59.240]   Stamps.com.
[02:04:59.240 --> 02:05:05.640]   It's, it's, it's everything the post office brings you without leaving your desk.
[02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:10.400]   So it starts by, of course, buying and printing official postage from your desk using your
[02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:11.440]   computer and printer.
[02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:17.800]   No postage meter, your computer and your printer, but it gets even better because with stamps,
[02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:20.520]   a post office loves stamps.com.
[02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:21.960]   And with stamps.com, you get discounts.
[02:05:21.960 --> 02:05:23.960]   You can't get at the post office.
[02:05:23.960 --> 02:05:28.600]   You can use their digital scale to make sure you have exactly the right postage on any kind
[02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:35.840]   of postage, whether it's a media mail or a box or an envelope or a postcard.
[02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:39.600]   You can, you, it's just awesome with stamps.com.
[02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:41.400]   I walk you through it.
[02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:46.080]   You get to, you get to go to stamps.com, click on the microphone on the right and or to it,
[02:05:46.080 --> 02:05:49.280]   you're going to get the stamps.com kind of no risk trial offer.
[02:05:49.280 --> 02:05:52.800]   That includes that digital scale right there, the USB scale.
[02:05:52.800 --> 02:05:54.120]   You get a $5 supply kit.
[02:05:54.120 --> 02:05:56.680]   You get $55 in free postage too.
[02:05:56.680 --> 02:06:00.920]   So you plug the scale into the USB port, you log into your account, you click on print
[02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:05.160]   posters at the top of the page, you could print on plain paper, you could be right on
[02:06:05.160 --> 02:06:08.200]   an envelope with your company logo, the return address.
[02:06:08.200 --> 02:06:10.720]   You could print a stamps.com label that you slap on the package.
[02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:12.200]   It looks pro.
[02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:14.480]   It looks great.
[02:06:14.480 --> 02:06:16.040]   You know exactly what the item weighs.
[02:06:16.040 --> 02:06:17.400]   You know exactly how much postage.
[02:06:17.400 --> 02:06:21.280]   You know, and by the way, stamps will suggest mailing options, all classes of mail, including
[02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:25.560]   certified mail, and tell you how much it's going to cost and you choose.
[02:06:25.560 --> 02:06:26.560]   It's so awesome.
[02:06:26.560 --> 02:06:29.280]   And then the mail carrier comes and picks it up and takes it.
[02:06:29.280 --> 02:06:30.920]   You never got up.
[02:06:30.920 --> 02:06:32.920]   It takes all the guess where you got a getting postage.
[02:06:32.920 --> 02:06:35.840]   It is a better way and it makes you look more professional.
[02:06:35.840 --> 02:06:36.840]   That's really important.
[02:06:36.840 --> 02:06:41.920]   If you're an Etsy seller, an eBay seller, an Amazon seller, you got, you will look pro.
[02:06:41.920 --> 02:06:44.600]   And it's saving you time and money.
[02:06:44.600 --> 02:06:45.600]   Go to stamps.com.
[02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:48.000]   Again, click the microphone, use the promo code TWIT.
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:49.840]   You're going to get the four week trial.
[02:06:49.840 --> 02:06:51.760]   You're going to get the $110 bonus offer.
[02:06:51.760 --> 02:06:53.680]   That includes the postage and the scale.
[02:06:53.680 --> 02:06:55.680]   That is a much better deal than on the front page.
[02:06:55.680 --> 02:06:56.680]   So make sure you do that.
[02:06:56.680 --> 02:07:01.360]   Click the microphone and use the offer code TWIT at stamps.com.
[02:07:01.360 --> 02:07:03.600]   We use it all the time.
[02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:07.520]   That actually was Carly showing off the stamps scale.
[02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:08.520]   Have you been following?
[02:07:08.520 --> 02:07:13.120]   Anybody follow the Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto soap opera?
[02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:15.520]   I'm just loving this.
[02:07:15.520 --> 02:07:17.200]   Just loving this.
[02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:21.360]   Dr. Craig Wright says, "I'm Satoshi."
[02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:22.360]   Yep.
[02:07:22.360 --> 02:07:23.360]   Yep.
[02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:24.360]   I am, really.
[02:07:24.360 --> 02:07:31.800]   And I'm going to prove it by posting a screenshot of some Unix code, Linux code.
[02:07:31.800 --> 02:07:33.400]   That'll prove it.
[02:07:33.400 --> 02:07:39.280]   And maybe I'll cut and paste a cryptographic signature from somewhere else that looks really
[02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:41.120]   real.
[02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:45.640]   And the sad thing is the economist and BBC kind of fell for it.
[02:07:45.640 --> 02:07:50.560]   And probably because Gavin and Driesen, who is the, was the former director, I've interviewed
[02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:53.160]   him on triangulation, former director of the Bitcoin Institute.
[02:07:53.160 --> 02:07:57.560]   And one of the few people who corresponded with the actual Satoshi Nakamoto some time
[02:07:57.560 --> 02:08:03.800]   ago and when Nakamoto dropped out of site in 2011, took over for him to run Bitcoin,
[02:08:03.800 --> 02:08:07.680]   said, "Oh yeah, Satoshi, I recognize him anywhere."
[02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:09.880]   I think Gavin's backed off a little bit.
[02:08:09.880 --> 02:08:12.600]   He's the chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation.
[02:08:12.600 --> 02:08:17.160]   And Dan Kaminski, one of our favorite hackers, wrote a great article.
[02:08:17.160 --> 02:08:19.520]   He was a little puzzled.
[02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:22.960]   So he emailed Gavin and said, "What's going on here?
[02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:27.920]   There's clear unambiguous cryptographic evidence of fraud.
[02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:31.480]   And you're lending credibility to the idea that a public key operation could, should,
[02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:33.080]   or must remain private."
[02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:39.320]   So even though oddly, Gavin did not post this on his blog, he responded to Dan Kaminski,
[02:08:39.320 --> 02:08:40.840]   he said, "Yeah, what the heck?
[02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:44.960]   I was surprised by the proof is anyone and yet I don't know exactly what's going on."
[02:08:44.960 --> 02:08:48.480]   It was a mistake to agree to publish my post before I saw his.
[02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:51.000]   I assumed his post would simply be a signed message.
[02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:54.520]   I think it verified it wasn't.
[02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:56.480]   So he's backed down a little bit.
[02:08:56.480 --> 02:08:59.920]   The whole thing was just another one of those stories like Newsweek's story a couple of
[02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:01.520]   years ago saying, "We found him."
[02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:03.720]   No one's found him.
[02:09:03.720 --> 02:09:06.760]   Mostly because it'd be very easy to prove he were Satoshi Nakamoto.
[02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:09.880]   He's just got to spend one of those bits on one of his first block.
[02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:10.880]   Yep.
[02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:13.080]   And Craig Wright can't do it.
[02:09:13.080 --> 02:09:18.440]   So by my, Craig, he's by the way, he's fled the country.
[02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:20.960]   He was in Australia and he was fled the country because he's being investigated by the bank.
[02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:21.960]   He's by Australian tax.
[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:22.960]   Sorry.
[02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:23.960]   Oh, there.
[02:09:23.960 --> 02:09:24.960]   Okay.
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:25.960]   Yeah.
[02:09:25.960 --> 02:09:26.960]   Goodbye.
[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:27.960]   Where is that?
[02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:28.960]   Is that Gavin's blog?
[02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:29.960]   It's Craig's blog.
[02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:31.480]   He says, "I'm sorry.
[02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:32.720]   I believe that I could do this.
[02:09:32.720 --> 02:09:36.480]   I believe that I could put the years of anonymity and hiding behind me.
[02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:37.680]   Classic con man.
[02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:38.840]   Never admit.
[02:09:38.840 --> 02:09:40.000]   Never admit guilt.
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:43.680]   But as the events of this week and folded, I prepared to publish the proof of access to
[02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:46.040]   the earliest keys I broke.
[02:09:46.040 --> 02:09:47.280]   I don't have the courage.
[02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:49.640]   I can't do it.
[02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:53.800]   When the rumors began, my qualifications and character were attacked.
[02:09:53.800 --> 02:09:56.960]   When those allegations were proven false, new allegations have already begun.
[02:09:56.960 --> 02:09:58.880]   I know now I am not strong enough for this.
[02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:00.520]   Oh, that's it.
[02:10:00.520 --> 02:10:01.520]   It's not that I can't do it.
[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:03.400]   I'm just not strong enough.
[02:10:03.400 --> 02:10:06.800]   I know that this weakness will cause great damage to those that have supported me, particularly
[02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:12.040]   with John and Gavin and I can only hope that their honor and credibility is not as reblasted
[02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:13.040]   tainted by their ashes.
[02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:14.040]   They were not deceived.
[02:10:14.040 --> 02:10:16.520]   I know the world will never believe that now.
[02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:19.960]   I can only say I'm sorry and goodbye.
[02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:20.960]   Oh, man.
[02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:21.960]   Good.
[02:10:21.960 --> 02:10:23.560]   I didn't see that.
[02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:24.960]   Thank you for pulling that up, Jason.
[02:10:24.960 --> 02:10:26.440]   I hadn't seen his.
[02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:27.840]   Oh, I could do it.
[02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:33.240]   I really I could, but I'm not going to.
[02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:34.240]   Okay.
[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:40.080]   Little, little light comedy.
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:42.800]   Anything else you guys want to talk about before we wrap this thing up?
[02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:44.800]   I think you're flagging.
[02:10:44.800 --> 02:10:48.160]   Cats, kitty cats, cats, context.
[02:10:48.160 --> 02:10:49.760]   You want to know how I do that?
[02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:50.760]   That's with context.
[02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:52.760]   Curated cats with context.
[02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:55.320]   contribute.google.com.
[02:10:55.320 --> 02:10:56.320]   Everybody should do this.
[02:10:56.320 --> 02:10:58.080]   This is a this is a good solution.
[02:10:58.080 --> 02:11:00.000]   Oh, nice.
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:01.000]   Never mind.
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000]   Well, we've done all we can.
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:04.000]   We've done all we can.
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:05.000]   The internet is over.
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:06.080]   Obviously it's contribute.
[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:08.560]   It's Google.com/contribute.
[02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:11.280]   If this is wrong, then I'm just going home.
[02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:12.280]   I'm sorry.
[02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:13.280]   I don't have the strength to go on.
[02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:16.280]   I believe in what I was doing.
[02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:19.160]   But apparently you don't.
[02:11:19.160 --> 02:11:20.400]   What the heck?
[02:11:20.400 --> 02:11:22.120]   Is it gone?
[02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:23.400]   Am I getting it wrong?
[02:11:23.400 --> 02:11:24.400]   Contributor.
[02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:25.400]   Contributor.
[02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:26.400]   Thank you.
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:33.680]   Anyway, the idea is you see fewer ads and you support the sites you visit.
[02:11:33.680 --> 02:11:34.680]   Is recode one of these?
[02:11:34.680 --> 02:11:36.920]   I think it might be because I think I see kitty cats.
[02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:37.920]   I don't know.
[02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:38.920]   I'm curious.
[02:11:38.920 --> 02:11:40.640]   I wish I'd I wish I did know.
[02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:41.640]   Yeah.
[02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:42.640]   But sorry.
[02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:44.480]   It doesn't have to be kitty cats.
[02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:47.880]   But I happen to choose kitty cats.
[02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:52.000]   So you see I've contributed 10 bucks and I've only spent 77 cents.
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.440]   They give you the money back at the end of the month if you haven't spent it.
[02:11:54.440 --> 02:11:56.400]   That's because I'm running an ad blocker too.
[02:11:56.400 --> 02:11:57.400]   Whoops.
[02:11:57.400 --> 02:11:58.400]   Whoops.
[02:11:58.400 --> 02:11:59.480]   Shouldn't do that.
[02:11:59.480 --> 02:12:04.520]   These are all the sites that get a little bit of money every time I visit them.
[02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:10.880]   And then in your settings, you can choose instead of the ads what you'd like to see.
[02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:12.160]   And I choose kitty cats.
[02:12:12.160 --> 02:12:13.160]   But it doesn't have to be.
[02:12:13.160 --> 02:12:14.160]   It could be anything.
[02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:16.440]   See, wouldn't you wouldn't you like that, Kelly?
[02:12:16.440 --> 02:12:17.440]   I would.
[02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:18.440]   I would very much like that.
[02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:19.440]   So here's your choice.
[02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:24.320]   You can replace ads with neutral transparent or kitty cats.
[02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:26.240]   Well, why wouldn't you choose kitty cats?
[02:12:26.240 --> 02:12:27.240]   Not.
[02:12:27.240 --> 02:12:31.360]   You actually can provide your own image if you wish.
[02:12:31.360 --> 02:12:32.880]   But uh, well, what's the fun in that?
[02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:34.360]   I mean, they're random cats, right?
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:35.360]   It's not like this thing.
[02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:36.360]   Oh, it's different every time.
[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:37.360]   It's awesome.
[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:38.360]   Yeah.
[02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:41.040]   And it's really good on mobile.
[02:12:41.040 --> 02:12:45.360]   Because you know, for some reason, sites with mobile with ads are worse on mobile.
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:46.360]   They're just ads everywhere.
[02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:48.800]   And then I get kitty cats everywhere.
[02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:49.800]   Highly recommended.
[02:12:49.800 --> 02:12:52.600]   Make your day.
[02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:57.040]   Silicon Valley engineering interns make good money interns.
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:12:59.200]   These are not employees.
[02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:06.960]   The average intern in Silicon Valley makes $81,000 a year according to Rodney Foltz who's
[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:10.440]   going to be an internet yelps.
[02:13:10.440 --> 02:13:14.960]   Almost twice with the average wages in the United States.
[02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:18.960]   So get an engineering degree.
[02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:22.280]   My son, I'm glad to say, is going to be a Silicon Valley intern this week.
[02:13:22.280 --> 02:13:23.880]   This is over the summer.
[02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:24.880]   Very happy.
[02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:25.880]   Smart man.
[02:13:25.880 --> 02:13:27.880]   Smart man.
[02:13:27.880 --> 02:13:30.360]   Uh, I think he's, I think he's, he's gunning for Patreon.
[02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:32.440]   I think he wants to work at Patreon.
[02:13:32.440 --> 02:13:33.840]   And I think he, I think he's going to do that.
[02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:35.560]   I think I sent him a note.
[02:13:35.560 --> 02:13:39.560]   Sent Jack a note saying, Hey, all right, I think we're, I think we're done.
[02:13:39.560 --> 02:13:42.800]   I think I've used up all your energy, all your resources.
[02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:43.800]   Your blood sugar is low.
[02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:45.880]   All our cats, all the cats and on.
[02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:46.880]   Send chocolate.
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:48.720]   Send chocolate fast and gator.
[02:13:48.720 --> 02:13:49.480]   I warned you Kurt.
[02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:51.880]   I warned you.
[02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:54.800]   It's great to have you Kurt Wagner from recode, recode.net.
[02:13:54.800 --> 02:13:55.960]   What are you covering this week?
[02:13:55.960 --> 02:13:57.760]   What are you looking at?
[02:13:57.760 --> 02:14:02.920]   Uh, you know, I actually have a big story set to, to run tomorrow morning in honor of
[02:14:02.920 --> 02:14:05.080]   our new design and our new layout.
[02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:06.720]   Oh, but you're not going to tell us.
[02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:09.520]   I can't say a lot, but it's uh, top secrets.
[02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:16.120]   It's on my beat, which is um, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, social media, that stuff.
[02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:18.080]   And it's, it's, I'm very excited.
[02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:19.560]   I've been working on it for quite a while.
[02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:20.560]   So nice.
[02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:21.560]   Yeah.
[02:14:21.560 --> 02:14:22.760]   Do they ever have you on the podcast?
[02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:24.800]   They ever let you do the podcast or just just care.
[02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:25.800]   Just hog the whole thing.
[02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:26.800]   Ha ha.
[02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:31.880]   You know, she likes to, she likes to let people guess how I actually um, hosted my first
[02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:36.960]   episode, but it hasn't, it hasn't uh, been produced yet, but um, it was just last week
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:40.760]   I, I chatted with a man by the name of Maverick Carter.
[02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:45.440]   He's the business mind, uh, the business and branding mind behind LeBron James.
[02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:46.440]   Oh, see.
[02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:47.440]   It was fascinating.
[02:14:47.440 --> 02:14:51.840]   It was kind of a sports business, sports business, uh, marketing conversation.
[02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:54.760]   And we taped it last week and hopefully it'll go up in the next week or two.
[02:14:54.760 --> 02:14:56.240]   Boy, is that in your wheelhouse?
[02:14:56.240 --> 02:14:57.440]   Uh, it was great.
[02:14:57.440 --> 02:14:58.800]   I was, I was pushing for it.
[02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:02.080]   And Carret calls it every sport is sports ball.
[02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:03.080]   So yeah.
[02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:04.080]   Yeah.
[02:15:04.080 --> 02:15:06.680]   So uh, she was more than happy, I think to, to pass this one over to me.
[02:15:06.680 --> 02:15:11.400]   So importantly, is she going to get another, uh, cameo in Silicon Valley this year?
[02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:12.800]   That's a good, that's a good question.
[02:15:12.800 --> 02:15:14.200]   I actually don't think so.
[02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:15.760]   I think it's Calla Canis this time.
[02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:20.160]   Yeah, I don't think she's, I don't think she's in this season, uh, but a handful of
[02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:21.840]   us got to go to the, uh, premiere.
[02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:22.840]   Oh, fun.
[02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:23.840]   Oh, did you go to that?
[02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:24.840]   How did you get a ticket to that?
[02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:26.000]   I wanted to go to that.
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:27.000]   Yeah.
[02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:28.000]   That looked like fun.
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:29.480]   I got to know the right people.
[02:15:29.480 --> 02:15:30.480]   Right people.
[02:15:30.480 --> 02:15:31.480]   I guess.
[02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:33.480]   I'm interviewing Dan Lyons tomorrow and trying.
[02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:34.480]   Yeah.
[02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:35.480]   He's one of the writers.
[02:15:35.480 --> 02:15:38.160]   You'd think I'm going to, I'm going to put him on the spot tomorrow next year.
[02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:39.160]   You'll get a go then.
[02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:41.880]   Sounds like where was my ticket to the, the premiere?
[02:15:41.880 --> 02:15:45.400]   It's still a good show and that, that I just love it.
[02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:46.400]   Yeah.
[02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:49.440]   Somebody was saying after last week's episode, it was too real.
[02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:54.040]   It was actually, it was like, uh, you know, with the, with the CEO who's saying, you know,
[02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:55.920]   we're going to, we're going to take your, we're going to pivot.
[02:15:55.920 --> 02:15:56.920]   We're going B2B now.
[02:15:56.920 --> 02:15:57.920]   Right.
[02:15:57.920 --> 02:15:58.920]   It was like, oh, this is painful.
[02:15:58.920 --> 02:15:59.920]   I've been there.
[02:15:59.920 --> 02:16:01.920]   I can't, can't watch.
[02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:07.200]   Recode.net Jason.
[02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:08.200]   Yeah.
[02:16:08.200 --> 02:16:09.200]   You can find him.
[02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:11.000]   Pod for Ham, which is all about Hamilton.
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:12.000]   Yeah.
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:13.000]   We got that.
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:16.040]   We got a little song about that, uh, that, uh, Feinstein Burr bill.
[02:16:16.040 --> 02:16:18.440]   Like, you know, if it isn't Feinstein Burr's.
[02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:19.440]   Sure.
[02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:20.440]   We'll work on it.
[02:16:20.440 --> 02:16:21.440]   We're sure.
[02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:22.440]   That's good.
[02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:23.440]   I like it.
[02:16:23.440 --> 02:16:24.440]   You and me.
[02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:25.440]   Well, it'll be a duet.
[02:16:25.440 --> 02:16:26.440]   I call in Manuel.
[02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:27.440]   30est duet ever.
[02:16:27.440 --> 02:16:29.160]   Uh, of course six colors.com.
[02:16:29.160 --> 02:16:30.160]   Yep.
[02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:31.160]   Great to see you.
[02:16:31.160 --> 02:16:32.320]   Always a pleasure.
[02:16:32.320 --> 02:16:37.920]   And my dearest, my sweetest, my most wonderful friend, Luria Petrucci, is so good to see
[02:16:37.920 --> 02:16:38.920]   you doing so well.
[02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:39.920]   Thank you.
[02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:43.680]   And the, and the humidity in Portland is great for your hair.
[02:16:43.680 --> 02:16:44.680]   All that rain.
[02:16:44.680 --> 02:16:47.280]   And you want to just weather up here.
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:48.280]   It's been awesome.
[02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:49.280]   Yeah.
[02:16:49.280 --> 02:16:50.280]   Yeah.
[02:16:50.280 --> 02:16:51.280]   Yeah.
[02:16:51.280 --> 02:16:52.280]   Nice.
[02:16:52.280 --> 02:16:53.280]   That's great.

[02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:17.560]   So that's a 10-inch emissivity.
[02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:20.840]   And it's just Facebook.com/GeeksLifeNet.
[02:17:20.840 --> 02:17:23.680]   So I don't do enough live video.
[02:17:23.680 --> 02:17:25.680]   I want to do more.
[02:17:25.680 --> 02:17:30.960]   I told, I've told, you know what, my, I actually have a killer idea.
[02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:32.160]   And I've told people this before.
[02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:34.000]   So I won't belabor it.
[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:39.440]   But you know, I ordered that Mivo camera that marked demo of F8, the camera that kind
[02:17:39.440 --> 02:17:42.200]   of follows you automatically.
[02:17:42.200 --> 02:17:43.200]   You don't need a switcher.
[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:46.120]   You could switch on the iPhone, but it also will follow you around.
[02:17:46.120 --> 02:17:49.520]   And I figured out, I was thinking, what can I do with this and YouTube video?
[02:17:49.520 --> 02:17:52.480]   And I'm going to do hot tub tech machine.
[02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:56.640]   And if you would like to come be my guest in the hot tub anytime.
[02:17:56.640 --> 02:17:59.840]   Hot tub tech machine.
[02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:01.840]   Hot tub tech machine.
[02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:05.080]   Join Leo in his hot tub talking about tech.
[02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:06.080]   Oh boy.
[02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:08.800]   It's a good show.
[02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:09.800]   That's from the pilot.
[02:18:09.800 --> 02:18:10.800]   Nice.
[02:18:10.800 --> 02:18:12.920]   I did learn a lesson from the pilot.
[02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:13.920]   We're trunks.
[02:18:13.920 --> 02:18:16.760]   Just I'm just saying it wasn't from now on.
[02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:18.760]   And camera from the steam.
[02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:19.760]   Good life lesson.
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:20.760]   Yeah.
[02:18:20.760 --> 02:18:22.440]   You want to make sure you keep that camera far from the steam and use the camera.
[02:18:22.440 --> 02:18:25.480]   The Mivo app in order to switch in.
[02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:27.480]   No, don't zoom.
[02:18:27.480 --> 02:18:28.480]   No zooming.
[02:18:28.480 --> 02:18:29.480]   Zoom out.
[02:18:29.480 --> 02:18:32.200]   I'm just going to shut up.
[02:18:32.200 --> 02:18:35.320]   Great to see you, Luria.
[02:18:35.320 --> 02:18:36.320]   Thank you for joining us.
[02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:38.160]   I think, Callie, Callie Callie more than a couple of times.
[02:18:38.160 --> 02:18:39.160]   That's pretty good.
[02:18:39.160 --> 02:18:41.160]   I'm happy about that.
[02:18:41.160 --> 02:18:42.160]   You're getting better.
[02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:43.160]   I'm getting better.
[02:18:43.160 --> 02:18:45.080]   I mean, it's getting in my head.
[02:18:45.080 --> 02:18:47.720]   You and I, you know, I worked with you.
[02:18:47.720 --> 02:18:49.760]   I've known you as Callie for a decade.
[02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:51.640]   In 2006, I think it was.
[02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:52.640]   We worked together.
[02:18:52.640 --> 02:18:53.640]   So yeah.
[02:18:53.640 --> 02:18:58.440]   Luria hosted, co-hosted with me our Call for Help show in Canada for a couple of weeks,
[02:18:58.440 --> 02:18:59.440]   right?
[02:18:59.440 --> 02:19:00.440]   You came up for a while, a month.
[02:19:00.440 --> 02:19:03.200]   It was a yeah, we did three months there.
[02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:04.200]   Three months.
[02:19:04.200 --> 02:19:05.200]   Yeah.
[02:19:05.200 --> 02:19:08.000]   I'm excited to hear you don't remember all of them.
[02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:09.000]   No, they were good.
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:10.200]   No, you're great.
[02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:12.720]   You're the greatest.
[02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:14.480]   Thanks to everybody who's in our studio audience.
[02:19:14.480 --> 02:19:15.480]   Great studio audience.

[02:19:17.840 --> 02:19:20.520]   No.

[02:20:07.560 --> 02:20:09.480]   We didn't write them, so we don't use them to collect information on you.
[02:20:09.480 --> 02:20:12.720]   I don't even know who you are.
[02:20:12.720 --> 02:20:14.760]   I don't know you, but I love you.
[02:20:14.760 --> 02:20:16.760]   Hit the app, subscribe, be here every week.
[02:20:16.760 --> 02:20:17.760]   You don't want to miss a minute.
[02:20:17.760 --> 02:20:18.760]   Thank you for joining us.
[02:20:18.760 --> 02:20:19.760]   We'll see you next time.
[02:20:19.760 --> 02:20:21.760]   Another Twit is in the can.
[02:20:21.760 --> 02:20:21.760]   Bye-bye.
